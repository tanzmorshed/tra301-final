"Loving_Silence","9","229","303","18 January 2011"," Amazingly directed, Greatly Scripted, and Impeccably acted. What more can you ask for in a movie?
","I am a big of David Fincher's work, when I realized he was going to make a film about the creation of Facebook, I was really excited. I came in the movie with huge expectations, and hopeful that it would turn out great. I have to say, I was impressed, my expectations were not only met, but they were blown away. The Social Network easily rivals Fincher's previous works like ""Fight Club"" or ""Se7en"".<br/><br/>Aesthetically the film is very beautiful, its very ""Fincher"". It has a very perversely attractive appeal, a glimmering awfulness, as it was lit from within. David Fincher deserves an Oscar for Best Director, he is extremely underrated by the Academy. Hopefully this film will finally bring Fincher in a new light.<br/><br/>The actors did an amazing job, they should all be recognized for their work in this movie. Jesse Eisenberg did an amazing job playing Mark Zuckerberg. Hopefully he will not be known as the next Michael Cera anymore. With this film, he established himself as a serious actor and he will have a bright future ahead of him. Andrew Garfield also did an amazing job as the co-founder of Facebook and the best friend of Zuckerberg. He deserves an Oscar nom and I hope we'll be seeing more of him in the future. The rest of the cast did a fine job and also hoping seeing them in the future.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone, it deals with betrayal and greed. The movie definitely deserves an Academy award for Best Picture. It is extremely revalent for our times and many years to come. I consider this movie is a fine piece of modern filmmaking and probably will be considered as a classic in the future. So if you're not doing anything tonight, you should spent an evening in theaters to watch The Social Network."

","So there I was, sitting in the cinema waiting to see 'Inception' greeting every belated trailer with a groan, each one prolonging the time till I could finally see one of the most anticipated movies of the year and there it was, I turned to one of my friends ""my god..a film about facebook?!.."" To say I was skeptical for those few moments would be an understatement, I was almost angry, like a footballer who releases an autobiography 5 years after he starts his career I just didn't understand the timing of it, who cares anyway?<br/><br/>""I think this is Finchers new movie actually""<br/><br/>""DAVID Fincher? He's made a film about facebook?!""<br/><br/>Almost immediately 'Social Network' became a movie that I needed to see. David Fincher is one of the true masters of delivering some of the greatest films of the past few decades. The gritty 'Se7en' and the intelligent 'Fight Club' had been two of my favourite movies growing up, the latter of which I had the privilege of studying in college quite in depth and although I missed 'Benjamin Button' (only god knows why it took me until 2013 to watch!) I had thoroughly enjoyed the enigmatic 'Zodiac' as well.<br/><br/>'Social Network' became my favourite Fincher title almost immediately. It is one of those rare works that feels so effortless in its brilliance which is due to the incredible work from both Fincher and Sorkin in creating this modern masterpiece, the way I see it the film relies heavily upon three aspects which are executed with perfection.<br/><br/>First of all, the score for this film is sensational. I've always been a huge fan of Trent Reznor & Nine Inch Nails but with his partnership with Atticus Ross and his ongoing collaborations with Fincher (also see 'Girl With The Dragon Tattoo') I can only see them becoming the most formidable artists in the industry, every minor note resonates perfectly throughout the film and creates a beautiful texture on top of an already excellent piece of work.<br/><br/>Secondly, Sorkin's razor sharp screenplay is something a director can only dream of receiving, the dialogue never falters and it is always witty, sincere and hilarious all in one (which can also be attributed to the performances of the actors involved)<br/><br/>But most of all, the atmosphere that Fincher is able to create visually is stunning, huge credit must also go to long time collaborator Jeff Cronenweth, together their formidable partnership and undoubted perfect understanding of each other's work is clearly the factor behind this film being one of the best movies of the past decade<br/><br/>Great performances from Eisenberg, Garfield and Timberlake also help this movie stand head and shoulders above most and as one of the most promising young actresses in the business, Rooney Mara is given her first chance to truly show her quality in a small role.<br/><br/>It's difficult to say where 'Social Network' will stand when we look back on Finchers body of work but one things for sure, if it isn't seen as one of his truly great masterpieces then he is sure to become one of, if not the most powerful director in the industry for years to come."
"Monotreme02","10","416","683","28 September 2010"," A timeless story of friendship, loyalty, greed and betrayal
","I just want to get this out there right away and put the cards on the table so to speak: When I first heard about it, I had very little faith in this project. I was stupefied, confused by the thought of what attracted all this talent to this seemingly trivial story to begin with? Why would David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin possibly be interested in the story of the founding of Facebook? Surely they could have found something more important, more meaningful to apply their efforts to. After seeing the film, though, I realized that, of course, Fincher and Sorkin knew what they were doing all along. And furthermore that labeling this as ""The Facebook movie"" is really an insult to what Sorkin and Fincher were trying to and have succeeded in achieving with this film.<br/><br/>First and foremost, I have to take a step back and admire this film as a technical achievement. Despite seeming to be a departure for Fincher in terms of content and subject matter – which it is and then again isn't – the film is very clearly and undeniably a Fincher film. Re-teaming with his Fight Club director of photography Jeff Cronenweth, Fincher manages to create and capture that really unique look all of his films have. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous – once again, Fincher proves that he is probably getting the best results in digital photography out of any other director working in that medium, and this film, shot on the RED One camera, looks absolutely beautiful, from the framing to the camera movement to the lighting and on to the look and the feel of the depth of field the RED captures.<br/><br/>Sorkin's script is also an impeccable achievement and showcases, once again just what a genius this man really is. From a structural standpoint it employs a very effective use of a framing device – the Zuckerberg lawsuit depositions, which introduce the various characters and lead into ""flashbacks"" of the events being discussed. It really lends the film a Rashomon air and intensifies the mystery behind the Zuckerberg character and what exactly transpired in the creation of this phenomenon, Facebook. Sorkin also demonstrates an acute awareness of character construction, and manages to create a loathsome protagonist we hate and are frustrated by but yet we still end up sympathizing with. Most of all, though, it's a showcase of Sorkin's impeccable writing style and knack for writing dialogue with a very unique sound and rhythm. I saw Fincher refer to it as ""Sorkinese"" in an interview, and this is a really good description – it is certainly very unique to Sorkin and the scripts he has written, and it is also certainly a completely unique language – one which normal people in our real world do not speak, but that just sounds great on screen. The rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue remains one of the highlights of the film for me, and the script is certainly a shoo-in for Oscar consideration.<br/><br/>The film is also a rare showcase of pure acting prowess, and features a very interesting and eclectic cast of young actors stepping out of their comfort zones and delivering some truly phenomenal work. The casting of the film is quite a departure for Fincher, who has enough clout to gather the biggest names working in the business. Instead, he opted to go for a cast of relative unknowns or up-and-comers, and really make stars out of them. First and foremost to be mentioned is Jesse Eisenberg, an actor I have personally been a fan of since The Squid and the Whale in 2005 and one whose work I have continued to enjoy since then. However, no matter how good he was in those previous films, none of his previous performances compare to his amazing achievement on this film. Stripping away his signature goofiness and neurosis, Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a cold, calculated and determined genius who knows what he wants, is very confident and forward-looking and will stop at nothing to get it. His counter in the film is Saverin, played brilliantly by Andrew Garfield, a name we will be hearing a lot more of of in the next few years: Saverin is a far more sympathetic character, more warm and inviting – these traits only increase the impact of the tragedy of Zuckerberg's betrayal of their friendship.<br/><br/>Many pundits and commentators have designated this to be the ""film that defines our generation"", and truly a ""product of its time"" in the most literal sense of the word. However, I'm not sure I like this designation, especially since once you watch the film, you very quickly realize that this isn't a story about the founding of Facebook; it's really a story of friendship, ambition and betrayal, a character study of this fascinating individual whose actions in the film happen to depict the invention of an online social networking site that gets out of hand and puts all of his relationships, especially that with his best friend and business partner, in jeopardy. All of the themes mentioned above are universal and can be applied to a number of fantastic films and works of fiction over the centuries, and that, I think, is the greatest achievement of the film."
"rogerdarlington","Null","115","187","20 October 2010"," It really shouldn't work
","This is a film which simply shouldn't work, but it does - magnificently. A story centred on a teenager who becomes the world's youngest billionaire, a web site that reaches a million users in two years, and a cast of real life characters with names like Zuckerberg and Winklevoss just shouldn't be possible. A convoluted tale of raw conflict on the origins of a new type of web site should not lend itself to an expensive movie as opposed to a television documentary. It succeeds because it is not about the technology but about creativity and conflict and about friendship and betrayal. It succeeds because of a magical combination of accomplished direction, scintillating dialogue and superb acting.<br/><br/>The direction comes from David Fincher who has had variable success, all the way from ""Alien 3"" to Se7en"", but here he is right on form with a flashy, but tightly structured, presentation that never fails to command your attention and interest. The all-important, sparkling script is courtesy of Aaron Sorkin who gave us ""The West Wing"" - the best television series ever - and yet apparently does not do social networking.<br/><br/>At the heart of the movie is a brilliant, Oscar-worthy performance from Jesse Eisenberg as the 19 year old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the genius behind ""The Facebook"" (the social network), the unsympathetic anti-hero of the adventure, a borderline sociopath variously described by women characters as ""an asshole"" and someone ""just trying so hard to be"" one. Andrew Garfield is excellent as Zuckerberg's Harvard roommate and co-founder of the site Eduardo Savarin; thanks to the wonders of CGI, Arnie Hammer manages to be terrific as both the twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss; while singer Justin Timberlake is a revelation as the Napster founder Sean Parker. This is a testosterone-charged fable with room for women only in minor support roles - ironic in that getting girls was the impetus for the Facebook project.<br/><br/>The film opens in 2003 with a breathlessly wordy encounter and closes in 2009 with a poignantly wordless scene. In between, the story zips along at the frenetic pace characterised by the business itself. Adapted from Ben Mezrich's book ""The Accidental Millionaires"", the framework for the fascinating narrative is not one but two courtroom dramas or, to be more accurate, pre-trial hearings (both resulted in out-of-court settlements which tells you a lot). Clearly you shouldn't judge a book by its cover."

","Maybe I'm too old. No, not maybe, I am. I saw this characters as aliens of sorts. I know they represent today's landscape, brrrrr. The film as a film is one of the best of David Fincher but the universe it explores gave the chills. A world approaching its end, fast. The youth of the characters made it even more sinister. I couldn't detect their soul or any evidence of its existence. In a way they represent the worst of the previous generations. Roman Emperors or Wall Street. Profit is the name of the game and the ideas come out of boredom of longings to get laid. Love and friendship, loyalty and/or honor as obsolete as good manners. Jesse Eisenberg is chillingly perfect as the humanoid that started it all - or did he? - Justin Timberlake keeps surprising me. Good, very good and Andrew Garfield, the most recognizable of the characters is a victim of sorts and he'll be destroyed no matter how much money he gets. How I wish this was merely a science-fiction film."
"sug2763","Null","202","342","24 September 2010"," Excellent dialog. Superb directing job by Fincher.
","I went into this film with little or no hope. By the time the movie was over, with the Beatles' ""Baby, You're A Rich Man"" playing over the end credits, I had a huge smile on my face. I literally cannot wait to watch this again during it's wide release. <br/><br/>The lighting and camera work here is beautiful, every scene and sequence is a joy to watch. If Fincher hasn't already proved himself time and time again with his great films, this one might be the one to seal the deal for him. One sequence in the middle of the film features a boring rowboat race. Fincher sets up the photography so beautifully, that it feels like you're watching a painting come to life.<br/><br/>All the performances are excellent. Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg as a fast-paced, nerdy, kind of jerk-ish attitude, and Andrew Garfield is his best friend, Eduardo, who at the beginning didn't mean much to me, but I found myself rooting for him by the end. Justin Timberlake is easily the weakest one of the three, but he still does a decent job.<br/><br/>And oh, man the soundtrack. Trent Reznor deserves some kind of recognition for this. It is amazing. A lot of people say the movie sounds boring. They cite ""The invention of facebook"" as an uninteresting topic. I say don't believe that talk, and check out this interesting, funny, thrill ride by Fincher and co."
"KennethWasHere","Null","133","229","11 October 2010"," Just as Fincher gave us the definitive Generation X film with ""Fight Club"", he and Aaron Sorkin give us a definitive Generation Y film...
","...and that's ""The Social Network"".<br/><br/>It joins the ranks of his best, and just like many of his his previous works, has been reviled before it was properly understood.<br/><br/>For months before it came out, it was the laughing stock of people who were off-put by the idea of a ""movie about Facebook"" (even though it's easy to look and see that it's about the founding of Facebook and the people behind it), just like ""Fight Club"" is dismissed as a violent film about people fighting, or that ""Se7en"" is just a serial killer movie.<br/><br/>Not to get sidetracked, though.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is filmmaking and storytelling of a high order, that shows the grand irony of a socially inept Harvard student named Mark Zuckerberg who ended up creating one of the largest social phenomena of the twenty-first century (and love Facebook or hate it, it most certainly is that). The story works as an engaging, fascinating character study; at the beginning of the story, Mark is a socially maladjusted reject, and even after several million 'friends' and a few billion dollars later, he remains pretty much the same.<br/><br/>The outstanding acting, style and direction, as well as the great script armed to the teeth with sharp dialogue is what people are likely to miss by dismissing it as a mere 'Facebook movie'.<br/><br/>Even if it were just a ""movie about Facebook"", why is such subject matter off-limits? Things that have become a large part of our culture shouldn't be reflected in our art? Or, is it because of that? That technology is such a scary thing and needs to be dismissed? The indisputable fact is that everything that's going on with social networking and the world of the Internet is incorporated into the ideas of a certain corner of history, this one, which will be remembered as such, and ""The Social Network"" may very well be remembered as a film to define that era.<br/><br/>So please, this is one of the films to see this year. Don't get hung up on the idea that it's just a silly ""Facebook movie"", or else you'll be missing out on an excellent picture."
"kindigth","Null","121","211","1 October 2010"," The Social Network
","Let's start with the script. It's great. Written by soon-to-be-best- adapted-screenplay-nominee/winner Aaron Sorkin, The Social Network's writing is intelligent and demanding on multiple levels: most obviously, the story is cleverly structured across dual lawsuits, but there's an equal amount of sophistication to Sorkin's character work--Zuckerberg is never quite capable of maintaining a dialog, Eduardo always stops just short of explicating his emotions. <br/><br/>Those two characters are wonderfully played by inevitable acting award nominees Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield--Eisenberg owns the brisk pace of the film while Garfield brings most of the humanity--who anchor a terrific ensemble--SAG best ensemble, perhaps? The film's score is a perfectly atmospheric concoction of electronica from edgy dark horse best original score nominees Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and it's all united under the name and vision of David Fincher, who did not win an Oscar for Fight Club or Zodiac or Benjamin Button.<br/><br/>All of this is to say two things: this is a really great movie from a phenomenal creative team, and also there are times when the film feels somewhat calculated for accolades--never in the repugnantly safe, crowd- pleasing, middle-brow Benjamin Button sense, but in the sweetly transparent sense of a kid who did all his chores and is suggesting that he might deserve a cookie. <br/><br/>You know what? Give David Fincher a cookie. The Social Network is thoroughly intelligent and engaging as a modern biopic and as an examination of evolving cultural currency, and it's also one of my favorite films this year. -TK 10/1/10"
"Stevendcravens","10","208","378","20 September 2010"," Fincher's best since Fight Club
","I have been a fan of David Fincher ever since I saw Se7en when I was 13. I saw all of his films the following week and not one of them disappointed me. That was back in 2003. I loved Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button as well, but he really knocked it out of the park with this one. I was fortunate enough to see The Social Network at a screening on 9/16/10 for my college. Eisenberg, Hammer and Sorkin were there and did a Q and A after the film. It was a GREAT experience. All of them seemed excited about the film and rightfully so. The film brilliantly tells the story of college students who go through hell with each other over the credit for Facebook and the damage that comes to all of them because of it. The acting and dialogue were flawless. Eisenberg, Garfield and even Timberlake churn out performances that should get them serious attention come award time. Fincher's direction is also perfect. you can always tell a Fincher film when you see it because his visual style is so striking and The Social Network is no exception. When this is released, please go see it and watch a film that defines a generation and what the world has become."

","David Fincher is competent, clean. The writer here does simple, clean, dialog-laden plots for TeeVee.<br/><br/>They decided to go for an economical story, something that we can walk into with all sorts of questions about the world and how it is changing and come out believing we understand it.<br/><br/>The facts are intimidating. Soon, Facebook will have a billion users. It is already the most visited site in history. As an entity, it already is on par with the the top tier tech companies: Apple and Google. But far beyond that, far, far more significant is the way that the world is changing. Until now, friendship was absolutely anchored in physical proximity. All media allowed that to be extended, but only if it were well established by actually being together.<br/><br/>Now, this notion is being replaced by an entire generation. The compact is no longer on mutual support and emotional needs, but simply being paid attention to. Life is flattened while the numbers get larger. Shared abstract thinking is reduced to whether something is ""liked"" or not. Political movements exploit this and we are getting into trouble faster than we can imagine. So we enter a theater with a film about this phenomenon with dire worries. Social networking is the successor to TeeVee as the next possible disaster in the social experiment.<br/><br/>The filmmaker and writer decided to make a movie about this simplification of the social fabric by taking a story that is necessarily rich and human, and reduce it to a cartoon. We liked it not because the thing is well crafted, though it is. We embrace it because it explains things. In fact, it simplifies things so much that we can feel superior in knowing that we would have made a (slightly) more rich version.<br/><br/>The story presented here is no secret: emotionally weak geek type, Jew, Harvard undergrad has trouble making friends. Each of these three stereotypes is exploited shamelessly in the service of an unambiguous narrative. This guy will do anything to make friends and elevate his social standing. But the only thing he can do is program, so he finds what he needs in a website he creates. There is a clear calculus of sacrificing real friends for virtual standing. It is not something he can do because he understands people; it is something he has to do because he doesn't.<br/><br/>Turns out is what others need is similar so the thing takes off. Advisors, investors and lawyers surround the thing. Simple. Our hero ends up alone. The story marginalizes women as a necessity, deliberately allowing us to see them as Zuck does. More stereotypes.<br/><br/>But what has been done here is a type of narrative fold. The subject is the flattening of the human relationship to the trivial. The movie itself is the similar flattening of the story to the trivial. It is what it shows and implicitly criticizes. We walk out ""understanding,"" in that way we do after a political rally before we actually start thinking and seeing real people.<br/><br/>In the real world, what is interesting is not what happened with a girlfriend or some jock twins. What matters is the way that connection is changing, the way we form associations and indeed what an association means and what value it gives. This is not a fad. Facebook and Twitter may fade but something profound has started, perhaps changing the very nature of what it means to invest in societies. We likely are not yet past a tipping point in government and family units, but it is likely that we are well past the tipping point in narratives. We may never get richness back as a basic value. It will be relegated to a few who form a social network.<br/><br/>It is also interesting that Zukerberg, Dorsey, Canter, Mullenweg and Winer truly believe that what they are about amplifies life in all its dimensions. They believe they are doing good work. If this film is anything, it is evidence that the contrary is true.<br/><br/>And Zuck isn't cool enough to be an Emacs user any more, though he seems to have a genius in the opposite direction: finding the lowest common, scalable need.<br/><br/>(Written from the Starbucks two blocks from the original Facebook office.)<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

"Michael-70","5","192","363","2 October 2010"," Like The Lead Character, The Social Network Misses The Important Ideas
","There is something wrong with this film like it was put though a filter of some type to remove any real humanity, unless that is the point. I'm not a psychiatrist but Mark Zuckerberg as portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg in the film seems to suffer from some kind of emotional agnosia. . .and so does the film.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to this film and I had fun watching it, but as I thought about it afterwards, all I could remember were the squandered opportunities the film had to actually tell a moving story about friendship and loyalty that got wrecked by a cool business venture that became much too successful way too quickly. <br/><br/>Both Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher have both said The Social Network is not really about the ""Facebook saga"" with Sorkin even being so bold as to claim the basic story goes all the way back to the Greek dramatists. He has a point, so what do you think, would Aristophanes have been a MAC man or a PC user? <br/><br/>Truly, you won't find a better emotional core to build a drama around than the relationship between best friends Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). That bromance is the heart of The Social Network and the film kept getting close to this emotional territory but then it would crash like an overloaded network and flit to other characters not important to the main story.<br/><br/>For example, the machinations of the Winklevoss twins are comic relief elevated to main story arc status. The self-righteous anger they feel and the lengths they go to seek revenge play like Margaret Dumont fighting with Groucho Marx.<br/><br/>It's very satisfying to see these overly entitled, great white hopes become dismayingly angry that things didn't go exactly the way they wanted them to for probably the first time in their lives. The Social Network develops a sharp edge to it in these scenes from their characters genuine feelings of an entitlement snatched away from them by a clearly undeserving cretin and the actors play it for all the high comedy they can. <br/><br/>But the main bromance is tested when the sexy, charming, persuasive entrepreneur Sean Parker (played to paranoid perfection by Justin Timberlake) comes in well over an hour into the film and starts finding ways to turn Facebook into a mega-money making operation all the while charming the pants off Mark Zuckerberg; much to Eduardo's sad eyed jealousy. <br/><br/>At this moment, The Social Network could become an ancient Greek drama in more ways than one. <br/><br/>But it doesn't. Instead, we just get more back and forth cutting between depositions and lawyer meetings, which are interesting and could have provided clues into the characters, but don't. These scenes were the biggest missed opportunities in the film. <br/><br/>Another squandered moment, why can't we see the scene where Zuckerberg goes into an investment banker's office in his bathrobe and slippers to deliver a Sean Parker bird-flip? Will Zuckerberg realize that making good on revenge for others is totally unsatisfying? And why was the tough talking Parker too big a wuss not to do it himself? <br/><br/>If the scene isn't going to advance the plot or inform about the characters, why have it?<br/><br/>Witnessing Parkers pathetic attempt at a put down of Andrew Garfield by offering him a check for $19,000 and then totally being made a fool of showed exactly what kind of man Saverin was and what kind of useless blow-hard Parker was. <br/><br/>As a secondary theme, the idea that money can ruin almost anything good like friendship, loyalty or love, even here, The Social Network does not convince. It seems that it was the fact that Facebook made tons of money that this story even has an ending that did not end in suicide or death. If Sorkin or Fincher sees anything ironic or even noteworthy in this, they sure don't indicate it in the film. <br/><br/>Remember, people would even have excused a horrible sociopathic bully like Alex DeLage in A Clockwork Orange if he had only made a billion dollars for someone. <br/><br/>As it is right now, The Social Network feels way too long and there is no emotional payoff. I didn't feel a sense of relief or fun or even sadness when the end credit titles listed what happened to the various characters. <br/><br/>The Social Network had glibness and a flow that only indicated a surface look at the deeper themes, but nothing else. <br/><br/>Fincher generally likes to make fast moving films because he seems to fear depth. He probably disagrees with the saying that ""still waters run deep"" and thinks that still waters are the ones that turn stagnant. <br/><br/>Well David, that's true, but stagnant water can still be deep water, and shallow water is never anything else."
"tsquared226","10","228","435","16 September 2010"," Can the ""Facebook movie"" be one of the best of the year? Yep, it sure can...
","""The Social Network"" was an incredibly engaging film that, while mainly revolving around the invention of Facebook (and all the problems that the creators encountered both before and after all was said and done), really focused in on ideas and feelings that can be (and are) universally felt through all people, the primary example being trying to fit in. Everyone wants to be accepted (I for one have never met a single human being that has wanted to be a loner), and some will do whatever it takes to get that sort of attention (which tends to lead into bad consequences). In a year where movies have received some of the lowest critical ratings (as well as box office earnings) in recent memory, ""The Social Network"" was, while haunting, truly refreshing and ultimately a triumph in all aspects, whether it be considering the acting, script, or directing. It was a fantastic movie that shouldn't just be among the best of the year; it's so much more important than that. It defines the entire social networking generation, and that is one hell of an accomplishment. Everyone can relate to it one way or another, and that makes it one of the must-see pictures of the year."
"tas22","3","112","207","14 November 2010"," Incredibly over-hyped
","The Social Network is contrived, artificial and overlong, but it didn't have to be. There were the makings of a really absorbing movie, using the very timeless themes of betrayal and greed; however, those opportunities were repeatedly squandered. The dialogue was characteristic of Sorkin, with the actors continually speaking over each other, spouting bon mots that rang hollow because they had no time to register. When a simple statement with a few words would suffice and be much more powerful, Sorkin stuffed in multiple sentences that rendered the scene lifeless. Sometimes silence is the most powerful indicator of feeling. <br/><br/>The most glaring problem is the absolute implausibility of one of the central motifs of the story, which is Zuckerberg's obsession with final clubs. The references are hilariously outdated and irrelevant, coming from right out of the 60s. Does anyone really believe that Zuckerberg would screw his co-founder out of his share of the company because of resentment over the fact that Eduardo was chosen for one of the clubs? Whatever happened to plain and simple greed? Surely there was a more interesting and more credible way to explain why the partnership went sour. The filmmakers should have found it. <br/><br/>It has been well publicized that the film is largely fictional; most of the machinations described in the film never happened or didn't happen as portrayed. Both the director and screenwriter have admitted that they don't know much about Facebook or see the point of it. Sorkin himself also said that he was willing to sacrifice the truth for a good story. That isn't necessarily a problem; if the storytelling is solid, the stretching of facts can be overlooked. In this case, the plot is overwrought and not believable, making the glaring plot holes and lack of veracity prominent. <br/><br/>A few more quibbles: the soundtrack was incredibly intrusive, the portrayal of all the women in the film was shameful and sexist, and the vision of life at Harvard was inauthentic. I thought the main actors did a fair job with the material they were given, especially Jesse Eisenberg, who managed to give Zuckerberg more than one dimension. But the movie could have been so much more, which makes the final result really depressing."

","Wow, seriously, last year I thought I was robbed because I didn't get to see The Social Network in the theater. The way some users were describing this film as ""the defining movie of our generation"" I thought I was missing the next ""Godfather"". I was trying to wait to buy the film on pre-view over at Blockbuster because again with the hype I assumed I would probably love the film, but I caught it on a movie channel this morning and have to say while it's definitely a good movie, I really hope this isn't the defining movie of my generation. The Social Network is loosely based on the rise of Facebook, the world's most popular website and IMO the fall of society. I'm sure it had good intentions in the first place as it was awesome to keep in touch with my college friends back in 2004, but it's gone down hill since then. But to the movie's credit, we are blessed with some pretty good actors, fast editing and a really interesting story. I think that's what really saved this movie from being just another addition to this hot trend.<br/><br/>In 2003, Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend. He returns to his dorm drunk and writes a scathing blog entry about her. This inspires him to create an on-campus website called Facemash which allows users to rate the attractiveness of female students using photographs pilfered from various university systems. FaceMash's popularity and the fact that Mark created it in one night while drunk brings him to the attention of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra. Mark approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin and tells him of his idea for what he calls ""The facebook"", an online social networking website exclusive to Harvard University students. Eduardo agrees to help Mark, providing $1,000 to help start the site. Starting the rise and rise of the popular social network site Facebook.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg as Mark I thought was what really stepped the film back from being a perfect film, he's a good actor, but doesn't have the charisma to make Mark likable and talked way too fast for average movie goers to understand half of what's going on. That does damage in reviews, because if people understood it, they automatically mark that as they are intelligent, not to go onto that rant, but just a pet peeve of mine. I read The Accidental Billionaires and Mark seems like a very nice guy who wanted to create something very good and seems like a pleasure to meet in real life. Jesse plays him off too much as a shy nerdy jerk who's just too greedy at times. Justin Timberlake playing Sean Parker, he's good enough, he seems to really enjoy playing what I would assume Sean to be like since he almost took down the music industry in the 90's. Justin plays him cool and really proved to that he can both talents in the music and acting industry.<br/><br/>Is The Social Network the best film of 2010? Depends on your taste, my favorite contender is still The Black Swan. However, this film does deserve it's praise mainly for David Finch and his vision. His fast pace with the film was what kept it going and his passion for the story was what really grabbed me. Though I know not to take this for a biography, I don't see why they couldn't stay a little more true to the story, though from what I understand, Mark is a very private manironic. I would recommend The Social Network, it will be apart of film history to describe our era in computers, however, I don't think it's our generation's defining film as many have described. Just don't believe the hype, I found it good just to watch it once.<br/><br/>7/10"
"n_peart_2112","5","29","49","9 June 2012"," Am I the only one who was angered by this movie?
","The movie was good for what it represented, and in terms of direction, it is a beautiful piece of work as always from David fincher. I can not be clearer, it is a well done movie, and the cast is stupendous. But i couldn't help but hate everything about our central character of mark zuckerburg and everything that he stands for. What makes it worse is that this is based on true events. So lets recap for a moment...<br/><br/>A narcissistic, and morally bankrupt mark zuckerburg decides he doesn't stand out enough in life even though he has been admitted into one of the most well known and prestigious academic institutions in the entire western hemisphere. So he decides after a little quibble with his girlfriend, he acts like a complete child and puts the rumour mill into full swing in order to avenge is insulted honour by posting humiliating things about his ex girlfriend on the internet. Afterwards, he decides to set up a minor internet site that rates the attractiveness of female Harvard students. (I'm sure i don't have to mention the shallowness of these actions, but I feel I must all the same). Then, two twin Harvard athletes decide to ask him to design essentially a myspace for Harvard students, and piece by piece from the input of many other people from the school, zuckerburg pieces it all together with the help of his colleague Saverin. As they watch their idea flourish and grow, the twins decide to take on zuckerburg in a legal battle, and also try to insight a breach of Harvard's code of conduct (neither of which are upheld for reasons i can't abide). Further on, with the help of the dipsh!t who has taught the world how to single handedly destroy the music industry, zuckerburg then turns around to cut his friend and first investor, Saverin, out of his share from 34% to .03%. And now after countless legal battles, Zuckerburg has become the youngest billionaire in history.<br/><br/>So what have we learned...<br/><br/>we have learned that society rewards people who are so deluded on their own over inflated self worth (like facebooks opening stock price), that they steal, lie, cheat, and worst of all, betray friends and loved ones for the almighty dollar. Why didn't anyone take care of him when they still could!!! If I was president of Harvard, he would have been out on his a$$ the minute he violated the code of conduct and never been permitted to even mop the floors of Harvard university. If no one upholds the code, why have it? I sincerely hope this class action lawsuit against Zuckerburg falls through, and he loses everything and spends a few miserable years in prison for his alleged insider trading. If he has openly admitted the accuracy of this movie and that he indeed did backstab and cheat his way to the top, I have no reason not to believe he wouldn't commit insider trading."

","""You're not an asshole, Mark. You're just trying so hard to be one."" This statement, uttered by a lawyer, played by Rashida Jones, describes David Fincher's The Social Network quite well. It is not a great film, but it is trying very hard to be one. That being said, it is certainly a good one. When it was announced, people reacted to the idea of a film about Facebook similarly to a Transformers film being made. For the most part , all the write-ups about the film were filled with cynicism and negativity. To people's surprise Aaron Sorkin would write and David Fincher would direct. Following its premiere, mountains of praise were heaped on the film, which for the most part was deserved.<br/><br/>To me, this film is hard to review. On the surface, there is much to praise. Fantastic performances, great cinematography and direction, with some great writing, yet, I come out of feeling nothing. There was an emotional disconnect between the film and me - something was lacking. The film is exceptionally well made, it has great style, and Fincher deserves a lot of credit for what he has done. However, the problem I had was I didn't care about the characters. Mark Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, is not meant to be a hero, in fact he is portrayed as a prick. Someone constantly condescending due to his insecurity and superior intellect. We are not given any characters that we can attach ourselves to, which isn't always a problem but the story was told in such a way that it didn't suck me in either. <br/><br/>The performances are great across the board, and most surprisingly, the stand out for me is Justin Timberlake, who disappears into his role. He plays Napster creator Shawn Fanning as a slightly delusional, paranoid entrepreneur. <br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin, like David Mamet or Quentin Tarantino, has a very stylized way of writing dialogue. It either works for you, or doesn't. Fortunately, it did work and some very enjoyable exchanges are present in this film. The problem isn't with the dialogue, but with the way the story is told, constantly cutting forward in time to his meetings with his lawyers and the people suing him. This gives the film an almost procedural feel, and leaves me cold.<br/><br/>Fincher has made some very good films, but never has he made a truly great one. They never emotionally connect, and I blame this on his style. The film is beautifully shot, but it is the way it is shot that I had the most problem with. It is too clean, too composed. It is style versus emotion, and style wins out. It is quite obvious he started his career as a commercial and music video director in this film. This is certainly not always a bad thing, but on this film, which needs us to connect with at least one of the characters, the lack of emotion keeps me from really loving this film.<br/><br/>I will say that the final scene almost made up for it, it is humorous yet strangely disturbing. Unfortunately, the ending came out of nowhere. There was no build up, it appears as if several scenes were cut leading up to the ending. It, instead, uses text during the final shot to clear up all of the loose ends, which there are many. The film doesn't care about its characters, and this proves it. <br/><br/>It may come off strange that I will still recommend the film, but I do. It is very good, and interesting. Certainly better than most of the films released in the last couple of months. That being said, it has flaws, significant ones, and for that it fails as a great film, but succeeds as a good one.<br/><br/>For more reviews and articles about film check out my blog: The Deleted Scene http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com"
"GodofGSXR1977","1","29","50","6 September 2013"," The movie this generation deserves
","In a Frank Zappa interview, he once discussed the changing music industry & how it slowly went downhill due to executives not taking any real risks while thinking they ""knew"" what was cool or what the kids wanted in order to meet their bottom line. He goes on to basically say that the current (at that time) decline in music quality/originality is what our society deserves; Since the masses obviously keep buying into the MTV culture where ""good"" art is more about looks, money, & style than actual content.<br/><br/>I think Zappa's idea applies to this film and our declining society as a whole (in terms of film, music, and the entertainment industry in general). We deserve this type of tripe, shallow, & superficial ""pop culture"" fad praising art that we throw gobs of money at each year. This film is a cookie-cutter ""what's cool now"" made-for-TV special with apparently a wild squirrel randomly jumping on piano keys for the soundtrack. <br/><br/>There are some solid performances here but overall it is too panderous to the contemporaries who will remember the rising popularity of Myspace 2. What is worse is that they didn't even make a Steve Jobs film until after he passed & Jobs (and company) did a lot more to change the way we interact in all aspects of life. Why did Facebook/Zuckerberg need a 2 hour film about him even as the site's popularity was rising? I guess because it's ""hip"" & so ""IN"" right now.<br/><br/>They may as well start making films about eBay's rise to power & the evolution of YouTube starring Justin Bieber as Chad Hurley. <br/><br/>Our watered down, over hyping society is sadly continuing into a dangerous trend of accepting essentially superficial and empty products that all look the same but with a slightly different package. Everyone wants to be a star or know something about stars; Both desires, just like this film, do not result in anything worthwhile. <br/><br/>I give it 10-15 years max before Facebook becomes as relevant as Pet Rocks & Gangnam Style. If critics and audiences keep buying into this garbage, it is certainly what they deserve more of."
"mmckaibab","2","33","58","12 January 2011"," Why should I care? This film doesn't tell me.
","As one of those who completely fails to appreciate the inherent narcissism that underlies Facebook (as well as its clunky, confusing interface), I was disappointed that Aaron Sorkin completely failed to make me understand why I should have any interest at all in the story he tells. What I saw was a story about a social incompetent who screwed over several people and somehow blundered into something that made him very, very wealthy but, in the end, had no effect whatsoever on who he was as a person.<br/><br/>Classic drama is all about how the central character faces a personal crisis, learns important lessons, and comes away changed in some fundamental way. In this film that just doesn't happen. It's just a story about an unpleasant person who created this ""thing"" that appeals to people's least interesting characteristics, made a WHOLE lot of money, but came away from it pretty much the same person he was when he went into. Boring. Just like most of what I see on Facebook.<br/><br/>What was really disappointing was that, given Sorkin's powerful work on ""The West Wing,"" I was expecting some profound reflections on what effects this shallow person has had on society. That might have been an interesting film--too bad it didn't get made. Instead, we get a navel- gazing look at someone who made it possible for millions of people to make their navel-gazing public.<br/><br/>Just like Facebook, this was mostly just a major time-suck and I left wishing I'd done something more important with the last two hours of my life."
"Red_Identity","Null","76","146","9 October 2010"," Revolutionary for our time
","When I first heard that David Fincher was making a film about the networking site Facebook, I was definitely very skeptical. Well, there was no need to be. Fincher took Aaron Sorkin's brilliantly clever screenplay and turned it into a film that highlights the best and worst moments of out technology-based life.<br/><br/>The Social Network's first scene is brilliantly written and acted, and it sets the mood that both Fincher and Sorkin want to set for the rest of the film. The film is seen as the advancement of how Mark Zuckerberg got his world-famous website started. Now, I know that a lot of the film was exaggerated or fictional, but it does not matter. Sorkin and Fincher have brought us this really interesting character, who is brilliantly played by Jesse Eisenberg. Eisenberg is one of the best young actors in this time, and while he has mostly done comedy until now, his role demands much more attention to subtlety and character nuances to move along. Last year Eisenberg showed us that he could create some of the most likable characters in films like Zombieland and Adventureland, and this year he proves to us that he can actually create a very flawed and condescending, but still sympathetic character that we may or may not end up hating. This was credit to his real talent. Andrew Garfield was also pretty much equal in terms of performance, and he was a true star next to Eisenberg's character. The rest of the cast are all fine, including Justin Timberlake that has proved over the years that he can actually act pretty impressively. <br/><br/>On another note, the film might seem very different than Fincher's other films, which include pretty much all crime/thrillers and a fantasy (Benjamin Button), but I thought that he was able to leave his mark on the film. It certainly took itself seriously, which for a film like this is fortunate. The cinematography was also very impressive, but not showy, and very keen on the real focus of the film. <br/><br/>Ultimately, The Social Network is a very hard film to dislike. However, I also know that it is not the type of easy-going, fun but forgettable film that many (including me) expected months ago. It is more profound, more meaningful, but it might not hit a nerve with all viewers, including the young that will only want to see the 'Facebook Movie!'. I think The Social Network has a lot of similarity to last year's Up In The Air. Both represent a dilemma about people's communications in the modern world, and both can be seen as perfect examples of what life in the 21st' century was like. The Social Network is about the many connections that we have with others, and it makes you feel the longing and loneliness that might come with it. It is David Fincher's best to date."
"janet-f","2","94","184","3 October 2010"," An unpleasant time had by all
","It's a story of really despicable people making a lot of money. If you are interested in making a lot of money, too, you won't find out how they did it by watching this movie -- all you will know is that Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in the US.<br/><br/>The flashback technique is used very ineffectively. The scenes of depositions (or whatever it is that is going on at those tables -- why aren't we told?) are unnecessary for introducing the next segments. It seems to me that the movie makers, while telling us about two lawsuits, are actually only protecting themselves from a lawsuit. They are trying to persuade us that the events in the movie, true or false, were presented in sworn testimony. Who cares? The story could have been better told straight forward. <br/><br/>Also, if the flashforwards had been omitted, there would have been some time left to let us see what happened that turned the company into a money-maker.<br/><br/>The actors did a great job of portraying unpleasant human beings who destroyed everyone who tried to get close to them, but that's not reason enough to see the movie."

","On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history...but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications. (Sony Pictures)<br/><br/>THE SOCIAL NETWORK is not about Facebook. It's about Mark Zuckerberg and the people associated with him and the consequences that arise with the evolution of Facebook. In an even broader sense, it's about friends being driven apart due to money and betrayal. Because of this, it's no surprise that many have already compared this to CITIZEN KANE. And it's not just the similarities in themes that are astounding, it's the quality as well.<br/><br/>What makes THE SOCIAL NETWORK so good is the masterfully written script by Aaron Sorkin. The film is filled with impeccable dialog that just sucks you in. It would be no surprise if the film won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Director David Fincher also does a great job keeping the audience captivated through and through with a consistently fast pace. Really, you'll probably be drawn to the film's opening argument between two characters than any other scene this year. All right, I'm exaggerating, but you get the point. It's not Fincher's best work, but it's in the top 3.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg and co-star Andrew Garfield are the driving force behind this film. Eisenberg does a terrific job delivering the lines as he did while Garfield brings in an emotional aspect to the film. Although both are quite excellent, Garfield's performance is Oscar worthy. Rooney Mara is quickly getting up the ladder after having last seen her in the remake of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET in the beginning of the year. She's just in a few scenes, but she's great in them. I would have like to see her more in the film, though. Apparently, Armie Hammer played two characters as twins in the film, which really blew me away when I found out because I thought they were two different actors. He really distinguished the characters really well. Oh, and if you're worried about Justin Timberlake, don't be. He's really good in here. I also loved Rashida Jones in the few scenes she was in.<br/><br/>With terrific performances from the cast all around, a brilliant script, some fine directing by Fincher, and an engaging score by Trent Reznor, it should be no surprise that THE SOCIAL NETWORK succeeded the way it did. Although it's a 2-hour dialog driven film, it absolutely engrossing to watch. If anything, this is probably the closest modern version of CITIZEN KANE that we will ever get in a long time. THE SOCIAL NETWORK is easily one of the best films of the year."

Who wants to follow around a miserable human being like this guy playing Zuckerburg? I don't. I wanted to suffocate myself with my pillow. The first hour seemed to last an eternity. The only saving grace was seeing Rashida Jones, although I must give credit to the actors playing the twins. Those guys were great and I'd like to see them in other films. Timberlake was pretty awful in this film-trying to be some playboy-founder of Napster-type of...what? His character was not what I expected to say the least. I hated the film so much that I did not watch it all the way to the end. It was that horrible. Nothing redeeming or riveting about it. It's actually quite disgusting to see that it all started (allegedly) with him wanting to rate the girls he went to college with as hot or not (or whatever the scale/rating system was).

","The trailers are the best I've seen, the reviews eerily better, making me wonder what cost more, the advertising or paying off critics, because bottom line is if Facebook were not popular, you would not care at all about this film. AT ALL. People raving about this film are simply fooled by the trite joy that ""Hey, I use Facebook and here are the guys who made it"", when the film itself is dismal. I was hoping for another Zodiak, and refuse to believe David Fincher had anything to do with this bland wreck. It's a film made by rich people about rich people for rich people.<br/><br/>All characters are one-dimensional with no arc Critics rave of witty dialogue, but only three moments offer any (you can see them online and save your money). Any potential emotional conflict is COMPLETELY left out, most notably sharing in any inward struggle the main character must have had to betray his only friend for no reason. We are given blow-jobs and cocaine over character growth and anyone we can relate to.<br/><br/>This film demonstrates two trends in Hollywood that in my opinion are destroying cinema, first and most importantly is that if a film is ""based on a true story"" it need not tell a story well. There are recreation scenes on ""America's Most Wanted"" with more character growth than this film. A documentary would be more entertaining because we would not be expecting to sympathize and vicariously bond with any characters.<br/><br/>The second destructive trend in Hollywood is pouring advertising money into bad films. It seems the better the film, the less advertising money is put in because they know people will love the film for the film. Here we are told from every ad and critic on the planet to love this film before entering the theater and the entire time watching it I sit there are say ""when is the part I'm supposed to love, or even care about."" I recognize a few smart lines from the trailer and the audience seemed to smirk at those, but even the woman who pretended to be shocked by ""22,000 hits over 2,200"" had a sense of boredom and confusion in her gasp that reeked of doubt as to ""why should I care?""

With an intriguing concept, it is for me one of the defining films I have seen recently, one of the best movies of 2010 and relevant in its themes of greed, betrayal, class tension, friendship and loyalty and concept.<br/><br/>Production-values-wise, The Social Network looks wonderful. The cinematography is incredibly skillful, and the editing is crisp. In fact, I'd sure The Social Network is director David Fincher's most stylish film since Se7en. I have heard a lot of mixed feelings on the score, while it is not my favourite of the year not like Toy Story 3, King's Speech and Inception, The Social Network's brooding, smooth and quite sexy score is very memorable and fits well with the film's occasionally quirky tone.<br/><br/>The Social Network is very well directed too. Fincher directs with an intensity and focus that makes The Social Network tied with Se7en as the best of his movies in my opinion. Another strong point is the screenplay which is very smart and sharp, while the story making the most of this intriguing concept is constantly snappy and engaging.<br/><br/>Also, all the characters are very well written and assembled, for me they are among the best-written characters in a Fincher movie. It also helps that the acting is as impeccable as it is. Jesse Eisenberg is very commanding as the titular character in a subtle sort of way, while Andrew Garfield also impresses as the ""voice of reason"" character. I was surprised in a good way by Justin Timberlake, while the weakest of the three leads, he does have a cocksure swagger here that he actually pulls off really well.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a wonderful film and one of the best of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Along the way, they create a company that exists solely to collect as much personal data as it can get its grubby hands on---and then turn around and sell that data off to the highest corporate bidder.<br/><br/>For this, Facebook gets praised as a era-defining phenomenon that is supposedly out to invent a wonderful new online world by creating this vast social network.<br/><br/>To which I say: hogwash. The World Wide Web itself is actually the real great social network. In the end, Facebook really adds nothing to the online experience. Some might argue that a Facebook page is easier to set up than a Web site. But this is false. Anyone can easily set up a Web site for free, with only a few clicks these days---and in doing so, you have freedom from the grubby clutches of Facebook.<br/><br/>The problem with Facebook is that it goes against the open nature of the Web that made the latter so successful. Facebook basically wants to control everything. And not for lofty idealistic reasons, but simply to rake in billions.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is idealizing and over-hyping a company that is basically extremely overrated. Even revenue-wise, I'd say Facebook is overrated---I'm not at all convinced that its multi-billion dollar valuations are going to stand the test of time, any more than companies that had ridiculous valuations during the 2001 Dot Com meltdown. And even as a work of fiction, ""The Social Network"" utterly fails.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, but I simply can't get into a film that has no appealing characters. Nobody in this film has a heart. Nobody seems to care about anyone else but themselves. I couldn't really relate to anyone in the movie. They're all a bunch of privileged, elitist kids who believe they are geniuses who tower over the rest of us. In reality, the only way they're ""superior"" to the rest of us is that they have bigger trust funds (or trust funds at all, for that matter).<br/><br/>Maybe some people enjoy two hours of egotistical jerks, scheming about how they're going to control our online lives (and sell our personal data off to the highest bidder). But the characters left me ice cold, as did the story.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I know a thing or two about creating successful Web properties myself. I'm a Dot Com entrepreneur who has built a number of highly popular Web sites. And for me, ""The Social Network"" simply didn't ring true in depicting the grueling, hard work that it takes to build a popular Web site.<br/><br/>For one thing, no one in this film ever seems to break a sweat. Success for the characters seems to come effortlessly. The film does a poor job of depicting the brutal, marathon, 20-hour days that one must put in to build a popular Web site. When I built my sites, I didn't spend loads of time (as the characters in this movie do) at fancy bars and nightclubs, sipping $20 martinis. The reality is a lot less glamorous.<br/><br/>In truth, you simply spend endless hours hunched over a computer monitor, doing tedious, often repetitive work, trying to find the spark that will make your site a success. (Oh, and unlike the privileged, pampered site creators in this movie, most popular Web site builders, including myself, also worked at full-time day jobs as we built our Web sites). Life wasn't an endless series of parties, as it appears to be for the characters in this film.<br/><br/>For me, ""The Social Network"" simply didn't ring true. It's an overrated film about an overrated company."

","This film has been the subject of breathless reviews. The media response has been hot and heavy too. Is this an event movie? Is this going to change the way anyone looks at anything, or is it a Vanity Fair article that got made into a feature film? I don't think this movie really lives up to its publicity. For one thing, the cinematography is almost incompetent. Many scenes are poorly lit and murky. There's a cold, gritty washed out look to a lot of the footage. The soundtrack can be somewhat invasive. It sounds like an African tribe performing ""Flight of the Bumblebees"" while on tranquilizers. Although there's a lot of money at stake, the story is fairly simple: a maladjusted, insecure male does various things because of unresolved feelings, especially about women. He just happens to invent a social network that goes on to include half a billion people. <br/><br/>Although the movie has its good points, I suspect that the breathless response by the media is related to substantial ad revenues. <br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg turns in a compelling performance as the founder of Facebook. There is also a wonderful scene where then President of Harvard Larry Summers is unbelievably arrogant and pompous. In it, he predicts that Facebook will never amount to anything, based on his opinion as a former Secretary of the Treasury. Most of the performances are good. I didn't really buy Justin Timberlake as Napster founder Sean Parker. I've never seen Sean Parker, but he is supposed to be a hacker/programmer. Although he eventually started to date models, snort coke and hang out in nightclubs, I don't think that someone like Justin Timberlake has the type of presence that a hacker would have. Nerds and musicians definitely inhabit their bodies in different ways. I've never seen the character Justin was playing, so I could be wrong.<br/><br/>I wish the movie explained how Facebook came to be valued at 25 billion dollars. During the time period covered by movie, the company seems to have no revenue stream except for loans. For the most part, the unimaginable wealth Jesse Eisenberg's character is supposed to have attained is not depicted. Those seems like significant holes in the story. <br/><br/>If you were looking for some kind of vicarious joyride, this movie isn't that. It's more of a balanced look at the good and bad. The movie also contains a lot of misogyny and objectification of women, stemming from the characters' behavior. If this is popcorn movie for you, then I would consider these factors.<br/><br/>In spite of its flaws, I'm still thinking about the movie 24 hours after I saw it. This is a picture of what's wrong with our time: insecure, inadequate males who don't know how to deal with women. Their unresolved feelings can do wonders, or destroy lives--sometimes their own."

The idea the this movie gives of the US is that there any kid, drunk, punk with no substantial culture can become a billionaire. Nice picture.

"Meven_Stoffat","5","43","80","4 October 2010"," 120 minutes of patches
","I'll admit I quite enjoyed this film while watching at the theatre, but however on the walk to the LRT station after, the novelty was soon wearing off, as all I could think about was the major missed opportunities. Minus the Benjamin Button adaptation (which sucked), I'd never have thought that this would happen with a Fincher flick. And furthermore, I was quite baffled to log on and see all the glowing reviews of this film. Really? an 8.7?? <br/><br/>This isn't a bad film strictly speaking, but it isn't a good one either. It's dialogue is great, as is the music by Trent Reznor (I loved the funky Hall Of The Mountain King in the race scene, and as is the acting and directing, so I really can't come down on it hard on the fact that it's, for the most part, a well made film.<br/><br/>Of course there's going to be award buzz for this film, it was directed by David Fincher. The acting is really great, in fact it's PHENOMENAL. The best thing about the acting (and the entire film) is Andrew Garfield's performance, as I will be baffled if he doesn't get nominated.<br/><br/>Now like I said, I enjoyed it while I was watching it. But lately I've been thinking about it and I can't say it's a very good film.<br/><br/>The film skips back and forth between the trial and the events which surrounded the making of The Facebook. This works in the first half, hut then once Sean Parker comes in, it gets annoying, as the cutting back and forth becomes increasingly constant. Why can't you just show the whole unadulterated scene? Is it really that important to show Eduardo saying it as opposed to the words come out of Sean Parker's mouth, or to show Eduardo saying ""Then he said"" then cut to Sean Parker? If you're gonna cut back and forth and ruin the suspense of a scene, why even include it at all? <br/><br/>This is an example of the ""patches"".I mentioned in the title. The film is patched together as opposed to having a seamless story being told. 75% of the film takes place in the office during the lawsuits and depositions. At this point the suspense is ruined for us because we already know Eduardo is suing mark. So why give it away early in the if you *want* to give the audience a reason to care about the characters? <br/><br/>Another thing wrong with the film is that the theme isn't easily made across very easily. The most glaring example is a powerful scene near the end where Eduardo, the jealous soul, gives Mark, a jerk, hell for offering him a below-cost check. It's powerful, it's well acted, even hard to watch. But it's missing the most important thing: The overall theme. We don't get anything about jealousy and/or greed. At the end, We see Mark add his former girlfriend add her as a friend on facebook. Does this say anything about the asshole he really is? About how shitty of a boyfriend he is and even furthermore, how shitty of a businessman he is, that he became the youngest billionaire in the world for the wrong reasons? No. It doesn't say anything about being an asshole. Like I said, the theme is missing.<br/><br/>In short, this isn't a bad film. Like I said it's well shot, acted, and directed, but it's not a good film either- when it's good it's good, when it's bad, it's bad. I think IMDb needs to overhaul its rating system, as how this has a rating of 8.7 baffles me."
"stupidus","1","39","72","24 January 2011"," Worth a film?
","Ultimately there is no reason why I or you should need to watch it at all (let alone again).<br/><br/>Core problem with ""true stories"" is that we are always asked to go along with a particular interpretation. And the better the story is told, the better we will remember it. Fincher is a good storyteller.<br/><br/>The best storytellers are masters of exaggeration and omission. While most of us will acknowledge this, we can't remember it! What we're actually left with in the end is this vague notion of accurate-enough account of what really went down.<br/><br/>Of course the big picture is almost never clear-cut. Movies have überpower of stamping forever into our brain images of heroes and villains, and more troublingly, scarcely unchallenged truths.<br/><br/>Remember ""127 Hours""? It showed us an irresistible adrenalin junkie which - I'm told - the real life Ralston was anything but. Real life engineers are rarely held as gifts of god to women (something that James Franco's character undoubtedly is) by hardly anyone bar engineers themselves.<br/><br/>And sure enough coders have it even worse. And inventing something like Facebook doesn't suddenly turn you into a sexbomb - even in our current image economy. It merely translates to a high-monetary-value ex-partner(s). But I'm sure Zuckerberg already knows this.<br/><br/>No, I don't really care who invented, let alone coded, Facebook. No one can patent an idea that unoriginal. Everyone knows that Facebook wasn't the first social network on the internets - and yes, they even say it in the movie. But Facebook did change the way that millions of people now choose to interact with each other (not that I'd be personally thrilled about it).<br/><br/>Zuckerberg/Facebook ""just"" got a couple of things right from the get-go. E.g. no ads (wait until they're hooked), making it exclusive (total self-image management) and making sure the service is never, ever, down. That, combined with the connections he apparently got from the Napster guy, and it was pretty much a waiting game from there.<br/><br/>It's hard to get worked up over something that seemingly required no real effort/pains on Zuckerberg's part to make Facebook an instant local and later global phenomenon. There's never a feeling that things even could backfire. I'm sure this is not the case, but that's the feel we get.<br/><br/>Plus, the grand idea behind Facebook didn't get any less banal and immature after seeing the movie: just another superficial way of making similar-minded friends while helping to score some. It was maybe _more_ elitist than other services, so why am I not impressed?<br/><br/>I can appreciate Zuckerberg for his seemingly natural talent with programming. Brilliant minds like that make my life more easier than harder (we can always opt-out) while they get to do what they love doing the most.<br/><br/>But in no way do I feel indebted to this guy, or feel he's responsible for starting something new that will change our lives forever. Far from it. If anything, I feel his contraption has only progressed the regression of genuine human interaction.<br/><br/>Too bad that most people have less than stellar interest on guys and gals who happen to share his level of talents in any particular field. Sure, near-and-real geniuses might all have an affable persona underneath the ""cold"" outer surface and/or any number of other good qualities, but if they - like Zuckerberg presented here - never let anybody see that side of them, how could they blame anyone but themselves when accused of being a-holes?<br/><br/>Usually one has to give people a genuine reason - or better yet reasons - for them to even consider a possibility of falling in love with you (to be understood in a very broad sense). I'm sure Zuckerberg - like most of us - can love, can be loved and is in fact loved, but that is something we are not allowed to see in the movie (except briefly in the last scene, I'm guessing).<br/><br/>That's an epic fail if one is aiming for a moral story of any caliber. The real Zuckerberg remains a mystery, and what's even worse, a mystery who does not (yet) even warrant a biography.<br/><br/>But the persona of Zuckerberg is irrelevant anyways. He's just a name. Just a random guy you'd meet in a party and forget the next day. Not someone you'd take an instant interest in - in real life. And unlike a self-made hero, Zuckerberg ultimately comes out as a sad opportunist (despite also being gullible/impressionable) who got immensely lucky, and whom very few would call a friend. <br/><br/>Even if Aaron Ralston was pretty much out of his mind going alone and seriously underprepared canyoneering, at least you could cheer for this guy to succeed. Pure American care-free idiotism combined with pure American persistence and will to live. That's an engaging story (and a true accomplishment from Boyle). ""The Social Network"" was just the first act.<br/><br/>We knew Ralston would survive, we knew Zuckerberg would become a billionaire. We saw Ralston change, but Zuckerberg stayed essentially the same. Where's the film? When Facebook won't be around anymore, then a bio might be in order.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg plays his caricature character flawlessly, though it's just more of the same he did in ""Roger Dodger"" (which by the way did have something worthwhile going on in it). But like many others I was more impressed with Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. As for the soundtrack, I'd be more than content to see the comeback of old-fashioned film score composers who know their place in filmmaking (""There Will Be Blood"" - anyone?).<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>BTW. I absolutely resent it when people insist on saying they are drunk when they've in reality just had a few beers. IF you're drunk, you don't code. You barely form sentences. Try typing when you're wasted, and you know what I mean."

I won't be watching this film ever again, no matter how good the rest of it is supposed to be.<br/><br/>The opening few minutes of a film are supposed to entice you in, get you hooked, make you care and want to watch the rest of the story unfold. The opening few minutes of this film did the complete opposite - it made me angry (never a good thing where I'm concerned because I just go B*LLSH*T and switch off the DVD).<br/><br/>If that boy speaks as rapidly throughout the film, as he did in the first few minutes, then I consider switching the film off to be a blessing. Rapid dialogue annoys the hell out of me, mainly because people just don't talk like that - like they don't need to think about their response when engaged in conversation, taking only a nano-second before answering a question or responding to a prompt for opinion, etc.<br/><br/>If this film wins any awards, it should be for the worst opening 2 minutes of a film in the history of cinema."

The direction of Fincher and the script of Sorkin make this film look like a thriller, a dark thriller, when in one of its many layers it is a film about envy and teenage immaturity, one of the greatest qualities of the films of Fincher is that they are very complex, and can cover as many topics as they want.<br/><br/>The Social Network with Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac joins the list of masterpieces created by the hand of David Fincher, one of the artists more prolific of the seventh art.<br/><br/>Although I almost never talk about such repetitive themes as the interpretations in my reviews, since it is obvious when the performances are good and not, and most of the reviews say the same about that, but this time the young actors who keep this movie afloat deserve a line of recognition or more."

This guy is far less charismatic than portrayed (and he isn't portrayed as particularly charismatic to begin with) and far more calculating, menacing and Machiavelian than described. The only thing the movie did show worse than it was was Zuckenberg incel situation. Zuckenberg was dating a Chinese golddigger/smartdigger/Harvarddigger the whole time and they got married.<br/><br/>But despite being more positive towards its subject than they would warrant, the movie manages to capture part of the psychopathic nature of facebook and its founding. Artistic liberties were taken in order to humanize these monsters, to make us care and for plot not to be boring. In that it succeeded, but humanizing monsters like Zuckenberg or Hitttlerr is never a good idea in a movie. However, you at least get an idea about the depths of the cutthrooat depravity that was only confirmed by the fact that facebook abuses the trust of its sheeple all the time, and a movie is fun to watch, and deserves a praise even if it is an idealised/sanitized/overseksed version of the sorry reality this movie is based on, and as a movie is well worth a watch, but keep in mind the reality was much darker and more boring at the same time."

","I saw this film at a free screening in Denver last night. From the opening sequence, you know you're in Aaron Sorkin territory. His rapid-fire dialogue and the ""that was then, this is now"" editing is a little disorienting at first, but you get used to it. When Mark Zuckerberg breaks up with his girlfriend, you have a pretty good idea of everything going on in his mind. And yet, the film portrays him in a sympathetic light. Everyone was laughing at the hilarious put downs and one-liners. The best one, at least in my opinion, is a reference to the original ""Karate Kid."" All the actors are OK, but this is Jesse Eisenberg's movie. He convinces you of all the insecurities and doubts percolating in his character. While his reasoning is usually explained with a gesture or a snide remark, his confrontation with the Winklevoss twins' lawyer lays out his true motives for being the way he is. Rashida Jones' character although minor is pivotal since she explains to Zuckerberg where he went wrong. There are some brief digressions like Saverin's girlfriend problems which contribute to the 116-minute running time(sans credits.) It's a little too long, and David Fincher seems confident enough in the material not to indulge in any of his usual tricks. I'd say the film is a mix of ""Juno"" with ""Greenberg"" without the self-conscious dialogue of the first, or the nastiness of the second."

I would say it's the most realistic portrayal of University life, but I would be talking out my arse, as I've never been. It captures a whole sub-genre of people so incredibly well, and the writing is as such that we can feel these characters as real people, with real struggles and personalities, and not just some nerd robots who pumped out a website. <br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg, as depicted in The Social Network, is a bad guy. He betrays people, he lies, he talks over his dear friends, he cheats, and he's the best at it. The dude isn't even 30 yet and he's built an empire bigger than you or I could ever build, yet he doesn't care. He has no real friends. He has build a multi-billion dollar empire, and for what? <br/><br/>I dislike Facebook, but Facebook is also very popular. This was the perfect opportunity to make whatever kind of film you want: dark, edgy, slow, witty, depressing, comedic, etc. as long as it has the background of Facebook, and you're still bound to make loadsamoney off it. And that's what Fincher, Sorkin and Spacey did. This is the smartest, most genius and wittiest film of the past 20 years, only just surpassing There Will Be Blood and Juno. <br/><br/>Eisenberg is pure gold as the fast, clever, cynical Zuckerberg, even though he doesn't seem to be all that bad. He talks faster than his own thoughts and often says mean and nasty things without even thinking they're mean and nasty until seconds later. He acts superior to all his friends, and he is superior, mostly. When he isn't superior to the rest, he will strive to be, betraying all in his path. This isn't about money for him, he just wants to be the best at something. And he is the best; he's the best at hacking, lying, betraying, and yes, creating. <br/><br/>What stands out for me is the soundtrack, which can only truly work for a film like The Social Network. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross redux In The Hall of the Mountain King, as a symbol of the old, traditional ways being shunned in favour of the new generation, and at the helm of the Battery Human Generation is Mark Zuckerberg."

","While it's never satisfying to write a review about heightened expectations not realized, it's good to see a lot of realists pointing out the obvious mediocrity and short comings of this movie. <br/><br/>The schematic of this movie is pretty damn straight and simple. College boy loses girl, college boy attacks said girl. College boy is alienated by ""those of means"" at Harvard (really, I never saw that one coming). College boy gets back at the snobby rich spoiled kids (granted there are ""lots"" of kids who row crew and have fabulously rich parents, just no one I know). College boy starts up website that taps into the social angst and uncertainty of hormonally active college kids. Brilliant college boy makes a ton of money ""just because"" and then tries to get girl back. He fails.<br/><br/>There - Just saved a bunch of people $10 bucks and two hours time. <br/><br/>General replies:<br/><br/>""Sorkin's script is brilliant""...really, where's that? ""Great directing from Fincher""..uh huh...in what way? ""Mezrich draws on many sources"" - Yes a complete story, expect for the fact that he made up entire scenes and never spoke to the subject of the film and main protagonist. Other than that, yes complete.<br/><br/>Disappointments for Sorkin, Fincher and Mezrich. Better luck next time.<br/><br/>Best moment of the film (by far) Severan's ""rushing"" for a Finals club and ""feeding his chicken, chicken"" dumb (think about it, for a Harvard kid) but DAMN funny."

","I did not care very much for this film so I will hit the key points of my afterthoughts....<br/><br/>I just finished watching The Social Network at my local cineplex, and I was greatly disappointed. At first, I did not want to see the movie because I truly had no interest in seeing how facebook came into being. But each trailer I watched made me believe more and more that this was a movie about friends, greed, betrayal, and facebook was only a backdrop of these emotional complexities. I should have stuck with my gut instincts. A good portion of this movie is filmed in an office with our main characters accompanied by their lawyers. We (the audience) were well aware of the betrayal between the characters long before we cared about them. Why should we care about them turning their backs on one another if Fincher never gave us a reason to care about his characters in the first place. This movie was about friends, greed, and betrayal, which are great themes for any movie but not if we don't care. I also didn't care for the fact that half of the movie was set in an office of uncharismatic characters going through litigation. It was well written and the dialogue was great, but for a movie about humans and the social experience, I feel it lacked any emotion. I believe this movie could have been great. The cast was great. It had what seemed to be a great script. The one thing it was missing was a director to bring it all together and make me feel any sort of emotion for his cast. Im sorry, David Fincher. If you're movie The Social Network friend requests me, I'd ignore it. It's time to put on Fight Club so I can remind myself what you're capable of.<br/><br/>Social Network gets a 6.0/10"
"yearnj","7","8","12","10 January 2011"," Not a very pleasant movie
","Don't get me wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The plot device of legal disposition was clever and kept me interested till the end. The acting was great, especially Jesse Eisenberg in the role of Zuckerberg. But I have to say that there wasn't one character in the whole movie that I could like or sympathize with. Just a bunch of conceited juvenile brats backstabbing each other. Granted that may have been the point of the movie after all.<br/><br/>And I felt that the movie was overall very demeaning to women. Not a single woman is allowed to have any significant role to play in the whole story, girls are just playthings that come along once you've got fame and fortune. And these women are supposed to be coeds in the same prestigious schools that these brats are so proud of.<br/><br/>In fact the one character I liked was Zuckerberg's girlfriend who dumped him. She was the only woman with pride in herself in the whole movie. The scene where she gave a cold shoulder to Zuckerberg who was raving about his new invention, that scene was the most refreshing one to me.<br/><br/>Oh, and the most hilarious scene to me was when Winklevoss twins took their grievance to Harvard president and were confronted by sarcastic Mr. Sumners."
"agmoldham","4","14","24","9 November 2010"," Interesting rather than thrilling
","I had heard plenty of positive comments about the Social Network and have finally got around to seeing it. I must confess to being slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>The story follows the founders of Facebook and their rapid rise to fame. It is an interesting portrayal of the pressures that come with owning a company that is worth a fortune. The tagline to the film is that if you have 500 million friends then you're bound to make enemies along the way. The story is really about how success leads to people wanting to share in the success and how it ultimately splits up genuine friendship. Overall I found the film well acted, well directed and reasonable, but not really gripping."

","I was very disappointed with this Oscar-nominated film of 2010. It basically has many of the antics of the old college films. The only difference here is the intellectual connotation due to the rise of the facebook technological theme.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg is definitely credible as facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The film deals with the suit filed by others against Zuckerberg and his chums for allegedly stealing the facebook idea for himself.<br/><br/>There are the many foolish college life scenes still depicted in the film.<br/><br/>The film starts with Eisenberg talking a mile a minute on a date. It is only when he meets up with the Justin Timberlake character that he becoming a maneuvering character. The film shows some accurate traditional problems of corporate management. The problem of Eduardo is dealt with in the way you generally expect such problems to be handled.<br/><br/>The film is not even in the class of this year's superb ""The King's Speech."""
"badajoz-1","6","11","18","23 October 2010"," Not as good as the hype!
","In the fifties and sixties, the BBC in the UK used to produce drama documentaries - plays with deliberately no stars that were a rendition of actual events and characters, eg today's made-for-TV biopics. The scripts were fairly plodding and there were no directorial visual flourishes, but it was fair. 'The Social Network' is in this mould - pretty good but ultimately fails to deliver - except it's got Hollywood production values (and a few other sorts), a script by a crackerbarrel writer, and an auteur as director. Sorry, lads, the script, yes, has its' moments and its' flourishes, but almost completely fails to explain the motivation or characterisation of some fairly creepy people. While the direction could have been left in the hands of a second year Film School student for all the effort expended. Compare the sequences of seduction by a satanic business figure in 'Wall Street 2' - a tour de force - and the anally retentive, hero worship sequence in this picture. Fancy letting Oliver Stone outgun you, Mr Fincher!<br/><br/>As we all know, the film is about the creation of the present day social phenomenon called 'Facebook' and its subsequent falling out between the major players leading to litigation. It's a multi-billion company, but we are not told how it makes money/its' business model, despite one of the founders - Eduardo Saverain - being portrayed as hopeless in trying to get the business off the ground by flogging advertising (this point is rammed home four times at least, but we are not told what does work!). We also never are given an explanation why Eduardo likes the eminently up-his-own ass Zuckerberg in the first place - a dimension on which the whole drama of the film depends! I do understand that the legal consequences of over-egging the script were very great and the explanations at the end are glib and suppositional, but something other than joining Harvard clubs, getting laid, and 'the family' (The Sopranos are mentioned!) as motivators is expected of a 'great' script!<br/><br/>The acting is very good, but eventually becomes boring and one-paced as there is no development of character. We are also never told or experience what makes 'Facebook' so powerful for so many people! How can that be in a critically acclaimed film? The ending just fizzles out like most of the promised drama, and would any female want to see this bunch of nerdy geeks (I suppose Justin Timberlake might just make it!)? And as for the orgy lite dimension of rich Harvard boy clubs - strip poker where nobody gets their underwear off, and strippers who also do not get their underwear off! Really, that's the parallel of the deep-seated fault at the heart of the script and whole film - a tease that fails to show what everybody is really interested in. A terrible missed opportunity!"
"hankeyham","3","19","35","17 December 2010"," slickly made but relentlessly creepy
","Being in the computer biz I was interested in some of the ins and outs of the rise to glory of Facebook. This movie has the feel of truth as far as the character of the individuals depicted and what I know of the backstory. But for me that was the problem. Almost everyone in the film was creepy and despicable, and the lesson I drew was that this is the way things work in the Brave New World of virtual friendships. That's fine as far as it goes but by the time I escaped the theater I had a dank aftertaste in my mouth. <br/><br/>The dialog is pretty snappy. I kind of liked the music, but it was a bit overbearing in those big disco/party scenes. I try to avoid these in real life, preferring to have conversations with people where I can actually hear and understand what that other person is saying. I didn't have the choice here. <br/><br/>Too many scenes were just irritating to watch. Is everyone at Harvard really a complete, overbearing, condescending superficial bore with an overinflated sense of entitlement? Interesting scene with Larry Summers, who has always struck me as one of these. But it gets tiresome. <br/><br/>Who do you root for in this movie? After more than an hour and a half I the only one I found was the girl from B.U. that called Mark and asshole and blew him off. His partner is decent but hopelessly naive, the other parties in the lawsuit are only marginally less creepy and arrogant than the main character. <br/><br/>Easily the most overrated movie of the year."

not to mention the visuals in this movie, I loved and still love them, the opening scene & theme is still a perfectly made thing in my eyes, the cast was nicely picked also, timberlake, eisenberg, garfield? come on, lovely.

"gradyharp","3","13","23","13 January 2011"," THE SOCIAL NETWORK: The Zenith of Privacy Deprivation
","The amount of information about the film THE SOCIAL NETWORK driving it toward being named Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor etc etc etc can only be compared to the global blast of privacy invasion that the topic of the film - FACEBOOK - has caused. The story of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg, acted with as much flatline self absorption as the character he portrays - a compliment) and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield in the most sensitive, multifaceted performance in the film) and their brainy computer manipulated program that became the ruler of the computer universe is well told. The fact that the idea was 'lifted' from the Winklevoss twins (recreated a la 'The Parent Trap' concept by one actor - Armie Hammer) and Harvard sidekick Divya Narendra (Max Mingella) provides the story driver here: the history of Facebook is told through back and forth sessions at the depositions for law suits alternating with transmission of the incidents of the developmental struggles of the toy. It is story of obsession, of the fragmentation of trust between friends, of the proliferation of a challenging brainy idea into a billions of dollars scheme, and it is a documentation of how the current state of mind of the students to adults feed on gossip and instantaneous information dissemination, the results of which we are only beginning to appreciate as individual privacy becomes a relic. <br/><br/>Ben Mezrich's book 'The Accidental Billionaires' as been transformed to the screen by writer Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher (Seven (1995), The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), Panic Room (2002), and Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). As with his other films Fincher successfully creates an atmosphere that captures the message of his films. Here that atmosphere includes degrading women, drowning dialogue with inordinately loud music on the soundtrack (courtesy Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross), maladaptive behavior, and the gradual loss of dignity of those young people who propel this concept of Facebook to success - not the least of which is a study of Napster Pro Sean Parker well played by Justin Timberlake. This is a long, loud, noisy, crude, roller coaster ride of a film that probably is true to the mark as a docudrama and as terrifyingly thought provoking. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"Ziya90","1","11","19","26 August 2013"," A visual information streaming without any real cinematic, artistic and emotional effect
","It is surprising and quite shocking for me that most people appreciated the work David Fincher had done, especially the style, the approach, the pacing, the editing etc. The Social Network is a ""cinema free"" and ""art free"" movie, also I didn't consider it as an entertainment film. The Social Network has no heart and soul, it is almost impossible to feel anything about anything happening on the screen including the characters. I didn't hate the main character as I didn't like him either, but the problem is not the character. I can't see any artistic touch or cinema feeling in this movie. It was like ""just story and dialogs nothing else, so I found the movie ""mechanic"". See Fincher's other works, especially his early period, there is a huge gap between those and The Social Network. As for entertainment, personally I was not entertained, but also I don't think that this movie intended to be entertainment. If it was, then it is a failure! It was impossible to be entertained for me because of the pacing of the movie and probably it was literally the most exhausting movie I have ever seen in my life. Not only the characters speak too fast, but also the pacing of the film. This editing style, course of events with no break is something I really hate as a moviegoer like that shaky cam and if you ask me it doesn't add brilliance to the movie. The another main problem of the movie is lacking of any message, depth or social commentary. I had expected a thought provoking film and I can easily say that Benjamin Button includes much more themes, messages and comments on life than The Social Network. The Social Network has no background, think about a movie without a background, just the story, the characters are there and dialogs. This is such a movie, so the movie doesn't let you feel anything about anything. I saw a lot of biographical movies, but haven't seen such a film before. If things such as ""cinematic experience"", ""dramatic structure"", heart and soul, character and story depth etc. mean a lot for you like me, then prepare yourself for a poor and very exhausting cinematic journey. Unfortunately, some great directors like some great actors lose their talent, even if not, they don't make great movies as they did in the past such as Brian De Palma, Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, Tim Burton etc. and as I a big Fincher fan, it is too hard and painful for me to say this, but Fincher is now one of those names either. Considering David Fincher's career, it is like before Panic Room and after Panic Room. By the way, I really liked and enjoyed Panic Room, but it was the transition movie of Fincher. Personally I prefer the period before Panic Room, because I wasn't that impressed by the movies he did after Panic Room. In this movie, if Fincher did something brilliant, I couldn't see what it is. A ""smart"" movie for me is something like 500 Days of Summer. If in the history of cinema, there is any other movie similar with The Social Network, in terms of style with real pacing problems, that could be Syriana, but even Syriana was a more important film than this if you ask me, despite I wasn't impressed by that movie either. I would have wanted to see scenes from life, scenes from Facebook users' lives, some social and psychological comments and the most important relationships! I don't know, but there is one thing I am sure about that which is it would be very interesting and useful to see such a film for every of us. Then what is the point of this film? Just to give us some information? If so, this is not ""cinema"". The Social Network is a visual information streaming, just that."

","Hollywood seem to have forgotten that to make an emotional investment in a film (and this is a long one, about 2 hours) we have to care about the characters and their story. Script writer Aaron Sorkin slickly moves his puppets about and has them say archly cynical things in his usual way but by the end the audience feels nothing but indifference.<br/><br/>Really, Hollywood thinks we all want to see a bunch of privileged, entitled people screw around then screw each other and we're supposed to care? These shallow self-interested people may be typical of Hollywood (and obviously connect with the critics who were almost unanimous in their praise) but in the real world people are more concerned about paying their bills not worried whether ""entitled person A from Harvard"" sues ""entitled person B from Harvard"" for xx million dollars.<br/><br/>Huge efforts have been made to make ""The Social Network"" as slick and self-consciously 'cool' as possible, so those suckered in the hype can delight themselves as to how smart they are getting it. The dialogue is sharp if unnatural (typically Sorkin) and delivered in rapid-fire fashion, sometimes (as in the opening scene) hard to follow (but the fans of this won't admit that, because that wouldn't make them smart enough); it is set in a subterranean darkness, much favoured by modern films (does nobody like daylight anymore?); it has a 'clever' (but dramatically distracting framing device; and a soundtrack designed more to sell CDs as to work on screen from the awful opening plinky plonky piano tune (representing what exactly?) to the loud inappropriate underpinning of the various scenes of drug taking or programming (the music makes no distinction between these activities).<br/><br/>In the end, we feel this is a typical product of the post-modern age: slick, shallow, cynical, derivative, dark and disposable."

","Cinema students rejoice. Here is an American film worthy of critical analysis and close examination.<br/><br/>Its camera work is (at times) stunning. The acting performances are worthy. The direction is tight and focused, all the while entering some new territory regards narrative structure. The sound was daringly attempted, albeit not wholly successful.<br/><br/>So why just six stars? Because with all the film's many technical and artistic high points (and there are many), I just didn't care. It didn't entertain me.<br/><br/>I understand that many folks might find Mark Zuckerberg's rise to Facebook CEO interesting; however, I suspect that a good many more people will not--I am among the latter.<br/><br/>About eight years ago, former San Diego Union-Tribune movie critic David Elliot wrote eloquently of a movie's need to personally reach a viewer's psyche before the individual can embrace it. Providing entertainment is the goal of all movies. I fought against this thinking most all my life. I wrongfully assumed that a film could be judged on its artistic merits alone, with no consideration given to its ability to make a personal connection with the viewer. Even if the connection was unexplainable and strictly visceral, the movie must make an emotional and personal impact on the viewer for the film to be a success. The viewer must be entertained.<br/><br/>Well, this movie is an example of Elliot's observation. The film did nothing for me. It was one long, dull and boring straight line, in spite of its artistic touches. I didn't care about Mark Zuckerberg before the film, and I don't have any more interest in him afterward.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie. Again, there is a lot to like; technically it gets an ""A;"" artistically it gets and ""A;"" but for entertainment value it struggles to get a ""D."" I hope you like it. You may.<br/><br/>Everyone's likes and dislikes regarding movies are different. I agree with Elliot in that films should ultimately be judged on a personal level after considering their artistic and technical achievements.<br/><br/>For my tastes, I'll see another film for my entertainment dollar. Afterall, isn't that what movies are made for, ENTERTAINMENT?<br/><br/>This movie is many things--many good things--but it isn't entertaining."
"bob the moo","Null","6","9","19 February 2011"," Smart, snappy and engaging thanks to good writing, performance and structure
","As someone who has never joined Facebook and don't have any desire to do so, I approached the film on the subject with a certain caution since, although I was aware of the various back and forwards legally between all the individuals involved, I had generally treated it with only slight interest because I really don't care to consider how much money those involved now have. So it is to the film's credit then that I was easily held for the duration of the film and that the two hour running time zipped past. Opening with a scene of rapid-fire dialogue that only people in Aaron Sorkin's world talk in, the film keeps up the pace throughout with lots of snappy and convincing dialogue. This is also impressive when one considers that the majority of the ""action"" is either occurring in coding within computers or in stuffy conference rooms between two legal teams.<br/><br/>This is where the importance of structure comes in and the film effortlessly moves between the two lawsuits and the events themselves as they unfold. None of it is in flashback per se but rather the audience is being told the story and getting to know the characters across the different time-zones at the same time without any real problem in terms of losing the audience or fragmenting the telling – it is a very strong structure and one that is edited together really well. In the telling, Zuckerberg is the focus and he doesn't come off well at all (although I imagine his immense wealth will perhaps soothe him a little). Here though he is very much an intellectual geeky type, difficult to get to know and, once he is able to ""be himself"" one discovers that actually he is even more of a jerk than when he at least had some sheer of politeness about him. He is the cynical heart of the film when it comes to the rather selfish manner in which the business unfolds – with Zuckerberg caught up in himself and seemingly motivated by some deeper sense of failing and inadequacy that manifests itself in a barely concealed jealously.<br/><br/>Thankfully the film balances this character with the much more sympathetic Eduardo, who is really the heart of the piece in that he allows us to see Zuckerberg more clearly by virtue of outcomes and not just actions. How much these two and their relationship is dramatised as opposed to fictionalised, I'm not sure, but within Sorkin's script they both work well. Fincher also delivers and makes the film feel cinematic despite its very talky and chair-bound nature. He produces great shots, sets the scenes well and produces good performances throughout. Eisenberg stopped being the poor man's Michael Cera for me with this as he produces a character that he really understands and gets into – it isn't that he is saying the lines in a certain way so much as it is him ""being"" that character so that the rather bitter edge to him is always there even when the scene doesn't need it to be more than a shadow. Garfield is equally good and does make a lot of the scenes with his more emoting character, while Timberlake is great – OK a rather swaggering character but he pulls it off well. In support there are plenty of good turns from Hammer (who does great with his two roles), Mara, Jones and others and the only ones that did distract me a little was Disney's Brenda Song and a totally silent Adina Porter (True Blood) who seemed to be in a character that one would normally just stick an extra in – I doubt she was actually even in focus once during the film.<br/><br/>Anyway, True Blood fan gripe aside, The Social Network is as strong as everyone says it is. It has the snap and pace that you know it will have thanks to Sorkin but it also has a strong base of characters and makes this tale of invention, betrayal, business and lawsuits into a fascinating and engaging character-driven thriller of sorts. The performances and direction are all on the money to make the most of this great script and the film does stand as one of the best of 2010 – hopefully the upcoming Oscars will reflect that as well."

","Before I review the film, I would like to mention that I do have Facebook account, and its sole purpose is to allow friends who I have lost touch with - and who live all over the United States, and the world - to find me if they want to. I also have a extremely rare ethnic last name and no one in the entire world of 6 billion+ people has the same first and last name, which makes my name unique, so I carefully guard my privacy. I have the barest of personal info on Facebook and the highest of security settings. I also spend close to zero percent of my time socializing or keeping track of people I know through Facebook or other social networking sites. Why? As the Social Network makes perfectly clear: Nothing, but nothing, takes the place of real, live people in face-to-face relationships! <br/><br/>After watching Social Contract it left me feeling both amazed at Mr. Zuckerberg's good instincts and his fortitude in not letting anyone hold him back and allowing himself to succeed beyond his wildest dreams - and empty - by his profound loneliness and from the persistent discord that swirled around him throughout almost the entire movie. I also found irony in the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg did not cooperate in any way with the making of Social Network because it exposed his private life to the world - but, yet, at the same time, the general public is encouraged to give him (Facebook) as much of our personal information as we can! <br/><br/>Social Network is interesting because you see what a person with good instincts can achieve in the real world. While I don't approve of people mistreating each other, the history of inventing anything important is full of stories like Social Network. For example, patent lawsuits are a big business, that's why we have ""patent"" attorneys! (I also found it so delicious that the founder of Napster, who brought the recording industry down on its knees, played a key role in providing critical good advice to Mr. Zuckerberg's success. I know how malignant the recording industry can be. None other than the legendary Nigerian drummer Baba Olatunji told me a how one the biggest record companies in the world viciously screwed him out of a lot of money!)<br/><br/>Social Contract is mainly about two things: Interpersonal relationships and money. As far as the ""money"" part of the story is concerned: Mr. Zuckerberg is now a billionaire (actually he's a MULTI-billionaire!) With that huge amount of wealth I couldn't help, but wonder, what is he doing with all that money to make the world a better place? At the same time, I kept thinking about the 18-year old gay college student who recently jumped off the George Washington bridge because someone filmed and then posted his same-sex sexual activities all over the internet. He left his suicide note on Facebook! I hope someone close to Mr. Zuckerberg's reads this review and encourages him to start spending some money on organizations that work to strengthen laws that protect a person's privacy and maybe throw a few bucks to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered (GLBT) Suicide Prevention Hotlines around the country, also. They are always struggling for money. It would be a most profound gesture, Mr. Zuckerberg!"

Perhaps it's because of its relevance to our times, like last year's Up in the Air. Unlike that film, though, The Social Network is especially pertinent to me, because Facebook is such a huge part of my life. It's something that (quite literally) connects us all, much like the shared experience of seeing a movie; this is even more true in this case, as the screening I attended was ""sold-out,"" a free screening for Ohio State students. It's thrilling to think how each of us is a part of the story in some way. We are among the hundreds of millions who made this site the success it is; thus, the controversy. Thus, the film.<br/><br/>David Fincher follows up his beautiful, haunting Benjamin Button with something completely different. Set in our times, and on our computer screens, the drama of The Social Network isn't confined to a fantastical take on the past. Instead, it's a thrilling look at our present. Fincher directs a cast full of young, fresh faces through performances that show their potential and hint at their future success. He keeps the film moving at a perfect pace, building an appropriate momentum that matches the intense success story that is Facebook.<br/><br/>The structure is gorgeous, too. When the film first cuts to one hearing, then the other (as the film's tagline says, Zuckerberg makes a few enemies), you'll likely feel lost. There's no way to ground yourself in the images you're absorbing; the film just throws you in. This brilliant bit of editing portends the morally questionable path Zuckerberg heads down while also reflecting the very nature of Facebook. Just as you're unsure what exactly is happening in these first glimpses of the legal proceedings, so are Zuckerberg and company unsure of what Facebook is going to become. Numerous times throughout the film, characters admit to ""not knowing what it is."" It's huge, epic in a way that few things are. It spans the globe while being limited to screens. It's something profoundly modern, but handled with the film- making mastery of cinema's finest auteurs.<br/><br/>Perhaps the highlight of the film is Aaron Sorkin's phenomenal screenplay. The dialogue flies fast and sharp, ably including the techno-babble but tempering it with humor and enough layman's terms to keep the audience in the loop. The inclusion of multiple points of view lends the film a sense of fairness and accuracy. Of course you expect that there's exaggeration for the sake of being more cinematic, dramatic, or entertaining, but the extensive attention paid to each character makes the story easier to believe than other films based on true stories.<br/><br/>Sorkin's words sound perfectly acidic and natural coming out of Jesse Eisenberg. Eisenberg deserves awards attention for his performance as Zuckerberg; this is the role that will hopefully catapult him to the star status he so deserves (and has received in moderation after great turns in Adventureland and Zombieland). Andrew Garfield continues to impress as cofounder Eduardo Saverin; he now has three fantastic turns under his belt for the year, with Never Let Me Go yet to come (in my neck of the woods, at least).<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake's involvement in the film likely gave some film aficionados pause, but he's a natural fit for Napster founder Sean Parker. He exudes confidence, energy, and just the right amount of sleaziness. Also worth noting is Rooney Mara, who has a small role but does big things with it, and will get her chance to shine under Fincher's direction again as Lisbeth Salander in the American take on The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.<br/><br/>At two hours, The Social Network is a long movie but it never feels like it. The film possesses an elegance of design not unlike that of the website it revolves around. Every aspect of the film is handled just so; from the gorgeous cinematography to the great cast, from the fitting editing to the unforgettable writing. The Social Network is, perhaps, the film of the year. It's timely and timeless, a combination that few films can ever hope to achieve."

","It's hard to believe that it's been almost a decade since this film's release. Since then, Facebook's grip on people's lives only seems to have tightened and Mr Zuckerberg's public profile has grown significantly. In this social media-dominated age this film was definitely necessary and it provides an informative and compelling insight into the story behind one of the biggest invention of the modern day.<br/><br/>'The Social Media' is a well-constructed film that gets the balance between educating and entertaining about right. The characters are the most interesting part of the film and I thought they were brilliantly portrayed by all involved. This film, while primarily aiming to tell the complicated story behind Facebook, also carries an important message - no amount of 'friends' on social media or money in the bank is a substitute for 'real-life' friendship. The sooner people realise this the better.<br/><br/>I deleted my Facebook account many years ago now and don't miss it one bit. My problem isn't just with Facebook, rather social media as a whole and the (in my view mostly negative) influence it has on people. I don't think I'll ever understand why people feel the need to broadcast their lives to the world, but that's a rant for another time!"
"Badmoviessuck","9","2","2","6 February 2019"," Don't forget who you are
","This movie is really good.
This movie isn't about Facebook, it's about the friendship of Eduardo and Mark and it's themes are very interesting and important in today's society.<br/><br/>THEMES
Mark... he is an anti-hero.
His ego is high and he tries to distinguish himself from others which leads to consequences, for example Facesmash.
Eduardo is kinda the opposite of Mark. While Mark is kinda like a robot Eduardo is what we call a normal human being and there is a contrast between Mark and Eduardo which is cool to see.
Mark dosent really care about Eduardo cause he isn't good with social interactions but Eduardo still is friends with Mark no matter how many times Mark screws up.
But things start to shift once Sean comes, he sees an opportunity to use Facebook to get money and he does that by signing up a meeting with Eduardo and Mark.
Sean is delusional and Eduardo sees that but Mark dosen't, and that makes Mark and Eduardo's relationship struggle because of Sean but Eduardo stuck with Mark no matter what until something major happened that made Eduardo lose it.
The moment when Eduardo was mad and stopped being friends with Mark was the time they hit 1 million users on Facebook i think or something like that, and that was the moment stuff fell apart with Sean using illegal drugs.
Mark fires Sean and in the end of the movie makes the first human thing, he sends a friend request and that scene was freaking great.
The theme is that you should remember were you started from and keep you're friends close cause as soon as you only go after the money, the only real friend you had will disappear and you will be with a bunch of fakes that aren't friends with you cause you are good person, it's cause of the money, and that's what i think social network is trying to teach us.<br/><br/>VERDICT
this movie dosen't really have well developed characters but the only well developed character is Mark but i think why this movie is so good is because of the themes it's showing."

","The Social Network had high expectations- apart from the fascinating subject which will be of immediate interests to driven millennials the film was being helmed by David Fincher and penned by Aaron Sorkin. The film justifies the expectation and all the credit goes to the men stated above. The Social Network is about friendship and jealousy intertwined with creativity and flashes of collaborative brilliance among a bunch of highly motivated young men. How much the film is close to the actual truth should be irrelevant as the screenplay itself is based on a book. But the resultant book is compatible for big screen fodder. The screenplay is as expected from Sorkin full of witty banter and cool exchanges. Fincher's direction is crisp, and the pacing is incredible. Cinematography is suitable for the subject location and Fincher never overdoes anything. Of course, this is riveting drama because of the actors, many of who have become well established today and they are all exceptional."

","The thing I love about The Social Network is, the flow of the movie resonates with the characters it depicts. The movie proceeds with breakneck pace, is raw, visceral and restless, much like it's characters. Another reason why the movie works is,Impeccable casting. Jesse Eisenberg playing Mark Zuckerberg with an air of arrogance nails it. Andrew Garfield is the most likeable character in the movie, as Eduardo Saverin. No one could have played Sean Parker like Justin Timberlake, and Armie Hammer playing the Winklevoss twins is fantastic too. We usually associate David Fincher with those dark psychological thrillers, but this movie proves, he is not a genre specific filmmaker, he is much more than that."
"tarekshabana","9","2","2","6 August 2017"," It's less about Facebook, more about Humans.
","Returning to Fight Club's cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth, David Fincher delivers one of his films' most engulfing cinematography. The lighting, the shots, the camera movement all have you dwelling into the movie and more importantly into the protagonist, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg). This is what I found most brilliant in The Social Network, the way it's cinematography, soundtrack, screenplay and acting blend in together through perfect directing to harmoniously engage you emotionally. <br/><br/>The fast paced dialogue with the soundtrack gives you a rush and leaves you, not keeping up but rather dragged behind the storyline (on first viewing at least). This rush, or thrill from the fast paced dialogue and soundtrack pull you into the aura of Zuckerberg. The screenplay is also very well structured and moves along very nicely with three dimensional characters and character development.<br/><br/>I found the severing of the friendship between Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and Mark Zuckerberg to be very interesting. It's easier to believe that it was greed or whatever is more ""evil"" than just envy or jealousy that led to Zuckerberg's betrayal because it's hard to believe and no one will admit their ugliness and deep down jealousy of others even the ones they love, even best friends. But it's only social standards that hold some of us back from acting on these ugly emotions or at least publicly acting on them. That's not to say that Zuckerberg did this just because Saverin got into the Phoenix club, but I believe it has a larger influence than many believe. <br/><br/>I don't mean to be cynical, but I do believe that we must acknowledge that we innately have these emotions, and that we do not control the emotions themselves but we can control how to act on these emotions. And this is what I love about cinema, or what I think makes a great movie, when it takes someone who seems godlike or other worldly and portrays him in the same humanity as the rest of us."

It's well written and directed, so to evoke the maximum response from its audience; and much like Jack Gleeson in his role of Joffery Baratheon in Game of Thrones, Jesse Eisenberg manages to create such a loath-able character, that you find yourself as a viewer, becoming more invested in the story, hoping for the ""villain"" to be beaten by those who you sympathise with.<br/><br/>So while I found myself hating the ""based on real events"" story, and some of the characters in it, I have to tip my hat to the production team for putting together a good movie."

","'The Social Network' (2010) is a very good film but I'm surprised it hasn't been crippled by a deluge of libel suits. Jesse Eisenberg is tremendous as the fast-talking, hyper-programming Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. But is the real Mark so blinkered into effecting his own genius as the film portrays – even hinting that Mark is responsible for certain acts of base treachery? Is Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake) really the ruthless, manipulating hedonist as displayed in the film? Is Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield) really the naive no-hoper displayed here? I've been working with computers for over 30 years (and somewhat over-awed by the 'Young Turks' of the Internet) but I really didn't learn that much about the workings of Facebook. What I did get was a master-class in the nastiness of humans determined to get to the top regardless or, as the Bible puts it, gain the whole world but lose their souls. It's a film that really leaves a bad taste in the mouth. One that I'll visit again, because it's very well made, but not very often. Worth an 8."

","A bright social misfit (Mark Zuckerberg) becomes a billionaire by coming up with a new and radical way of communicating with friends and colleges through the internet. But was he the complete and total author?<br/><br/>Before I even saw this film I congratulated David Fincher and his production team for even touching this theme. So recent a piece of social history. The protagonist has the deepest pockets imaginable - so the film is clearly guided by lawyers and legal advice. The usual flashback he said/she said bomb-proof air-raid shelter. Mostly based on court deposition.<br/><br/>(Not only was the film virtually written by lawyers they feature on-screen more than they need to. Loyalty-free parasites - all of them!)<br/><br/>I don't think many people will want to see this product twice and over time the (high) IMDb rating will shrink. Why? Because the soup is too thin. We know he did it - what we may not know is how he did it. Once this is learnt (in the broadest who-do-you-believe strokes) then there is not a lot to return to.<br/><br/>Credit Jessie Eisenberg for playing a slightly autistic virgin loner who clings to the wall at parties, but clearly untrue. He not only had a girlfriend before his life went bang, but he is still with her today. Movie convention dictates that all programmers are geeky social misfits, usually wearing glasses held together with sticking plaster.<br/><br/>(They stopped short of this here - but cliché is not avoided.)<br/><br/>Programming is a slow business. Like working in treacle. To show his skill he hammers away like a speed typist. But most of programming is debugging. He never got it right first time. Although, to be fair, only programmers know this and the audience has no interest in such nuts-and-bolts.<br/><br/>Quality acting by lead Eisenberg and especially good support from Justin Timberlake (as theft-is-good Napster ""founder"" Sean Parker) who really is quite adept at playing flash character roles. Lost a lot of weight to make himself look younger.<br/><br/>The movie contradicts itself is when it claims that Zuckerberg has no real interest in money. Especially when most of his actions show that he wants to cut the cake more-and-more in his favour and, earlier, makes himself scarce rather than having to lie. Cowards lying. Like Bill Gates (featured in cameo) I don't envy him because he is not cool and in reality money (above a certain level) cannot improve your life. Not unless your only ambition is to build a hospital in the Third World.<br/><br/>Like many I came to this film looking for information and what I got was mostly opinion and spin. At worst it clinks and clangs in its ball-and-chain. However I was entertained for a couple of hours and that is - really - all we should ask of a film."

","David Fincher's ""The Social Network,"" promised to be meaningful expose on what facebook really means. Radiohead's ""Creep"" plays during the trailer as we watch facebook clicks and posts. ""Don't care if it hurts/ Wanna have control/ I want a perfect body/ I want a perfect soul/ I want you to notice/ When I'm not around/ You're so very special/ I wish I was special/ And I'm a creep/ I'm a weirdo/ What the hell am I doing here.""<br/><br/>We were lied to. Every character in The Social Network is an empty shell. In a baffling antithesis to the trailer, we are deliberately kept from ever seeing any emotional depth. Relentless aberrations of ego dominate the film as we watch Mark party, meet the hotshot creator of napster and perform business deals.<br/><br/>In what felt like the only scene of value in the film, we start by seeing Mark get dumped by his girlfriend ""not for being a computer nerd, but for being a dick."" His revenge is to call her a ""bitch"" on his livejournal and create, ""facemash,"" a website that ranks every girl's attractiveness on campus by having men vote who's hotter between two girls. And while the movie briefly explores the effect this had on his ex-girlfriend and the other female students, Mark never accepts or grows from the idea that he committed wrong, and we instead watch him heroically stand up to the evil school board that punishes him. What follows this wonderful patriarchal attack is a slew of parties, girls and celebrity. <br/><br/>The movie cuts between litigation over the money of facebook and Mark's rise to power. What facebook actually means to Mark, or to any of the users, is never actually explored. The film ends with the words, ""Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire to date."" How perfect to sum up this void of two hours. What you are to take away is the comfort of knowing you spent time with someone who has more money then you, drank more alcohol than you, knew more famous people then you and got richer than you. If you enjoy a vicarious ego trip with no emotional gratification, this is the film for you. Be prepared to not care about anyone."
"Legendary_Badass","8","14","27","30 September 2010"," I ""like this""
","Director David Fincher's The Social Network stars Jessie Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, and depicts how he became the billionaire behind the popular Facebook website. We start with the humble origin of the site's forerunner as a prank Mark pulls after breaking up with then girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara). This catches the attention of the school's social elites who pitch their site to Mark only to have him leave the project and launch Thefacebook, a site eerily similar to their concept. But before anyone can grasp the situation, Facebook becomes a phenomenon. Along for the bumpy ride are Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), Mark's best friends and FB co-founder, as well as Napster founder Sean Parker (played by Justin Timeberlake).<br/><br/>Tradition dictates that a film's protagonist, or hero, needs to be likable. When the audience isn't rooting for the hero, the movie usually falls apart. Not true for The Social Network, a movie that thrives on the disdain achieved by Mark Zuckerberg in this account. From the start he is overtly blunt, rude, and careless with no signs of remorse. Does this sound like a guy who would donate $100 million to a public school system? The Social Network chronicles Marks efforts to hijack ideas and leave out friends. It's a story about an antagonist.<br/><br/>Great performances abound. Jessie Eisdenberg is a distant, fast-talking, smart alec. Andrew Garfield has a fantastic scene where his easy going Eduardo loses his cool, and for once Justin Timberlake doesn't suck! I'm sure Sean and Justin mutually agree to his lady's man charlatan portrayal. <br/><br/>But the fun doesn't stop there. The score by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor's is reminiscent of Tangerine Dream and it lifts many scenes. I think some people will be letdown to find that the story of Facebook is framed by legal hearings but there are some clever screenplay elements put into play by scribe Aaron Sorkin. The Social Network is billed as a dark comedy, but I found it to be a straight drama. Almost every movie regardless of the subject has a lighthearted moment and that's what I see in The Social Network; it's a drama that happens to contain some humor. For instance it would behoove you stay on the good side of a twin who describes him as ""6'5"" 220 and there's 2 of me"".<br/><br/>There are times where the use of soft focus goes to the extreme and the mise-en-scène masks drug use. Heck, college students even sub out the f-bomb for some truly awkward PG-13 retention dialog. Cutting from an R to grab a PG-13 for assumed profits has never been this bizarre.<br/><br/>Even without showing a dollar, The Social Network is a far more timely and engaging tale of greed and woe than last week's Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, but still it would have been nice for the film to clarify how Facebook became so preposterously overvalued. After all, this is a move about some people you came into money and the audience never understand where the money came from. Is it the movie of this generation? Perhaps but that would be because this generation can't make an income from inventing a tangible product. My distaste for Facebook may be obvious, but I ""like this""."

","I didn't have much expectation when I was on my way to watch this movie, and there wasn't much to be expected either. <br/><br/>This movie is boring and to me sounded more like a documentary but they tried to make it more interesting by adding drugs, a few sexy looking young women and Justin Timberlake. <br/><br/>The movie was about how the Facebook came up and how the creator who seemed like a genius went through a rough time with law suits and lost a lot of friends in the process. <br/><br/>I gotta admit Mark Zuckerberg's character was well played, but everything else was nothing special. <br/><br/>I would watch it if it was on TV or maybe on DVD rental but not worth my money...especially with the price we pay to go to the theatres nowadays."
"ella-48","5","10","18","5 February 2011"," Is it really a movie?
","THe first thing I should do is declare an interest - or maybe it'd be more accurate to say a LACK of it. I didn't come to this film with a particularly open mind. I actively dislike Facebook and the whole ""social networking"" phenomenon, so if a drama about its origins was to keep me on board for the whole ride, it would have an uphill battle on its hands.<br/><br/>Sure enough, by about 20 minutes in, I was getting restless. Simon Amstell - sorry, Jesse Eisenberg - does a great job as Zuckerberg, but the script portrays him as such a thoroughly unlikeable, asocial being that I found it pretty hard to give a damn about what he was doing, and his fellow Harvard undergrads were portrayed as a pretty vacuous bunch of twerps too, which didn't help. Fortunately, the character of co-founder Eduardo Saverin provided somebody to care about. Then - before my hand had strayed too close to my coat - the plot began to thicken nicely, and thereafter the pacing kept us bowling along to the finish line.<br/><br/>Was it worth sticking with it to the end? On the whole, yes: it's a fairly satisfying drama. However, I'm not sure that it really qualifies as ""a movie"". A tale well told it may be, but to me it felt more like it belonged on the small screen - as a two-part TV drama, perhaps - not as something you'd willingly part with hard cash to go and see in a cinema. Oh, and one final thing: can somebody PLEASE tell David Fincher that incredibly dingy, yellow-lit interiors aren't atmospheric - they're just very difficult to see!"
"Klickberg","5","23","49","3 October 2010"," Please stop making movies about j*rks!!
","I wasn't planning on seeing The Social Network. I love Alien 3, was blown away along with everyone else by Fight Club when I was younger and now find it to be nostalgic at best, absolutely hated the ""adaptation"" of Benjamin Button, and haven't really paid too much attention to Fincher otherwise. I also don't have a Facebook page and haven't good things to say about Eisenberg.<br/><br/>But, everyone else seems to be digging the film, and Aaron Sorkin is one heck of a writer, so I thought I'd give it a go. <br/><br/>The film itself was average in quality. No great highs and no great lows, in my humble opinion. <br/><br/>The biggest issue for me, though, is more of a slippery slope I've been noticing as of late of movies such as this coming out, all about a slew of j**ks (or ""a***oles,"" as the Network itself would claim) who no one would ever care about. <br/><br/>Back in the day, it was all about the underdog, the Brando schmo scratching at himself and wearing a dirty white T-shirt. It seems today, though, the new ""underdog"" is really just some selfish bozo whose only means of being empathetic, according to the filmmakers, is that he/she might be a computer nerd or short or not so good-looking. As though that's enough to make us care about him/her?<br/><br/>The specific problem for me with The Social Network is that none of the characters deserve any empathy (or even sympathy) at all. The main character--whether the real Mark Z. is or not--is a total narcissistic b***ard who doesn't seem to even want anything or have any real goals aside from pi**ing off his ex-girlfriend with whom he seems to have no real chemistry or intimacy in the first place. Just because he continues stalking her doesn't mean he cares about her; I had trouble even believing that he would care that much about her anyway, considering the inhibited/introverted solipsist the movie made him out to be. <br/><br/>Then we have his best friend (or ""ex-best friend"") who was probably the only slightly sympathetic character in the film (which in this case is like being Valedictorian in summer school). But, even he seems to be selfish, childish, and immature throughout, using his family's money as a means of making or breaking friendships throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Everyone else in the film seems to be ""even bigger"" j*rks than the character of Mark Z., going around trying to intimidate their enemies and each other without really accomplishing anything or, again, wanting anything real except for ""revenge."" <br/><br/>It's difficult watching a movie like this where there's no one to latch on to emotionally. Justin Timberlake was surprisingly charismatic and charming throughout the movie, but as much as I wanted to like at least him--at least one character in the film--his character was also so incredibly despicable and conniving (not to mention somehow very wealthy despite everyone saying he had no money anymore) that it became impossible. I guess he was supposed to be the antagonist? The villain to the other villain(s)? <br/><br/>Another issue with this kind of slipshod writing and filmmaking is that we're not granted any semblance of three-dimensionality or humanity that can lend itself to realism. Jesse Eisenberg might never smile (and he never seems to in movies or interviews alike), but I'm sure Mark Z. does. In fact, whenever I see that fellow in an interview or photo, he seems to be smiling quite bright. Maybe it's just now that he has $25b? But, come on. ""Cheer up, Charley! Give us a smile!""<br/><br/>An easy fix to this could have been involving characters from Mark's actual life to show the humane and more complicated side of his persona. His parents, for example. Where were his parents? He was 19 during all of this, a minor. His parents could have been injected into the movie to give a fresh and more complicated perspective of the guy, to have them maybe speak with him and with each other about the scared boy inside the angry robot the movie makes him out to be. Or his real-life girlfriend who was there in those early days, perhaps making a composite of this girl and the one-dimensional ""Erica"" of the extant film. A girlfriend who stands by him, who caresses him and lets US in on the ""real"" Mark who SHE sees, as opposed to, again, the robot the movie makes him out to be. <br/><br/>In the end, Mark Z.'s character was just as bad a guy and just as hypocritical as the biggest blonde-haired, Adonis bully fratboy character you might find in an 80's teen movie. Just because he happens to be a ""nerd"" (?) doesn't make him Louis Skulnick. <br/><br/>Charles Foster Kane wanted the innocence of his youth and craved that time in his life before he became Hearst. And this is exactly what makes him more like ""us,"" more of a character with whom we can empathize, regardless of how venal he becomes over time. Mark Z. just wants to pi*s off an ex-girlfriend who, again, I don't even really believe he gives that much of a d**n about anyway. When there's nothing to care about in a main character, a movie is failing. When there's no characters to care about at all, a movie FAILS. <br/><br/>Hollywood: please take a memo! You can't combine Revenge of the Nerds with Varsity Blues anymore! J*rks will always be j*rks no matter if they're computer nerds, alienated little eight-year-olds, Southern working moms, pregnant teenagers, or fat. Work a little harder to create real, three-dimensional characters we can care about. There's always something there; it's just a matter of finding it."

","David Fincher does a marvelous job of telling a complicated tale, pulling us in and riveting our attention. he has a history of that.<br/><br/>It is curious that so-called ""social"" networking began in such an anti-social stew of class distinction, intellectual arrogance and sophomoric personal viewpoints.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg is excellent as the creator of Facebook. However, the amazing role in the film is that of the elitist Winklevoss twins. I don't like to read too much about a movie before I dive into the audience, so I had no clue that one actor, Armie Hammer, played both roles.<br/><br/>Seen side-by-side in numerous scenes, there was even a thought in the back of my mind that the twins were close, but not really close enough. What a performance. A supporting Oscar nomination will hopefully follow.<br/><br/>Distractions: the glamorization of the party scene at Harvard--I have my doubts. Perhaps it was just a way of emphasizing the fantasy that the computer guys were hoping to obtain? ...and the abrupt ending.<br/><br/>It was almost as if a studio exec had said, well, not bad, but we're looking for a two-hour run time. And so...slice, stop, rolling credit explanation as to outcomes. A more natural ending would have been appreciated.<br/><br/>But the anti-social nature of the networking is laid out brilliantly, through the Mason of the Harvard undergrads, to the coed user-consumer wannabes, to the don't care attitude of the Dean, to the use and discard context of many of the relationships.<br/><br/>In the context of the suicide death of a Rutgers undergrad a few weeks ago after social network bullying, this film accurately tells of our times and directly questions its values."

After watching the movie I did follow up research to understand better the events of the story. That research showed that Eduardo Saverin was instrumental in getting the book ""Accidental Billionaires"" written as a character assassination of Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker.<br/><br/>I don't know if Mark Zuckerberg is as self absorbed as presented in the movie, nor whether he was mesmerized by the cunning of Sean Parker. But I doubt it. The movie presents Saverin as complete victim and the Winklevoss brothers as noble, but petty, finaglers who had an idea yet did nothing with it, except sue for wealth from Zuckerberg.<br/><br/>I have no fondness for Facebook. I was on it for about a year and later discovered that they are retaining all data that we put on their site to sell to marketers - hence their billions of dollars profit. It is ironic that Zuckerberg hacked into the Harvard computer system to gain the jpegs of all the girls on campus for his Facemash, then later comes up with the system where all the private data is given to him voluntarily. This information is available for the government whose quest it is to profile every American for surveillance reasons. Google is doing the same and I have since stopped using their search engine. It was very difficult to get my data removed. When you close your Facebook account they do not delete the data and you have to go through various ""hidden"" pages to get the data deleted. Even then I am not sure that it is deleted since I am still getting Facebook spam months later.<br/><br/>Before they got they first 500 million dollars investment, they wanted to keep their site cool. Now that it is a giant mega corporation, it is not cool, but creepy. Zuckerberg is not cool, but filthy rich. Perhaps Bill Gates was cool at one time but they are both part of the globalist elites now."
"Lechuguilla","2","8","14","30 January 2014"," Cold And Soulless
","It took about a minute for me to know I was not going to like this film. The male character, Mark (Jesse Eisenberg), a Harvard University computer geek, addresses a college-age girl sitting across from him in a pub. In an annoying voice and with all the warmth of a dead computer, he speed-talks his way through what is supposed to be a romantic date. As the plot moves along, Mark morphs into a kind of juvenile Gordon Gekko, obsessed with his work, greedy, self-satisfied, and unconcerned with the welfare of anyone but himself.<br/><br/>With the possible exception of Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), almost all other characters, including Mark, are cold as ice, selfish, and downright soulless. The Harvard University President is portrayed not only as obnoxious but also unethical. Basically, the script consists of a thousand villains and no one to applaud.<br/><br/>One really good line of dialogue stabs like a dagger. In a scene where Mark sits in a conference room staring at his laptop, as usual, a female legal assistant named Marilyn asks him: ""What are you doing?"" ""Checking in to see how (Facebook) is going in Bosnia"". To which Marilyn responds in a tone of sadness: ""Bosnia, they don't have roads but they have Facebook"".<br/><br/>The cast is too big. Acting is acceptable, given the heartless subject matter. Visuals overall are too dark. Sound quality in some scenes is terrible. Filler scenes could have been edited out.<br/><br/>Trying to be ""hip"", ""The Social Network"" cashes in on the ""success"" of a contemporary internet fad. Twenty years from now the film not only will be dated; it will play like some relic from antiquity. Either that or humanity will have been replaced by soulless robots exchanging notes with each other in code through some ghostly Orwellian hologram called Bot-book."
"vostf","6","11","21","14 October 2010"," Great scripting and acting, and then what?
","OK I'm a tad prejudiced. I had read most about the Facebook backstory over the past year and I think David Fincher is an over-rated picture mash-up maker.<br/><br/>Let's try to be objective. There's not much to learn from the Facebook genesis. Basically it's Fight Club without fist fights. Nice elevator pitch, uh? If it wasn't for the 500-odd million people registered on The Social Network, nobody would give a damn. It Is Downright Anecdotal and Deeply Uninteresting. But the scripting is brilliant. All this uninteresting stuff just flows. There's no gap, no hang, the known reality is perfectly blended in additional fiction to leave no unknowns behind, only bright answers and nice half-answers.<br/><br/>The acting is just perfect too. So directing must be very good, not? As a 'project manager' I can admit David Fincher is really good. Yet, since this movie will mean nothing 5 years from now - whatever becomes of Facebook - to the general public, I can just acknowledge it is a very fine marketing product. A - somewhat - good movie? Scripting and acting keep you interested all along but there's absolutely nothing in it you would feel like discussing with your friends after it reaches the 2h mark when it's time to close shop.<br/><br/>So you may think David Fincher is a great director, I just think he has a talent for building his team, which is just half the job. Spielberg is a great director, he knows how to (and has the means to) build his dream team, he gets all the funding he wants and still, in every other movie he dishes out his trademark sentimentalism overflows. David Fincher has no trademark, he is great at nothing except feeling the breeze and setting sail at the right time. No small feat; no major achievement either.<br/><br/>In the end only a very small number of people are able to see precisely how much of a talents' catalyst Fincher is, and how much he owes to individuals' talent and hard work. Just like with Mark Zuckerberg."
"lambchopnixon","6","6","10","27 November 2010"," Only the best it could be with such a limited structure
","Social Network is nearly as good a film as could possibly be made out of this remit: Anal, vindictive, extremely smart nerd at college creates web site, and the film flashes backwards and forwards between those days and the later law suits. <br/><br/>The film doesn't go down the terribly over-worn road of lawsuit in courtroom drama, holding it within an airy high-up office room, with easy close-ups all round. Fincher also makes the college campus as picturesque as he possibly can. He begins with a bang, smartly gong straight into the armchair-psychologist's accounting for why the character did everything he did: by being spurned in love during this scene.<br/><br/>Social Network could have been improved if it didn't employ that common trick nowadays of cramming too much, too fast into dialog, so that it washes over the listener. Only the gist of the thing comes across, with the detail sounding like good writing, but from what it sounds like, not what's in it, which goes by intentionally too fast.<br/><br/>Other than that, the film could not have been improved given the structure that it must conform to. The acting is excellent, including Justin Timberlake, a boy-band version of the real-life man. The trouble is, the structure is far to constricting: flashbacks between the scenes of making the site and later legal side (almost all in one room). That's all there is to it. The story as-told doesn't call for any depth to the characters to be shown. When I say 'depth' I mean as shown by perceptive writing.<br/><br/>In Social Network, the characters and how they work internally is blatantly sign-posted. The framework of the tale doesn't allow anything more through. Sean Parker is charismatic but nowhere near as confident as he seems, as telegraphed by asthma inhaler and young girls. Mark Zuckerberg's story has its roots in the lost love bar scene. <br/><br/>With the acting as it is, but the film perhaps including some tangents, some subtlety and most importantly, a framework not limited to just two settings, this could have been a far better film. As it is, it is very good for the limited work that it is, which equals only a good film."

","It cant be denied that the social network movie for David Finch is one of the most anticipated movie of the year and has a big chance for winning a lot of awards and it is one of the best biography movies ever.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of the founding of the massively popular social networking site Facebook. At the outset, co-founders Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) & Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) are best friends but business soon comes between them. This results in legal action against Zuckerberg, who is also being sued for allegedly stealing the idea for Facebook from his would-be employers.<br/><br/>There's a cool precision and honesty to The Social Network, the story of the founding of Facebook, which guarantees its entertainment value even as it limits its emotional impact."

","The Social Network is an immaculately crafted Facebook origin story and character study of Mark Zuckerberg that cuts to the heart - or lack there of - of what makes Zuckerberg (played by a razor sharp Jessie Eisenberg) such an unlikable guy.
It's an unflinching portrayal of a misanthropic, social climbing opportunist, who enriches himself by building a social network under the pretense of bringing people together and, in the process, double crosses his business partners and his only friend, Eduardo Saverin (an empathetic Andrew Garfield) when it becomes financially and socially prudent.<br/><br/>Whether it's in business, friendships, or in any other relationship, honesty is the trait we prize most. Its what we look for in people we either hold dear or have close dealings with.<br/><br/>The Social Network is an unflinching takedown of the unfeeling opportunist at it's helm. If you still have a Facebook account and have even the slightest urge to delete your account give The Social Network a watch. It might be the cure you're looking for. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that David Fincher masterfully directs Aaron Sorkin's great script and Trent Reznor's score is fantastic. I also wanna say that the whole cast was really terrific."

Garfield and Timberlake are good too. The cuts between past and present ensure the film remains very well-paced. The atmosphere is comfy, and the music is phenomenal.

","This is one of the movie I had on my watch list for a long time and which I wanted to see almost ever since it came out. I only had the chance now because I wanted to watch all the movies from the 2011 Oscar highlights list. The Social Network tells the story of the Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg and how he created Facebook and later dealt with the problems it raised. <br/><br/>This movie is directed by David Fincher and it can be seen from almost the first shot. The cinematography and the pace of the movie reminded me most about Fight Club because this is mainly Fincher's style of movie making. This movie was a blast from start to finish. I was captivated and drawn into the story from the first couple of scenes. The movie is not shocking or with a lot of twists and turns but the way is directed feels like a live experience. This movie is 2 hours long but it felt almost like an epic of 3 hours because the pacing was somewhat fast and there were a lot of things happening in it. First of all the performances were all top notch especially from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield. The cinematography beautiful along with the directing which in my opinion should have won David Fincher the Oscar. The story is very realistic and extremely well told, I mean it captivated me even though there were no plot twists or CGI extravagance and props to the screenwriter for that. The only reasons I'm not giving this movie a 10 are 1. The poster for this movie is in my opinion misleading in a way that makes you think that the movie will be about how unsafe Facebook can be at times but the movie is almost about something completely different. 2. Some of the politics and laws were way to complex exposed in movie and it was hard at times to keep up with all of them. 3. The score was a big let down. Now, I know David Fincher wasn't renowned for being a director who utilizes music score very much to enhance the quality of the movie (example Fight Club) but this score won an Oscar that year and compared to Inception's score (which is the only one I know from the nominees that year) is completely underwhelming. I can't understand how they didn't gave the Oscar that year to Danny Elfman or Alexandre Desplat or other composers who I think did a better job than the composers for this movie did.<br/><br/>Overall: A very interesting and captivating movie with terrific performances, great direction but with a slightly misleading poster that made me believe the movie was going to be about something else, some hard law science and poor score. 9/10"

But the most memorable part of this film is Jesse Eisenberg's performance. I don't think they could have cast anyone better to play Mark Zuk., or for that matter anyone to play just that role... of the Harvard nerd kid who made it.

","This movie inspires, provides motivation, and shows the true picture of two worlds: the modern world and the IT world. It demonstrates how money jealousy destroys a true friendship. I like it especially for two things: for a motivation which the story of Facebook and the biography of Mark Zuckerberg shown in this movie provide and for demonstrating that each should be vigilant when he/she builds a business with his/her friends, each should be aware of a betrayal, even from the side of friends.<br/><br/>Facebook was founded in 2004 at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was launched by Mark Zuckerberg with his roommates Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes and by his friend Eduardo Saverin. The story began with Facemash, the Facebook's predecessor, opened on October 28, 2002. Zuckerberg wrote the software for the Facemash website when he was in his second year of college. The website was set up as a type of ""hot or not"" game for Harvard students. It allowed visitors to compare two student pictures side-by-side and let them decide who was hot or not. Harvard's network died because of large traffic; 22 thousand students used Facemash at the same time. Mark Zuckerberg got the bad fame, all female students hated him because he hacked all dorms and used female students' pictures for Facemash. The Winklevoss brother, who had the idea of ConnectU, social networking site for Harvard student, noticed him. They told Mark about Connect U and asked him to help them. He agreed, but then he didn't reply to their emails, phone calls and messages. Mr. Zuckerberg began to work on Facebook (the first name was the Facebook) in 2003, he wrote the largest part of the code, his roommates helped to finish the programming code. Eduardo Saverin's father was rich and gave his son enough money to launch Facebook without investors. Eduardo was the first financial director. In 2004, the Winklevoss brothers sued Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, claiming he stole their ConnectU idea to create the popular social networking site, and ultimately received $65 million. <br/><br/>This movie motivates and inspires; it didn't change my life, but enriched my outlook and opened my eyes on some aspects of this difficult and unfair world. I recommend this movie to everybody and even if he/she does not have an interest in computers and the IT world; it is for all majors. The main idea is that everything is possible, even if a person is alone and that in this dangerous world you may be constantly betrayed."
"Screen_Blitz","10","3","4","30 December 2015"," Intelligent and well crafted biopic of the Facebook founder
","Facebook has been held position as the most popular social media website for almost a decade, beating other popular social networks like Myspace, Twitter, and one more popular towards the adolescent crowd Instagram. This biopic directed by David Fincher, focuses on Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook; and the story behind how it became the enormously popular social website it is today. Beginning in the fall of 2003, Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg) is a student at Harvard University who is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright (played by Rooney Mara). Upon the break- up, Zuckerberg creates a website known as ""Facemash"" where users compare girls online based on their attractiveness. The website's high traffic causes a breakdown in Harvard's computer network, resulting in Zuckerberg to place under academic probation. During this time, he builds up a social media network known as Facebook which soon leads to a global success and lands Zuckerberg to a billion dollar business. However, he also faces conflicts with his friends in the process, pitted against two lawsuits, one by his best friend Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield), and the other by two brothers (both played by Armie Hammer) who accuse him stealing their idea. <br/><br/>Thanks to the masterful writing by Aaron Sorkin and superb performances by its gifted cast, this biopic sparkles the legacy of Mark Zuckerberg's work and the story behind the creation of the globally popular website. Based by Ben Mezrich's novel 'The Accidental Billionaires', the film introduces us to the main character in the opening scene as someone not too likable due to his attitude towards his girlfriend, and later his friends. His ways of running his newly founded business leads to him squeezing his best friend out of business and making more enemies in the process. So Mark Zuckerberg is proved to be have been not the most desirable person to work with, but very intelligent nonetheless. Jesse Eisenberg brings such a sensational performance in what becomes his first Oscar-nominated role of his career. He looks so natural in his role that you almost forget its him instead of the character he is playing. Andrew Garfield who plays the main character's best friend that later turns into his enemy brings satisfaction to his role as well. Let's also not forget Justin Timberlake playing Sean Parker the founder of the computer sharing service Napster who later partners up with Zuckerberg in his business.<br/><br/>The story works exceptionally well from start to finish, and the elegantly written screenplay by Aaron Sorkin should be credited for this. The film gently highlights the important points of the story based on the events that took place, and though there a few noticeable liberties taken from both the book and real-life events, Sorkin keeps the story solid and satisfying without overdramatizing or sugarcoating the events. The whole subplot dealing with the lawsuits against Zuckerberg are lavish the storyline, and director David Fincher handles this subplot in a solid manner. <br/><br/>The Social Network is one of the most intelligent and well crafted biopics ever put to screen, and demonstrates some of the best filmmaking from David Fincher. This is an A+ film that everyone is strongly encouraged to watch regardless of they are users of Facebook or not."

Jessie Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire thanks to a social network called Facebook. Mostly in flashback it is indicated that his revenge on an ex-girlfriend resulted in a site that crashes the Harvard web server. He is approached to assist in a network called The Harvard Connection but he misleads and creates a social network for everyone called Facebook, which results in a couple lawsuits and the reality that being a billionaire has ultimately cost him in terms of social acceptance. Andrew Garfield plays Eduardo Severin, his best friend who put up money for the site but feels betrayed. Justin Timberlake plays Napster founder Sean Parker whom also invests in the site but due too his problematic past, Eduardo doesn't trust him. Parker is hyped on parties and drugs, which become his ultimate downfall. Armie Hammer plays the Winklevoss twin Cameron and Tyler who first approach Zuckerberg regarding the Harvard site and are now suing claiming that he stole their idea. They are part of a rowing team and result in comic relief. Rooney Mara has a small but pivotal role as the initial target of Zuckerberg's emotional dispute. Directed by David Fincher who previously made such intriguing films as Zodiac, The Game, Seven, and Fight Club, this is easily one of his very best. It demonstrates how success and wealth don't equal popularity and friendship. Score: 10 / 10"

","The Social Network is truly a masterpiece and deserves to be recognized as such. <br/><br/>First of all, it is unimportant whether the movie is accurate in its depiction of facebook foundation; what really matters here is the universal story that is told and enables the viewer to analyse a generation. <br/><br/>The sharp, direct, fast dialogue (contribution of Aaron Sorkin), the upbeat score and the cold colors used in cinematography all serve one main purpose: to accurately represent generation Y (in which I include myself), a generation marked for being cold, uncaring, distant and without a goal in life. <br/><br/>It is possible to see David Fincher's touch in the technicality and precision throughout the entire film. The opening scene is a thing of beauty, for it sets the tone for the whole movie and reveals how the protagonist is like: frustrated and just aspiring to belong. For instance, it is curious to see that at the moment Saverin discovers the shares' dilution Zuckerberg is wearing the same jacket Saverin wore earlier in the movie; Zuckerberg just wanted to be part of something. <br/><br/>The actors did a great job in transmitting the feeling of an era; one can really feel Zuckerberg's (Jesse Eisenberg) indifference and motivations. Saverin's (Andrew Garfield) character is well built and one feels heartbroken when he is betrayed. Justin Timberlake also did a nice part as Sean Parker, the young rebel without a cause. <br/><br/>It is also important to observe the ambiguity inherent to generation Y: at the same time they seek relationships (we live in society after all), they remain distant and change partners/friends in a blink of an eye. Another interesting aspect one can notice is - as in real life nowadays: the characters have a lot of so-called friends (e.g. on facebook) however at the end of the day everyone feels lonely.<br/><br/>Thus David Fincher has done an incredible piece with The Social Network, further extending his remarkable body of work."

","While some may consider the comparison sacrilegious, The Social Network is essentially a modern version of Citizen Kane (it even has its own version of Rosebud), and while it doesn't have the same scale of Welles' film, it's almost as good. It's about the true story of Mark Zuckerberg, who became the youngest billionaire in history after founding Facebook. The film uses Zuckerberg's life as a metaphor for the ironic isolating effect social networks have on individuals. He's desperate for genuine human connection, but incapable of fitting into the world of the social elite, so he invents a virtual way to crash the party, which only isolates him even further from the society he wishes to be a part of, as well as the few real friends he started out with. It's an excellent film about capitalism's ""expand or die"" principle. Every time Zuckerberg hits a roadblock in his personal life, his answer is to expand the reach of the company in a futile quest to prove his worth. The Social Network features a haunting score by Trent Reznor; its dark tones establish a sinister atmosphere and prevent the perception that Zuckerberg's attitude and achievements are something to celebrate, and Aaron Sorkin's script weaves together multiple narrative threads in a seamless structure. David Fincher's film should be remembered as one of the definitive films of its era."
"ryklinker","10","3","4","18 December 2014"," The journey of Mark Zuckerberg's invention and establishment of Facebook
","College is a time where every student defines him or her self. It's when many people meet their spouse, some of their closest friends, and when they get the degree that turns into a career. For Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg), his time at Harvard has been less about the classes, and more about his time in front of a computer screen, hacking into the school's database and blogging about his life. We first see him infiltrating Harvard's student directory and creating a site where two students' pictures are placed beside each other, and viewers vote on who's ""hotter"". 22,000 page-views, and many outraged students, later, Zuckerberg is called into the school officials' office, and it is now that we see why he has very little friends. The two friends he does have are Eduardo Saverin (Garfield), the finance genius, and Dustin Moskovitz, a computer programmer like Mark. After witnessing the impressive computer work by Mark, brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss meet with him and propose their idea; a social website featuring student bios, info, and statuses, and they want to call it The Harvard Connection. Mark agrees that he's interested in helping the brothers, and leaves. About 6 weeks later, a new social media site is activated featuring student bios, info, and statuses, and it is called The Facebook. The brothers find this new site, and the conflict of whose site it is, and who deserves the potentially billion-dollar revenue, is launched into action<br/><br/>As an American teen that has been a Facebook account-holder for about 5 years, I was interested in this film. Facebook revolutionized how our society meets and interacts with each other. Coming into this film, I knew two things. 1.) David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en, and Curious Case of Benjamin Button) directs it, so I knew that it would be well done 2.) This was the ""big break"" for both Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield, so I was curious to see what made their performances so good I thought that the actors were good in the film, particularly in the case of Andrew Garfield. The only other role I had seen him in was as Spiderman, and this performance was far better. I thought that Jesse Eisenberg did a great job of capturing the quick-thinking and slightly smug Zuckerberg. The story itself is true, and the truth behind the history of this company is quite emotional. This film was nominated for 8 Oscar categories, and it won a trio of them (Adapted Screenplay, Film Editing, and Original Score). My one negative comment is something that I'm still unsure of. In the movie Mark comes off as very egotistical and pretty cutthroat. I'm not sure if this is what the real man is like, or if Eisenberg's performance is what created this impression. In the case of the former, it disappoints me that one of the richest men in America is pompous and conceited.<br/><br/>The run time is exactly 2 hours, but it seems longer than that. While stereotypical college life and the ""lifestyles of the rich and famous"" do involve sexuality, I found it to be a little too much for my taste. I also found that the film leaves the viewer with the idea that tricking your business partners and friends out of a piece of the company that they helped you create leaves you rich. However, it does show the moral message that you can have billions of dollars, but you may not have many friends, whether in real life or on Facebook. <br/><br/>www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com"
"chris-madaffari","10","3","4","21 October 2014"," Out of Connection: The Social Network's Subtle Commentary on 21st Century Society
","""You are going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerdthat won't be true""<br/><br/>The Social Network can be proclaimed a great movie for various reasons. There is the arc of Mark Zuckerberg from pitied protagonist to self-loathing antagonist. The allusions of Harvard rowing elite and final club grandeurs perfectly symbolize a begrudged, yet seemingly unreachable social class. Moreover, the simplistic irony of the man responsible for connecting millions together ending alone is unescapably intriguing. However, these explanations for the film's prominence are all but pawns for Director David Fincher's ultimate drive; a commentary on society's imbalance, with the obsession for individualized success uprooting the true bliss of companionship. Erica Albright's opening that Zuckerberg will be infinitely disliked, solely, ""because (he is) an asshole,"" is the axis on which Fincher reasons this societal conviction. For every step in Zuckerberg's success, there is a scarf burned, cut-in- sequence to settlement hearings, and an ever growing disconnect from humanity. Fincher's process of subtly placing these intense human interactions within a movie assumingly all about a website is what creates the film's magnificence. <br/><br/>Fincher starts the process by drawing the audience into Zuckerberg's character. This is neither completed by belittling Albright's education nor embarrassing Harvard's female population through facesmash (though both are essential to establish his prowess and intensity). Nonetheless, it is Zuckerberg's desire and continued denial for acceptance that yearns viewers' emotions. While Zuckerberg codes the night away by balmy lit dorm room, Fincher purposely cuts to the sexual-enlightening, adventure-gratifying party at the Phoenix. This dissonance is heightened when Zuckerberg later attends Caribbean Night at AEPi, a fraternity typically linked with ""nerdiness"". While Zucerkberg speaks of wanting to live in the apparently rapturous prestige of final club socialites, he is stuck with dreary party mates and an irrelevant ""loop of Niagara Falls,"" amplifying his own monotony. When Zuckerberg is, at last, approached by Harvard crew it is only to be their work horse in a venture and when eventually given access to a final club he's cut off immediately at the bike room. Consequently, as Zuckerberg initially clings for societal acceptance to feel success, the audience feels for the character. <br/><br/>However, as the storyline develops, a deteriorating relationship between Zuckerberg and Eduardo, fixated on the latter being punched by the Phoenix, gives way to a key shift in the audience's perception of Zuckerberg. In consecutive conversations between these characters, Fincher ends scene with Mark taking shots at Educardo; calling out ethnicity as an overwhelming factor in the final club acceptance and being frankly brute of Eduardo's ability to make the cut. These quotes epitomize a more avaricious, individually-orientated form of Zuckerberg, which continually grows. His premeditated absence from Harvard.Co appears vindictive on Zucerkerg's intent on the venture's inevitable failure and is later proved true when he states the twins are suing him because, ""for the first time, the world didn't work"" for them. By utilizing these moments, Fincher paints a version of Zuckerberg who is throwing down the hatchet. If he will not be accepted by the elite, if he will be used as a mere faucet for others' triumph, Zuckerberg will beat them all. Zuckerberg will not care who gets in his way nor will he settle until he is the most successful. <br/><br/>While this impassioned mindset may draw an audience closer to the character, it does not in the The Social Network. Fincher purposely allows Zuckerberg's drive to corrupt his sense of self in exchange for Facebook's, and inherently Zuckerberg's own, success. The entrance of Sean Parker, whom Zuckerberg sees as essential to Facebook becoming a ""billion dollar"" company, highlights the character shift. In following each of Sean Parker's questionable suggestions, from cussing out AD agencies to freezing Educardo's personal account, it becomes apparent Zuckerberg no longer feels the need to fit society's norm. If an action benefits Facebook, it is a go and if it does not, it needs to be stopped, bottom line. This spiral of greed summits with Eduardo's stock being diluted to near zero for Facebook to become profitable with corporate backers. In choosing millionaire status over his essential best friend, Zuckerberg has completed the final stage in becoming an antagonist. The audience no longer roots for nor is drawn towards Zuckerberg as he emotionlessly watches Parker mock Eduardo out of the headquarters. In a time when Zuckerberg should be over joyous in his gained wealth, he sits all alone staring at his business card, which reads""I'm Ceo, Bitch"".<br/><br/>In this specific moment, Fincher has established his commentary on society. Yes, Zuckerberg has reached his goal of being successful beyond the means of those who chose not to accept him in the past. But, in doing so, he lost everyone who ever did accept him. The grandeurs of the elite, which Zuckerberg once held synonymous with an unreachable prestige, no longer hold value. Zuckerberg could buy the Phoenix club and turn it into his own ""ping-pong room,"" but says money has become ""nonexistent"". Though his superficial success makes Zuckerberg more desirable than ever, he stares at Erica Albright's facebook profile waiting for her acceptance to ""friendship"". It is of no prevail. The man responsible for creating the world's most powerful social tool gave too much away for the creation. He is left but to watch alone as the rest of the world connects with itself."

","I've got to admit, I was not entirely enthusiastic about a movie based on Facebook. For one, I didn't really enjoy the website and I didn't see why everyone was so obsessed with it. Secondly, I didn't think that the material in the movie would be all that fascinating, seeing as it was about making a website. Big Whoop.<br/><br/>But boy, was I wrong. While the basis of this movie is about building a website, the fundamentals are not. At the heart of this movie are the relationships that were built, the relationships that grew, and the relationships that were lost. What sucked me in was not all the mathematics and computer mumbo jumbo (something that, as a non-computer scientist, I didn't understand). Rather, the dynamics between the characters are what resonated with me. <br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg with such a delicate mix of iciness and shyness, that in some scenes you don't know which one he is really portraying. He pulls of the fast dialogue really well, and although you tend to fall towards the ""hate"" side throughout the movie, by the end he'll still manage to leave you feeling sympathetic to his case(Although I have to say, if this is Mark in real life, the movie did not do much to make him look heroic). Andrew Garfield does a spectacular job of playing Eduardo Saverin, Mark's best friend and initial co-founder of Facebook. He conveys a sympathetic, honest and kind spirit about Eduardo, and we can all root for him as well as relate to him. This is a story of a friendship gone wrong, and in the climatic final scene, when Garfield really lets loose, is when the performance is at its strongest. Other notable characters are Justin Timberlake who proves he can act (and FINALLY be hated!) as a slimy, get under your skin, all around annoying Sean Parker (which means he is doing his job well, seeing as that was the goal) as well as Armie Hammer, who impresses by donning a double role as the winklevoss twins.<br/><br/>Overall, don't see this movie for girls (who did not add anything special to the plot and shouldn't have even been there), or even really for facebook. But see it for the impressive portrayals and for the relationships built. You'll root for some, you'll hate some, and overall, you'll enjoy the movie."
"sanjdale","10","3","4","2 February 2011"," The World We Live In!
","This review may contain spoilers <br/><br/>I have to say that i rate this movie was one of the best movies i have seen in years. As a reflection of the times we live in i would say 2 movies are right up there the first the Pirates of Silicon Valley and the other being The Social Network. <br/><br/>We live in times that we do not fully understand and this movie for me provides a balanced and non-judgemental commentary of how we got here. We live in a time where we share more about ourselves than at any other time in our lives. Never before have we provided so much personal information to so many and how we react to social situations has changed dramatically as a result of phenomena such as Facebook. Let me give you an example, in the past you met a girl(or guy) you started dating, you had your first kiss, then more you gradually started introducing them to your life, your friends then your siblings and if it got very serious your parents. Now we have Facebook, they send you a friend request full of the full flush of a blossoming romance you accept and give them unrestricted access to your facebook page and them to you.... now that could get messy very quickly and forces along the pace of what people of my generation think of as a natural pace. You add them on a restricted profile limiting them access to your friends and your wall? How will that effect the relationship. I do not personally believe we have had sufficient time to think about these issues in any great deal and it will take a lot of time to get used to. <br/><br/>Anyway back to the movie! None of the above is discussed or touched upon on The Social Network I just felt it was something this movie should be making us think about! Much like Silicon Valley you get a focus on the individuals involved, the rivalries, their personal inadequacies, and how the end product evolved. The main focus of The Social Network is the focus on the litigation that was settled by the founder as Facebook got more popular. I came to facebook quite late so didn't really know much about how it started so i found this a very useful movie to watch. Also the story was engaging as the characters had a lot of depth. Especially Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of the founder. The movie did seem to hinge on one central theme, the creator of this biggest social network has real problems when it comes to founding close personal relationships with others. I do not know how true this is but it was portrayed in a very good way, no over dramatisations and no downplaying of the main events. <br/><br/>Anyway finally I would like to strongly recommend this movie to anyone thinking of watching it, i thoroughly enjoyed it as a piece of entertainment and it has also given me much food for thought on how we live today."

","Title, money and beauty are the three forms of aristocracy as director Preston Sturges once observed and they are the governing forces of our society. Connected to all three forms are curiosity and jealousy. Both are very powerful human emotions that give people a certain false sense of power and ""raison d'être"". Facebook the website/phenomenon is primarily built on it. Curiosity and jealousy intersect in unexpected ways, desires are triggered via mouse-clicks and somehow a whole new way of existence is created and released.<br/><br/>What's even more powerful, David Fincher, writer Aaron Sorkin, the work of the entire cast and crew rounded off by an amazing score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross completely captured all the above mentioned aspects. <br/><br/>But the ultimate feat, that ""The Social Network"" manages to achieve, is to show to an entire generation of internet users that no life can be lead if identity is not based in reality. Every life has a profile, not every life is profiled to have a soul. Mark Zuckerberg seemed to have grasped this and, according to the film, failed to choose the right side of this equation.<br/><br/>Now this is one hell of a movie."

","The film itself is excellently filmed and acted but I wonder why did they have to choose this particular story.

If he wanted to make a movie about truly brilliant people doing truly innovative things, however, he should have chosen other base material. Fincher should be aware of how his films are understood by mainstream critics and audiences, and if this film was meant to be ironic, then the irony is too thin to be understood by most people, let alone make a point; you just have to read the reviews at Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic to realize this."

","Can David Fincher make a bad movie (well lets forget about Alien 3)? The Social Network is so amazing on so many levels. The story is captivating from the opening scene, the scene between Mark & Erica in the bar. Sparking dialogue that leaps off the screen- so many memorable lines in just the 1st scene alone. The narrative hurtles along at such a pace & doesn't really let up until about the last 10 minutes of the movie. This is definitely a movie to watch a few times. The acting is awesome- the 3 lead actors are just great & there are some excellent supports (notably Rooney Mara). It is incredible the way the leads are depicted, very flawed, often unlikeable people in so many ways. Aaron Sorkin has written a really impressive screenplay (got to get a nod at Acadamy Awards!!!!) & plays an exec in 1 scene. There are so many great scenes, the opening is outstanding & the scene where Mark Zuckerberg looks at Sean partying through the window is really impressive too. We just got home from seeing it- it opened today & i cant wait to go back. But Im a Fincher fan & even his worst movies (Panic Room, The Game) are excellent. His best (Fight Club, Seven, Benjamin Button, Zodiac) are amongst my all time faves & this is more in the Zodiac style. Fincher for best director or Nolan? Highly recommended & what i would call a 'must see'."
"matthewfitzgerald87","8","3","4","22 October 2010"," Surprisingly deep and moving film
","I think the majority of people were very skeptical upon hearing that a film was to be made regarding the invention of everyone's favourite social network site: Facebook. Such a film sounds like a quick cash-in, aimed at today's youth who live part of their lives through the said website; however, when David (Fight Club) Fincher was announced as director I immediately became intrigued. Fincher is, in my eyes, one of the best directors around, and his attachment to a film ensures it will be entertaining yet deep. He's proved this with his past projects, and this is exactly how I would describe The Social Network. I'll admit, I have a Facebook account, although I had no idea who created it or how it was created. The Social Network tells the story of how Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard University student, comes up with the idea of Facebook, and the ensuing legal battles he faces. Now, since seeing the film I have learnt that much of the film is in fact an exaggeration of the truth; but what film isn't these-days? The Social Network begins with Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) being dumped by his girlfriend Erica in a bar where they had visited to just have a drink. You learn a lot about Zuckerberg in this scene, how he is a complete ass, yet simply wants to have friends and be recognised as having friends. In retaliation to the actions of his ex, Zuckerberg returns to his dorm and creates a website called 'FaceMash' where Harvard female students are rated against one another based solely on levels of attraction. Zuckerberg creates FashMash in one evening alone, whilst intoxicated, although he is aided by several friends, including Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) who supplies him with an algorithm necessary to allow the site to function properly, and it is this feat, along with the fact that the Harvard network crashes due to the amount of traffic on FaceMash, that alert Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to Zuckerberg's talents. They hire Zuckerberg to create a social network site called The Harvard Connection, which Zuckerberg agrees to. However, he then approaches Eduardo with idea of 'Thefacebook', a site where Harvard students can see information regarding each other without invading privacy. Zuckerberg asks Eduardo to put up 1,000 dollars to set up the site, which he will create. Eduardo agrees and Zuckerberg quickly creates the site that becomes an instant hit across campus. During this time, Zuckerberg avoids any meetings with the Winklevoss'; however, they eventually become aware that Zuckerberg is the creator of Thefacebook and claim that he stole their IP. Meanwhile, Thefacebook expands to schools across the US, and comes to the attention of Napster co-founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), who arranges a meeting with Zuckerberg and Eduardo. Zuckerberg is impressed with Parker, whilst Eduardo notes his unprofessional past, and is skeptical of him in general. No deal is reached with Parker, though he recommends that they drop 'The' from the site calling it simply 'Facebook', which is taken up by Zuckerberg. The decision is then taken by Zuckerberg to move the base of operation to Palo Alto, while Eduardo remains in the East trying to secure investment through advertising. When Eduardo shows up at Palo Alto he is enraged that Parker is living with the Facebook team and making business decisions, while Eduardo is ignored. Zuckerberg then agrees to a decision whereby Parker is given 7% share of Facebook and Eduardo's ownership is reduced from 30% to less than 1%. Eduardo then decides to sue Zuckerberg, whilst Parker and Facebook interns are arrested for possession of cocaine at a party. Throughout the film we see Zuckerberg testifying in the two lawsuits (Winklevoss' and Eduardo's), and the finale sees a junior lawyer inform Zuckerberg that his defence team will recommend a settlement agreement with Eduardo and she suggests that he settles. The film ends with Zuckerberg sending Erica (his ex) a friend request and waiting for her to reply. I must say that all the performances in this film are fantastic, something that deserves recognition considering the cast are all quite young. Eisenberg steals the show as Zuckerberg, portraying a troubled youth with immense talent that, as Eduardo recognises, ""needs looking after"". Timberlake puts in an admirable performance as sleazy Parker, and I think he deserves some respect for playing a character that really isn't supposed to be liked in the movie. This isn't a happy movie, there's some jokes, but generally you will leave the cinema somewhat downbeat. This is a film about how friendships are destroyed, and how people are manipulated. The audience are probably most sympathetic to Eduardo (he was a consultant for the movie, whilst no Facebook employee, Zuckerberg included, had anything to do with it - perhaps this has some bearing on the telling of the story), he tries to do the right thing and look out for Zuckerberg, but Zuckerberg's treatment of him leads him to being kicked out of the Facebook team. Fincher's direction is superb, a memorable scene being the Henley Regatta featuring the Winklevoss' boat race, which I would like to watch again. The film is very relevant right now, as Facebook is huge and still growing, and it is impressive what has been achieved in a film regarding such a subject. I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed with The Social Network, and it ranks up there with Fincher's best."
"callahan-patrick","9","3","4","22 October 2010"," Critics got it right...
","It's nice to see that the critics hadn't blown this movie hugely out of proportion like they did to the last film I saw in theaters *cough* (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World). The Social Network, with a 98% on RottenTomatoes, is my second favorite film of the year thus far (number one being Inception). Kudos to David Fincher and Jesse Eisenberg and the rest of the cast for bestowing us with some the most compelling characters I've seen in what seems like an eternity as well as a clear-cut drama without being too vague or melodramatic. I honestly didn't believe, at first, that a great film could be derived from a topic involving Facebook, but... there you go. Anyway, most of the film isn't about Facebook at all, but rather the people in the told events. What do I recommend? Give it a shot, is it a ground-breaking film like the Matrix. No, but still there is entertainment and intellectualism to be found here (although I felt it featured more of the latter rather than the former). I must say though, if you don't no much about business politics , you may be out of luck. Keeping that in mind, however, go SEE THIS FILM!!!"
"neil-476","9","3","4","17 October 2010"," Food for the brain
","I really enjoyed this film. It is something of a rarity, in that it is aimed at the part of the brain which involves thinking, not the parts which involve feeling, or enjoying eye candy, or visceral reactions etc.<br/><br/>I have to approach it as if it was a work of fiction as I'm not able to assess the extent to which it uses dramatic licence in telling which is otherwise the true story behind the creation of Facebook.<br/><br/>Two things drive it. One is the two legal actions deriving from the creation of Facebook together with the actual gestation (told simultaneously in flashback), and the other is the interactions between the main characters involved, principally Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), his partner Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), the predatory Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) and the twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer). Both are presented masterfully by director David Fincher.<br/><br/>If there is a weakness here, it is that (with the possible exception of Saverin) none of the characters are particularly sympathetic. But that doesn't matter too much because the story is sufficiently interesting to survive that. In particular, Timberlake delivers a character who is unpleasant and amoral, but nonetheless very three dimensional, and Eisenberg - previously a charter member of the self-deprecating loser fraternity - is simply phenomenal, playing a character whose interaction with others takes place almost exclusively on intellectual, not emotional terms. He is aware that there are such things as social niceties, it is just that he is completely unequipped to access them.<br/><br/>And a quick word of praise for the special effects. What special effects, you may ask. Quite. In most of the scenes in which the Winklevoss twins appear, they are both played by Armie Hammer, and the inclusion of the actor twice in the same scene is absolutely flawless. And there are quite a few such scenes. Brilliant."

","The Social Network was a movie that I expected to be very dramatic, and not leave a lot of questions unanswered at the end of the movie. I was slightly wrong. Sure, it did have a lot of drama, but not as much as the trailer portrayed it. Also, this movie was showed as being controversial, for not having shown the true story of how Facebook was founded.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I saw this movie, and I enjoyed the geekiness of the movie. The character uses a Linux operating system, an old computer from the time the movie is set in, and Livejournal. It wasn't obviously fake, and didn't show some geek typing all the time without ever touching his mouse. I also enjoyed the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg. He was shown as a fast-talking, smartmouthed brat that was more mature than the other kids. It looked pretty real.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is pretty great. If you are a parent and are concerned about alcohol and marijuana being in movies, you should stay away from this one. Quite a lot of partying from the characters."

","Laggards may scoff at this film about Facebook, the current cultural phenomenon at the peak of its networking power, but the tale of it's genesis from the dorm rooms of Harvard to the bedrooms of every man, woman and child in the western world is as old as the carrier pigeon. So old that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has been at pains to point out that it's themes of betrayal, jealousy and friendship could have been written by Shakespeare or Chayefsky. This may sound like Sorkin starting to believe his own golden award enriched hype but there's an element of truth in his deserved self-aggrandising.<br/><br/>Director David Fincher, sometimes prone to brilliant and artistic flights of fancy in films such as Fight Club, plays a steady hand here by letting Sorkin's quick fire script roll off the tongues of the leads and push the narrative with every sardonic quip and computer jargon soliloquy. It really is a testament to the mutually beneficial partnership between director and screenwriter that when The Social Network moves it's attention from computer screen to litigation room via three separate testimonies and perspectives like a Ritalin starved 14 year old, it is still able to hold your attention throughout. Of course there are the odd Fincher touches and themes, the exclusive frat party which is shot like one of Tyler Durden's wet dreams and his constant penchant for dark, autumnal, desk lamp lighting for example, but really this is an Aaron Sorkin film with the auteur Fincher providing a beautifully lit blank screen for typing.<br/><br/>Facebook itself plays a relative backseat in proceedings, Sorkin all too aware that placing the website front and centre would be as interesting as accepting Farmville invites every two minutes. Instead the website's creator Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is the focus of attention. His inability to be included in the hierarchy of the American higher education system, be that via the exclusive rowing clubs or romantically with female classmates, the catalyst for the ironic creation of this all inclusive behemoth.<br/><br/>Eisenberg's portrayal of Zuckerberg as a computer genius outsider with borderline Asbergers is engagingly restrained , neurotic and amusing in equal measure. Each million he makes and each friend request he accepts taking him further away from any semblance of real life and real friends. There are also stand out performances from Andrew Garfield as the frustrated friend, exacerbated admirer and co-worker Eduardo Saverin and Justin Timberlake as Napster creator Sean Parker. Timberlake especially enjoying the opportunity to stand on the shoulders of Zuckerberg's genius with Iago like arsehole zeal and cowardice.<br/><br/>The Social Network is an almost perfect film that packages the early 21st century version of the American Dream in a simple and engaging morality tale.

I have to admit going in I really did not have any desire to watch this being that I'm not into facebook(I don't even have a personal facebook page).

I don't know how accurate Eisenberg's portrayal was but he was pretty much what I expected. Has the movie progressed I started to feel sorry for him, Facebook took off too quick and he was at the mercy of everyone he came in contact with in order to be liked. For some reason when ever a movie takes over all media and becomes the place to be (like this one did) I have a feeling like I need to find something wrong with it so I can hate it, (like I do with Titanic...different review) but I found it difficult with this one.

"freemantle_uk","9","4","6","22 October 2010"," This is more then just 'Facebook the Movie'
","When it was first announced that there going to be a bio-pic about Mark Zuckerberg and the creation of Facebook it was seen by many as a quick cash-in on the popularity of website. But luckily Aaron Sorkin wrote the script and David Fincher was setting in the director's chair and that made The Social Network one of the most highly anticipated film. It is clear that The Social Network is going to be one of the big hitters at the Oscars this year (though my preference is for Inception).<br/><br/>The film tells two stories that are interlinked. The first from 2003 when Mark Zuckerberg (Jessie Eisenberg) as a Harvard undergrad who after breaking up with his girlfriend Erich (Rooney Mara) has a misogynistic rant on the internet and make a website, FaceMash where men get to rate Harvard female undergrads against each other. When he gains notoriety the Winklevoss Twins (Armie Hammer) recruit him to make a website, but he ends up making his own website with his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). But as Facebook grows Saverin believes that they need to make money out of the website and Zuckerberg falls under the spell of Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the founder of Napster who wants to isolate Saverin. In 2007 the film tells the two lawsuits Zuckerberg is facing with the Winklevoss twins and Saverin both suing him.<br/><br/>Sorkin is a great writing and The Social Network shows his skills and usual traits of quick, intelligence, witty dialogue, intelligence well developed characters and quick pacing and excellent plotting, using the legal proceedings as a framing device. The film sets out to show that Harvard is controlled by social elites, with misogyny raging in the Final Clubs. Sorkin was unable to speak to Zuckerberg so most of the script was a fiction, but it was an entertaining fiction. Fincher's direction added to the script; keeping the film down to Earth and Jeff Cronenweth's dark cinematography adding to the tone of the film. Fincher kept the film in the real world and unlike Oliver Stone who tried to be stylist with Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (a film that was difficult to make visual), Fincher takes a more gritty realistic tone. Fincher and Sorkin shows that Harvard can be a sleazy place with heavy drinking, drug taking and treating women as no more then sex objects: but there are also intelligence people there and people who disagree with what Zuckerberg did. Fincher and Sorkin make a fast paced, entertaining drama with moments of comedy.<br/><br/>There is a very good young cast in the film. Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg almost like he was autistic, a young man with great intelligence but almost no social skills, who as Erich said 'But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole', which is true in the context of the film. Zuckerberg is a shown to be a man willing to steal other people's ideas and concepts, use people and string them along and hides behind computers, becomes horribly bitter if anyone dares cross him and the internet because his lack of social skills. Hammer has a tough job of playing twins and two different characters and he puts it off. Both men are from a wealthy background and felt wronged by Zuckerberg. Garfield is a strong performer, playing one of the few truly sympathetic characters of the film, someone royally screwed over by his one time friend. Before the film Timberland did not have a great reputation as an actor but Fincher was able to get the best out of him and show he can be a good acting talent. Sean Parker is made to be the real villain of the piece, a man who looks a like a 30-year-old who wants to be a uni student, a man who speaks pretentious rubbish about the internet and what he did with the music industry; a man who used Zuckerberg.<br/><br/>Sorkin worried that his characters would not sound real because of their age: but Sorkin knows that everyone is an individual and have their own speech pattern. Whilst there is slang that every generation claims for themselves most teenagers and young adult speak the same as everyone else and it great that Sorkin makes his young characters sound intelligence. Language has not changed much between generations and if anything the internet has made it more universal.<br/><br/>With all the good things about The Social Network, I am critical of their portrayal of England in a short sequence, going through all the posh stereotypes of what an American would think England is like. I would have expected better from Fincher and Sorkin who are both intelligence men and well travelled. Also it was a shame their didn't use the Kolacny Brothers and Scala version of Creep in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent film and deserving of most of the praise it has received."

It takes the audience to a point where they can't help but ask ""What did he just say?"" or say ""Now that's cool, that's really cool.."". The screenplay stands equally superb as the direction. I'll just simply state that Fincher is Fincher when it comes to his direction and roving camera work. But what really haunts me in this film is his signature lighting. Unlike any other of his films in the past, in here it flowed vividly unscathed. It's always dark yet captivating to look at. It has an effect perfectly blended through the immaculate score and story that in my opinion, results in subtle resonance of every photographed scene. <br/><br/>On the side of acting I'd like to give recognition to the casting director for it is a great job putting all the ensemble together. From Eisenberg to Garfield to Timberlake who I am not surprised to live up an over the top role, to even Jones' short but sweet participation are all suited. Although the stand out award I'd like to give to Mr. Armie Hammer. His role is just Tailor fit, literally as his jacket. From his statuesque as a rower all through out as a dapper at Harvard, he is just believable in that field. He is after after all the Winklevoss BrotherS. <br/><br/>The Social Network is a significant film to be shown in this day of age. People are at the coffee shops, internet hubs, computer room at their houses all wanting to be connected and have a connection, socially of course. This film is so evident that people are somehow meant to socialize, I'm not speaking as an expert here or whatever, but by just witnessing all my friends and relatives speaking the lingo ""Facebook Me"", or ""Add Me As Your Friend"" is such a testament that we actually do care to care about other's lives I don't know if it's good, but most people claim it's fun and so the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Based on my few learnings about this movie, Mark Zuckerberg just like many other guys got the better out of him because of a girl and the inevitable Heartbreak which, on the other hand brings out the best out of a man. Then subsequently enforced him out to build the phenomenal Facebook, or should I say The Facebook.com. The way I see it, Zuckerberg in the film doesn't really know how to properly socialize in public and maybe it is in real life. But we all know all of it doesn't matter anymore, for he just founded the biggest and most influential social connector existing in our technological world today. Facebook is his outlet. I think it is part genius and part love, which in the last scene of the film tells you it is a social vindication out of a sullen admiration."

","Bit behind but still.. the film ""The Social Network"" annoys me, ""based on a true story"" that really made it seem (after multiple accusations) that Zuckerberg didn't steal the whole idea of facebook and that he really had it hard to get there. Who's to say the two people, supposedly trying to steal his idea in the film, didn't create it and the way they were portrayed as arrogant money-grabbers is unfair, who's to say Zuckerberg wasn't the idea thief, the arrogant money grabber. Whom, now he has all the money decides to further discredit the other two by funding a film about himself. He's already proved himself as the arrogant one."

","I just saw this movie at a screening in Chicago, IL and was so drawn into the story. Jesse Eisenburg, Andrew Garfield, and even Justin Timberlake gave superb performances. I was pleasantly surprised with the storytelling itself. Despite many critics saying Zuckerberg is portrayed in a negative light throughout the movie I found myself pulling for him, caring for the character and even feeling badly for him at times. Which is just silly when facebook is worth at least $25billion. I believe it was Eisenberg who gave such a great performance who make me like Zuckerberg so much. Bravo to everyone involved."

","I wasn't all that impressed with ""The Social Network."" I didn't buy the whip-smart dialog and the rapid-fire conversations. I thought the script was way too showy, and too clever by half. I've heard Mark Zuckerberg speak. He's not that articulate and he is definitely not that spontaneous. I also tend to believe that his characterization, while unflattering, was very likely not unflattering enough.<br/><br/>More incredulously, the movie portrayed him and those around him as cool geniuses, untouchable by us mere mortals. Indeed, it presented the high-tech milieu as if it was an endless array of wild parties and ecstasy-fueled dance raves. Nothing could be further from the truth. I think you would get a more accurate depiction of Silicon Valley life from watching ""The Revenge of the Nerds,"" for what it's worth.<br/><br/>Some high marks for the score and the cinematography are in order, and the pacing and direction are competent enough. It will be interesting to see what happens to this movie, once the level of interest in Facebook subsides, and the next big thing in cyberspace comes along. My sense is that it will be seen as nothing more than a dated artifact whose once great significance will seem quite mysterious to future audiences."
"jlg310","10","8","16","3 October 2010"," The Price of Success
","Well, I certainly wasn't all that excited about The Social Network when I first heard about it. A movie about a Web site that was founded by an obnoxious twenty-something sounds awful on paper. Even the dynamic duo of director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin didn't generate all that much enthusiasm from yours truly. But three phenomenal trailers later, and I couldn't wait to see this film. It helped that early reviews compared it to Citizen Kane and The Godfather, among other all-time greats. So does it live up to the hype? The short answer is YES! It's a very compelling film about the time in which we live and a man who impacted our time greatly. He's not the most pleasant hero, but his story makes for two incredible hours of cinema, and all those involved should be proud.<br/><br/>While this film certainly is more than just ""the Facebook movie,"" it still is, first and foremost, about the founding of the irritatingly inescapable social networking site. In 2003, Harvard student and computer whiz Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) was dumped by his girlfriend, Erica (Rooney Mara), an event that ended up changing the Internet and turning Zuckerberg into a billionaire. But that certainly didn't happen overnight.<br/><br/>After his breakup with Erica, Mark went home and drowned his sorrows online, writing some demeaning blog posts about his now ex-girlfriend and creating a site called ""Facemash,"" which asked users to choose the hotter of two female Harvard students. The site crashed the Harvard network almost instantly and attracted the attention of the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler (Armie Hammer), popular and athletic twin brothers who are looking for a programmer to create a site they came up with, The Harvard Connection, which will allow Harvard students to connect with one another on the Internet.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg agrees to work with them, but instead, he goes to his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) with a similar idea—The Facebook. Essentially, it's like MySpace, but exclusive. Only students with a Harvard e-mail address will be able to use it. Once launched, The Facebook becomes a hit. Everyone at Harvard is using about it, and Mark and Eduardo are the most talked-about students on campus. Once The Facebook expands, it attracts the attention of Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), party boy extraordinaire and founder of Napster. Sean wants this project to succeed, but his ideas drive a rift between Mark and Eduardo. This rift eventually becomes permanent, and the latter sues the former, who is also facing a lawsuit from the twins he screwed over years ago.<br/><br/>I've always been a big fan of Aaron Sorkin's fast, smart dialogue. The man knows how to grab your attention with his words, and his work here might just be better than anything he has ever done. But even more than the exceptional dialogue, the way he crafts his story is just masterful. The Social Network is so many things that giving it a label is almost impossible. It's a drama, a coming-of-age character study, an examination of entrepreneurship and the things that often get tossed aside in the endless quest for more, and a look at who we are as a society in the digital age. This film succeeds because of a number of things, but in my opinion, number one on that list would be Aaron Sorkin.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg is an absolute fascinating character played brilliantly by Jesse Eisenberg. I really didn't think the young actor capable of a performance like this, but he's great. This is a man who is completely driven, but he's not driven as to make money as one might expect. Instead, the currency he seeks is status. And while he obtains a kind of superficial acceptance (thanks to Parker), he never gets what he desperately wants. In fact, everything he does moves him further and further away from true acceptance. Eisenberg pulls of all the complex layers of Zuckerberg exquisitely. He's a fighter, energized at the prospect of finally being ""cool."" But by the end of the film, he seems exhausted just being him—almost as if he knows he has defeated himself. I think this will be the defining performance of Eisenberg's career, as he is another big reason the film succeeds. I also think he's a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Eisenberg's costars are uniformly excellent, especially Andrew Garfield. He has a scene near the end of the film in which he confronts his former best friend, and he's just dynamite. It's what gives the film an emotional pull (the proceedings until that point were, for the most part, a little distant). In this scene, things become clearer and we recognize Eduardo as this story's tragic hero and Mark and Sean as its villains (though again, credit Eisenberg for making Mark a somewhat sympathetic villain). This scene just might land Garfield, who's taking the reins from Tobey Maguire in the Spider-Man franchise, an Oscar nomination, and he just might be there on Oscar night with none other than Justin Timberlake, who's got just the right amount of charm to make Sean Parker tolerable to watch. He's a scoundrel, no doubt, but Timberlake makes him a magnetic presence on screen.<br/><br/>There will be those who debate the veracity of events in The Social Network as filmgoers debate the truth behind any film that's based on real events. What can't be debated is this film's expert craftsmanship. Sorkin and Fincher, with the help of a handful of perfectly cast actors, craft a tale that works on a number of different levels. It tells the story of a conflicted and fascinating young man while also outlining the rise of perhaps THE company of the Internet age and showing us what an obsession with social status can drive us to do. It doesn't matter if you use Facebook or not, The Social Network will sweep you up completely from beginning to end."

"cultfilmfan","10","7","14","3 October 2010"," The Social Network
","The Social Network is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich and follows Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg as he creates what is now one of the most visited websites and forms of social networking ever entitled Facebook.The film shows the socially awkward and acid tongued Mark Zuckerberg as he creates the website and after time he keeps getting more and more members signing up and joining it and after it becomes a big success that is when the different lawsuits come out. I am not a particularly really tech friendly person. I know how to use parts of a computer and the internet, but if you were to ask me to build a website from scratch, design anything, or anything to do with coding I am completely lost. The Social Network does talk about how they create the site and some big technical words may come your way, but it is not the whole film and doesn't leave those who are unfamiliar with it confused and not able to get into what is going on in the film. There is so much I absolutely loved and adored about The Social Network that I will try and remember it all and get it into this review. First off the direction is great. Yes this is a Hollywood big budget movie, but it does not feel like one. Because the film itself is pretty dark the atmosphere and mood set by the director is more low key and has a haunting and at times macabre look to it that suits the going on happenings of the characters around. When, I talk about this I do not mean to say that The Social Network is a horror film, but instead that in other ways it is disturbing and very dark and the dim lighting and use of what I guess would be fluorescent lights to give some scenes a haunting glow, I thought was pulled off perfectly and set the tone for the film really well. The script to the film is amazing for several reasons. It takes a true life story that in the hands of another director, or script writer could have become a fairly unoriginal biopic, but instead it breathes life and there is so much energy here. The characters, or at least a lot of them in the film have very rich vocabularies and they tend to talk very fast, but just listening to some of these conversations is fascinating because of the quick wit of some of the characters and what they say as well as some of the awkwardness around it as well because a lot of these characters have very poor social skills (is that why they created a social networking site?). The script which goes back and forth from the characters at school to talking with the lawyers during the lawsuit is all absolutely fascinating and with the quick jump cut editing it feels fresh, alive and something that we do not see all that often. The acting from Jesse Eisenberg who plays Mark Zuckerberg is a brilliant performance because of his smug arrogance as well as his sharp wit and acid tongued speech to his social awkwardness. It's all here in this performance and it's great. At the same time all of the supporting characters do a great job as well. The Social Network not only looks at the creation of one of the biggest and most profitable websites of all time, but also shows the decline of today's youth. The teenagers and young adults that are portrayed in the film all have huge egos and are really egocentric, narcissistic and nihilistic. They care for themselves and themselves only and in some ways will do whatever it takes to succeed. In it's own way, perhaps the creation of Facebook has led to some of this. Instead of talking to a friend, or family member on the phone, you now all do it on Facebook and you lose that sense of personal touch and the relationship to the person. The conversations one has on the internet or cell phones is a lot different than it used to be and illiteracy and bad grammar and English skills are on the rise and is some of these sites to blame? The film also looks at these dangerously empty lives of these young adults who try and fill in what is missing with drugs, alcohol, sex and money, but we see that they are never really happy and continue to lead an empty existence. The film is a brilliant character study in that way. I found myself loving The Social Network from close to the beginning right up to the end and the film lingered with me. I thought about it and what I would tell others and say in this review about it. The film is powerfully and masterfully made with an enormous amount of talent behind it. Mark my words in years and decades from now The Social Network will still be watched and talked about by a lot of people and will go down in history as one of the best films of all time. The way it captures the mood and feel of today's youth is brilliant and is a real eye opener while being tremendously entertaining at the same time. This is one of the best films I have seen in quite awhile and I think it is safe to say also that it is one of the best films I have ever seen."

","I hated this movie, didn't even finish watching it, because it just got on my nerves. I think the purpose was to show Zuckerberg and other characters as genius greedy money obsessed and cold opportunistic people. However, it just looked kinda stupid, all those intellectual duels, they could have been fun if the characters had a bit more emotion, but they just turn out boring and stupid. nobody is like that in real life. not even those goldman sachs people when they were being drilled in court behave in this way (and they're as cold and money obsessed as it can be). Mark is a nice relaxed guy, come on... give the kid a break, stop trying to hard to make him a inhuman genius."
"griffolyon12","10","5","9","13 October 2010"," All He Wants to be is Somebody
","What's the point of being rich if you have no friends? The opening credits of The Social Network play over a scene of future Facebook co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg) solitarily running across the Harvard campus, passing socializing college kids without a second glance from Zuckerberg. Mark has just been broken up with by this beautiful girl because Mark could not understand the concept of human relationships. All Mark wants to be is somebody, and he gets that wish, if nothing else, in the end.<br/><br/>The Social Network tells the story of the founding of the now famous social networking website, Facebook, and all of the lawsuits and broken relationships it took to create the source of friendships for the 21st century. In a way, writer Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher have crafted a modern day Shakespearean tragedy. No, there is no murder, but there is a ton of backstabbing. Nowadays, we don't need to kill to usurp power, we just need money, and more of it. Whether Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook from some collegiate athletes wanting to make a Harvard dating website or not, this is all irrelevant, the bottom line is, Zuckerberg, like all great tragic heroes, made the wrong alliances (Sean Parker, founder of Napster) and alienated his only real friend (Eduardo Saverin, co-founder of Facebook and former CFO).<br/><br/>Actor Andrew Garfield plays Eduardo Saverin with such an emotional range, that I would say Garfield's performance is the heart of the movie. You feel for Eduardo being phased out of the company by his one and only friend and Zuckerberg's new ""so-called friend"" Sean Parker, played surprisingly well by Justin Timberlake in fantastic acting form. The true reason Eduardo is phased out is never really explained, maybe Mark was always jealous that Eduardo was more popular than he, or that Sean felt threatened by Eduardo's business prowess. The worst part is, and this is what really makes The Social Network a tragedy, is that Mark spent so many hours working on his computer with headphones on, tuning out the rest of the world, that he never listened to reason and lost his only legitimate friend. This turn towards pathos in the final scenes of the movie are played exceptionally well by Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. With just one look, Eisenberg manages to convey a range of unsaid emotions, that while he is still talking like the world's biggest socially awkward jerk, he knows what he's lost.<br/><br/>I give The Social Network a 10 out of 10!"
"dfranzen70","6","5","9","9 October 2010"," Over-hyped
","he Social Network, about the intrigue surrounding the founding of the fantastically popular website Facebook (perhaps you've heard of it), is a fine film – but not a great one. That's a little disappointing, considering that David Fincher (Seven, Zodiac, Fight Club) is the director, but the movie isn't much more than a run-of-the-mill history movie about a subject matter – websites – that's not particularly compelling.<br/><br/>In 2003, Harvard undergrad Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg, Zombieland) creates a quickie site called Facemash, which takes head shots of female coeds and puts them side by side, allowing male users to rate which one is more attractive. This crashes the Harvard network and brings him to the attention of one of the many posh elite clubs on campus, whose leaders (the Winklevoss twins) ask Mark to create a social networking site for them, but open only to Harvard students.<br/><br/>This in turn leads Mark to create Facebook itself, rather than the Harvard-oriented site. It also sets off a chain of events that would eventually make Mark a billionaire, albeit one sued by not only the twins but by his own best friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), the company's CFO.<br/><br/>The movie's how-it-all-came-together theme is interspersed with legal proceedings – both sets – that put everything into a sort of current context. What caused Eduardo and Mark to be at odds? Do the twins have a chance of defeating Mark? And how does Sean Parker of Napster (Justin Timberlake) fit into all of this?<br/><br/>More than 500 million people use Facebook presently. It's no longer a haven limited to college students. My mom's on it. If my grandparents were alive, they'd be on it as well. It's a hugely successful tool in so many ways – small businesses can use it to keep in touch with their customers, friends can find their friends anywhere in the world, people can catch up with old classmates, and so on. It's highly intuitive and very user friendly, and it's all free.<br/><br/>Making a movie about a website can't be easy. A website isn't three dimensional; it's not exhilarating to watch someone create one. The Social Network is simply not an exciting movie, although it tries really hard to be one. It attempts to show that the intrigue and back stabbing that occurred behind the scenes of its rapid rise into the zeitgeist is riveting, fascinating stuff. But when the movie was over, I didn't know much more about Mark Zuckerberg than I did going in to the theater, and what I learned about Facebook itself was just trivia.<br/><br/>On top of that, the legal stuff that's always in the background is just dull, no matter how many snide answers Zuckerberg gives to opposing counsel. We're not talking about the Scopes monkey trial here.<br/><br/>On the plus side, we do get a terrific performance from Eisenberg, who shows he's not just another schlubby always-a-victim actor; the role has some real heft to it, and he's amazingly up to the challenge, particularly with the rapid patter that always seems to be coming from Zuckerberg's mouth.<br/><br/>Other than that, though, this is almost a generic origin story about a subject that's really not interesting enough to warrant a full-length movie."

It's an omnipresent, surveillance-based global software that relies enormously on the sharing of ""content"" for which it, nor consumers ever pay. This film, although handled with excellent balance and dramatic treatment, and no shortage of wit, seems to make no mention of the fact that our best journalists, artists, musicians, documentarians, animators and designers are paid nothing ($0.00) for a media sharing platform that earns nearly 40 billion dollars a year in revenue, and directs United States government policy-making, and collects all your personal data for marketing algorithms and public surveillance.<br/><br/>The image of Zuckerberg in his hooded sweater grinning naively with a soft-drink in hand is actually the sound of the Western arts and media economy being flushed down the toilet, and while there is ""an angle"" to this film, it makes little sense for any thinking individual to respect it's purported ""little guy makes good"" myth."

I have no idea what any of equations or algorithms mean, or how to write script. Maybe I'm a little jealous because I never got to go to college parties as glamorous as the ones in this film? Or maybe the problem is that the subject matter it just so banal that despite the quality of the production, this film is lost on me? I have a problem with this film that is so full of maybes. And yet for all its weaknesses, it won three Oscars, albeit one of them was for Baxter and Wall's editing, which is superb. Both editors have worked on numerous Fincher productions. <br/><br/>None of the actors are convincing at portraying the real people they are supposed represent. Maybe that's the point? They are attempting to play versions of Zuckerberg and Co. that seem more interesting than the real, live versions. I guess I see the reasoning behind this. As activities, creating companies, programming computers, or writing software, no matter how profound, aren't exactly as riveting as invading Bin Laden's compound, or smuggling blood diamonds out of Liberia. Still, I am no fan of Jesse Eisenberg. His success is baffling to me. He was for a while a Michael Cera impersonation gone wrong, now, whatever he is, he does it well. He sells tons of tickets but none of them are to me. The best part about this film is that it has Rooney Mara, briefly. Later she becomes Lisbeth in Dragon Tattoo.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing about this film is simply that it exists and was so successful. Rather, that a production company actually paid David Fincher to try and create a full-on thriller packed with betraying, greedy, snarky little boys either getting their way, or losing millions of dollars. Poor babies. Even if in the end Zuckerberg did create something monumental, so what. It's just a monument to a monument. What does any of this represent? How does any of this change the world?

In fact, if you were to make a movie about an annoying geek, Eisenberg would definitely fit the bill and I'm not sure he is very far off from that character.

Progressively, his character traits extend to a reckless million dollar entrepreneur of an unparalleled success concept of social media.

"MartinHafer","7","7","15","30 March 2011"," Considering I am 'old' and a history teacher, this movie isn't exactly geared towards me...
","My review is best read and understood in context. I am 46 years-old (and in the Facebook world, that makes me OLD) and an ex-history teacher, so what I liked and disliked about the film is not what the average viewer would think. This isn't meant as an insult--just that I know I am not like the typical demographic for whom the movie was made. I am very computer-savvy for my age--but that still makes me a dinosaur compared to a teenager or 30-something person. The fact that I have never had a Facebook account alone makes me an odd-ball! So, when I see the film I do NOT wax nostalgic about the good 'ol days of 2004 or 2005. Additionally, as a history teacher, I CRAVE accuracy in films and tend to nit-pick them far more than normal. For me, history is like the Bible--you don't embellish it or 'interpret' it--is IS truth. So, a younger person seeing the film with me would find me insufferable, as I would look for the flaws and ignore the bigger picture.<br/><br/>So, I did some research and found that the film makers did NOT intend for a historical account of Facebook but wanted to craft an exciting story that people would love. And, to do so, personalities were changed and facts were omitted or ignored. My biggest problem is that in reading about Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, while he is no angel, nor does he seem to be (as the movie strongly implies) a sociopath with Asperger's Syndrome (I was also a psyc teacher...trust me on this--this is exactly as the film portrays him). And, although he is exciting to watch in the film, Justin Timberlake's version of the fonder of Napster isn't exactly spot-on, either.<br/><br/>So if you can ignore the artistic license, what are you left with in ""The Social Network""? Well, for 46 year-old guys like me, not a huge amount--or at least not as much as I might have hoped based on all the publicity the film received. Yes, I liked it--but didn't love it. I liked some of the acting (again, I'll mention liking Justin Timberlake--something I NEVER thought I'd see myself putting in writing!) and the rest of the cast were good. I also loved the way the twins were magically created using computers and a single actor....cool. But the story didn't engage me that much. Yes, I know they are all rich as can be...but other than that I just didn't get it. And, as a middle-aged fart, I guess I wasn't intended to!"

","When I first saw the trailer to The Social Network during the premiere of Inception, I didn't know what to expect. My first thoughts were definitely something along the lines of ""really? they're making a movie about Facebook? How horrid!"". But then again, I was wrong to profile Scott Pilgrim's trailer as boring and not for me, so I gave The Social Network a try. I was glad I did.<br/><br/>Celebrated Fight Club director David Fincher takes a look at this story (who better to guide you through a tale of friends and foes, and really, alienation). The movie is fast paced throughout; there is not a dull moment I can pick out after freshly seeing it. The development of the Facebook project is well blended with the development of the lawsuits against Zuckerberg- played by a keen Jesse Eisenberg who really delivers a top-notch performance as the world's youngest billionaire, something that could even be (dare I say it?) Oscar worthy. His co-stars Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake deliver great acting as well, which in Timberlake's case is merit worthy as it disproves the usual theory that not one soul in the music industry can act well.<br/><br/>Fincher's beautiful way of telling a story, his unique way of telling a side plot rowing tournament for example, and his great flow of story and cinematography (along with the great direction/acting) make the Social Network a pleasing tale that you'll most likely want to see more than once; a pleasing tale that you'll most likely become a fan of on Facebook."
"somf","9","9","21","24 September 2010"," Terrific and Thought Provoking
","With 10 films up for Best Picture these days I think it is a pretty safe bet that it will get a nod, but back in the days of 5 nominees I would really doubt it unless the winter crop of Oscar Contenders is a big disappointment. Personally the only two films that I have seen this year that I enjoyed more were Inception and Animal Kingdom ( I have not yet seen the Town.), but as I said before I expect to see several more terrific films during the next 4 months.<br/><br/>I am not a huge Fincher fan. I have liked every single one of his films. I have loved none of them. This is now my favorite Fincher film. Since Zodiac he has really made fantastic looking films, and this continues that trend. Panic Room was my favorite film of his prior to this, though I am sure I am in a minority there.<br/><br/>Eisenberg should really got nominated. I haven't a clue if he can win, but he was brilliant. Every little nuanced scene he shined in. I really believed his character. It truly is his film.<br/><br/>I would like to see Andrew Garfield nominated for Best Supporting Actor as well. He is one of those guys that I know that I have seen in a few things to date, but I have never found him memorable. However; he does a wonderful job here and this should give his career a big boost.<br/><br/>I have always been surprised at how solid Justin Timberlake has been in his films to date, and he does a great job here too. Not as strong as either Garfield or Eisenberg though.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Sorkin was rock solid and will certainly get a nomination. You have to wonder how a story about Facebook is going to translate to the screen. The answer with all the talent involved is brilliantly.<br/><br/>The movie opens a sort of Tarantino type restaurant scene with Eisenberg and a girlfriend, prior to the credits. It sets the tone for the Zuckenberg character and lets the audience know that they are in for a fascinating ride.<br/><br/>One of the great successes of the film is to cause one to ponder just what an impact social networking has had on our society. It really has changed the way people interact with one another. And it is subtle but powerful. In my opinion as a man who lived through the last cultural upheaval (Hippies and Vietnam), this is not for the better.<br/><br/>One last thing I must mention. There are a very important set of twins in the story, and I thought these guys are really good. I wonder what else they have done. I was totally blown away when I found out that the two guys who played the twins are not even related in real life. I mean they looked exactly alike.<br/><br/>A lot of humor and a fascinating story. I love a good character study and this was certainly rock solid in that category."

","My guess is, 99% of the people who think that this movie is awesome, have facebook or at least no about it. My point is, if somebody with no knowledge whatsoever of Facebook went to see The Social Network, he or she would just have found it dead boring. Though I do know about Facebook, I found it dead boring. I don't understand how it could have win the Golden Globes Best movie. It's basically a pseudo-biographical movie (pseudo because it isn't even 80% accurate_100% being impossible). The acting was decent but the storyline didn't have anything special in it_except of course if you are one of those Facebook-addict and find it interesting to understand where did this phenomenon came from. Cinematrographically, this movie deserve a 1/10. David Fincher definitely didn't show any of his filming talent in this one. What a shame.

"AstridX","5","5","10","29 January 2011"," The Social Nutwing
","The evidence is clear that Mark Zuckerberg (as portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg) could be the poster child for ADHD meds/treatment. Was there MORE to this film?, I thought. Yes, indeed. ""The Social Network"" became more complex and interesting when it got beyond the initial geeky clutter. The individuals who played significant roles in MZ's life and work make the facebook-creation story pretty amazing. Yes, he is an a**hole but the movie isn't just about him. From his ex-girlfriend (played by Rooney Mara) to the Harvard faculty, early fb investors, and the MZ/fb groupies, this IS a remarkable story.<br/><br/>To wit: I think Justin Timberlake did a superb acting job as the developer of Napster as he portrays the greedy, self-centered Silicon Valley ""dude"" with obnoxious aplomb. His involvement in facebook's development hilariously brings out the cheesy side of Zuckerberg. Good stuff.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" watched in its entirety proves worthwhile. And, of course, David Fincher is an excellent director who makes sense and order of the many elements that resulted in the ever-controversial social media menace known as facebook."

It was dramatized. So it's not very dramatic in real life when Zuckerberg created ""FaceBook"".<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of dialog and that is not a flaw. The dialog is too deep and the tempo of the dialog is too fast. It's not very easy to understand but it was overwhelming + amazing.<br/><br/>The acting was great.

Film editing, directing, sound, music, sets etc etc 100%. And here's the thing....if you are not of the 'Facebook' generation then you don't really get it...until you see this film and boy, because it is nearly 2011, you really need to understand this thing that 'happens once in a generation (or two)'. The creation of Facebook emerges from a story as old as the hills, intelligent genius of a guy about to be taken advantage of by over privileged brothers and a friend who can 'buy' anything they want - but can they.....? Nope, not when they met a guy who is always going to be one step ahead of the game. Of course it was his idea and his baby and the film aptly shows that genius overrides limited ideas..the idea of Facebook probably had been floating and yes, it was up for grabs, but Zuckerberg was the mind and the creator end of story. There is a whole secondary story of class, privilege and Ivy League college fraternities but rightly so, the film takes you to the real issue - business and that is where the film is in two halves. I urge anyone of 'a certain age' to go and see The Social Network - it is relevant and educational and certainly the film delivers the story in an accomplished way."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","3","5","21 October 2010"," David Fincher has proved that even a movie about the dawn of a social networking website can be interesting
","Despite being a user of Facebook.com, I must admit I had some apprehensions about going to see ""The Social Network."" Even though Facebook is an internet phenomenon and even though there is plenty of history and conflict that went into the making of the multibillion-dollar website, I wasn't exactly ecstatic about seeing a movie about it. A cyberspace network can be addicting in the sense that you can talk to your friends in silence and such and according to an article in Forbes last year, Facebook is estimated to be worth nearly eight million dollars, but just how interesting would we expect a movie about it to be? Well, director David Fincher has taken the story behind this incredibly popular website, the stories of the people who created it, and weaved a movie that runs about twenty minutes too long, but is still quite engaging.<br/><br/>As the movie starts out, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a nerdy, pompous computer brainiac has been dumped by his girlfriend and in a fit of stomach-stomped rage, decides to humiliate her in cyberspace via a blog and a new website in which female Harvard students are ranked in terms of how physically attractive they are. His trouble-raising prank catches the attention of three other students, who want his collaboration in producing a new social networking website, which would later evolve into a multibillion-dollar phenomenon, and the source for vicious, friendship-splitting conflicts.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is really held up strong by its creative forces. Mostly because of the skills of director David Fincher, who I am predicting will finally win an Academy Award next February and will most definitely be one of the five nominees. Every single shot of this motion picture shows his craftsmanship and technical prowess. He also shows that he knows how to pace what might otherwise be dull sequences, by having them whip along quickly but still registering an effect. He also has very good actors in his cast. Jesse Eisenberg plays his character in an autistic, withheld manner; a young man torn apart inside but only revealing it under the most dire of circumstances. Armie Hammer was digitally integrated into many shots so that he could play the twin Winklevoss brothers and he magnificently generates two separate characters. Also credit the digital effects artists and the makeup department for making him look like two different people; I was thinking really hard if I had ever heard of Hammer's twin brother until I saw the ending credits. Joseph Mazzello also makes his biggest film since ""Jurassic Park"" as the brothers' jealousy-stricken comrade. Andrew Garfield is charismatic and generates sympathy with his performance and Justin Timberlake chews up every scene he's in as Sean Parker, another networking maestro. There's also a small part by Rooney Mara as Zuckerberg's ex-girlfriend and she does a wonderful job as well.<br/><br/>It is the combination of these talents that overcome some of the movie's shortcomings. Looking back on ""The Social Network"" I do still feel that it would have done better as a television miniseries, for that is the sort of feeling it generates. There just is not the firm, glue-applied narrative structure that typically builds the foundation for a movie. As such, about twenty minutes of the picture sort of drags. I must also confess that I only really cared for the characters because the strong performances and the spins the actors threw on them. Save for Timberlake, none of them had any really likable or three-dimensional characters to work on. In addition, the screenplay is a little jumbled, at times making it hard to determine at what point in time we are now setting ourselves. It flashes back and forth too quickly and a straight storyline would have been better.<br/><br/>It's not, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the year, but ""The Social Network"" is still a movie very much worth seeing. Part of the reason is that I am still amazed that anybody, even somebody like David Fincher (""Se7en"") could make a subject as seemingly droll as this become lively and animated. I have no doubt that this movie will be be on the ballot lists for the Academy Awards next year and that its many overlooked talents will finally get the recognition they deserve."

","The Social Network is a decent enough movie to waste a couple hours watching with a couple friends. The lead actor (sorry I forget his name already) did a very good job, I also liked him in the other movies I've seen him in. The movie's just okay and boring at times (hey what do you expect from a movie that is entirely about the guys who invented a social networking website) but it's much better than I feared it would be and totally worth seeing. No reason you need to see it on the big screen though, I'd say catch something else that's more fun and rent this down the road on DVD or catch it on pay per view or whatever, worth seeing but nothing special. The acting's pretty good, even Justin Timberlake is okay though he is obviously the weakest link of the actors in this, but at times the story drags and they talk about stuff that wouldn't interest most people. The movie's also a bit too long. Worth a watch."

","An extremely well told story that would've dragged or fallen apart in any other format. It's very compelling and it certainly keeps your attention all the way through and that's no small task considering the subject matter and the fact that it's all depositions and flashbacks. There are remarkable performances all the way around. The reason this film stubs its toe is the fact that it's the story of a correctly labeled A-hole becoming the world's youngest billionaire. The opening scene delivers the line that people don't hate him because he's a nerd, it's because he's an A-hole. Then, the writers of the film take the next two hours to basically prove that point. They close with a line that says he's actually not an A-hole but is trying to be. Well, if a character tries hard enough, he is indeed an A-hole. And, it's tough to pull for or take a journey with an A-hole on screen. I honestly don't know if this tale should be taken as real life fact but as a film, it's hard to spend two hours disliking a lead even if the story is remarkably interesting.<br/><br/>It's a solid technical film and often quite smart but emotionally and sometimes as entertainment, it falls short. Critics and apparently some fans are blowing this film far in to the land of overrated."

"secondtake","7","2","3","26 September 2012"," This history of Facebook is exciting--for a awhile. Lots of filler here & great script, great acting.
","The Social Network (2010)<br/><br/>The rise of Facebook is so sensational in terms of money and culture, a movie about it was inevitable, and it came early in the game. Appropriately. Everything is speeded up in this world, and who knows why turn might make Facebook the next AOL or Nokia. <br/><br/>And so it is quite the story. I don't think it's such a great movie in movie-making terms, however, and this flies in the face of a lot of critical acclaim. Beyond the main story line, there are lots of party and social scenes that are meant to display the changing lifestyles of the main characters (much of which is openly inaccurate). These are prolonged enough to lose their point, and after a few of them, they lose their initial interest, too. They are really meant to serve as interesting ways to have dialog about the stellar rise in members and money involved with Facebook. <br/><br/>Because of course there is no action in a movie like this. It's mostly dialog. It's about ideas and numbers and watching computer screens. We are led through the initial moments of inspiration, possible intellectual theft, and good luck at the beginning of Zuckerberg's rise. But there are only so many aspects to this rise that can hold interest for us. It is pinned together through a more recent scene in a well appointed briefing room, as a couple of the leading characters give testimony about who really started Facebook. Flashbacks fill up the rest of the film.<br/><br/>What to miss? The long and overly filmic rowing scenes (part of which were partly scale models, actually). What not to miss? The lead, deadpan performance by Jesse Eisenberg and the really moving performance that steals every scene he's in by Andrew Garfield. Justin Timberlake is good, too, and will be a separate draw for some. The twins turn out to not be twins--quite incredibly, a body double was the second twin and the face of the first actor was digitally inserted into the second one. Crazy stuff.<br/><br/>The writing is superb. Aaron Sorkin is key here, making some of the dialog really virtuosic (including the first scene, a dialog in a bar between Zuckerberg and his would be never will be girlfriend, which took 99 takes, all shot with the legendary digital Red camera). The filming, as such, is really good in a functional way, and with the experienced Jeff Cronenweth in charge (he did minor flicks like ""Fight Club"" and the American ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""). And Cronenweth is one of director's David Fincher's big reasons for success.<br/><br/>Fincher is a terrific director, and you might say he made the most of a story with little real substance. But I'm not sure that's true. I just saw ""Moneyball"" a second time last week and it holds up really well even though it generally lacks what you would call action, too, and was written in part by Aaron Sorkin as well. I think Moneyball, whatever its defects, is a better movie. Both movies are about contemporary society and the changing way we use computers, and the way people behind the scenes have made this true.<br/><br/>Facebook is a story we are all destined to be affected by, whether you learn of it through the movie or elsewhere. Many people are just totally gaga about the crazy amount of money involved, the movie clicks. The title of the book this was based on is perfect--The Accidental Billionaires. So true. For me, though, I'm like Zuckerberg himself. I just don't care about money, and so the main draw in scene after scene was missing. Judge for yourself."

","As several of the actors and filmmakers comment in the DVD extra, this is NOT a movie about Facebook, that would be 4th or 5th on the list of things it is ""about."" As they go on to explain, it really is about college friends, how that friendship shaped the creation of social networks, and how ambition and disagreements led to lawsuits.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg is Mark Zuckerberg in college at Harvard, a programming genius who was also a social misfit. It seems that the real Zuckerberg is either quite different from that, or he has blossomed quite well in the 7 or so years since the period this movie covers. But Eisenberg does a good job, and he is of course bound by the script, which is very interesting, and what the director wanted in the way of a portrayal. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is good as Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's close friend and co-founder of Facebook as its CFO and 30% partner. The movie portrays Saverin's getting into a Harvard organization as the catalyst for Zuckerberg's eventual snubbing of Saverin, an idea that Zuckerberg says is totally fabricated. <br/><br/>Justin Timberlake is also good as the Napster guy who ends up influencing Zuckerberg's moving to California, and getting at odds with Saverin.<br/><br/>As the story is developed in a rather linear time line, it also often cuts forward to the time when depositions were being taken and various parties were suing Zuckerberg for theft of ideas and breach of contracts. The film is accurate from the point of view that it reflects the testimonies and statements faithfully, but as Zuckerberg says in the movie, people lie under oath. Still, it is a matter of record that he paid $Millions as a result of the suits, but he is still the youngest Billionaire. <br/><br/>Very interesting movie, we will probably never know the truth. But it isn't possible to visit your Facebook page and look at it the same way after seeing this movie."

First of all even though this film is about the creation of Facebook I don't think it depends on it's existence or popularity and in fact I'd even argue it will be meaningfull and remebered for more time then Facebook itself. The acting in the film is all great and I really like the fact that it's great despite the fact that half the characters aren't very likeable. The cinematography is really good with the movie being visualy beautiful but what in my opinion is the best part of the movie is simply the story, I adore it, it's very interesting and I also liked how it's presented with flashbacks, the ending is also one of my favourites of all time.
Also the movie's score is really good and even feels scary or disturbing at times wich I'm not sure if it was intended or not but nontheless I really like it.

"ethanj-41027","8","1","1","11 May 2020"," 21st Century Gold
","The Social Network (2010) - [8/10]<br/><br/>I am really close to review this as a 9/10. The Social Network (2010) is a fantastic film. I am a huge fan of David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin, and this film fuels the admiration I have for them. Fincher directs masterfully in this horrific biopic, coupled with Sorkin's elegant dialogue. Without Sorkin, the film wouldn't work. Without Fincher, the film wouldn't work. Two masters work together to create an amazing film. I really would like to give this film a higher rating, but there are a couple things holding me back. In my opinion, it lacks something spectacular. Whether that be from the emotional detachment of the main character(s) or the fact that some scenes feel unneeded, I think it misses something that could have made it perfect. One scene in particular was very strange. It involves a CG, but not CG, effect during a boat race. When I look back on this scene, in terms of the rest of the story, it's really out of place (the music choice is also quite strange). Thinking about it more, it's still very important for multiple reasons. So it feels out of place, yet deeply important... very conflicting ideas. Another issue I had, and it's actually part of why I like the film, is the pacing. For the most part, The Social Network (2010) is extremely fast paced. Dialogue races by with each shot. There are scenes that are short, but sweet with excellent cutting. But, because it is so fast (and complex), you can get lost in what is happening. Some of the most important scenes happen very fast and it's hard to digest, analyze, and remember everything. This is also a positive for The Social Network (2010). The fact that you need to watch it multiple times to pick up on every little complexity is genius (Sorkin is a master in that way). This was the fourth time I watched the film and, don't get me wrong, I really love it. I think it's one of the best biographical films that has been made, and its message is just as powerful - if not more powerful, today. The acting is exceptional (especially from our leads, Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield) but, there is quite a big emotional disconnect between this film and the audience (at least for me anyways). This is a result from our lead character, Mark Zuckerberg - played by Jesse Eisenberg, who just isn't likable. In fact, he is the villain of this story (rather one of them). For the most part we're against him, morally and legally. The only likable character is Eduardo Saverin - played by Andrew Garfield but, he is the supporting character (I could actually make an argument that he is the main character of the story and very well should be, but I digress). I think because of the choice to have only one hero, who is a supporting character, this film loses all the emotion it could have generated. The moments where Garfield stands in the spotlight are highly emotional, and I applaud his performance. It was really rewarding to see Garfield's talent when a great director utilizes it. I've always believed that he is one of the most underrated actors of this generation and if more directors see his potential, he could be one of the greats (similar to Adam Driver). Eisenberg is excellent in this film. He perfectly portrays an unapologetic, selfish jerk - alongside Justin Timberlake. Eisenberg is emotionless, and fits Zuckerberg's character perfectly. He is extremely detached from humanity and human emotion, yet he makes founds social media phenomenon that strives for human connection. It is so compelling, and Eisenberg makes it so. The cinematography of this film is stark, detached, and formulaic - just like it should be. The editing is fast paced, but sacrifices slow, emotional moments for orchestral dialogue. The writing is exceptional (and one of the reasons I want this film to be a 9/10). This film features one of the greatest scripts that was ever made. David Fincher directs with meaning, mastery, and minimalism. In the end, I really think the biggest problem this film faces is emotion. It tries desperately to conjure emotions (albeit it is able to conjure negative ones very easily), as seen with the very last scene of the film, but fails to do so in the long run. The Social Network (2010) is one of the greatest films released in the 21st century and is a must see for anybody that has ever heard the name, Facebook."
"realalbertbarrios","10","1","1","2 May 2020"," The simple story turned into an extraordinary film.
","Intelligent, funny, and energetic. The Social Network is a spectacular film that David Fincher flawlessly crafts. This is probably the only film that I've given 10 stars and the film is just dialogue. The film is exciting with each line of dialogue. Jessie Eisenberg portrays Mark Zuckerberg as a smart, witty, and hilarious man who begins making his network without knowing how much money this network would make. The music is used cleverly and the editing is constantly extraordinary. Andrew Garfield also is wonderful and he gives an extraordinary performance near the end. The film is two hours and it never feels slow. I could even watch another half an hour of the film. It never is uneventful. It keeps your adrenaline pumping. They are able to tell a story that offers more than just dialogue. David Fincher directed this film with much care and I appreciate him for that. I hope I can watch more of his films soon. (I have only seen Seven and this film). Overall, The Social Network works and it takes a simple ordinary story and makes it better than any other film."

","The Social Network is incredibly intelligent and engaging. It has a great cast and a very strong screenplay.<br/><br/>The movie is about college student Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) who, with the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin ( Andree Garfield), creates the global phenomenon Facebook. The story is framed around two lawsuits against Mark, one from the Winklevoss twins (Arnie Hammer) and Eduardo himself. Justin Timberlake plays the playboy character of Shaun Parker, he does such a good job I really hated him at the end.<br/><br/>The actors do a great job in this film. Jesse Eisenberg delivers his lines with speed and sarcasm, which is very entertaining to watch. Andrew Garfield is also fantastic, he brings a vulnerability to his character and makes the friendship between the two leads believable. Arnie Hammer is playing two versions of himself yet each of them feels distinct.<br/><br/>The music stands out as well. It perfectly matches each scene and is tonally accurate.
The dialogue is written by Aaron Sorkin, who is known for his snappy screenplays. This film is no exception, it really elevates the movie and makes it more exciting. The pacing is quick, it moves along without feeling rushed or too long. The themes of fame and wealth are profound and subtle, adding a very important layer to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic movie. It has an excellent cast, a great screenplay, engaging story, good music and a good pace. I have no real complaints, I loved it."

","I personally really enjoyed The Social Network, it was able to tell the story of Facebook without becoming boring. When films are based around certain real life event they can sometimes be too scared to stray too far from the facts which can make the film end up being boring and too realistic (if people wanted that they would look for documentaries). The Social Network pretty much keeps to the story line of creating Facebook without feeling to much like a documentary.<br/><br/>The script/dialogue you can tell just by watching the first scene with Mark and his girlfriend, Erica. Jesse Eisenberg especially captures the tone/personality of his character just by his execution of his lines (fast pace).<br/><br/>I found the scenes where they were arguing in the meeting a little confusing and erratic but other than that this movie is able to keep to entertained while giving you real insight of the story of Facebook."

","To me, this film is perfection everything from the cinematography to the story is astounding I don't think there is anything you could do to improve it.

With a Sorkin script and stunning visuals as well as direction, this film is more indulgent than anything that I watched from the 2010s and would go as far as to say this is in my top 3 favourite films of all time.<br/><br/>As far as it goes for the soundtrack all I can say is that it is phenomenal, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross bring everything together (with In Motion being my favourite from the collection). Having watched this many times before and with my favourite scene since the beginning is the original hacking scene where they are creating Face Smash being possibly the best in the entire film.<br/><br/>It also the perfect amount of comedy and seriousness that has somehow bonded together extremely well. I can easily watch this film on repeat and no matter how many times I have seen it I will be able to watch it again.<br/><br/>For me, this is absolutely a 10/10 and I would go as far as to call it a masterpiece. (With Gone Girl being a very close second in terms of pacing and cinematography). And for it being a 9-year-old film it definitely holds up to any standards that there are today.<br/><br/>10/10"

"anselmdaniel","9","1","1","15 June 2019"," Embellished and solid movie
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Social Network is a biographical drama movie that premiered in 2010. The movie is directed by David Fincher. The movie is based on the book 'The Accidental Billionaires' by Ben Mezrich. The movie stars Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield. The movie is about the founding of Facebook and the subsequent lawsuits concerning the creation of Facebook.<br/><br/>David Fincher does an excellent job directing this movie. This is a solid movie that can embellish the truth of the founding of Facebook. It is a movie that absolutely does well in the presentation of the real-life events. 'The Social Network' is able to make the world revolves around Mark Zuckerberg and his executives feel incredibly real and authentic. This ability to craft the narrative to make the audience both sympathize and also despise the Facebook executives is a job well done by David Fincher. In addition the movie is well shot, edited, and staged. This is a great movie in the presentation. If you were to watch this for its presentation alone, the grade would be an A.<br/><br/>The acting by all of the stars are phenomenal. Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg does a great job in this role. I enjoyed his portrayal of the controversial Facebook founder. It makes for an interesting depiction of the founder, when the actor is able to show more emotion than their real-life counterpart. Likewise Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin does a good job. Although I do not see much of a resemblance to the real life counterpart, Andrew Garfield is able to portray the betrayal he suffers at the hands of Mark Zuckerberg with great conviction. It makes the earlier parts of the movie where they partnered harder to watch. Even many of the smaller supporting cast members do an admirable job in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie does embellish the truth which can make this appear to be a fatal flaw to some audiences. For most of them, the audience can accept this as a well told story. As with many biographical movies, the movie has to embellish the truth to be more satisfying narratively. The movie does feed into the negative opinion of Mark Zuckerberg which can be warranted depending on one's views.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'The Social Network.'<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"zkonedog","10","1","1","11 March 2017"," A Film Worthy Of Facebook
","An idea like Facebook is one that changed the world. It needed a film up to the par of that idea, and that's exactly what David Fincher provides here.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Social Network"" tells the story of Facebook's creation and subsequent legal battles. It is told primarily (via flashbacks) through the recollections of creator Mark Zuckerberg (Jessie Eisenberg) as he wades through the various lawsuits.<br/><br/>There are three areas in which this movie really shines:<br/><br/>1. Direction: There is no dull moment in this film. Fincher really keeps things hopping and upbeat, as befitting a movie about the greatest social invention perhaps of all time. Very deserving of his Oscar nomination, and I'd vote for him for the win.<br/><br/>2. Acting: Only in the best of movies can outside-the-box casting choices make you not feel as if they are out of place. For example, Brenda Song (known worldwide as the ditzy London Tipton of Disney Channel fame) plays essentially a ""Facebook groupie"", while Justin Timberlake has a small-ish role as Sean Parker, founder of Napster, who has a major influence on Zuckerberg in the Facebook development process. Remarkably, those thespians show no effects of typecasting and fit in seamlessly.<br/><br/>3. Ideas: Besides just a summary of Facebook's creation, the true genius behind this movie is the ideas/notions it stirs up. The definition of copyright, the creative process, and the definition of friendship are all themes that are swished around during the movie. No grand conclusions or black-and-white summations are given. Instead, it is left up to the viewer to decide on the ethics of what just transpired.<br/><br/>Thus, I consider ""The Social Network"" to be one of the better movies I've seen in the past few years. Facebook literally (for better or worse) changed the world, so there are very few people who won't be affected in some way by the film. I'm clicking the ""Like"" button on this one."

","When you first hear that a movie is going to be made about the creation of Facebook you don't think big things from it much less that it would be consider one of this generations masterpieces. Thought I wouldn't go as far as that I still love The Social Network and I think that it's a close second for David Finchers best film. After seeing this film I legitimately could not have seen someone else directing this film he just knows how to direct a movie his process of taking as many as takes as necessary works for this movie as it mirrors the themes of inventiveness and betrayal. This is arguably Jesse Eisenberg most icon role and it is for a reason he's just perfect in this movie his acting style matches perfectly with the character of Mark Zuckerberg who is a fascinating protagonist. Even though he isn't always the most likable character his say-things-as-they-are attitude makes him an intriguing and sometimes funny character that always captures the viewers attention. Most of the events of this film are shown through flashbacks and while that has been seen before it works perfectly for this films narrative and makes for some truly amazing editing. Aaron Sorkins screenplay is one of the best written of recent years it's a script that in some way relates to everyone we've all had something that we're good at in life and want to strive to be the best at, we've all had friends that we want to keep but can't because real life gets in the way all of this is addressed in The Social Networking making sure that everyone will in some way be able to connect with this film. The supporting cast are all fantastic in this film Andrew Garfield was worthy of at least an Oscar nomination in this film he bounces perfectly of Eisenberg and serves a reflection of the audience in this film. Justin Timberlake also really blew me away in this film he just is so good at playing his almost unlikable character and has never since been able to live up to this performance. <br/><br/>Overall The Social Network is a guaranteed classic that will forever be remembered by this generation as one of its most relatable movies and one of Finchers best efforts.<br/><br/>100%/A+"

","Have you ever wondered what a collaboration between all your favourite creative people would look and sound like? To be honest I had not - it's such an improbable event, the chances of such a thing happening are so remote, that it's not even worth thinking about... (Roll VT)...<br/><br/>I am sitting in the superb Grosvenor Cinema in Glasgow's West End about to enjoy the latest offering from David Fincher, 'The Social Network'. I know that it is scripted by Aaron Sorkin - he of West Wing fame - either one is a strong recommendation on its own, but both together bodes very well indeed, I am anticipating eagerly. Trigger Street Productions - ah, an unexpected bonus, my favourite actor of the 90's (and probably the other decades too) Kevin Spacey (Glengarry Glen Ross (92), Swimming With Sharks (94), Se7en (95), Usual Suspects (95), LA Confidential (97), American Beauty (99) - an incomparable body of work in such a short period) has produced, truly a stamp of quality.<br/><br/>Even now a full house has not even entered my head, and then the opening bars of the soundtrack creep from the speakers as the camera tracks up the stairs, only the first handful of notes are required, it's only Trent flaming Reznor who's written the soundtrack, prophet of an alternative generation and my touchstone for musical inspiration. Right from the opening lines you have to run to keep up. Sorkin's dialogue is as snappy and intelligent as the West Wing or Studio 60 ever were, it's nasty, smug, angry when it needs to be, but always, always, very, very clever. Who do you pick to write a script about a computer 'genius'? A scriptwriting genius of course.<br/><br/>The central performances are all good, Jesse Eisenberg in particular as the anti-hero Zuckerberg, excellently portrays a detached and somewhat bemused persona that I would imagine most computer 'geniuses' have, while Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake provide excellent foils for our 'hero's' single-minded petulance. The protagonists all have their faults and none of the characters elicited any sympathy in me. That's usually a cue to switch off, but 'The Social Network' transcends the characters and the plot, which is largely irrelevant, in the sense that we all know how the story ends (to this point at least). But the script holds everything together and I found it impossible to take my eyes off the screen.<br/><br/>On paper this is a turkey, a movie about an Internet billionaire and the contractual and legal fog that surrounded his success? It could not be a better example of what true genius can deliver to the screen. As a child, like most children, I used to think that the actors did all the work, and I wondered who all the other people in the credits were - if ever there was a lesson in how naive that childish view is it in the team that brought us 'The Social Network'."

","""The more time I spend with the tail end of Generation Facebook, the more convinced I become that the software currently shaping this generation is unworthy of them. They are more interesting than it is. They deserve better."" - Zadie Smith<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" with Wi-Fi, David Fincher's ""The Social Network"" watches as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg (Jesse Eisenburg) moves from hot-shot hacker to head of a sprawling media empire. Like Charles Foster Kane in Orson Welles' classic, Zuckerburg makes enemies, loses friends, and becomes increasingly isolated, even as his globally successful social-networking empire grows and blooms. Like ""Kane"", the film then ends with its own ""Rosebud"" moment, a sequence designed to ""explain"" the inner motivations of its lead. Here Zuckerburg sits at a computer, refreshing an internet page in the hopes that he's ""liked"" and ""befriended"" by Erica Albright, the one girl who got away.<br/><br/>Written by Aaron Sorkin, a writer renowned for his rapid-fire dialogue, ""Social"" plays like a slick, topic-of-the-week TV movie. Sorkin's style is meant to conjure up the works of Howard Hawks, and classics like ""Sweet Smell of Success"", ""Ace in The Hole"" and ""Force of Evil"", but the result is something else; more Coppola's ""Tucker"" or Scorsese's ""Aviator"", big biographies that don't realise how thin they really are.<br/><br/>Much of the film watches as Zuckerberg clashes with the Winklevoss twins, two wealthy Harvard students who hire Zuckerberg to create a social media site. Other scenes see Zuckerberg feuding with an ex-girlfriend (Rooney Mara), the girl who spurs him to hatefully create Facemash, a website which allows male students to rank and compare female students.<br/><br/>""Social's"" script was based on a bit of revenge fiction by Eduardo Saverin, a book which left out facts and was designed to both defame Zuckerberg and portray Saverin as a buddy betrayed. Fincher's film is kinder, but tells the same lies. It portrays Zuckerberg as a loner and Harvard outsider (and Autistic robot?), when the opposite was true. It portrays him as being a middle class guy amongst rich snobs, when Zuckerberg's family was fairly well connected. Strangely, the film completely removes all traces of Zuckerberg's Jewishness, and ignores how Jewish work ethics, support networks and familial bonds influenced and spurred him. Zuckerberg's isolation and woman troubles are also fudged; he's been with girlfriend/wife Priscilla Chan well before Facebook and the film's Erica Albright character is a complete fiction. Unsurprisingly, the film opts for a kindly portrait of Saverin. He's sketched as a poor kid who's frozen out of eventual profits, but the real Saverin partied money away, defaulted on loans and forced Zuckerberg's parents to put up the cash to float Facebook and pay for servers.<br/><br/>Why ditch reality? Probably because Sorkin is determined to boil his tale down to what he thinks is a clever irony: the kid who created a social network and who dreamt of connecting and fitting in, is left without friends and connections. Sorkin's telling the archetypal tale of the Jewish outsider who feels worthless, wants to fit in with rich gentiles, but never quite can. ""Did you like being nothing?"" Fincher's Zuckerberg yells, ""Did you like being nobody?!"" Elsewhere he complains about not being athletic like Harvard's WASPish alpha-males, about not getting into Harvard's exclusive Porcellian, Phoenix and boating clubs, and insults Albright for attending the ""lowly"" Boston university.<br/><br/>But again, the truth is almost the complete opposite. Zuckerberg didn't care about social status, was on fencing and boating teams, in elite fraternities, came from a prestigious private school, 20 percent of Harvard students are themselves Jewish, and the head of Harvard at the time (Lawrence Summers) was himself a Jewish oligarch and US Treasury chieftain. The film thus manages a weird juggling act: a film about a Jewish outsider who wasn't an outsider and which is ashamed of perpetuating Jewish stereotypes and so avoids all Jewishness.<br/><br/>The film's villains are the Winklevoss twins, archetypal Masters of the Universe who say things like ""you don't have to school me in the importance of getting there first, I'm a competitive racer!"" before coming second in both boat races and product roll-outs. Fincher, a graduate of music videos and corporate commercials, uses his trademark, burnished, yellow-green colour scheme throughout the picture. Elsewhere the dolly-in through a nightclub sign in ""Citizen Kane"" becomes a crane shot through a dance club's CGI handrail, a cool tracking shot follows Zuckerberg to his isolated laptop (the only place he feels at home) and the film diligently flips the analogue world of Fincher's ""Zodiac"". The rest of Fincher's plot plays like a feature length version of Chumbawamba's ""Add Me"", or maybe ""The Fountainhead"" for coders, Zuckerberg hell-bent on protecting his ""property"" from people who he believes didn't do much to ""earn it"". Capitalism 101: claim all collective labour as yours alone.<br/><br/>What does the film say about social media? Zuckerberg is offered as internet generation exhibit A, desperate for connection, status and love. Here, people and their emotions are nothing but commodities to be traded, technology breeds isolation, and personal skills decline in lieu of cyber networking, severe inferiority complexes and narcissism. Ironically, as art the film is as flattening and reductive as Facebook, and everything about it itself embodies the poke-me-now neediness and depthlessness of generation Tweet. But the flip-side is also true: humans have been superficial and putting on false facades long before cyberspace. The self has always been a fiction, people are always inherently alienated, Facebook connects as much as it estranges, it is as warm, powerful and communal as it is vapid and humans have always been narcissistic and petty. While Facebook may be a Cause, it also merely amplifies biological and sociocultural conditions which routinely breed Little Eichmanns in the first place. The film co-stars Justin Timberlake as Justin Timberlake.<br/><br/>7.5/10 – See ""The Paper Chase"", ""Afterschool"", ""Catfish"" and ""Demonlover""."

","When we sit down at our computers in the morning - our hair disheveled - with a thunderous bowlful of Rice Krispies, what do we do next? That's right, we head straight for the internet and – more than likely – any number of websites that connect us in some way with our fellow earthlings. Chances are that one of the stops on our internet itineraries will be Facebook, the social networking site that we have all helped to develop into a worldwide phenomenon. However, like the human race trapped in The Matrix, we tend not to ask questions of where the things we use in our daily lives come from. Facebook falls into that list of cherished pieces of our lives; it is hard to imagine a world without the internet, let alone Facebook. There are incredible stories behind even the most common – and essential - facets of our culture, and the same goes for our beloved Facebook. Behind the friend count competitions, the ridiculous cat memes and the half-naked pictures of our favorite drunk coed Sally is a fascinating origin tale that is worthy of a superhero - or super villain, depending on who you ask. That, my dear friend counts, is the spirit of director David Fincher's 2010 cinematic splash The Social Network.<br/><br/>While the film takes many creative liberties with the story of Facebook mastermind Mark Zuckerberg (fittingly played by Jesse Eisenberg) and his rise to ten-digit immortality, The Social Network is by no means an unwatchable pile of bloated hyperbole and special effects. Instead, David Fincher presents us with a film that oozes charisma and atmosphere, created in no small part by the witty, pistol-quick dialogue and dead-eye acting. The set designs are carefully drab, underplaying the glamorous associations with such idealized places as Harvard and Beverly Hills. These elements help to draw us into Zuckerberg's world, one that thrives on gossip, greed, betrayal, sex, and everything else in the Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) handbook. wait a minute, that sounds an awful lot like the real world, doesn't it? The Social Network is completely self-aware, calling into question everything that is presented at face value, including the superficiality of social networking and even us.<br/><br/>Even the soundtrack, composed by Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) and Atticus Ross is an exercise in artificiality; the keyboards weave an intricate (world-wide) web of ear candy, featuring a plethora of beeps and boops mixed with icy flourishes of piano and guitar. This sonic formula, although unorthodox for a ""young person rises to the top despite an x number of setbacks"" movie, perfectly captures the heart of The Social Network's story as it glides throughout the scenes, always present and poignant, but never distracting.<br/><br/>On the whole, The Social Network does not necessarily break any boundaries in terms of plot, nor is it the first film to question a staple of American culture, but it does not have to. The film takes what many films attempt to do and does it much better, and it is sure to create a buzzing discussion over French fries and coffee at many a restaurant or living room. and quite a few Facebook status updates as well."

","First, I should admit that I can't verify the accuracy of ""The Social Network"". Nonetheless, David Fincher's look at Facebook's origins is a very engrossing movie. Part of the point that it makes is that Mark Zuckerberg clearly did some ethically questionable things on his way to becoming the first millennial billionaire. Then again, did anyone become a billionaire 100% ethically? <br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a nerdy but ambitious student, taking an idea hatched by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer) and using it to enrich himself. He even antagonized his erstwhile friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). At least as portrayed in the movie.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" does come out really good. The main question that it seems to be posing is how honestly any business has come about. Of course, people might not consider that as they spend all day on Facebook.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing."

The Winklevosses want to make a social networking site that requires a Harvard email address for membership and they want Mark to program it for them. Never actually working on their website, he instead uses it to gain a 1-month head start on his own similarly-themed website: ""The Facebook."" With the assistance of his friend and newly appointed CFO Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), Mark will turn ""The Facebook"" to the international force that it is today.<br/><br/>The film is, at its core, the thematic successor to Bennett Miller's ""Capote"" (2005): a tale in which creation (""In Cold Blood"" / Facebook) leads to the emotional destruction of its creator (Truman Capote / Mark Zuckerberg). The creation of FaceMash (and Mark's subsequent angry-blogging) destroyed his relationship with his ex girlfriend (Rooney Mara); Facebook destroyed Mark's friendship with Eduardo (Mark cut him out of his 1/3 ownership of the company, for which Eduardo sued him for $600 million - only one of two lawsuits Mark was simultaneously involved with). By the film's conclusion, he even grows disillusioned with Sea Parker, who is arrested after snorting cocaine off of underage interns. The film's final scene (where Mark friend-requests his ex, sits back in his chair and continually refreshes the page until the credits) is one of the most heartbreaking in recent memory.<br/><br/>The film brilliantly frames the story of Facebook's genesis in Eduardo's lawsuit against Mark. David Fincher successfully negotiates these parallel continuities with perfect clarity, using the descendant timeline (the lawsuit) to elaborate the antecedent timeline (Facebook's creation). Transitioning between these timelines in a complimentary fashion without creating temporal confusion in the viewer is a more than commendable achievement of direction.<br/><br/>Necessarily minimalist, though occasionally explosive, Jesse Eisenberg gives one of the year's most intriguing performances as the possible autistic Zuckerberg. Andrew Garfield gives a commendable performance himself as the much more personable Eduardo. The chemistry between the two is incredibly tense, perfectly reflecting the strained relationship that they portray on screen.<br/><br/>Fans of contemporary dramas or those interested in the origins of the omnipresent Facebook will find ""The Social Network"" a worthwhile cinematic experience."

","The film is beautifully shot and directed with the shots perfectly placed. The rowing sequence is gorgeous and deserves some recognition. The acting is also quite good, Jesse does a brilliant job of being a hard to love genius but idiotic at the same time as his business skills are awful. However, the dialogue is rushed and badly written. The opening scene is extremely confusing and could be an instant turn off. The story is also very drawn out and the back and forth swap from the original story and the later on questioning. Brenda Song is probably the most annoying actress to have either walked the earth and every scene with her in was insanely cringe-worthy and almost made me laugh it was so awful. All in all, a quite tedious drawn out annoying film with a brilliant director of photography."

","Perhaps I read too much into this, but I thought the friendship between Zuckerberg and Saverin in The Social Network ran very much parallel to the friendship of Jedediah Leland and Charles Foster Kane in Citizen Kane. The disillusionment that Leland faces in having to expose his friend, Kane, as a fraud insofar as a man abandoning his core principles in running a newspaper to become a power hungry politician is in line with what Saverin faces in watching Zuckerberg be taken in by interloper Sean Parker and Parker's influential ideas on how to expand Facebook.<br/><br/>Both films feature scenes where the best friends of the lead characters confront their friendship/conflict while reflecting nostalgically on their declining importance; Leland's saved declaration of principles from the hand of a younger Charles Foster Kane and Saverin during a moment of reflection with Zuckerberg discussing an algorithm written on a dorm room window pane.<br/><br/>Both films are classic tales of young entrepreneurs becoming wealthy, powerful and influential...albeit without any friends."
"davideo-2","9","1","1","13 June 2011"," Fincher applies his usual dark style to this intriguing and relevant story
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>For such a young guy, I'm still worryingly over-whelmed by all the technology that controls the world these days...you seem to have mobile phones where people can watch films, download music, connect to the internet, music devices that can download tunes on the go, and doing the rounds on the internet itself at the moment, 'social networking' sites seem to be all the rage, mainly Twitter, and, arguably the most popular, Facebook. I fail to see the big rage, to be honest, intermittently informing other users of the most mundane aspects of your day, trying to out compete others with how many messages you can send at one time and so forth. But still, FB has millions of followers worldwide, and has made it's founder Mark Zuckerberg the youngest millionaire on the planet. This film charts how Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, used his social alienation and nerdishness to set him on his way to founding Facebook, before it's money making potential became evident and he began to turn on his friends as he became more ruthless making his way to the top (or so the film claims.) <br/><br/>At first glance, the material doesn't feel suited to the dark content director David Fincher is more renowned for and so he's an odd choice to be at the helm here. Still, his heavy, brooding style is felt all over the picture, and adds it a layer of authenticism and style that it otherwise wouldn't have had. In the lead role, Eisenberg (weird his and his character's name both end in berg!) brings the character of Zuckerberg to life quite well, showing an already tactless and socially awkward person descend further into a ruthless, predatory and traitorius monster (although this is a dubious depiction by the film.) It is curious that such a socially challenged guy could be responsible for creating the biggest social networking site in the world. And it has to be said, praise is owed to Justin Timberlake in a supporting role, showing more range and depth than could be reasonably expected of an ex member of N Sync.<br/><br/>This is an unusual but timely and relevant piece for a director like Fincher to take on, and, applying his usual cold, dark style, he has achieved quite an admirable result indeed. ****"

Zuckerberg juggles business relationships with co-founder and money man Eduardo Saverin(Andrew Garfield)and Napster founder Sean Parker(Justin Timberlake). This Harvard undergrad and computer programing wiz just wanted to find female friendship and ended up creating a social network that would eventually end up putting more than a million people in touch with like minded others half way around the world. The ownership of Facebook would end up in question when the Winklevoss twins(Armie Hammer and Josh Pence)put up a bitter courtroom fight for control of the network claiming the young entrepreneur stole their original idea while building it for them.

"Galina_movie_fan","9","1","1","21 January 2011"," ""They just can't wrap their head around the idea that someone might build something because they like building things."" - Mark Zuckenberg
","The Social Network (2010) is fast, smart, sharp, and very modern because it tells the story based on the real facts going back to the origins of social network called Facebook that started few years ago, continues growing every moment, and forever has changed the way people communicate whether we like it or not. At the same time, the story is timeless, because it has been told many times already, that of the unpredictable and sky rocketing rise of a young genius, in this case computer prodigy, not very popular socially among his peers, who creates the comprehensive, easily accessible and the most popular and populated network of communication, which as of now includes 500 million participants all over the world and has made its creator the youngest billionaire ever. According to Kevin Spacey (yes, THE Kevin Spacey), the film producer and owner of the rights for the book by Ben Mezrich (""Bringing Down the House"") ""The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,"" which is the basis for the script by Aaron Sorkin, it is ""captivating story of betrayal, vast amounts of cash, and two friends who revolutionized the way humans connect to one another—only to have an enormous falling out and never speak again."" <br/><br/>What made the film about birth and growing of the largest Internet social network truly remarkable are directing by David Fincher, the film's pace, and masterful editing. Seems that it moves with a speed of 100 megabytes per second, sweeps the viewers like a tornado, and throws them in a blink of eye back and forth from the recent past when there were no Facebook yet but it was inevitably meant to happen to the present switching between two lawsuits that Mark Zuckerberg had to face. One was filed by his former best friend and business partner Eduardo Saverin, and another - by the Winklevoss twins who claimed that Zuckerberg stole their original idea for his Facebook. I am not sure if it is the best movie of last year but certainly one of the most inventive, coolest, and interesting, the happy combination of intelligent and entertaining film with mass appeal. While watching, I could not help thinking of it as of Citizen Kane of modern day - even before I found out from reading about the film that I was not the only one who thought so.<br/><br/>The cast of the young actors all did terrific job. I've always liked Jesse Eisenberg since I saw him for the first time in the independent film Roger Dodger (2002) and I knew instantly that he would have a great future. In addition to Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield is very good as Eduardo Saverin, the best and the only friend of Mark Zuckerberg in Harvard, and co-founder of Facebook, who later was forced to leave the company and sued for his share in the Facebook stocks. According to the film, the big role in the fallout between Mark and Eduardo played Sean Parker - himself, a very remarkable personality. Parker was one of the creators of the enormously popular ten years ago but forbidden by court Napster - free Peer-to-Peer file sharing of music. Sean Parker, as played by Justin Timberlake, is very clever, charming, smooth, insightful, and totally unscrupulous, a Mephistophelian figure. I never thought of Timberlake much as of actor but I was pleasantly surprised by his performance. I also liked Armey Hammer who provided some comic relief in the double role of twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, golden boys who belong to the circle of ""American aristocracy"", the members of the Harvard row-crew that hired the fellow undergrad, Mark Zuckerberg to create a social network that would connect the Harvard students and let them communicate with one another on line. While working on the project, Zuckerberg took the idea to creating the global network, and the rest is history. <br/><br/>I would only suggest to a potential viewer not to take the film as an accurate documentary. It is not. From what I've read about real Mark Zuckerberg, his persona is somewhat different from the character that Jesse Eisenberg masterfully created in the Fincher/Sorkin's film. The main triggers in the film that started Mark working on the new site were frustration caused by the break up with his girlfriend and inability to join the most prestigious student clubs in Harvard. Real Mark has had the relationship with the same girlfriend since he was 19 - before he had become the creator of Facebook. He said in the interviews that he did not care about joining the clubs, and I believe him. The worlds he has created using his talent and his computer, starting as the teenager, were more exquisite than any prestigious club but jealousy and resentment just look so good in the movie that it would be much more difficult and challenging to make a compelling movie without them, just about someone who ""might build something because they like building things"". But then, we would be talking about completely different film."

","The reviews I had read of ""The Social Network"" implied that there was a bad guy, but after seeing it tonight I came away feeling that Sorkin had drawn Zuckerberg's character with the compassion and huge brush strokes of insight, snappy dialog and ambiguity for which he is famous. OK, so Zuckerberg made a few mistakes, but for the most part, he was as much a victim of Facebook as its creator. (I know, I know - a rich victim, but a victim of his own and others' ambitions, opportunism and greed.) Rage, anger and frustration are the fuel that fire the world's most brilliant creations; add Facebook to the list. You can't teach that in B school; you can't bottle it, you can't aspire to it either. You have to live through the hard stuff - the rejection, the insecurity, the primal angst (which Zuckerberg had in spades even if Sorkin doesn't beat us over the head with it) to gather the kind of motivation required to take a company where Facebook has gone. Of course, I loved seeing my beloved San Francisco as one of the stars, and getting a snapshot of Sean Parker."

"zardoz-13","10","4","9","3 October 2010"," The Curious Case of Mark Zuckerberg
","""Fight Club"" director David Fincher prefers to make movies about eccentric people. Not only do these folks exist on the fringe, but they are also pretty dysfunctional types. They are lethal serial killers, warped visionaries, baffled authority figures, and bizarre nonconformists. Fincher loves to tackle any genre. His first film was the science-fiction sequel ""Alien 3."" He has helmed two serial killer thrillers, first ""Se7en"" (1995) and then in ""Zodiac."" He put an executive through the ringer in ""The Game,"" a movie about deception that rivals ""The Sting."" Fincher has even made his own weird ""Forrest Gump"" type movie with ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" Fincher's new film ""The Social Network"" could be subtitled ""The Curious Case of Mark Zuckerberg."" This scintillating, insightful, and compelling depiction of the trials and tribulations that Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg endured to make a billion dollar global success of his social-networking website will keep you riveted throughout its 121 engrossing minutes. Watching this movie is like riding an escalator. It never slows down to catch its breath. Mind you, ""The Social Network"" qualifies as one of Fincher's shorter movies. Lately, he likes to stretch his cinematic canvas to cover subject matter well over two hours in length. Happily, Fincher doesn't squander a second in ""The Social Network,"" and ""Charlie Wilson's War"" scenarist Aaron Sorkin, who also wrote episodes of ""The West Wing,"" provides crisp, snappy dialogue as well as surprises galore in a screenplay derived from reporter Ben Mezrich's book ""The Accidental Billionaires."" Of course, Fincher and Sorkin cover the biographical basics. Everything started at New England in 2003 and everything went into high gear in California when Facebook entered the orbital velocity. Initially, ""The Social Network"" adopts a chronological time line, but Fincher tires quickly of this and leaps into the future and then dances around in time wherever he pleases. There is nothing ordinary about this extraordinary expose, and the way Fincher and Sorkin skewer Facebook's creator as well as many of the people around him is a treat. <br/><br/>""The Social Network"" unfolds in 2003 at Harvard University. A nineteen-year-old Harvard sophomore in a GAP hoodie, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg of ""Adventureland""), insults his girlfriend, Erica (Rooney Mara of ""Youth in Revolt""), at a Harvard bar, and she breaks up with him. In a fit of rage, Zuckerberg writes nasty things about her padded bra in his online Internet blog. Indeed, he is so fed up with Erica that he hastily assembles a website while he is getting drunk where anybody can evaluate Harvard co-eds based on their appearance. Zuckerberg gets himself in trouble with the administration because he had to hack the school's computer system to get the names of the co-eds. Zuckerberg's audacious stunt brings him to the attention of two stuck-up jocks, the wealthy Winklevoss twins, Cameron (Armie Hammer of ""Billy: The Early Years"") and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer ), as well as Divya Narendra (Max Minghella of ""Agora""), an elite Harvard club member. They hire Zuckerberg to program a Harvard dating site which they want to christen 'The Harvard Connection.' Amusingly enough, actor Armie Hammer plays both identical twin brothers with the help of a body double. Basically, Zuckerberg sees some marginal merit in the Winklevoss twins' idea and modifies it with the help of his close friend and fellow student, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield of ""Never Let Me Go""), a Brazilian who provides an algorithm for Zuckerberg to base the site upon. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Zuckerberg keeps ignoring the Winklevoss twins and builds his new website 'The Facebook' and then expands it to other Ivy League universities. Initially, Eduardo serves as Zuckerberg's business partner and provides the financing. Eventually, Napster creator Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake of ""The Open Road"") enters the picture and contacts Zuckerberg. Parker persuades Zuckerberg to relocate to California. Parker also suggests that they drop the 'the' from The Facebook title. Zuckerberg is immediately impressed by the Napster creator and listens to him with more interest than any of his other friends. Not surprisingly, Eduardo and Zuckerberg have a falling out over Parker. Furthermore, Eduardo sees Parker as a mortal enemy who is going to force him out of the picture. Eduardo tries to limit Parker's spell over Zuckerberg by freezing the money in the Facebook account. Nevertheless, Zuckerberg and Parker score a deal for financing and everything proceeds smoothly for Zuckerberg's brain-child. Meantime, the Winklevoss twins and Divya decide to launch a lawsuit against Zuckerberg for allegedly appropriating their dating website and turning it into Facebook. Similarly, Eduardo launches a lawsuit at Zuckerberg because he feels that Parker getting between them. Betrayal emerges as a major theme in this outlandish yarn. When Zuckerberg isn't betraying the goofy Winklevoss twins, he sells out his close friend Eduardo. Later, when Parker goes off the deep end during a Facebook party for bagging their one-millionth customer, Zuckerberg betrays him, too. Ultimately, Zuckerberg loses the lawsuits, but the payments are so minuscule that he can pay off both the Winklevoss twins as well as Eduardo.<br/><br/>Unmistakably, ""The Social Network"" is Jesse Eisenberg's best movie, and the role seems tailored to his brand of quirky, fast-talking shtick. He delivers an accomplished performance as an obtuse nobody who wound up hooking up a billion people around the world without hooking himself up. Zuckerberg emerges from ""The Social Network"" as a dishonorable individual afflicted by a single-minded ambition as well as greed. He refuses to share anything with anybody and ends up paying the price for his perfidy. Future ""Spider-Man"" star Andrew Garfield is just as spectacular but also sympathetic as Zuckerberg's wronged friend. In a double role, Armie Hammer is downright hilarious as the goofy Winklevoss twins. Director David Fincher wrings deliciously juicy irony galore out the premise that the man who turned more than 500 million users into friends turned his back on his friends to make Facebook a crowning success."

"benparf","8","3","6","19 October 2010"," A well made film that draws out what it can from a rather limited topic.
","It's hard to make a film about Facebook sound interesting. How do you jazz up the most banal of topics? It would be like trying to sell a storyline gravitated on the walk to the shops. How many people would spend their hard earned dough watching someone buying a pint of milk and a few hundred grams of Crunchy Nut. Any takers? No? Well, you're just going to have to go with it. Stick with me please as I give you the lowdown on the hottest bit of reel this side of Inception. This recent release didn't get 8 stars for nothing, you know. <br/><br/>The Social Network is a film about Facebook yet there is barely a poke, like or wall post in sight. This is not, as one may imagine at first glance, a rom com played out through the interweb. The focus of David Fincher's latest flick is the stuff behind the scenes, the stuff many of us have little idea about and have even less interest in. <br/><br/>The plot is simple: Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is a Harvard Computer Science geek desperate to join the frat scene. He invents Facebook although others are keen to make claim to their stakes. We thus see the rise of the company through a retrospective retelling of events as scrutinised in a rather awkward pre-court hearing. <br/><br/>The narrative naturally gravitates the viewers attention to focus on the Zuckerberg's blunt autisms. We feel his pain, his frustrations and his vision though, because of the man he is, we remain distant. This is a guy that pays more attention to the architecture of a nightclub than the music it plays. Yet there is an honesty about his straightforward manner that appeals, that amuses. <br/><br/>Just as this is no triumphant celebration of the youngest billionaire in the States, neither is it a scathing critique of those that launched successful assaults to rob him of his dollars. The Winklevoss twins, played by two people but both featuring Armie Hammer's head, are what we would call 'preppy'. They are snobs who readily use Daddy's contacts to yield the desirable results. But we don't hate them for it. No, they seem like nice enough chaps. Instead, the viewer is drawn to giggle at this double-act's forthcoming whit. Think Price William meets the Chuckle Brothers. The best thing about the Winklevoss pair has to be the perplexing technical mastery at work that enables the one actor's head to be digitally sewn on to another actor's body to give the illusion of identical twins that are always stood side by side!<br/><br/>The biggest surprise undoubtedly has to be the coherent acting of Justin Timberlake. In the role of Sean Parker, the bankrupt Napster founder who flirts with drugs and underage girls, Timberlake adds a bit of spice to the mix. Parker pushes both Facebook and the narrative to more exciting places. Whilst his revolutionary spirit is most prominent, we are occasionally reminded of the geek behind the flashy façade. Ultimately though, we, just like Zuckerberg, admire the man that pioneered the rise of music sharing software and the subsequent decline of the music industry. This is the story of youth fighting back. <br/><br/>The Social Network is also a story of the geek fighting back and in order to connect the audience with the social outcast a series of subplots are set up. One of these is a rather dire love story. This underdeveloped series of exchanges is placed on the periphery of the narrative. It seems as though they have been tagged on to the first an last minutes of the film in order to round off a rather open ending and give the impression of a slightly more traditional narrative structure. All that it does though is give a rather soppy, nice finish to an otherwise different sort of film. <br/><br/>A fairly uneventful 120 minutes puts The Social Network more in line with Fincher's prior release, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, than his earlier thrillers, Fight Club and Seven. Although a grand climax is neither built nor delivered, there is not a minute of stagnation. The two hours rapidly disappear as the audience remains hooked by the tightest of scripts whilst an abundance of commendable performances bring a turbulent blend of conflict, passion and humour to the screen. The Social Network is a well made film that draws out what it can from a rather limited topic."
"Hellmant","10","3","6","3 October 2010"," Fact or mostly fiction the film is still a masterpiece and a must see!
","The best reviewed film (so far) this year and early Oscar front-runner 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' is upon us! David Fincher (one of my all time favorite directors) directs this adaptation of the popular book 'The Accidental Billionaires: A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal' by Ben Mezrich from a script written by Aaron Sorkin (who also wrote 'A FEW GOOD MEN', 'THE American PRESIDENT' and created the TV series 'THE WEST WING' to name a few of his credits). The book, if you haven't heard, is an account of how the internet social networking site 'facebook' was founded, mostly centering on the lawsuits that followed it's immediate success and the relationships of the people involved. Jesse Eisenberg stars as Mark Zuckerberg (the majority stockholder) and Andrew Garfield co-stars as co-founder Eduardo Saverin. The real Zuckerberg fought hard against this film's release (in this form) fearing it will tarnish his image and he denies it bears much factual bearing at all, to real life events, but the real Saverin was the main consultant on the book. Fact or mostly fiction the film is still a masterpiece and a must see!<br/><br/>The story is mostly set in 2003 beginning at Harvard University in the fall and then flashing back and forth between court procedures involving the litigation battles over the ownership of 'facebook'. As the film opens Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend Erica (played by Rooney Mara, who was just cast as the lead in Fincher's upcoming remake of 'THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO'). Mark is so upset that he goes back to his dorm room, gets wasted and blogs about her and then creates a brief internet site called 'facemash' comparing Harvard girls to each other in ranking of 'hotness'. This gives him notoriety and he is approached by the Winklevoss brothers (both played by Armie Hammer, in addition to a stand-in) about programming an internet social networking site that would be exclusive to Harvard students, in an attempt to help get them laid. Zuckerberg leads the brothers on, as well as their business partner Divya Narendra (played by Max Minghella, son of award winning director Anthony Minghella), and tells them he's working on their project while coming up with one of his own, facebook, in an attempt to beat them out the gate. He enlists the help of his best friend Eduardo to finance and promote his venture, with the return promise of thirty percent of the profits, and later Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake), the co-founder of Napster. Zuckerberg becomes inpatient with his long time friend Eduardo and tricks him out of the majority of his stock sharing which (along with the Winklevoss dispute) leads to the core legal battle of the film and the heart and humanity of the story. <br/><br/>I've been a fan of Fincher ever since his first feature film 'ALIEN 3' (which I'll admit doesn't match it's two predecessors but is still a very underrated sequel, much better than the 4th installment as well as the 'ALIEN VS. PREDATOR' films). He's been responsible for some of my all time favorite films ('FIGHT CLUB', 'SEVEN' and 'ZODIAC') and he's one of the most diverse big name directors working in film today. Here he demonstrates universally appealing thematic abilities (like he attempted with 'THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON', my least favorite of his films) and I predict he'll finally take home a much deserved Oscar come award time early next year. I also think the film will win best picture and screenplay (Sorkin's script is so witty and brilliant it would be a crime if it doesn't win). The acting is all very impressive as well and Eisenberg, who I've always been a fan of, should finally be able to shed the 'poor man's Michael Cera' image he's been labeled with by many. I'm a big fan of Cera but Eisenberg has been around longer and done much more serious and diverse work; after this film's release the two should have no problem standing apart. The supporting players are all more than adequate and the film's score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is mesmerizing. It's still a little too early to over confidently predict but I'm guessing no film in the next three months (and definitely none already released) will be able to top it come award time. <br/><br/>Facebook is probably the most popular and relevant invention in use by the majority of society in at least the last decade and for that reason many say they're not interested in seeing this film; they don't want to further support mankind's biggest fad. This film isn't really about facebook though, it's a dramatic character study. It's about two best friends who are torn apart by money and fame, envy, the desire to get laid and the desire to be approved and envied by others. The film could be about the invention of anything and it wouldn't change much as long as the characters remained the same. This is an intriguing, amazingly fast paced character study with plenty of litigation battle action to keep anyone from falling asleep. The movie is much more entertaining than it might sound and it has a lot of emotion and heart as well. While the Zuckerberg character is appalling and hate worthy at times he's also a well intentioned and good heart-ed person at other times. He uses his show-off smart-ass pretentious nature as a defense mechanism for his insecurities and need to feel liked. He's a flawed anti-hero but a likable one and those are the most interesting in my opinion. The character, whether true to life or not, is the relate-able heart and core of the film and makes for one of the best stories, if not the best, to come to cinematic life this year.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ"
"zetes","8","4","10","3 October 2010"," Extremely entertaining
","This one had a lot of things going against it, at least for me. First, I generally don't like David Fincher, with the one exception of Zodiac. Second, I also don't like Aaron Sorkin. I'm not extremely familiar with his work, but I used to watch his show Sports Night and it's pretty freaking difficult to forgive him for that pile of crap. Third, I could not care less about Facebook. It just seems incredibly unnecessary, I don't like people I barely know or haven't known in a long while having any knowledge of my current comings and goings, and, heck, IMDb takes up so much time of my life why would I really want another bit of the internet biting off chunks of my life? Of course, this movie is solely about the founding of Facebook and really does little or nothing with the way Facebook has affected the concept of friendship in the 21st Century (although, honestly, that sounds like an interesting film itself, but I probably wouldn't watch it because it would make me feel so out of the loop!). And it is a fairly interesting story. As for Fincher, that one exception of Zodiac is the reason I will probably see anything he makes in the future (some may wait for video, however). Plus, this one seemed like it would be tapping into Fincher's Zodiac talent, what with its being a complex true story. His talent is in his attention to details, and it serves him well here. Sorkin is a little harder to get over, and during the opening sequence, in which Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) has a quick-witted conversation/argument with his date (Rooney Mara), I was very afraid that I was going to be beat down by his overly clever dialogue. Fortunately, that scene is the worst in the movie, and, while occasionally the dialogue feels overwrought, generally it's smart without showing off. So, with all of the challenges conquered, how did it fare for me? Very well, in fact. It's far from the greatest film ever made, which is what the insane buzz was saying beforehand, but it's very entertaining. Really, the story shouldn't be anywhere near as entertaining as the film turns out to be. When I went over it again in my head, it felt fairly shallow. But it rushes along with such energy that it swept me along with it like an ocean wave. Fincher does a great job, and he's helped exponentially by the editing (Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall) and the score (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross). I really want the score to win the Oscar, if for no other reason than to give Trent Reznor an Oscar. My 17 year old self would be ecstatic at that proposition. The cast is also excellent. I think they work best as an ensemble, but, yes, Eisenberg is wonderful, Andrew Garfield shows off his star potential in his biggest role yet and Justin Timberlake is amazing as the guy who created Napster. It may not be a masterpiece, but it's definitely one of the best films of 2010."

","As further evidence of the decadence of modern society, this movie fits the bill. In the nineteenth century the electric light replaced the candle; the telephone replaced the telegraph. These were two landmark inventions that changed the world for the better and marked new developments in technology that benefited all of mankind. Then in the twentieth century came the airplane and penicillin, two more inventions that changed the world forever. Then in 2003 came ... Facebook! Wow! According to the movie, this cyber-network was launched by an angry computer geek who stole the idea from three snobs at Harvard who in turn were determined to make the geek pay for his thievery. The story seems shallow but is actually a compelling and fascinating as the movie shows how one person became the center of a whirlwind over something that is little more than a toy. Unlike the financial barons of the past, who dealt with railroads, steel mills, coal mines and oil refineries, our modern day billion-dollar entrepreneurs are computer-savvy operatives who create web networks. It's not exactly building a factory or creating anything actually new. There are no new technological breakthroughs, nothing that improves the condition of the human race. Rather, these new ""captains of industry"" are creating playthings, gimmicks, facilitating a service that is intangible, that people cannot consume but meets a need to feel connected in a world in which one can feel very alone. Jessie Eisenberg gives an incredible performance as the main character in this movie. He projects the main character's personal shallowness, intellectual narrowness, mental disturbance, sociopathic inclinations and essential nastiness. Whether this unflattering portrayal is a true depiction of the actual founder of Facebook is another question, but if it is, then he has serious problems. In the nineteenth century the United States built the transcontinental railroad; in the twentieth century discovered atomic power and placed men on the moon; and now in the twenty-first century there is a program that allows millions of people to communicate by computer. Wow! Better get yourself a pc so you can get online and start communicating with all your friends and neighbors and employees and fellow human beings, and maybe even with aliens from outer space if you believe in that. Oops! You're not computer literate? No problem! Leave it to a ""computer-savvy"" college student to invent a computer program designed specifically for the computer illiterate, THEN build a website, and then let the whole world know that now EVERYONE, even the most staunchly computer illiterate, can now communicate by pc, for a price. But if somebody does invent such a program and launches such a website, remember: IT WAS MY IDEA!!! and if you steal it I will sue ... and I won't go complaining to the college president first."
"jleinweber","10","3","7","4 October 2010"," Fantastic!
","One of the best movies I have ever seen! Jessie Eisenberg is amazing as Mark Zuckerberg. He was truly the scene stealer of this movie! Hoping that an Oscar nomination is coming his way because it is highly deserved. I loved the way that no one involved was made out to be the bad guy and even the twins didn't portray a ""good twin/evil twin"" persona. Heck, even if Zuckerberg IS the bad guy, you are able to forgive him for that. My one and only regret: that the music from the trailer was not played at the beginning or end of the movie. That song, Radiohead's ""Creep"" as sung by the Vega Choir, is mesmerizing and haunting."

","How about a movie without sex, violence, or even a kiss? How about a movie that is thought provoking, inspiring, smartly written, directed, and staged? How about a movie where a relatively minor character is a scene stealer and a person to remember (I'm referring to the Dean and his scene with the (V boys)? This guy was spot on, as was everyone else, including Justin Timberlake, who I always thought was a flake. I totally enjoyed this movie and it is only the second movie this year that I would recommend (the other being Inception). I guess I'm not ""cool"" though, don't have that first billion yet. <br/><br/>David Fincher is one of my favorite Directors and has created a totally unique and intriguing concept for the movie, as he always does. Aaron Sorkin's script is amazing and together the two have created a classic movie, bereft of the usual movie junk, and have told the story, which seems as real as could possibly be, from Zuckerberg's mind."

","Superb direction. Stellar script. Bravura performance by Jesse Eisenberg. And it all adds up to...<br/><br/>So what?<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is less than the sum of its parts. A lot of flash; substance-- not so much. <br/><br/>Fincher knows how to tell a story. He knows how to please a crowd. But his films lack the gravitas and emotional resonance that mark the very best American films, the ones worthy of Hollywood's highest accolades.<br/><br/>I liked this movie a lot. I expect it will get one of the 10 ""Best Picture"" nominations. But there are other films this year far more deserving of the ""Best Picture"" statuette and I hope the Academy has the good sense to choose one of those films over ""The Social Network."""
"wwe7961","10","3","7","3 October 2010"," One of those rare movies that is perfect.
","This movie is simply amazing. Everything about it just amazes me. The dialogue is fantastic, the acting is wonderful, and the direction is perfect. First thing I really want to talk about when it comes to this masterpiece is the acting. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE is excellent. The performance that surprised the most was Jesse Eisenberg. I loved him in Zombieland and Adventureland, but here he will amaze you. With his roles in Zombieland and Adventureland he was hilarious, but here he shows more range then you thought an actor could ever have. He goes from two funny roles to an amazing dramatic role. Now I know that many people who have not seen the movie will call me crazy, but I think that Jesse Eisenberg deserves the Oscar for Best Actor. I also will go farther by saying that his performance is one of the finest I have ever seen in a film. Andrew Garfield is also fantastic in his role as Eduardo Saverin. Justin Timberlake is one to mention also. Justin should stop singing, and stay in the movies because he is excellent in this movie as Sean Parker. One last person I would like to mention is Brenda Song. Many of you may know her as London Tipton in ""The Suite Life of Zack and Cody"". At that point you probably doubt that she will impress you, but you would be wrong. In her role as Christy Lee she shows how she is more than just some actor from a stupid Disney show. In her role she is very good, and I hope that she looks for more roles like this. Then there is the excellent dialogue. The lines are fast, witty, and full charisma. It shows what these characters are like just through their mannerisms. We also have the excellent direction from David Fincher. This movie is just so well put together throughout. Not one camera angle doesn't work. This film has become my new favorite film of 2010 and I hope that this wins a lot of Oscars. It is masterful.<br/><br/>4 stars out of 4"

","This movie begins with future billionaire Mark Zuckerberg talking to Erica Albright, a (ficticious) Boston University undergrad who Zuckerberg was currently dating. After insulting her education (he was a Harvard undergraduate) among other things, she calls him an asshole, breaks up with him and leaves. Erica ultimately played a huge part in the story.<br/><br/>Led by a fury of fast talking dialogue and witty pacing, there is not much to dislike about ""The Social Network"". The actors are fine suited in their parts, with Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, founder of the ""social network"" Facebook, Andrew Garcia as Eduardo Saverin and Justin Timberlake as the scandalous Sean Parker. The film mostly takes place from fall 2003 to the reaching of 1 million Facebook users, switching between then to a lawsuit in 2007 against Zuckerberg.<br/><br/>The ending is a partially sad one, due to him losing his best (and only) friend.

","The Social Network, ever since I saw and heard David Fincher will be directing this. I was kind of worried. Thinking to myself ""Can the director of such great but disturbing films such as Se7en and Fight Club be able to tackle this subject?"" Then I told myself ""Yes He Can!"" Afterwards the icing on the cake was that Aaron Sorkin the screenwriter who wrote A Few Good Men was writing this too. Right after seeing those 2 names together I was sold! And the film didn't disappoint. At all. It is based on a book called ""The Accidental Billionaires"" written by Ben Mezrich. A film which relies heavily on in depth conversations, smart screenplay and great acting. It delivers! Jesse Eisenberg plays the billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, after this film no one shall ever call him a Michael Cera clone ever again. Eisenberg brings great depth to the character of Zuckerberg and also makes you think how can a guy so unsocial in life, make such a financially successful internet social network? The opening scene just tells what we should expect; we see Zuckerberg and his girlfriend named Erica Albright separating at a restaurant. The way he speaks, ambition, his conservative nature and point of view are all explained to the viewer at the beginning of the film. Mark expresses his feelings on her through a very explicit blog. Then comes in Eduardo Saverin played by the up and coming Andrew Garfield, best performance of the film, Eduardo is shown to be a very concerned friend of Mark. Throughout the film his concerns shift from Mark to the Facebook website, but the transition is so well done that no one ever realizes that his focus is on something completely different. Near the end we see him suing his once best friend in court. Ironic isn't it? Since Mark was heartbroken, his revenge scheme is shown to us in an online statement he begins to post up on the net. With some very skillful and crafty editing using narration and website texts on the computer obviously compiled with some shots of Mark. His motivation to create facebook came from that one incident as we are shown that he meets up with Erica yet again. She is still sickened at the past events and unimpressed with Mark's creation. Rejected again, in retaliation Mark decides to expand. Enter Justin Timberlake Armie Hammer. He played a double role as the twins named Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Brothers who believe that Zuckerberg had stolen the idea of Facebook. It is very interesting to see the courtroom sequence with the Winklevosses and Eduardo in one room, as both of them are suing Mark, for different reasons, one guy is suing him for financial matter and the other team is suing him for stealing their idea. We actually see the history between Mark and Eduardo right there, as Eduardo even though against him shows a bit of compassion for him while the Winklevosses state their claims. Each character was shown very well developed and very well acted. Eisenberg and Garfield have only up to go after this performance. Justin Timberlake was also very convincing as Sean Parker, flamboyant, arrogant and aggressive. Great choice The direction of David Fincher was definitely there. The film never had a boring scene, even all the conversations which might make all people snarl and say ""It's all just talk talk and talk"" This film is nothing like that, that's where Aaron Sorkin comes in. Almost every conversational scene is very hard hitting, powerful and smart. After watching this film I knew that this was the man who wrote the screenplay of A Few Good Men, another film with some very powerful lines. The lines are portrayed naturally by Jesse Eisenberg and every other actor in the film. The film is structured in 3 narrations, 2 private court cases and the testimony flashbacks the audience is shown. The viewer will be vastly engaged and wanting to see what happens next, instead of watching the flashbacks the viewers will want to see what going on in the court. Lot of humor is present, professional humor. Professional humor in a way that what looks funny to us was bad news for the people (Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Savin) at that time. The Fincher and Sorkin duo just takes it a step further to flawless. The film reminded me of one technique used in Michael Mann's film ""Collateral"" as he always reminds us how the film began, at the airport, thus we are shown airplanes flying around L.A. at many points of the film. This film also sort of had that trait added to it. The only one time I noticed the film was weak (barely) is an editing problem. But is barely noticeable, if seen again it will probably be forgotten, as of right now I'm trying to remember what that problem was but I just can't. The beautiful Script makes up for it.The Editing isn't anything like the editing of The Departed. But it's still great. The score was performed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. A very dark score was written for the film. Music mapped on to the intensity of the scenes and defines the scene very easily for the audience. First we have top notch acting added with a beautiful score, for the audience it's really easy to identify the tension each character and scene with that combination. We are given a very strong Oscar contender here. This film should definitely receive nods for Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. A Film which absolutely everyone should see regardless is he/she is on a social networking website or not. The Great acting by all overlooked actors make their marks her. A great definition of the ""facebook ""generation, the internet generation, our generation. At a running time of two hours(which could've been longer).A Film which shouldn't be missed."
"tj19","9","3","7","2 October 2010"," Did I adequately answer your condescending question?
","David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin form a cinematic union to tell the story about the founders of the social-networking website, Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is an eccentric and brilliant Harvard undergrad who intellectually and fundamentally creates the social-networking site we all know and love, Facebook. ""The Social Network"" is a dramatization of the creation of Facebook, but also the civil case(s) Zuckerberg went through to create the one of the biggest sites in the world that is worth billions of dollars and is used by over 500 million people across the world. But to make 500 million friends, Zuckerberg had to make a few enemies. ""The Social Network"" is an absorbing film that makes you question yourself, 'What is Facebook?' It's a philosophical question that essentially bridges the gap (More like chasm) between the sides of baby-boomers, and the sides of Gen X and Y'ers, and stimulates meaningful discussions about viewpoints, ideas, and values. This is a very talky film, but thankfully the dialogue is excellent, and Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men, Charlie Wilson's War) pens an exceptional screenplay that will likely get an Oscar nomination (And perhaps even a win). Besides a fantastic script, the film is beautifully directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en), who paces a talky, 2-hour film while keeping the audience more than just entertained. He also directs a fine cast; all members of the cast give their best performances to date. Jesse Eisenberg especially gives an astonishingly sophisticated performance of calculated detachment. Every movement he makes is a stimulating one, he makes you laugh and happy, and at times makes you hate him and question his morals. The rest of the cast is solid as well, particularly Andrew Garfield, who is a star in the making, as well as Justin Timberlake, who proved that his breakout performance in 2007's ""Alpha Dog"" was not a one-time thing; He can definitely act. A lot of people were not sure what to expect of ""The Social Network."" It really doesn't matter whether you love or hate Facebook, or even have one. Cinematically, it is a great film. It is a ballsy and risky first effort by Fincher and Sorkin, which turns out to be rather brilliant and controversial (Many people are wondering how factually accurate the film is). The Social Network reminds me of the ""Rise and Fall"" narrative of the gangster film narrative, with Networking being the subject of the rise and fall. More directly, the film is a lot like ""Citizen Kane,"" with our protagonist (who infuriates us and pleases us at the same time) reaches the heights of the communications empire. This film isn't for everyone. It requires thought, and I foresee some people being bored by it (Mainly the average ADD movie-goer who isn't entertained unless they see an explosion or hear a one-liner every three minutes); It's flashy, entertaining, funny and interesting. Unlike Facebook itself, ""The Social Network"" has little to no flaws, and is well worth ""friending.""<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

","Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend in the opening scene and in a drunken rage he goes online and hacks into different websites to take student photos and create a site called FaceMash, where people pick which girl is hotter. This leads to some academic probation, but it catches the eyes of three other students who want to create a social networking site that would be exclusive to Harvard students. They tell Zuckerberg the idea and he joins the team. Unfortunately Zuckerberg shuts them off from communication and writes his own codes and brings in his best friend as CFO. Thus The Facebook is born. As the site gets more popular, Zuckerberg loses his connection with his best friend and ends up getting sued by him and the three students for millions of dollars.<br/><br/>When I first heard that there was going to be a movie based on Facebook, I rolled my eyes and asked why even bother. Then, to my surprise, I heard that David Fincher was set to direct. My interest perked up a little bit, after all the guy directs some stellar films. It wasn't until the trailers starting popping up did I really want to see this film. The accolades that it has been receiving added more anticipation. Now that I've seen the film, all I can say is bravo. <br/><br/>Fincher and soon to be nominated for best adapted screenplay Aaron Sorkin, have created a film that defines what this generation is all about. Facebook is such a cultural impact that some people can't live their lives without it. I have it open in another window as I'm writing this review right now. The film will undoubtedly receive more award nominations than screenplay, I'm just curious to see if any of those are in the acting department because this cast is great.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg, who people always claimed to be a Michael Cera rip off, commands the screen with his awkward and pseudo intelligent riffs in his speeding bullet laced monologues. The guy (Zuckerberg) is brilliant at code writing, but his social skills are clearly lacking. His best friend, Eduardo Saverin (soon to be Spiderman Andrew Garfield) is desperate to get into elite clubs and has his emotions close to the surface. Eventually they explode when he learns he's being shifted out of his CFO position. Garfield plays well opposite Eisenberg. To my surprise Justin Timberlake wasn't irritating. He plays egocentric Sean Parker and while I don't see any awards heading his way, he does help complete a well put together cast.<br/><br/>The story jumps between two timelines. The present, in which Zuckerberg is facing two lawsuits and the past, which we see the creation of facebook. Heaps of praise should be thrown on Fincher and Sorkin, they pulled off this structure perfectly. The film feels just like his previous efforts, dark and cold. Much like the depiction of Zuckerberg. I can't comment on how true the film depicts the events, but we all know he did get sued and the filmmakers stand by the truths they tell in this film. It's all heightened to be entertaining, but with Zuckerberg trying to steer clear, I see a lot of truth in this film.<br/><br/>The Social Network is one of the years best films. It's solid direction from Fincher, who knows what he wants from every aspect. Sorkin delivers a timeless story set in our age of the internet and facebook. Friendship, greed and loyalty are all called into question. The performance are strong across the board with such a young cast. Eisenberg standing out in the lead role of Zuckerberg. The score is phenomenal, Fincher knew what he wanted and he got it with Trent Reznor. His style of music perfectly matches the film with the technology it's bringing to the forefront. <br/><br/>I wouldn't call this the film of the decade, but it is good enough to be in the high ranks of Fincher's best work and one of the best works this year. For a film that is simply people talking, it feels natural and goes at a breakneck speed. I highly recommend The Social Network."
"StevePulaski","10","3","7","2 October 2010"," A True Story of Consumption and Betrayal
","The Social Network has a quality in movies that isn't utilized enough. It captures the feeling of ""living it while watching it"". After I watched The Social Network I felt I had lived the frustration, hardships, and everything in between dealt with by the film's protagonist Mark Zuckerberg. Few movies have that unique quality and since many movies that are released now are poor, rushed, CGI messes, The Social Network proves good films still exist out there.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg is one of the many actors in the world today that is underrated, yet hasn't done a bad movie. He was funny and relatable in Zombieland, quirky yet lovable in Adventureland, and now he is smart and sophisticated playing quite possibly the biggest role in his filmography. His portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg is pure gold and almost Oscar worthy showing off how capable he is of a highly potential filled role. He shows off some clever one-liners in the film and even brings his full acting talents together by showing off technical humor in the film as well.<br/><br/>The plot takes place in Harvard University in 2003 when Mark Zuckerberg's (Eisenberg) severe frustration after his breakup with his girlfriend leads him to posting several hate comments on his LiveJournal account. Mark then hacks into various servers making ""Face Mash"" a site where people can rate the attraction of different women. Zuckerberg faces charges after the hacking which leads Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer), and Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) to approach him and ask him if he would like to help them create a social networking site called ""ConnectU"".<br/><br/>Zuckerberg accepts the offer, but then goes to his friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) with a similar idea about creating a site where friends can post status updates, pictures, talk to other friends, view other friends updates, and so on calling it ""The Facebook"". Mark and Eduardo spend a weekend working on the the idea and eventually launch it calling it ""The Facebook"" like planned. The Winklevoss twins are furious claiming Zuckerberg had stolen their idea for the website and are now suing him for breaking his word.<br/><br/>The film flashes back and forth from 2003 where Facebook started to when the lawsuit coincides with the part in the story. Its a unique action, the problem is it makes the film choppy. My only complaint is I could see where the crew was going trying to go back and forth between the birth/lawsuit. Though it makes the film choppy and almost slows things down. The Social Network runs for two hours when it could be cut back at least twenty minutes. Although the choppiness doesn't deteriorate much from the premise of overall idea of the film.<br/><br/>I like this movie for many things, mainly the script written perfectly by Aaron Sorkin which is one of the many things Oscar worthy about this film. Not only does the screenplay satisfy to various degrees having heavy technical jargon and amazing dialog scenes, it's director David Fincher does an amazing job holding the movie together and the effort amounts in this film are overall amazing. Jesse Eisenberg, like stated before, deserves an Oscar for his profound performance in this film. He is Mark Zuckerberg. His looks, attitude, and characteristics show he perfectly capable playing a big name role.<br/><br/>The movie teaches life lessons too. We see Napster's Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake, who gives a dynamite performance as well) walk into the picture to assist Zuckerberg with his Facebook site and basically kicks Saverin out of the picture. It shows that you need to keep your friends close. Anyone can waltz in and take control of your life if you let them. Don't put your friends aside for someone who loves your net worth more than the actual person. Here's the story of two friends who's website creation split their lives apart from each other because of Zuckerberg's selfish move. Rarely does a movie send a message so meaningful.<br/><br/>The Social Network is now my pick for best film of the year followed by Toy Story 3, then Easy A. The Social Network could have easily been a poor, lifeless retelling of the founding of one of the biggest social networking sites nowadays, but it chose to be as good as it did. While running long, it still manages to tell the story and events in broad, descriptive detail leaving no stone unturned. Most of the movie's characters don't appear as the real thing at the same time the story not being all the way true, you will get that with every movie ""based on true events"", The Social Network may anger Mark Zuckerberg, but it's still an informative, electric, dark, out of the ordinary, mesmerizing film with little to complain about. Fincher, Eisenberg, Sorkin, and everyone involved with the film have a perfect movie on their hands. One with a heart and soul.<br/><br/>Starring: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, and Max Minghella. Directed by: David Fincher."

","As an avid Facebook user, I took the liberties in going to see this film. I really didn't know what to expect with this one. I actually thought since this was directed by David Fincher that it would be some kind of thriller. It's not. It's more of a history lesson of how Facebook came to be.<br/><br/>Really, it's about the youngest billionaire in the world, how he got there, and the people he screwed over to get there. They want blood. Or at least his money. So the film takes you through a series of events that starts out with our protagonist, Mark Zuckerberg having a conversation with this attractive girl. He screws it up with his mouth and the girl doesn't want anything with him anymore. So Mark gets mad, literally runs home to write a blog about her and creates a forum that has people rating girls in his school, which is Harvard.<br/><br/>At this point, it feels like his motivations are over this girl. It's like he wants to succeed just to show her up or something. He gets a little help from the Moskovitz brothers (one played by Joseph Mazzello, the little boy in Jurassic Park) who want him to create a Harvard Facebook. Mark agrees but doesn't include them in this idea and chooses his own people to help him through this endeavor. The Moskovitz boys get angry as Mark gets big with the a new website simply called The Facebook.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie has got to be Justin Timberlake as Napster genius Sean Parker. He steals every scene and he's chalk full of great performances. In fact, most of the performances in this movie is well done with some slick writing to boot. I especially love the scene with the Moskovitz brothers in the board room with the Dean. The dialogue exchange there is masterful and it felt like a real conversation between people. There's a lot of this in this movie and special care is given to every scene. This is a pure Oscar contender if I ever saw one.<br/><br/>The only true flaw that I've seen might has to be the ending. The film just had to wrap itself up, and it just wasn't as satisfying as I hoped. Almost sort of anti-climatic. It's not distracting and won't ruin the overall enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>If you are a Facebook person, you owe it to yourself to see this movie. You might feel dumb afterwords like I had. Now if you excuse me, I have to go invent something."

","Greetings again from the darkness. This is a film with good genes. It's based on Ben Mezrich's novel ""The Accidental Billionaires"", screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (""West Wing"", ""A Few Good Men"") and directed by one of the best directors working today, David Fincher (""Fight Club"", ""Zodiac""). The film is dialogue driven and my advice is to shift your ears into turbo-mode to keep up. These Harvard types never stammer and are quite speedy in making their oh-so-clever points.<br/><br/>This film is not so much the history of Facebook as it is a glimpse into the individuals behind the idea. Foremost, of course, is Mark Zuckerberg (played with rapid-fire tunnel vision by Jesse Eisenberg). The programming guru behind the code, Zuckerberg is depicted as a guy who is not just socially inept, but also unaware of social mores and code. I am not sure if he is best described as a prodigy, genius or even (possibly) a sufferer of Asperger's Syndrome. Whatever he is/was, he became a billionaire in his early 20's by proving he could put together the world's dominant social network while having no redeeming social skills of his own. Fascinating.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg's best and only friend (and business partner) is Eduardo Saverin (played by the next Spider-Man, Andrew Garfield). Saverin fronted the money to get Facebook started and was one of the parties who borough suit against Zuckerberg claiming he was cheated out his place in the company.<br/><br/>The third key player is the infamous Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake). Founder of Napster and Plaxo, Parker manages to get his hooks into Zuckerberg and apparently was behind the snubbing of Saverin. This is the most charismatic role in the film (and real life), yet also the role that may have the most dramatic license taken.<br/><br/>The story is told in non-linear form, weaving multiple depositions from different lawsuits. One includes the Winklevoss twins from Harvard who claim Zuckerberg stole their idea. They later settled for millions.<br/><br/>As I said, this is not so much a history of Facebook as it is a display of the characters involved. These are all brilliant people who are also ignorant to the ways of the world. It seems they all have significantly different goals, yet never really stop to agree on strategy. Instead, the growth is non-stop, as is the back-stabbing.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the film uses a girl (Rooney Mara) in the opening scene as the single biggest influence on Zuckerberg's brainstorm. Her rejection of his self-centered speed-talking kicks his wheels in motion and his relentless energy never slows for the rest of the story. One thing is clear, Zuckerberg did not single-handedly create Facebook and there is little doubt some key people were given short straws along the way. No matter what really happened as all that was battled out behind closed records in the settlements. What we do know is that Facebook now has over 500 million users worldwide.<br/><br/>This is an extremely well crafted movie, though in my opinion, none of the acting is up to the script. It's a film that provides enough insight into the players and enough entertainment for the ticket. That's really sufficient. Coming next ... David Fincher is set to direct and Rooney Mara is cast as Lisbeth in the Americanized version of the fabulous Swedish hit, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". So enjoy this one and look forward to that one!"

","It is not Citizen Kane, but David Fincher's Social Network has the energy of young Charles Foster Kane descending with his wunderkinds to take over a newspaper because it ""would be fun.""<br/><br/>So too Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), who has become the world's youngest billionaire by inventing Facebook. This biopic chronicles his rise from an undergrad at Harvard, where he and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) begin a campus wide comparison of coeds that led to a global social network phenomenon.<br/><br/>Along the way Zuckerberg, not destined to win any congeniality awards, legally fights the upper-crust Winklevoss brothers (Armie Hammer), who claim he took their idea, and Saverin, who didn't fit well as CFO. Whether or not Zuckerberg contributed to Saverin's downfall is an important consideration in establishing Zuckerman's complicated character, who not only comes up with winning programming but also must engage and disengage operatives as brilliant as Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the founder of Napster.<br/><br/>The opening sequences where the great ideas take shape on the campus are the most electric and closest to helping us to understand the workings of genius. We learn he's a computer nerd and a workaholic who gets results just as Kane/ Welles did. As in the latter cases, we really don't know who these gifted entrepreneurs really are inside, yet listening to their witty dialogue, more like frat-boy screwball comedy than ordinary repartee, is the film's greatest joy, albeit some of the words are lost in the race.<br/><br/>But it sure is fun trying to find out. In the spirit of All the President's Men, The Social Network is necessary viewing for those who want inspiration to start an enterprise and for those who just want an affirmation of the supremacy of ideas and hard work."
"jimbo-53-186511","6","2","4","3 July 2013"," Slightly overrated, but still worth watching
","Social Network is a fictionalised account of 'Facebook's birth' and during this journey the viewer gets to see what happened before Facebook - Zuckerberg's (Jesse Eisenberg) early effort at Social Networking which initially begins at his Harvard University. During Facebook - the legal battles that Zuckerberg faces between two brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer and Josh Spence respectively) who claim Zuckerberg stole their idea and also the legal battle between Zuckerberg and best friend and CFO of Facebook Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) who felt that Zuckerberg cheated him out of his share of Facebook.<br/><br/>Social Network is a bit of a mixed bag and in my opinion the good slightly outweighs the bad. I will start off with the aspects of Social Network that I liked;<br/><br/>Firstly, the directing David Fincher's direction is really crisp. Throughout the film, it cuts between the legal battles and the evolution of Facebook and everything just flowed naturally. Another aspect that I liked was the script, although I'm unsure how much of what I saw was true, I did like the content of the film and found the way that Facebook evolved and the various legal disputes to be fairly interesting. Whatever tweaks have been made to the story have been done to good effect.<br/><br/>One of the main problems with Social Network was the characters themselves. The vast majority of the characters either weren't interesting or very well developed and I just couldn't make any sort of emotional connection to nearly all the characters. The only character who I felt any sort of sympathy for was Saverin. It has to be said that Andrew Garfield's acting was also much better than the rest of the principle cast. Justin Timberlake shows up about half way through the film as Sean Parker (an arrogant know it all) who becomes an investor in Facebook following the downfall of his previous company Napster which was a music downloading site.<br/><br/>To sum up, Social Network is a watchable film which is well directed and it also has a decent script, but for me it was let down by poor characterisation and because the characters lacked depth and I just didn't care for them. It is a film that I would say was merely 'good' rather than 'great'"
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","6","2","4","29 August 2012"," An over exaggerated movie
","After watching this movie two things happened. One: I started disliking Mark Zuckerbeg. Two: I started wondering why this movie was nominated for so many Oscars. It holds almost no dynamics, it is predictable and shallow. This movie had a lot of capital, it started out promising but at the end it was just a flat line. Nothing in this movie gave me goosebumps, nothing made me think, I just realized Mark is not such a nice guy I thought he was. The acting was actually very good. Garfield gave the best performance, but Timberlake is up there with him. Both understood the essence of their characters, their wishes, desires, their fears and acted them very, very well. Jesse was magnificent but a bit over the top. I believe he exaggerated in every scene and should have kept his character a little calmer. He would have made a much stronger impact on the screen and on the audience. The concept itself is good. Two story lines, intercepting each other was interesting but never finished. One expects that the culmination will be their connection but that never happens. The movie just ends. It leaves one sitting wondering if that is all, is there is more etc. All in all, a good script, good young actors, great idea, but poor execution. Without a proper ending and nothing interesting about the film, with no scenes that will stay in my mind, that will start a conversation with my friends, I can only say - Fincher, you can do way better than this."
"intern-88","10","2","4","22 June 2012"," Facebook: the heart in a heartless world
","The great insight of David Fincher's brilliant The Social Network is that social inadequacy was the main driver of the Facebook juggernaut.<br/><br/>The film kicks off in 2003 with the nerdy, OCDish Harvard student and future Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) meeting Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) for a date. After Zuckerburg fails to impress with his rat-a-tat-tat of facts and feelings - think The Simpsons' comic book guy mashed with Stephen Fry - Erica torpedoes him with one of the film's many memorable lines: 'You're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole.'<br/><br/>Facemash, via a couple of posh, handsome, Harvard twin brothers asking Zuckerberg to help them build a social-networking site for students, becomes Facebook - or TheFacebook, as it was originally known, before the founder of Napster, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), made his enormous contribution to the project. 'Drop the ""the""', he tells Mark. 'Makes it cleaner.' Initially a Harvard-based info-sharing site, Facebook, in Fincher's telling, is born directly from a student's need to hook up with people in some fashion, when so many of the traditional ways of doing so - meeting in bars, conversing face-to-face, joining clubs - are increasingly closed off to him. In this way, Fincher subtly yet profoundly captures what remains the lifeblood of the extraordinary Facebook phenomenon: not social inadequacy per se, but certainly social discombobulation.<br/><br/>Written by Aaron Sorkin of West Wing fame and directed by Fincher of Seven fame, The Social Network focuses on the lawsuits filed against Zuckerberg in the mid- and late 2000s. With Facebook a household name and worth an estimated $25 billion (Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire ever), he was sued both by those posh twins, who claimed that he stole the idea from them after they asked him to construct a social-networking site, and by his best friend and the original funder of the Facebook project, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), who is ruthlessly ousted by Zuckerberg as he gets closer to Parker the Napster maestro.<br/><br/>The Social Network taps into what has made Facebook so popular: the desire to carve out an identity, a life narrative, at a time when it seems increasingly hard to do that through real social relationships in the real world. 'People lived on farms and then in cities and now they will live on the internet', says Parker. He says it's no longer enough just to go to a party – you must 'go to a party with a digital camera and share the photos on Facebook'. Everything – from their job title to their interests, their relationship status to their religious beliefs, their social antics to their childrearing experiences – gets recorded and logged by the FB generation, as a kind of makeshift but also permanent personal narrative, which tells everyone who they are and what they believe.<br/><br/>This is what is really significant about Facebook starting off as a university phenomenon before spreading to the rest of society. At uni, people's cultivation of a personal identity is necessarily a bit forced. Lacking the social cachet that goes with having a certain kind of job, living in a certain kind of neighbourhood, and moving in certain kinds of adult social circles, students instead physically sign up for societies or join clearly demarcated and often caricatured social networks (the Rugby Drinkers, the Political Club) to demonstrate who they think they are. Today, in the absence of the old solidarities and the old informal networks of community and shared interests – that is, at a time of great alienation – that experience of needing fairly self- consciously to magic up an identity is repeated across society. So a fundamentally student site now has half a billion members.<br/><br/>Facebook is better understood, not as a country, but as a refugee camp for people who feel today's lack of identity-forging social experience. The scene in which Zuckerberg tries to befriend – or rather 'friend' – Erica on FB after their disastrous date and his pathetic apology, where he keeps hitting the F5 refresh button to see if she has accepted, is as painful a study of alienation as you are likely to see in the cinema this year. An intelligent, funny and humane exploration of society's new networks – if I were on Facebook, I'd definitely 'Like' this film."
"ronnay_barkay","10","2","4","22 November 2011"," Dark, haunting, with more than a grain of truth.
","These days it seems harder and harder to go to the cinema and see a movie that isn't frankly rubbish. The Social Network is the best movie I've seen since the last century.<br/><br/>It portrays the beginnings of Facebook, probably the most famous and popular website ever, creating the youngest billionaire in history, Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg is played by Jesse Eisenberg who gives an incredible performance of a young man with vastly superior intelligence , desperate to make an impression and become ""somebody"". By pure chance he is asked to design a website for the college, which he agrees to, only at some point he decides that the site he's working on should belong to him, not them.<br/><br/>It's well known that a lot of this movie is fictitious but I believe the core emotions and events are very true to what actually happened. Zuckerberg fed off the thrill of playing people like pawns, gradually shedding his nerdy teenage persona and turning into a ruthless businessman.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story with atmosphere using dark, brooding, menacing music, it just all comes together and exudes some intangible quality that makes it seem hard to believe that this just happened a few years ago, you feel the gradualism of the build-up as Facebook gets bigger and bigger and how people quickly get left behind and how Zukerberg and Parker became perfect business partners to create something the world has never seen before.<br/><br/>It's very brave to make a movie about a true story so soon after it happened. If this movie was made 30 years after Facebook was invented it would have been very different. The residual emotion that was floating around after these events would have long since evaporated.<br/><br/>David Fincher did something bold and brave by making this movie. The fact that it upset Zuckerberg himself is an achievement in itself. He's been portrayed with more accuracy than he's willing to admit."
"benaven","6","2","4","22 September 2011"," Flavour of the Year?
","I remember 17 years ago, I'm guessing, buying a film magazine (presumably Empire, here in the UK) that had an article entitled ""The 100 Greatest Films of All Time"" or some-such. Somewhere in the list was Interview With The Vampire and I remember thinking that it was only in the list because it was new and that if a similar list was drawn up at any year in the future then the film wouldn't appear. Sure enough, I've never seen it on such a list since, fine film though it is. It's very good, but one of the best 100 ever? I don't think so. Which brings me to TSN. It's a good film, possible a very good one, but one worthy of IMDb's Top 250? I don't think so. It's an interesting story with some interesting characters that tell the story of one of the major social developments of our time but it certainly isn't a Great film. Much of the acting is of a high standard, the direction is strong and the film certainly looks nice thanks to some inspired cinematography but I just didn't think it was as good as the IMDb rating led me to expect. I saw it last night; within a week of watching The Secret In Their Eyes. To me, unless you have a pathological hatred of subtitled movies there's no question at all as to which is the better film. One is good going on very good; the other is magnificent. Yet their scores on here are almost identical. But, we're all different. If you haven't seen TSN I'd recommend that you do so as it's a nice way to spend a couple of hours. If you go to see it expecting to have to re-write your own personal list of Greatest Films Of All Time then you might not need to do so after watching it. I'd be interested to see if the film's score drops over the years. My bet is that it will."

","First while there is some good dialog, the movie's downfall is that it was too long at over 2 hours. Also, there isn't a lot that happens since it is just a film about the start up of facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed as sort of a nerd/genius but he is also a jerk with how he treats his one good friend, Eduardo. He basically tosses him aside once the hip, outgoing Sean Parker shows up, whom has connections to get facebook funded.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I didn't think it was that great, but I can see how a lot of people would find it entertaining. Since I don't care anything about Facebook, I say skip it."
"oabbott89","8","2","4","13 July 2011"," Heavily adapted but brilliant story
","I've become a big David Fincher fan over the the years and I've come to expect something when i see his name linked to a film, a certain sense of dark witty humour mixed with subtle clever storytelling and a sense of rebellion that always make the films different from the others available at the time. When i watched the Social network i really didn't know what to expect but wanted typical fincher trademarks and in a way i was disappointed with the lack of darkness about the film i wanted a tale of betrayal and deceit displayed on screen, however i was not disappointed as it was replaced by a film that showed us the emotion between the characters involved with a lot of comic relief which is always witty and never resorts to American slapstick we find so much these days which i believe only children under the age of ten still enjoy but Hollywood still insist on producing. What the makers of this film have managed to do is make a documentary into a vivid and in-depth story, with drama and emotion that all audiences can relate to. I do worry however that the screen play is so good that large amounts of the story have been added to make the film flow and add aspects about character and storyline which in turn has been at the cost of the truth of the situation around the actual creation of facebook. Even to the extent that the real life actors counterparts in some cases refused to help in the making of the film as they felt it was not accurate or true to their real life personalities. Finally the film offers us one very confusing scene in which there is a rowing race in the UK which seems as though it has been agreed to be added as a favour by fincher to a cinematographer as it does not seem to fit in with the pacing or storyline of the film at all but contains some brilliant looking shots and aesthetics to the extent of a cinematographers wet dream."

","I think this is the best movie made by David Fincher since Fight Club. when i first saw The Social Network, it was kind of boring, listening to all those lawyers talking about the same thing all the time, but then i saw it for second time and liked it more. the movie contains really good dialogs, and of course, the scrip is perfect. Actors weren't very good but still, the movie is good.<br/><br/>The history of one of the worlds biggest companies is very interesting to see and isn't boring at all. the movie shows how friends can make decisions, how they see what's right and what's wrong. there is friendship, argue, love and betrayal in just 2 hours which is filmed, directed and edited very well.<br/><br/>For me, this was the best movie of the year. King's speech is quite a good movie but it can be watched once or twice, but social network, is the movie that never makes me fell tired of watching it. from a great book was made a great script and from that script, Fincher made a movie, which would be interesting, entertaining and good to see. the music in the movie is also very good. it fits with the movie so well that you're just getting pleasure both with watching and listening to it.<br/><br/>The social network shows that money isn't the most important in life. it shows how a person get a lot of money and power, and at that time, lose friends and make more enemies.<br/><br/>The movie is very good to see. if you've not seen this movie yet, don't miss it just because of the fancy actors."
"czn1987","10","2","4","8 March 2011"," Money, genius, asshole, attitude and betrayal
","Money and wealth: No spiritual things are mentioned here. We only talk about the Material. What is ""money"" and what is ""wealth""? You spend one hour, write a program and sell it to Microsoft. Then you get $1000 and buy your girlfriend a coat. That's wealth! Studentship or the money that our parents support is far from called wealth, until you know how to use it to make more. In the movie, Mark and Eduardo are rich. But for the twin Winklevoss, I have to say that they are not rich enough.<br/><br/>Talent excitation: Everybody has the potential to become a genius. However, a so-called genius must be stimulated, which makes the genius-population limited. Provocation from his girl is the original motivation to start the facebook. Challenging tasks in programming may help Mark forget the unhappiness at the same time. Actually, real excitation is very hard to get, because you have to obtain a woman you care and a project you like.<br/><br/>Asshole's logic: Mark is called ""asshole"", because he is incredibly meticulous and nerdy. Everything in his eyes has to be precise and correct, just like Binary. During the foundation of facebook, I think Mark understands very well how much stake each of them, Eduardo, Sean and himself should hold. In Mark's opinion, Eduardo has to pay for his mistake. If we say that the freezing of accounts is excusable due to Mark's behavior which made Eduardo has unfair treatment feeling, then the praise ""I love talking to people who understand finance"" went to his head, which makes it obvious that he was careless! Therefore, Eduardo should not get 30% stake in Mark's point of view. But will it be only 0.3%? We don't know.<br/><br/>Attitude and power: A very interesting phenomenon is that in China, when you drink with your friend, although both of you do not want to get drunk, you all do finally. Sometimes, people are living for a kind of feeling, for example, feeling balance and fair. Unless you are as nerdy as Mark is, you always have to show some attitude although it seems to be meaningless. That's why we saw ""Harvard gentlemen"" and ""I just want to get my things back"" in the movie.<br/><br/>Betrayal and Self-harm: Are Mark and Eduardo friends? This is just like asking whether Mark and Erica are lovers. Different people have different way to express their emotions. There was a very talented and pretty poetess ""Lin Daiyu"" in Chinese fiction who liked get-together, but she actually did not enjoy it because before get-together, she always worried her friends' leaving. She could not endure this feeling, as a result, she said she hated get-together and never wanted it! Maybe Mark values friendship very much, but simultaneously, he fears his friend one day will betray him! Mark would rather hurt his best friend, in case of one day's probable betrayal, which is kind of helpless protection. But who will be hurt more? He keeps doing this, and falls in love with this self-harm feeling gradually! Does he remember once he said to Eduardo ""WE did it""?<br/><br/>""You're not an asshole, Mark. You are just trying so hard to be.""<br/><br/>At the end of movie, Mark refreshes the web page over and over again. In fact, he is hurt seriously, more than Eduardo, and more than Erica. Although he has got to 500 million friends with only a few enemies, the biggest enemy is himself ironically. You can say he is poor, you can sigh he is tragic. But after all, he asked for it, he does not even dare to imagine his girl will come back! Instead, he is enjoying her rejection from time to time, like... drugs."
"DonFishies","9","2","4","25 February 2011"," Hypnotic, important and unmissable
","This late in the game, David Fincher's The Social Network needs no real introduction or proper synopsis. It is a dramatized, debatably truthful version of how Facebook was created by Harvard dropout Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), juxtaposed with two lawsuits with people ""involved"" in its creation.<br/><br/>When I first saw the film in October, my feelings were immediately uncertain. I thought it was good, but not great, and was left with the same emptiness many people have continued to complain about since the film's release. After having re-watched the film a second time, knowing full well what the experience was going to be akin to, not only do I feel The Social Network is an excellent piece of celluloid, but also the most important film of the year and the current decade. The fact that Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin were able to craft such an intense and wild ride out of something as mundane as HTML coding and alleged ""idea theft"" speaks volumes for their creativity, and suggests that not every silly idea for a film will turn out as bad as it initially sounds.<br/><br/>Had Fincher's name not been attached to the credits, it would be insanely difficult to even consider this be the work of the same man who gave us Fight Club, Se7en and the Oscar-winning The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. But looking closer, you will immediately notice his calling cards – the frantically paced, hyper kinetic editing style his films have been well known for, alongside his meticulous sense of detail. While we already knew he was a master in both realms, his work in The Social Network only helps cement what a talent he has so quickly become. Every scene is just so incredibly constructed, that it manages to haunt and hypnotize you at the same time. And whereas indulgence and length bogged down Zodiac and practically destroyed anything Benjamin Button had going for it, it is nice to see Fincher scaling back and maintaining brevity I had no idea he still had.<br/><br/>The film would be nothing however, without Sorkin's incredible screenplay. While he may have been adapting Ben Mezrick's The Accidental Billionaires, Sorkin still manages to inject an almost outlandish dose of creativity and originality, and allows the project to become his own. The quick and witty quips between characters, the poetic voiceovers, the heartbreaking diatribes – the film is very much driven by dialogue and the written word, and what easily could have a by-the-numbers adaptation becomes something so much more. Just watching the opening of the film and seeing the rapidly devolving argument between Eisenberg and Rooney Mara, playing Zuckerberg's then-girlfriend Erica Albright, is enough to suggest any naysayers of the project were all so very, very wrong. After the debacle of the underrated Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and the incredibly disappointing Charlie Wilson's War, it was great to see Sorkin bounce back with such an incredible and unforgettable screenplay.<br/><br/>While everything else practically works secondary to the work of Fincher and Sorkin (especially Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score), they all complement each other to help make the film the experience it truly is. Eisenberg is startling as Zuckerberg, managing to be hilarious, frightening and scared all at once. He maintains all of his emotions at every turn, and gives his best work since his brilliant turn in The Squid and the Whale. Andrew Garfield maintains a deer-caught-in-headlights look for the majority of the film, but it works for his portrayal of the wounded and betrayed best friend. Smaller turns from Rooney, Joseph Mazzello, Max Minghella, Justin Timberlake and especially Armie Hammer are all equally well portrayed and delivered. While they are not exactly unknowns, their lower key status among Hollywood powerhouses helps give an even greater sense of authenticity to the film.<br/><br/>But the film's raw and unhinged power comes squarely from how timely the project is. We scoffed at the idea of a Facebook movie, but it really is the most important major motion picture of last year, and will likely remain one of the most important of the next decade. It stands out in a year dominated by 1980s nostalgia, sequels, prequels, remakes and throwbacks, as something so wildly original and indefinable. The film's target audience of young adults and 20-somethings have lived and breathed Facebook for years.<br/><br/>But Facebook is almost the McGuffin in this case, because the film is not so much about the creation of the social networking website, as much as it is about the attitudes of the people who created it. Sure, there are debates about the authenticity and factual elements in the film, but anyone would be doubting themselves if they did not recognize how very real the jealousy, the selfishness, the bitterness and resentfulness, and the all-for-one attitude of these characters are in our current times. Journalists and writers have been saying for years how attitudes are have been shifting, and the sense of entitlement the younger generation and its peers maintain. While films have come and gone trying to quantify these assessments, and try to define the internet-bred generation, I feel The Social Network is the first to truly get it right, to truly define this generation. The liberal and embellished changes were made for dramatic effect, but they make the project that much more real and hard-hitting. I saw myself being reflected back in these characters, and its hypnotic appeal makes the proceedings that much more terrifying.<br/><br/>I enjoyed but did not adore The Social Network the first time I saw it. But I think with every fresh re-watch, the film will get better each time. It truly is one hell of a movie, and one that will continue to grow with its importance. We laughed at the idea of a movie about Facebook, but with how important it has become to just about everyone in their day-to-day lives, we should have never had any doubts.<br/><br/>9/10."

","Reviews have stated that this is the movie of a generation, about a generation and that it catches the zeitgeist of a moment. True all, but it's more. It's the story of friendship (ironically almost), how in modern times the germ or development of an idea is claimed by all, of how the simplest of things can become so intricate in daily life that you forget what it was not to have them. So is it worth watching? Oh hell yes. David Fincher maybe the most vital director around, giving so much more than 'The Facebook Movie', he is giving you a movie full of technical wonder you don't realise your watching (Example? The Twins, played by one man.), giving the film a pace not unlike a thriller (time is non-sequential, energy is not sapped). The cast are startling, Eisenberg especially so. He's Woody Allen's twitchy nervous son, intelligence pouring out, exacting and resulting. Andrew Garfield is possibly the movies heart and soul, Justin Timberlake the cocky, arrogant prick jumping on the band wagon. This has won so many critical awards (this is written before the Oscars) you might forget in years too come how this film will resonate of a time and place. Pretty much the zeitgeist, then. Oh, and don't be surprised when you see The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo being advertised as 'Directed By Oscar Winner David Fincher'."

","This is an intriguing movie, still fresh in my mind despite having seen it some weeks ago. I was surprised at the ""warts and all"" portrayal of Facebook's putative founder Mark Zuckerberg, who, being now seriously rich, can afford the very best defamation lawyers. A good alternative title would have been ""Citizen Zuckerberg"" though he apparently still lives in a nondescript suburban house and drives an old car.<br/><br/>Several points stand out. First the film makers have rather ingeniously used as a framing device two separate court cases dealing with who really invented Facebook, the social networking site, which I am happy to say I do not belong to. Second, Jessie Eisenberg's performance as Zuckerberg is uncanny. It may or may not be true to life but it is absolutely convincing. His Zuckerberg is either afflicted with Asberger's syndrome or else is seriously weird, yet somehow we connect with him. Third, his opponents in one of the cases are the egregious Winklevoss twins, two of a vanishing breed – handsome rich WASP boofheads with an unshakable belief in their entitlement to privilege. They are also now seriously rich, though just a few days ago they lost an attempt in the Federal Court of Appeals to overturn their 2008 settlement with Zuckerberg. They are played by the same actor (Armie Hammer) who puts in two seamless performances. Fourth, Zuckerberg's treatment of his collaborator Eduardo Saverin, which leads to the other set of legal proceedings, is almost beyond belief. Fifth, all the litigation seems to be about a property right which does not exist, namely the ownership of ideas, though the lawyers try to dress it up by inventing contractual rights of doubtful provenance.<br/><br/>As a film, however, this one works very well. The supercharged and chilly atmosphere at Harvard College, where the super-bright slug it out with each other and the super-rich is superbly realized. You may have allies, but no real friends. This writer has some experience of the law school at Harvard and it all rings true. I'm not sure the origin of Facebook can be put down to Zuckerberg taking revenge on the girl who dumped him; Facebook was one of those things whose time had come, though no-one realized its full potential at the time. The Winklevosses, snobs that they were, saw it as a Harvard only site, while Zuckerberg thought the Ivy League colleges were about the total market, though of course he soon discovered the world was his oyster."
"gavin6942","9","2","4","10 January 2011"," By Far David Fincher's Best Work
","This film offers what purports to be the true story of Mark Zuckerberg the founding of Facebook. I suspect it is fairly accurate, as it is based on court documents. What may seem like a simple story of geek innovation is also a story of theft, betrayal, and the rise of modern social networking technology.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg is amazing as Mark Zuckerberg. How accurate he is (or any of the actors are) I do not know. But his geek genius and social ineptitude are clear, and I think that is spot on. Eisenberg was the right choice for the role, as no other person has the geeky vibe but can be a very serious actor (as well as comedian).<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake is also great as Sean Parker. Timberlake does not act often, but when he does, I am often impressed (he was great in ""Black Snake Moan"", for example). Maybe being a talkative big shot is not a stretch for him, but he pulls it off, and gives me a whole new perspective on Parker, a man I have somewhat admired. Though, I admire Shawn Fanning much more, and viewers should not confuse the two -- the film does not make this distinction clear. I had no idea he had any involvement in technology beyond Napster (and I find it odd that a geek would be so party-happy, though I guess he worked more on the investment end).<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey produced this film, and I love him for it. Spacey is an amazing actor, and I am glad to see him move into the realm of producing, not unlike George Clooney if I am not mistaken. Trent Reznor was also involved on the music end. Fincher has long been a Reznor fan, so I think this is a perfect choice, and Trent nails the score. I am surprised his involvement did not get a bigger notice.<br/><br/>David Fincher has been a great director for years. ""Seven"" is obviously his masterpiece, and even the troubled ""Alien 3"" is decent. ""Zodiac"" was a great telling of a classic true crime tale. I think ""Social Network"" might be the best yet, though. While ""Seven"" is his best overall, it suffers from not being a film everyone would want to watch. This one is more universal and very timely, especially with Zuckerberg being 2010's Man of the Year.<br/><br/>If you have not yet caught this one, do so now. I suspect it will get a handful of Oscar nominations, and maybe even a win or two. Fincher's dark visions brought the world of Silicon Valley? Oh, yes!"

","If you have never heard of Aaron Sorkin you should seek out West Wing. One of the best TV shows produced ... EVER. Really great writing and smart plot combined. I didn't know he was responsible for the script for that movie, before I went in, but I should have seen that coming (or hear it in the dialogs).<br/><br/>Of course before all that, was the idea of a movie about Facebook. Or the ""Facebook"" movie as it was also called. It seemed like a joke. Until you heard the director attached to the project. David Fincher! Now why would he want to do a movie about Facebook? I can't really answer that, but I'm guessing he read the book, the main ""character"" of the movie wrote and he found something in it, he liked.<br/><br/>Same must go for Sorkin. His fast paced dialog, might feel a bit distance for some. But for those who came to love it, they will really cherish every line spoken in the movie. If the real deal is as clever and eloquent as Eisenberg who is portraying him? Don't know, but it's not like everything is made as an ode to the Facebook Founder.

Just this year we have been privileged with Inception, The ghost writer and this reviewed title just to name a few. I strongly suspect, no, I KNOW that The Social Network will be a huge contender at 2011's Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Also, do not judge this film as garbage simply because it's about facebook.

","I was bored out of my head trying to watch The Social Network it was just a boring and pointless movie! The lead actor playing Mark Zuckerberg or Zuckerburg whatever the spelling of that crazy name, he did a great job playing the part and I bet he will be nominated for an Oscar for best actor and I can't argue with that, but the movie over all was just boring and a waste of time. I can't believe it has a rating of 8 out of 10 here on IMDb. The other actors were mostly okay but Justin Timberlake was not good or believable at all in his role even though he lost that weight to look younger he doesn't look younger. I thought the whole movie was just boring and pointless, we already know that this Zuckerberg guy is a total a-hole so why do we need a movie about it?"
"korn_issues3","9","2","4","14 November 2010"," A dialogue-driven movie
","This movie has been receiving unprecedented praise and this naturally leads one to ask 'is it worth it?'. Well, a reserved yes. Reserved because I can't say that it will become an influential film, it certainly may become a classic film, but besides from a sharper (read quick intelligence) dialogue it doesn't offer anything new or open up new directions for cinema - aspects I would consider for overwhelming praise. What the film does do, however, is bring together its cinematography, screenplay, music, acting and all other cinematic elements in such an intelligent and entertaining way that is rarely seen in Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>To watch this movie you don't need to have facebook, in fact, you don't even have to care about it (of course these things will help as in-jokes and nods to teenage society are found throughout). This is not a movie for people with facebook, nor is it necessarily about it (at least in its effect on society), but rather it is about the creator/s. Basing it around the people involved means it becomes a film about 'real' relationships and not screen-to-screen ones. If Fincher decided to focus the film on the influence of facebook then it would have become a quasi-documentary. Instead it is a drama, with the screenplay echoing the rapid-fire dialogue seen in many plays (which isn't a surprise considering Sorkin is also a playwright). It certainly isn't natural speech but it didn't need to be. This isn't supposed to be a mirror of reality, it is too polished for that; instead it is a (loosely) true story represented as entertainment, and the witty dialogue is used to create the intellectual atmosphere of Harvard and its characters.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg (the founder) does a great job as a person who has an idea and wants to create it himself. But for this he will have to rely on others. This is where Eduardo (played by Andrew Garfield) comes in with the money to finance it all. What Eduardo brings to the movie is what lifts it into the higher echelons of film: the delicacy and balance of human relationships. Without this it would be a nice movie, with a nice storyline that is nicely filmed. We get that from a lot of Hollywood productions (see Inception), but Sorkin and Fincher are able to add a depth and complication to the characters that ultimately drives the already interesting story. More than any other character, Eduardo is similar to us; he is down-to-earth, wants to make money and does not possess a freakish talent, and thus we can empathize with him. Zuckerberg is different from us, and this is what makes him a fascinating subject. We do not know what to make of him, and are left with the question posed throughout the movie: is he really an asshole?<br/><br/>http://waitingforthrenos.blogspot.com"
"jake-law123","10","2","4","27 October 2010"," Fascinating Topic!
","As a person whose had a Facebook for awhile, I never thought once to how or when it was made, or under what circumstances. Who would've ever thought to make an actual film about the story behind the creators of the popular blog site, Facebook, and what led them to making it. The history behind it is a lot more than I would think. And in this box- office success, it takes us far into the story of how it all started.<br/><br/>After being dumped by his girlfriend, Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg, (Jesse Eisenburg) along with his skilled computer friends, are assigned to create a new blog site by the Winklevoss twins. In no time, they officially create Facebook. But conflicts arise when the twins blame them for stealing their idea. As Facebook becomes more and more popular, Mark becomes one of the most famous people in the world, and to this day is the youngest billionaire in the world.<br/><br/>One thing I loved right off the back about this film was how intelligent the dialogue was. As the beginning progresses, Mark starts hacking into the Harvard computer system which is a very entertaining scene. He starts typing all his notes and thoughts really fast. The editing in this movie killed. I expect an Oscar nomination from this film. It went by quite smooth.<br/><br/>One downfall was the main character. For one thing, he's a real jerk. Yet you feel like your suppose to care for him and like him, which makes you struggle to decide whether you like him or not. I for one liked him, despite his rudeness sometimes. Although they might have twisted the actual person's attitude, the film somehow got away with it.<br/><br/>The other characters are just okay, with Andrew Garfield playing Eduardo Saverin (the vice president of Facebook). He starts getting angry with Mark for taking most of the credit for creating Facebook, leaving him in the dust. Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker was also a lame character, who takes part in Facebook, and turns it upside down.<br/><br/>For what it is, I really liked this film a lot. The characters, the fast paced editing, the idea, and just everything else. With a few flaws, it still turns into a 8/10."

I just assumed he was another Michael Cera, but his performance as Mark Zuckerberg is unlike anything I've seen before. Andrew Garfield also blew me away as Eduardo Saverin.<br/><br/>The script is ridiculously good, full of one-liners and zingers. Zuckerberg doesn't finish the movie looking very good, but through a combination of his witty lines and Eisenberg's performance, I still ended up loving the guy.<br/><br/>The movie is long, but doesn't feel long. It's sort like a biopic of Facebook, but it doesn't feel long or predictable like a lot of biopics. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes movies."

The weaving legal terms are fascinating and the amount of detail encoded about the formulas and constructing is great.<br/><br/>Eisenberg after his impressive comedy outings in Zombieland etc has created the perfect enemy that you can somehow route for whilst being intellectually unmatched throughout. Despite the serious predicament he finds himself in the character can often come up trumps with a killer comedy line.<br/><br/>One very good note to take from this film is that Andrew Garfield will be a great Spider-man. Playing Zuckerberg's best friend Eduardo, he is slick, funny and carries the burden of being the victim in the bigger scenes, the final showdown at the Facebook office is a very strong scene.<br/><br/>The film has a few flaws. For one a showdown between Eduardo and girlfriend Christy about why he hasn't changed his Facebook status to 'in a relationship' makes the whole principle of the site seem ridiculous. Justin Timberlake is hard to take seriously and occasionally there are lapses in repetition, as if the same thing had been discussed before.<br/><br/>Nevertheless this has proved a special surprise.<br/><br/>This is a good strong drama with great leading performances and an unmatched drama by David Fincher to create possible Oscar nominations for next year.<br/><br/>Worth checking out."
"DICK STEEL","10","2","4","23 October 2010"," A Nutshell Review: The Social Network
","Who would have guessed that the next big thing that took the Internet, and the real world, by storm, would be the application that crafts our social network digitally for the online world to see. There's hardly a time I encounter anyone without a Facebook page, or are not actively updating it, unless of course you're stuck in a country that has barred access to it. It's a simple but brilliant idea translated which made the founders billions of dollars and propelling them into the elite club of the superrich, and David Fincher's The Social Network maps a dramatization of how the world's social network got created from the dorm rooms in Harvard University.<br/><br/>Based on the book by Ben Mezrich, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay doesn't bog us down with a mountain of details, choosing instead to focus on the sexier parts which kept the narrative moving at breakneck speed, beginning with the introduction of the socially inept Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) on a disastrous date – the irony of course that he'll be chief architect and co-founder of a social networking site – before heading back to his dorm room in a fit of anger and creating a site that melts the university's network while drunk, and gaining notoriety overnight. With the writing on the wall, Fincher paces this film with such velocity that you'll hardly ever realize that two hours had passed when we reach the obligatory closure titles that pepper a biography.<br/><br/>As with almost every biographical film it comes with a tinge of drama to spice things up, so it's obviously not wise to take this film like the bible word for word, but it does provide an excellent study into the nature of human friendships and business relationships, and how the two often come dangerously close to a collision that will make friends and/or partners fall out of favour with one another, especially since it is fairly easy to surmise that everyone has an opinion of how a company should be run in a post dot-com bubble burst – whether risks are to be taken in a giant leap of faith, or to go down the more traditional route of monetizing a site through ad revenue.<br/><br/>Fincher adopts a non-linear narrative for The Social Network, and you'll be forgiven if you find yourself a little bit disorientated in the beginning, since he throws you into the middle of not one but two lawsuits, one between Mark Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss brothers Cameron and Tyler (both played by Armie Hammer) who are adamant that the technology whizz had stolen their idea when they pitched it to him in the confines of their exclusive club, while the other is between once best friends and roommates Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield, the new Peter Parker/Spiderman) in a relationship and friendship that had gone sour and communications between the two conducted with lawyers as intermediaries. But you'll find your balance soon enough as both narrative threads are equally compelling and engaging to sit through, and you'll begin to see the plenty of issues and challenges that always automatically come along when something or someone becomes successful, otherwise who would bother at all?<br/><br/>As if that is not engaging enough, the introduction of Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) spices things a lot more, as he seduces Mark easily since they talk on a technological level, leaving Eduardo a lot more cautious because of Sean's shady background with drugs and his womanizing ways. But of course if someone brings funding and expertise and know-how for having been there and done that, as well as experience in navigating the tough business waters, then perhaps Sean's deemed as the necessary evil to bring Facebook forward, having to contribute to workable, iconic ideas even, off the cuff. <br/><br/>While Jesse Eisenberg is spot on in his portrayal of a highly intelligent geek with a problematic EQ and as someone who doesn't mince his words, and Andrew Garfield being quite suave as the business economics undergraduate who cannot believe their collective success that skyrockets their popularity and a groupie following, it is Justin Timberlake (who would have thought) as the relatively sleazy Sean Parker who steals the show with his anecdotes, having some of the best lines in the show and being the quasi-villain that the story lacked in the driving of a wedge between two best friends in the dogged quest to have something to do with what he sees as potentially the next big thing in the world. As he will attest to, great ideas somehow have their connections stem back from the female of the species, and here there's no lack of that reference, and truly the film comes alive with the Mark-Eduardo-Sean axis of characters coming together that has trust issues, business and personal friendships all put on the line.<br/><br/>One thing about David Fincher's filmography thus far is his aptitude to tell stories that are dark in nature, epic and biographical. The Social Network has all these rolled into one, with a story about one of the world's most popular website, and the ugliness of how a business relationship can sour genuine friendship into nothing more than a bitter aftertaste. It doesn't pass judgement on its characters, but allows you to form your own conclusions. Definitely one of the best and engaging films of the year, perhaps also because it's something easy to identify with, and based upon a pop cultural tool that's still, I believe, yet to achieve its peak. A must watch!"
"Spyan","8","2","4","20 October 2010"," A depressing and realistic view of the world we live in.
","First off, I'm a huge Fincher fan, Se7en and Fight Club being two of the best movies I've ever seen. He's my favorite director, right above Kubrick, Scorcese and Tarrantino. I've seen all of his movies except ""benjamin button"" which bored me 30 mns from the start (panic room and alien 3 weren't great either). But I'll give it another try.<br/><br/>This one is one of his greatest. I didn't find it enjoyable at all though, and I came out of the theater with a bitter taste in my mouth and feeling totally depressed. That's what's awesome about Fincher. His movies never let you indifferent, you think about them for hours after view.<br/><br/>The photography is, as usual, superb. I think DF isn't interested in shooting a movie with bright light and clearness. Once again, all the imagery is sunk in darkness and shadows, you instantly know it's Fincher's trademark. Makes me think of the Italian Renaissance technique ""Chiaroscuro"", deep shadow/light contrasts.<br/><br/>But beyond the aesthetics, the message is what counts. And as usual, it's dark, cynical and unfortunately very real. It's about people who are very good at what they are doing but very bad at social and moral values. Hence the ironic title of the movie. The only character we can identify with is the victim of the story. All the other characters are merciless and elitist profit-mongers that made me very uncomfortable. I wouldn't want to sound harsh, but similarly to the world of programming and coding (the FB world), this movie mainly pictures individuals devoid of human emotions and completely efficiency and productivity driven. Cold, empty, heartless beings I wouldn't dare to call people. Practically what you could define as machines. And these exact same people apparently rule our world.<br/><br/>So this is truly a Fincher film, beautiful filmmaking serving a solid plot to point out how heartless and hollow our times really are. Or how emptiness and superficiality finally took over. The same issues he was criticizing in Fight Club, only with a lighter tone.<br/><br/>This movie isn't about FB. It's a social commentary about the world we live in. I think most of the people didn't ""get"" this yet. And as usual with Fincher, it's delivered in the most brutal, direct and cold way as can be.<br/><br/>Best 2010 movie so far, but I don't think I'll watch it again."
"bartireid","7","2","4","17 October 2010"," Genesis not quite Genius
","A few minutes into The Social Network we are presented with a fairly staggering piece of irony that stuck with me for the rest of the film, and that is that the would be creator of the ultimate social networking tool would himself be a socially inept outcast eager to find acceptance and inclusion within the Harvard University elite. So in tracing the genesis of the Facebook The Social Network whilst wrestling with concepts of creation and inspiration finds the idea in it's simplest form early on, defining the subject in it's own necessity from the outset.<br/><br/>Core to the film are relatively routine thematic dynamics such as greed, betrayal and of course friendship, those who are familiar with Director David Fincher's previous works such as Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2004) will recognise Fincher's look at the inner workings and purpose of his characters relationships, as well as the speed in which those relationships come and go in way reminiscent of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008).<br/><br/>The Narrative of the film is constructed cleverly through the use of two depositions which effectively provide a running commentary of two stories. Both depositions feature our central character Mark Zuckerburg (Jesse Eisenberg) as he attempts to stave off those claiming credit for the invention that would go on to define him ""The Facebook"". The first sees Zuckerburg headhunted to be chief programmer for ambitious entrepreneurs and athlete twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Armie Hammer) and their associate Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). The trio ask Zuckerberg to help them build a Social Networking Website called ""Harvard Connection"" one of many notions suggested as a potential forerunner for the Facebook concept, the similarity of the sites leads the twins and Narendra to press for legal charges after Facebook explodes in popularity.<br/><br/>The second and more interesting of the depositions focuses on the creation and rise of Facebook, as well as the relationship of co-founders Mark Zuckerburg and Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield. It is here we are also introduced to Justin Timberlake's smooth talking portrayal of Sean Parker who attempts to muscle in on the Facebook frenzy. As mentioned earlier the inner workings, nature and strength of the relationships are inspected by Fincher and the cast here.<br/><br/>So what did I like? Well the cast does a sound job with the nicely calculated script. Eisenberg and Garfield are the highlights for me, both manage to bring conviction and whit to their roles. In addition those who indulge in Facebook themselves will enjoy seeing how the site along with many of it's intricacies were conceived, also there is much to relate within the film's references to how the site has impacted peoples lives and created new social behaviours.<br/><br/>On the flip side the subject matter is ultimately more captivating than it's subjects, who for the most part are reflective of over privileged American youth culture. The climax of the movie is pretty unremarkable and lacks any true climactic tension. With that said it's not enough to detract from what is a solid project, guided by fine work from all involved which should be a largely inclusive viewing experience for movie goers and Facebook lovers a like.<br/><br/>Go see it 7/10"
"Danusha_Goska","8","2","4","17 October 2010"," Film as Greedy and Irritating as Its Subjects; Eisenberg - Wow!
","In ""Social Network,"" Jesse Eisenberg blossoms into an Academy-Award-worthy actor. His performance as Facebook-founder Mark Zuckerberg is, by turns, clammy, cold, vacant, snarky, and mean, as it should be. If this were a better film, I'd watch it again just to savor Eisenberg's performance.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg's/Eisenberg's perfect foils, Cameron and Tyler, the Winklevoss twins, are both played by Armie Hammer, and his performance is also noteworthy. The Winklevoss twins were Harvard students and Olympic athletes from old, WASP money. Actor Armie Hammer is himself from old money. He plays the Winklevoss twins without irony – just, here I am, tall, gorgeous, blond, athletic, brilliant, rich, a superman product of WASP breeding. Given how the politically correct cultural elite of the US has demonized its WASP founders, it's amazing that the twins are not portrayed as bad guys here. They're not good guys, they're just really lucky genetic freaks / Aryan Gods. They are also shown to value old fashioned concepts like honor in business.<br/><br/>That a nerdy, super-smart, manipulative, romantically unsuccessful Jewish kid, Zuckerberg, requires establishment WASP princes and ubermenschen like the Winklevosses to sponsor him, and that the Jewish kid eventually manages, through his triumphant sneakiness and cleverness and litigation, to screw the WASP princes over, is a timeworn tale treated many times before, significantly in Lion Feuchtwanger's ""Jud Suss."" Given how many times storytellers have gone to this well, given the explosive and indeed deadly stereotypes at play, I wish that director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin had ventured anything probing or original here, but they do not.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is every bit like the subjects it treats. The film is desperately needy, and it works too hard. The film is very loud. Characters often exchange key dialogue in clubs with loud music in the background. The dialogue features, every few seconds, a sarcastic retort.<br/><br/>Every scene shouts at the viewer: SOME PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE MUCH SMARTER THAN YOU AND THEY ATTEND EXCLUSIVE PARTIES AND MAKE MONEY YOU CAN'T EVEN DREAM OF. And snort coke off hard-bellied coeds and bungee jump into built-in swimming pools and are serviced by crazed groupies in the stalls of men's rooms. Then they betray each other, and their lives are not always fully emotionally satisfying. You know, I got all that the first time the movie told me, and I really didn't need it repeated over and over and over and over again. The final scene of ""The Social Network"" is unbelievably cheap. If anyone tells you he was moved by that final scene, that person needs to get out more. It's a blatant, failed, attempt at a ""rosebud"" scene.<br/><br/>I liked the film at first, but it really doesn't have anything new to say that I didn't know before I went in, and I was really eager for it to finish up. What, besides Dutch angles and noir cinematography, separates a film like ""The Social Network"" from a masterpiece, also about ambition, its rewards and costs, like ""Sweet Smell of Success"" or ""Citizen Kane""? I think those who made those classics managed distance between themselves and their subjects. Orson Welles did not fall under Hearst's spell.<br/><br/>Fincher and Sorkin appear to be very much in thrall to the smarts, power, and money they want to skewer, but never really do. ""Look at this man! He's much smarter than you! He's much richer than you! And pity him because his social life is not as good as yours!"" They shout.<br/><br/>But then they don't give you any reason to care about this film except its zombie dedication to money and power. ""The Social Network"" says nothing about the power of facebook, or how it's changing society, or even if it is. Scenes exploring those questions would not be as cool as scenes of snorting coke off a blond teenager's belly, or watching one rich man screw over another.<br/><br/>Finally, there's a miracle story here that no one making the film is interested in pursuing, but that shines through, in spite of the film's lust for decadent wealth. Mark Zuckerberg really is smarter than you or I. That's a very wonderful thing. It's also a wonderful thing that he managed to find his way to 21st century Harvard. Had Zuckerberg been born in a mud hut in any number of locales and centuries, his abundant gift at manipulating zeros and ones would have been wasted, or even a curse. That Zuckerberg's gift was allowed to flower in capitalist America is a much bigger story than the pettiness, excess and spite the filmmakers insist on focusing on. Zuckerberg's gift, like Gates' and Jobs', etc, will live on long after he and his cofounders and fellow travelers and everyone who envied these guys or wished them dead is forgotten."

","Jesse Eisenberg is the actor of our generation! That's not an exaggeration.<br/><br/>In The Social Network, Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed by Eisenberg and goes beyond the level of what is usually expected of him. What's been expected of the top names in the business, for that matter. From the first line from Zuckerberg in the film, you are glued—eyes and ears—to the screen. He grips you hard and doesn't let go. He's articulate and such a jerk of a character that you can't help to be fascinated and enticed by him.<br/><br/>Behind the camera is David Fincher (who is well known for Fight Club) and the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (famous for the stageplay and screenplay A Few Good Men) and they both do an incredible job to landscape this film. What speaks out, besides them is the score by Nine Inch Nails frontman, Trent Renzor. I've heard Charlie Clouser's music and they are both Nine Inch Nails but very different film composing. From that very first note from Renzor, it's chills up your spine.<br/><br/>First scene sets the tone for the amazing story of the origins of Facebook. I really can't tell you that this film is about the origins of Facebook, because it's beyond that. I went into this movie expecting a lame, boring and slow paced biography of Mark Zuckerberg. This story is told through flashbacks during a deposition where Zuckerberg is being sued by his co-founding partner, Edwardo (Andrew Garfield).<br/><br/>It's more than just the origins of Facebook. It's about the people behind it. It's got a lot more substance and endearing plot elements than I ever expected. It's got a great cinematography due to the fact of the ever-changing lighting. Acting is phenomenal and I definitely didn't expect it from Eisenberg nor Timberlake.<br/><br/>When it comes to his previous roles, I enjoyed him to an extent, but this role I was ecstatic for each and every time he opened his mouth. I wasn't interested in the movie, but I saw it for the sake of seeing it. I'm very glad I did because if you need to see two movies from 2010, you need to see Inception and The Social Network. This is one of those don't miss it movies. Facebook is a $25 billion company...find out why."
"pyrocitor","9","2","4","11 October 2010"," Text-speak as high drama
","If the idea of the creation of a social networking site for college students yielding the world's youngest billionaire feels surreal, then the notion of a box office smash hit about a young man creating a website should prove even more indicative of the disorientation of the self- appointed ""age of media"". Nonetheless, David Fincher's The Social Network is happy to hit the ground running, apparently thinking of itself as a current day All the President's Men (or, as Fincher calls it, ""the Citizen Kane of John Hughes movies"") through being a suspenseful, youth-oriented movie providing a 'commentary on its time'. That the film's overall tone is far more snappy, cynical and noncommittal is as telling of ""the times, a-changin'"", as it is poignantly hard to tell whether Fincher's film fails to make any grander statements about its era or youth culture, or, ironically, through skirting the issue it perfectly represents them. <br/><br/>However, first and foremost, The Social Network functions as both drama and character study, detailing the now infamous story of 19 year old Mark Zuckerberg's spark of internet genius spiralling into a series of heated dramatic confrontations, lawsuits, explosions of stock and cementing a place in the cultural lexicon unlike any other, now known as the website/company/landmark Facebook. It is important to keep in mind that the film, while rooted in fact, is an unabashedly embellished and fictionalized telling predicated more on dramatic effect than factual realism (with some of the points of the story reeking more of obvious artifice than others – particularly the tragically ironic ending). However, if nothing else, there is no doubt that Fincher and screen writing Aaron Sorkin have created one of the more exciting films of college students speaking fervently over computers to hit cinemas in ages, as Sorkin's slickly polished script allows each line to crackle with the visceral immediacy of a fistfight.<br/><br/>In fact, the film functions so well as an impeccably oiled machine that it largely vetoes its own concerns about bias within the story (whether or not Zuckerberg is 'to blame' for allegedly stealing the idea of Facebook from a commission from fellow Harvard students, ruthlessly cutting his own best friend out of his company, troubling preconceptions of private and public spaces and so forth), treating everything, characterization included, as if subjective, circumstantial evidence at a trial, up for individual interpretation and reprocessing. Sorkin leaves it nearly impossible to 'root' for anyone or anything in particular, as the narrative feels locked into a consistent feeling of wheels inextricably in motion, beyond all notions of emotional investment and simply intended to be appraised and marvelled at. One could raise the concern of the film being too emotionally closed and distant (particularly ironic for a film about a social network predicated on ""bringing people together""), were it not for the envisioned rebuttal, as if delivered in a rapid-fire, acerbic monotone by Jesse Eisenberg, that it simply has bigger fish to fry than satisfying trite, conventional emotional expectations. This is a film with a story to tell and a message about its times to convey (albeit in a somewhat muddled fashion), and, like a good piece of software, it refuses to compromise or slow down in the midst of accomplishing its core objectives. <br/><br/>Even Fincher's visual aesthetic captures this sense of sleek efficiency, his crisp, clean cinematography drinking in a depiction of Harvard neither excessively romanticized or banking on stereotypes. Channeling the driven anxiety of his antihero protagonist, Fincher shoots conversations and programming sessions like nail- biting stakeouts and college parties as if alienating action sequences, keeping the pace brisk and the tone ominous throughout. If nothing else, it is refreshing to see a film set at a college which doesn't come across like a beer commercial montage (although it is clear which beer brand gave Fincher the most funding), thankfully concentrating more on the story and characterizations as self-contained rather than wallowing in attempting to deliver another banal treatise on ""this is what the point of college really is"". <br/><br/>As characterizations go, it would be difficult to ask for a more grimly memorable one than Jesse Eisenberg's (undeniably artistic licence fuelled) take on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Muting his natural neurotic charisma through a steely deadpan and constant, unmoving half-frown, Eisenberg proves scarily good not only at inhabiting the piercing, controlled mania of Zuckerberg but also turning him into an oddly sympathetic, Machiavellian antihero, just as easy to respect and even like as to despise – it is easy to picture business majors worldwide taking notes. In contrast, Andrew Garfield brings a far more familiar emotional centre to the film as Zuckerberg's eventually jilted friend and business partner Eduardo Saverin. With a casual, likable aura and welcome strains of humour (one of the best scenes of the film is Saverin's agonized confession at not knowing how to change his own Facebook relationship status), Garfield makes Saverin's fade out from the Facebook all the more upsetting, providing intriguing counterpoint to Zuckerberg's snappy success. Finally, in a gleefully self-reflexive piece of casting, Justin Timberlake oozes glamour and sleaze as the manipulative creator of free music downloading site Napster, not chewing scenery so much as salivating upon it and providing a deliciously detestable face to corporate ambition. <br/><br/>While it may or may not have as much to say about the presence of technology in contemporary social relations, the blurring of the spheres of private and public and the tension between individual or collective success as it may or may not mean to, The Social Network provides an impressively assembled slice of fun and profundity, with all creative talents concerned functioning at the top of their games. Even (or perhaps especially) for those few still to be drawn in by the seductive allure of Facebook, Fincher's film still proves an intriguing and even exhilarating watch, and one of the best films of its year. <br/><br/>'Like'. <br/><br/>-8.5/10"

Andrew Garfield(who played Eduardo Saverin) is another Gem, he pulled the role so well, you would hate him many time being so self-centered.

","The critics are falling all over themselves praising this film, predicting a armload of Oscars for the principals come March, and that could very well happen, but The Social Network doesn't seem like any kind of modern-day classic to me.<br/><br/>What strikes one while watching it is the skillful way Sorkin, Fincher, and the actors can hold your interest for 2 hours with a story about a socially-awkward computer wiz's rise to the top and the pesky lawsuits he had to endure, which seem real important during the film, but eventually result in settlements.<br/><br/>Apparently Fincher can make any subject matter interesting, and Sorkin's rapid-fire script had the audience I watched with hanging on every word. You had to pay attention. If you were distracted for 5 seconds, you might miss 4 lines of dialogue. And while all of it was clever, there were no great truths coming from the actor's mouths. There wasn't much of a theme to latch on to here, other than the irony of a friendless geek creating the biggest social phenomenon on the web. As far as I could tell, everyone just wanted to get paid. Except Justin Timberlake's character who wanted to get laid and high as well. He was great, by the way.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg was also great (again) evolving from his usual intelligent, self-conscious, sensitive guy to an intelligent, self-conscious, insensitive guy. Not much of a leap that Eisenberg manages easily. I didn't hate his character at the end as much as everyone else seems to. Best bud Andrew Garfield and rich guy(s) Armie Hammer were good too. <br/><br/>I guess the lack of real conflict or suspense is the cause for the slight flatness I felt at the end. I knew Zuckerberg was going to come out filthy rich and in the absence of any personal epiphany from him, the fate of his former best bud just wasn't enough to get me emotionally involved. (Don't worry, he got paid -- along with everyone else.)"

"colinrgeorge","10","2","4","1 October 2010"," With Friends Like These...
","The genius of ""The Social Network"" begins with the story that inspired it. The tagline on its poster, ""You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies,"" perfectly conveys the inherent dramatic irony; royal narcissist Mark Zuckerberg is today the champion of the web's most popular socialization tool, Facebook.<br/><br/>It's rich soil for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who imbues the material with his signature wit and a searing theatricality. Frankly, I'm not concerned with what small liberties his brilliant script took along the way—Not that even the most obscene inaccuracy could stymie the momentum he builds. The film is guiltier of embellishment than falsification, a crime for which he and director David Fincher should be awarded our highest praise. Fincher knocks this one out of the park with confident cinematography, nuanced performances from his cast, and layered storytelling that lends the film its surprising depth. On its surface, ""The Social Network"" is funny, brisk, and compelling, but underneath, it's near rotting with angst. <br/><br/>Its moodiness and purposeful visual melodrama are its most unique assets. Fincher approaches the story from the position of Zuckerberg himself, striving for the honest emotional experience of each scene, with all the grandiosity of a nineteen year old's perspective. To the layman, that means he finds a way to make sitting at a computer, or having a conversation in a crowded nightclub seem invigorating and fresh.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is immediately in contention as his best film, but as much as Fincher brings to it, the lion's share of the Mark Zuckerberg experience is etched in the long, perpetually unsmiling face of Jesse Eisenberg, who portrays him in the film. Eisenberg has a history of taking on lighter roles in comedies like ""Zombieland"" that has prompted some to unfairly label him ""the poor man's Michael Cera,"" (though the comments seem to stem from Cera bashers themselves—There's no pleasing those guys). Eisenberg's turn here should slap the cynicism from any remaining doubters' mouths. He owns the role; the callous calculation, the condescending sense of humor, and the introverted inner pain are expertly realized, and yet the true testament to Eisenberg is that Zuckerberg at his worst is a character impossible to truly hate.<br/><br/>And Eisenberg is matched by a cast of equal talent; Andrew Garfield plays Facebook's co- founder, Eduardo Saverin, and Armie Hammer plays both of the Winklevoss twins, who together bring suit against Mark for intelligent property theft. The beauty of each character is that despite their muckraking in the deposition room, which acts as a framing device in ""The Social Network,"" none ultimately feels like the antagonist. As with the best cinematic scuffles, we identify with both sides.<br/><br/>But as beautifully as the stars aligned for what is insofar the best film of 2010, ""The Social Network"" is somehow more than the sum of its parts. Its underlying themes of capitalist corrosion and the price of success are made all the more poignant given the age of its participants. Fincher has jokingly referred to the film as ""The Citizen Kane on John Hughes movies,"" but he honestly isn't far off. Young love, rebelliousness, arrogance, and burgeoning identity play major roles in shaping the behavior of Sorkin's characters.<br/><br/>And yet, for all their bitterness and hostility, ""The Social Network"" is still an exciting, encouraging film. Somewhere beneath the veneer, alongside the greased cogs in its innermost workings, the power of Mark's idea gestates. Facebook, as silly and as trivial a subject as it may seem, is for many an essential communicative hub in their day-to-day lives. Watching Zuckerberg succeed beyond his wildest dreams, literally bringing strangers together while pushing his friends away, paints an oddly optimistic portrait.<br/><br/>The future for the internet generation seems bright in Fincher's mind. Even as we make the gradual shift to living our lives electronically, even when we're polluted by a consumer culture, and even when we lose sight of our humanity, some kid can still change the world."

","While watching this movie, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.
The movie lasts around 2 hours but to me it seemed like half an hour.
All this is thanks to specially a great editing, but also the script and narration that gives this movie an amazing rhythm and tempo.
To me, this is by far the best part of this nice movie.<br/><br/>Although the script is not bad, and it also helps to provide this movie with such a nice tempo, fastest movie I've seen since Billy Wilder's ""One, Two, Three"" (1961). However, I don't find the dialogs as smart as other people do, that consider Aaron Sorkin's scripts very intellectual. Conversations are just normal for me, if you want to see intellectual scripts then I'd refer you to Joseph L. Mankiewicz movies like ""All about Eve"" (1950) or Igmar Bergman movies.<br/><br/>Also I found some elements of the script a bit artificial and flawed. Starting with the initial scene, where Erica and Mark are having a discussion, then the audience ""discovers"" that they are in a relationship in a very artificial way, by having one of the characters say it: MARK: ""We are dating"" this should be the last resource used when screenwriting, same goes for the way they break up just in the next line: ERICA: ""Not anymore""<br/><br/>Regarding the photography, and the way Fincher directed actors, It was quite mediocre during the film which doesn't really matter because they weren't really important elements for this movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall I gave this movie a solid grade because I enjoyed watching this movie and in my opinion, entertainment is something that should be appreciated when rating a movie."

","It is never an easy task to adapt a true story, let alone such a recent and contemporary biography. However David Fincher has succeeded. He has done it in the best possible way.
'The social network' tells us how the famous Mark Zuckerberg founded the popular social network 'Facebook'. Fincher tells us a story of power, ambition, and above all treason. All through a script that will jump between different times, each filling the holes that are planted. Although clearly a good script is not enough if there is not a good director behind, and luckily this film finds David Fincher at its highest point. We are probably facing one of his best works so far. Although we must not neglect the great performance provided by Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, possibly the best one he has performed to date.
One of the most fluid and best worked films that David Fincher has given us, that is 'The social network', despite not being totally perfect, the director knows how to transfer a current story to the cinematographic field in a way that is strong enough so as not to depend on the real protagonists and the name 'Facebook', since the film is capable of supporting itself."

Revisiting the movie in 2020 was very different (and not just because Zuckerberg feels more and more like Eisenberg these days). I was able to just watch it as a movie. This film tells a company's origin story through depositions and flashbacks. That should not work. But it does. From Resnor's score ramping up the intensity to the brilliant pacing/cuts to the pitch perfect performances of Sorkin's dialogue, this story just cooks. No matter where you come in, you HAVE to keep watching. And for once Sorkin's resists explaining his theme through speeches over and over.

","Looking back in the past decade, The Social Network was the one movie I had to settle the score with. I have lost count of how many times I have watched it now and every time I watch it, the movie gets better and better. This is Fincher's best work in terms of critically acclaimed and award winning and I can definitely see why.<br/><br/>The reason why this movie works so well and it doesn't becomes one of those generic and boring biopics is the tone. Fincher creates the whole tone of the film using the cinematography and the score to absolute perfection. The way certain scenes are presented, the way Fincher uses closeups and the score to elevate the scene is amazing.
The movie has some of the most dis-likeable actors for me (Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake) acting in it, but I have to say that they do a really good job at keeping up with the level of everyone else involved in this film. And you can argue that that's Fincher pushing them to the limits of their potential.
Now apart of Fincher, one of the other reasons this movie works so well is because of the screenplay. It feels like you can do no wrong with a screenplay written this well. I think that the reason why the viewing experience gets even better each time you watch it, it's because of the screenplay. There is so much in it, given so fast, so slick that it's hard to absorb it all in one or two viewings. This is a very rare screenplay and Fincher knew it for deviating from his usual genre and do this biopic. The script it's so detailed, it's slick, it's sharp, it's smart and witty and I love it.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a fantastic film. It's one of those films you can't wait to pass some time so you can watch it again and that is the best compliment I can give to a film."

Everything from screenplay to soundtrack was at it's optimum state, David Fincher did an amazing job which i doubt that anyone else could've done. The movie isn't just about the success and rise of Facebook, At it's core it's a tragic representation about how those once inseparable friends turned on each other because of greed or power."

","David Fincher directs ""The Social Network"". A film detailing the events of Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg creating the social networking site that would become known as Facebook, and how he is sued by the twins who claimed he stole their idea, and by the co-founder who was later squeezed out of the business. This film is a very well made and captivating film. The performances from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield are stunning standouts. Fincher directs this film in a great way, as its riveting score, excellent editing, and cinematography, give this film which doesn't necessarily deal the darkest of subjects, a somewhat intense and dark aesthetic to it. The script is brillant, as this is a film that relys heavily on dialogue, so the script had to be great. This film deals with true events, leaving it no room for narrative creation, but it still packs a heavy punch. As this film is relevant, important, sophisticated, engaging in every way, and depicts the relations of business and ideas, and the choices that lead to the future. The film really explodes in a good way when the arguments over rights and business opportunities happen between Zuckerberg and Savrin. Jesse Eisenberg turns the character into someone you'd love to hate, yet cant quite seem to, as he is a very sensible and intelligent asshole. The dialogue is slick and powerful, and the way the past and at the time present is interwoven together is masterfully crafted and structured. This film is razor sharp in many ways. The film is not intense in the usual way, but more through dialogue and the emotion of characters. And in the end, Mark Zuckerberg realizes his petty nature. The film is about relationships and freinds and what they mean in the digital age. He feels bad for screwing Eduardo, and using him. Mark spends most of the film attempting to distinguish himself. Eduardo saw through Sean's facade, while Mark didn't. Mark is just trying to make Facebook the best that it can be, until the end, he does the first human thing of the entire film, and reaches to someone, expressing remorse. Or, it could be seen as Mark revealing his shallow nature, and depicting his isolation, even though he has money and power."

","At last, a movie you can actually discuss afterward. And not just on Facebook or Twitter. No, you'll want to chew it over in person, with friends, for hours.<br/><br/>When was the last time that happened?<br/><br/>The movie would be ""The Social Network,"" the highly anticipated collaboration between director David Fincher (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (TV's ""West Wing""), which has its Friday night at the gala opening of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center. (The movie opens wide Oct. 1.)<br/><br/>
The complex drama, about the founding of Facebook and the conflicting claims over who deserved credit for its invention, lives up to the hype. ""Social Network"" is smart, lively, well-acted and - this is key - raises questions and issues that are both timeless and totally of the moment.<br/><br/>Oh, sure, you probably spent time palavering after seeing ""Inception"" this summer, but that was trying to figure out just what the hell actually happened. How many dream levels were there again? And why were they mucking around in all that snow near the end?<br/><br/>In a way, ""Social Network"" seems almost a throwback to the great movies of the late 1960s and '70s. It taps into the zeitgeist. It's about what's happening now. Right now. And it has a viewpoint - well, actually, a bunch of them.<br/><br/>In the same way that ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The Godfather"" were all provocative films, so is ""Social Network."" Like those earlier movies (but without the torrent of bullets and actual blood), it raises questions about who's good, what's right and the definition of success in America.<br/><br/>""Social Network"" begins in late 2003 with dweeby 19-year-old Harvard-ite Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) getting dumped in a noisy bar by his girlfriend (Rooney Mara). He goes back to his dorm room, begins drinking and writes vicious hurtful things about her on his blog, including revealing her bra size. Classy guy.<br/><br/>
Immediately afterward, on a tear, he hacks into the Harvard computer system and creates a site called Facemash. It features the faces of two female students side by side, and viewers are asked to rate which one is hotter. Within hours, the site has received more than 20,000 hits and crashes the Harvard server.<br/><br/>It's Revenge of the Nerds, writ small. Soon it becomes Revenge of the Nerds, writ large.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg, socially inept but always the smartest guy in the room, goes on to conceive the idea for Facebook, the now global social network that has made him into the world's youngest billionaire.<br/><br/>Or does he? Because success has many fathers while failure is an orphan, there are competing claims for Facebook's founding. While no one argues that it was Zuckerberg's brains and programming skills that built the system, he later faced legal challenges from other Harvard-ites who claimed they, too, had been there at the social network's birth.<br/><br/>These competing claims, both in the deposition room and in flashback, make up the heart of the movie. One comes from Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), a fellow geek and Zuckerberg's self-described best friend, who provides the seed money for Facebook. The second lawsuit is filed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, twins who are everything that Zuckerberg and Saverin are not: socially skillful, preppy and successful athletes. (They rowed crew at Harvard and later in the Olympics.)"

","Overall, the movie was very well directed and sophisticated. In fact, the only flaw I found with this movie is that it may have been a bit too sophisticated at times. As someone who is not as technologically savvy as Mark Zuckerberg, I often found it hard to understand what he was talking about. Although I am aware that the reason Jesse Eisenberg's lines (as Mark Zuckerberg) were so advanced in vocabulary was to portray Mark as accurately as possible, it made it hard for viewers such as myself to fully grasp what was going on. Other than that, this film was astounding. It really helped me get to know Mark as more than just the founder of Facebook. When I first learned that we would be watching this film in class, I had very low hopes to be quite honest, as I had never even heard about this movie before. I am glad that I was wrong, and I actually ended up liking this movie very much. It was about more than just the creation of Facebook. It was about friendship and betrayal, as well as supply and demand. In this case, Facebook, allowing its users to connect and interact with one another, is the supply whereas its users' desire to connect with others is the demand. As demand went up, so did the supply, which is what would lead to Mark becoming the youngest billionaire (at that time). Overall, it was an exceptional film and well worth the watch."

Nothing deep but just gets you thinking about something other than money at the moment the film closes. My only fault with the film is that I wouldn't have made it at all. So it turns out that Mark Zucherberg became the youngest billionaire ever by being extremely selfish. That's probably not a surprise but the one good thing about Mark Zucherberg, the one thing that redeems him from creating social media, is that he could be an inspiration for young people to strive for success through education rather than through bullying. Maybe Mark should be exposed as a bad person, however in this case I think the better thing for humanity would actually be to keep that behind closed doors and let him at least be an inspiration for the next generation to work harder at school."

","Review:
'The Social Network' is a biographical-drama film directed by David Fincher. It is based on Ben Mezrich's 2009 book 'The Accidental Billionaires'.
Who would have thought a movie based off the creation of Facebook would be entertaining, let alone of the best movies of 2010.
On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room as a small site among friends soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history, but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications.
All the performances in the movie are great. Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, who has a fast-paced, nerdy, kind of jerk-ish attitude, and Andrew Garfield is his best friend, found me rooting for him through the whole film, even more than Mark. Justin Timberlake does a decent job but is lost among the other performances.
The direction comes from David Fincher who has had variable success, all the way from 'Alien 3' to 'Se7en', but here he is right on form with a flashy, but tightly structured, presentation that never fails to command your attention and interest. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, which is crazy given the context of the film. Only Fincher could make that happen.
Overall, the movie keeps your attention throughout with great performances and an intriguing story. It shows different sides of one story and how much it took to get Facebook off the ground.
4.5/5"
"JMichaelAtchue","9","0","0","2 September 2019"," Brilliant, Bold, and Heartbreaking
","I won't mince words: ""The Social Network"" is a brilliant film. Brilliant direction, brilliant writing, brilliant acting, and a brilliant score all come together to tell a tale of greed, sex, money, and the irony of a man with a million followers but zero friends. Certain aspects of the film already feel dated, and the ending could use some work, but overall ""The Social Network"" is a knock-out.<br/><br/>The film isn't all that historically accurate - there was no Erica Albright who inspired Facebook and Zuckerberg wasn't the totally ruthless, emotionless robot Aaron Sorkin makes him out to be. But the movie's story, a classic tragedy of power and broken friendships, is a powerful look into a contemporary world increasingly dominated by social media.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg is stellar as Mark Zuckerberg, who's the perfect protagonist for ""The Social Network."" While the script exaggerates his many flaws, the movie paints a searing portrait of our modern cultural landscape by choosing to show him as a cold narcissist who is able to create one of the biggest social media phenomenons of all time despite being socially inept. Fincher and Sorkin use Zuckerberg to examine not just Facebook but an entire era where the internet suddenly has the power to change the world in a matter of minutes and the number of followers you have on social media means more than the value of your genuine friendships.<br/><br/>The greatest scene in the movie brings these themes to the surface so beautifully when Eduardo, fed up with Zuckerberg's betrayals, smashes Mark's computer and tells him, ""I'm not coming back for 30%, I'm coming back for everything."" As Eduardo is escorted out of the building Facebook employees celebrate the milestone of a million users signing up for the website. Mark may have a million followers, but his one true friendship is long gone. Aside from being highly memorable this scene does much to showcase Andrew Garfield's skill an an actor - his performance is by far the best in the film.<br/><br/>As to be expected from David Fincher the technical aspects of ""The Social Network"" are almost flawless: the movie has such a distinct look and feel that evokes the early 2000s without really becoming a period piece. The editing and pacing are on-point and the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is a driving, brutal soundtrack that animates the film's endless scenes of code writing, computer hacking, and litigation that might otherwise have been dull. Although there's a few points in the film where the score becomes repetitive, and the usage of dubstep is unneeded, the music is still impressive.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" was certainly one of the best films of 2010, but that doesn't make it a perfect movie. The film overuses obscure technical jargon, especially in the first act, and the ending just doesn't cut it. After two hours of gripping drama the movie screeches to an abrupt halt with a finale that contradicts the whole premise of the main narrative: a young lawyer tells Mark that although he's not a bad person, he ""tries so hard to be."" In contrast, nearly everything that Mark said or did throughout the movie showed that he's a jerk even to his best friend but doesn't care - and maybe doesn't even realize it. He isn't trying to be a bad person, he just is and that's what ironically resulted in Facebook. The ending doesn't ruin the movie by any means but it does undermine its central theme.<br/><br/>Further, the movie already feels dated. Mark's petty rivalries and backstabbing now appear quaint in a time when the real Zuckerberg has been accused of selling Americans' personal information to the Russians, who may or may not have swung the 2016 election to a man who himself is very much a product of our chaotic social media landscape. The movie's story is still compelling and entertaining, but I almost wish that Fincher and Sorkin had waited another ten years to make ""The Social Network"" so that these newer and more interesting questions could've been addressed. ""The Social Network"" is imperfect but nonetheless it's a towering artistic achievement that well-deserved its critical praise and box office success. 9/10."
"anothermyrla","2","0","0","3 August 2019"," Lots of drama infusion to make the movie more interesting...
","A lot of events that are portrayed in the movie did not happen in real life, but that's not to say that a lot of events in the movie did happen. however. Mark Zuckerberg did not have a girlfriend that he broke up with that made him begin The Facebook, he had the girlfriend then that he is with now. I also found the movie VERY degrading towards women, as they were portrayed as dumb, emotional drama queens that wore fancy makeup and suggestive clothing who were either stripping, sleeping with the men, or completely unaware of the men's entrepreneurial ideas. The ONLY reason I had to give the movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because I loved Trent Reznor's soundtrack to this movie. Bravo to him."

","The Social Network was never a film on my radar but upon hearing that David Fincher directed it and Aaron Sorkin wrote it, I had to go check this film out. I have no regrets.<br/><br/>The Social Network is definitely one of the most engaging dramas I've had the pleasure of watching. Everything was pretty much bang on. Fincher's direction was immaculate. Every scene was clear and had a great style to it. What really stood out to me was Sorkin's script. I knew Sorkin was one of the best scriptwriters working today but here I was just in awe at his work. Each and every dialogue felt captivating and added a lot of personality to everyone's character especially Mark Zuckerberg. The cinematography was top-notch and the music throughout felt very fitting to whatever was going on in the scene.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg owned the role of Zuckerberg. He delivered his lines so well and proved to me that he is capable of handling a serious role. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake were also perfect in their roles and gave their best performances.<br/><br/>Even if the film is factually inaccurate at times, the drama and conflict that takes place between the characters creates such an investing experience that you tend not to think about what aspects of the film are true or false.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend The Social Network. On a technical level this movie is outstanding. The direction by Fincher and screenplay from Sorkin provides us an engrossing insight into the troubles faced by Zuckerberg after the creation of Facebook. This film has to be watched if you've never seen it."

","1 March 2014. After three years of avoiding watching this film because I knew I wouldn't like it, especially the title character, perhaps I had been channeling Steve Jobs or something, but now that the deed is done, I must admit I was wrong. There is subtle elegance in how all the characters came across. What makes this movie so meaningful and powerful is its deliver of non-stereotypical, flat, overly dramatic characters and instead the audience is offered up a more complex and deliciously appealing set of characters that seem real and sympathetic in almost every person presented. I enjoyed how the movie ended and how each character seemed to be a victim of the system of economics of business development, each with their own honorable take on how it should be.<br/><br/>This movie isn't so much about right and wrong, but how one's own personal identity interacts with the innate conflicts and tensions of anything new. There is both sufficient anger and sympathy to go all around. While I didn't like the constant flashback technique used in this movie as the background method of presenting the main story, I can't really come up of another way it could have been done, which says a lot in itself."

","Finally came around to watching the most popular movie about mr. Zuckerberg and the founding of his little website..<br/><br/>The film opens with Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) at Harvard University in 2003. Mark was just dumped by his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) for being a jerk. His reaction to this is to post insulting things about her on his blog while simultaneously hacking the University database to illegally download pictures of all the female members and drinking lots of beers. With the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) he uses the downloaded pictures to create the website ""Facemash"" (which ranks two girls and the user picks the hottest), which is so popular that in a short time it crashes the whole University computer network. The University is not pleased but Mark's website did draw the attention of three Harvard upper-class members, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra, who have an idea for a social network featuring exclusive Harvard members and aimed at dating. They ask if Mark likes to join their project as a programmer.
Mark agrees to work on their project but then starts to create his own online social network called 'thefacebook', funded with the help of Eduardo and leaves the Narendra and the Winklevoss brothers in the dark of what he is really doing. When he launches thefacebook website it immediately becomes a success, which infuriates the Winklevoss brothers who blame him for stealing their idea. Things get more and more tense when thefacebook grows and Mark draws the attention of playboy and Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), who would like to work with him and make it a billion dollar project..<br/><br/>Overall this is a good movie; I really liked the chemistry between the main characters (Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield, who stole the movie for me) and it's story kept me watching even though you already know what happens (I guess everybody knows what Facebook is during this day and age). The supporting cast did a fine job as well and I was surprised by the performance of Justin Timberlake (or was he just acting as himself..? ). The message of the movie is clear (the young techs are coming!) and it leaves it to the viewer to make up your mind about Zuckerberg true intentions.<br/><br/>What bugged me the most in this movie is that they portrayed Zuckerberg as a lonely nerd and that he was still lovesick about some girl he dated years ago. The real Zuckerberg was in a relationship during the time this movie takes place and he married his girlfriend in 2012, which is a huge difference with the Zuckerberg we see in the movie. It's also interesting that they tell the story in a flashback style with the courtroom being the present time but it's sometime a little bit difficult to follow what event happened first. But despite this it's a fine movie with good acting, some comedy moments and an interesting story about how one of the biggest websites ever was founded.<br/><br/>Check out this film if you like dramas with some comedy elements and are interested in Zuckerbergs story and the rise of Facebook. But don't expect it to be 100% accurate. (as is usual in biography's)"

A convoluted tale of raw conflict on the origins of a new type of web site should not lend itself to an expensive movie as opposed to a television documentary.

","The screenplay from Aaron Sorkin really makes this film. It makes what could have been a boring concept thrilling and absorbing. The dialogue is so visceral and quick-fire that I never lost interest despite not knowing all the jargon being used. David Fincher's direction is focused which really helps keep the narrative flowing. I never found myself bored because of the excellent combination of writing and direction. <br/><br/>Jesse Eisenburg's performance as Mark Zuckerberg is thrilling as he plays what is almost an insufferable genius to perfection, whilst his performance is grounded by the excellent Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, the co-founder of Facebook. No character is truly moral, all working with their own agendas and interests which creates realistic conflict. When Saverin confronts Zuckerberg about his shares in the company being diluted it ends up being one of the best scenes in the film because of this.<br/><br/>There also must be a mention to Justin Timberlake's portrayal of Sean Parker, who is the closest thing to an antagonist in the film, with how he clashes with Saverin and in effect forces him out of Facebook. <br/><br/>The only issues I had with the film was when it cut back to the lawsuit going on in the present day, as I felt it disrupted the pace of the narrative somewhat, and that the ending seemed a little abrupt.<br/><br/>I know the subject matter has probably been somewhat glamourised to make the narrative more entertaining, but it certainly succeeds there."

","The Social Network Review In American cinema, the ""get rich or die trying"" mantra is exemplified in several figures from the rugged frontiersman out in the old west (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly and the Revenant), the business tycoon (Citizen Kane and Wolf of Wall Street), and the various American gangsters fulfilling their ethnic stereotypes (Godfather, Scarface, and the Departed). These figures in these movies have many positive qualities like bravery, craftiness, and determination, however, they also have many vices, greed, and thirst for power is the most notable.<br/><br/>In David Fincher's, the Social Network our protagonist is no different. Mark Zuckerburg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, personifies a new generation of anti-hero the jaded and insecure computer nerd. Mark feels he needs to distinguish himself from others, while at the hyper-competitive Harvard. Mark's motivation to be better, however, turns into an obsession. This obsession to be the best jeopardizes his relationship with everyone who is close to him like his girlfriend and best friend.<br/><br/>The Social Network succeeds like a good gangster flick by showing how Mark's time at Harvard and his determination to succeed turned him into a monster or as the film would call an ""asshole."" An interesting question driving the film is Mark an individual ""asshole"" or a byproduct of a narcissistic society? By answering the question about Mark, it should also make you take a moment to pause and question yourself and wonder if you have ever been an asshole.<br/><br/>What makes this protagonist so well done is that Mark's online experiences are relatable for many young people watching the film. In a new era where everything is online from how 'beautiful' people think you are to messages about your ex that you wish you could take back. The Social Network covers a lot of ground about these brand new social dynamics that are still in 2017 are little discussed, and it seems like little resistance to social media is given.<br/><br/>In 2010 Facebook was the premier social network, but now the number of apps is only growing from twitter, snapchat, Instagram, tinder, and myspace to a name a few (okay I am making a joke about the last one no one still uses myspace). But these new social networking sites have influenced the way humans interact and how we view each other in our societal hierarchy. The networks have changed society with little resistance, and little discussion and the Social Network does an excellent job in trying to tackle this issue.<br/><br/>You will have to watch the movie to see if Mark is ever free from being ""wired in"" but it will defiantly make you reconsider both the utility of social networking sites like Facebook and the need to be the best. In sum, excellent acting and a thoughtful and original script make it worth at least one watch. The only con is that the secondary characters have little arc as the protagonist Mark takes center stage. Therefore the film could have been stronger if the other characters like Eduardo and Sean weren't so flat and linear."

","I'm guessing, without really knowing, that Mark Zuckerberg would have heavily lobbied against this film ever coming out. It's not exactly flattering in it's portrayal of the man as a socially inept, should I say it, total a..hole, and it's a credit to Jesse Eisenberg that he was able to pull off the characterization so successfully. One thing I really couldn't figure out about Zuckerberg from watching the movie was what really motivated him. It probably had to do with creating something that exceeded anyone's expectations, because I didn't get a sense that he was in it for the money. Most folks would be, which is why the betrayal aspect of diluting Eduardo Saverin's (Andrew Garfield) ownership stake came across as so, so underhanded. What's ironic in the final analysis is that Zuckerberg wound up with five hundred million 'friends' on Facebook when in real life, he had all he could do to maintain one, and he blew that up pretty successfully. That was in 2010 when the movie came out. Facebook is about to achieve two billion! users at it's current pace, sometime in 2017 as I write this. That's over twenty five percent of the world's population! As a contrarian, I've never joined and have no interest. From what I've read, the site is too intrusive regarding your personal stats, and there are enough eyes watching everything you do as it is, from credit card monitoring to using your cell phone. Impossible to stay off the grid totally, until someone comes up with a reverse Facebook. Maybe then I'll sign up."

","Mark Zuckerburg, a student of Harvard University, who becomes famous for an opener of Facebook later on, is claimed by affluent two brothers that Mark steals their ideas and co-founder and Mark's best friend, Eduardo, sues Mark <br/><br/>Before watching the film, I expect that the story will be successful how he has achieved the remarkable feat. However, in the film, his struggling points such as relationship with people and money are described. For instance, he is dumped by his girlfriend, Erica, in order to retaliate against her, he opens a bad site for the use of advantage of his programming ability. One interesting point is that the universally prestigious social network service, Facebook, which is to communicate with others all over the world, is created by a man who is not good at making a good relationship. Even if Mark Zuckerburg is one of the youngest millionaires in the world, he holds no true happiness. This shows that family bond and friendship are crucially significant rather than money.<br/><br/>Yet, according to my search, not everything in the story is based on the true story. Seemingly before producing the film, though the director asks him to have an interview, the director is turned down. Actually, the story is unreliable to seize as Mark Zuckerburg's autobiography, but I believe that the film wants to convey a message to us that relationship makes our life."

In all honesty it's not a movie about ""Will Facebook become successful despite the lawsuit?"" since we all know that it does. It's a movie about the deterioration of friendships and how the idea of success can come to change someone. It's beautifully acted and Aaron Sorkin's dialogue is some of the best I've ever seen.

"CinematicInceptions","9","0","0","30 June 2017"," A hands-down masterpiece.
","I don't know how much I should trust the content of this adaptation. It's pretty safe to assume that Mark Zuckerberg didn't endorse the creation of this movie, but it may have painted him in an unfairly negative light. Regardless of its accuracy, it does illustrate the unfortunate truth that people who are tenacious and don't care about other people are the ones who tend to come out on top. Mark is not found guilty of the charges against him, but he still undeniably violates some serious ethical expectations to achieve his goals. Now, Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher seem to be opposed to Zuckerberg's actions, but at the same time they show him as rather a tragic and unfortunate figure. <br/><br/>The curious thing about the Mark Zuckerberg we see here is that he really seems to want to have friends and a social life, but everything he does hurts his ability to be social. He actually says flat out that he doesn't want friends, but I don't believe that, at least not totally. Maybe I'm mistaking this for him wanting to be accepted, but in the end he fails at being accepted as well. This is highlighted by the way that Mark creating Facebook is shown alongside scenes of people having parties and social lives. And by the end of the movie, he's alienated both of his closest business partners by his possible betrayal of Eduardo and Sean. I guess it's lonely at the top.<br/><br/>Eduardo was the character that I really sympathized with. I disagreed with his stance on wanting to make money with Facebook through ads and stuff, but by the end of the movie I really wanted him to get his own back from Mark. Conversely, I was immediately distrustful of Sean Parker, though I agreed with some of his ideas. Sean has some really cool ideas and forward thinking motivations, but I would much rather work with Eduardo because I would at least know that Eduardo would be a trustworthy and fair business partner. Then there's the Winklevoss twins, who have an understandable gripe in their lawsuit against Mark, but again Mark works around the rules and ignores ethics to come out on top. In a lot of ways, Mark's point that the Winklevosses simply didn't capitalize on their idea is completely true, but that doesn't forgive the fact that he took their idea and ran with it. Finally for characters we have Erica Albright, who doesn't make many appearances but is nonetheless important as the one part of Mark's life where he cannot win.<br/><br/>I thought the execution of this movie was fabulous. First off, Aaron Sorkin's wrote what I think is cinema's best screenplay ever with dialogue that flows naturally and is snappy and relevant and true to each character. Besides that, he intercuts scenes very nicely and seems to have provided each scene with a specific tone. Then the script was put in the very capable hands of David Fincher, who works with DP Jeff Cronenweth to create a tense visual tone that fits the movie's identity and turns it into a work of art. This coupled with the quivering score and pretty good performances from the lead roles made for a riveting two hour masterpiece.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to practically everyone as a pretty good insight into aspects of human behavior. Now, the one caveat I have for that is that it's geared for an adult audience. It may be rated PG-13, but it wants to be R and is not geared for kids. It may not sound like the most riveting story on the surface, but it should keep your undivided attention attention pretty well. It's somewhat complex but I did not find it hard to follow. Finally, for anyone who wants to go into film production, you definitely should see and learn from the best. Overall Rating: 8.7/10."

","David Fincher has proved that any premise can be made great with the help of a hardworking and ingenious film crew and cast. The miracle Fincher has achieved in this film is the morphing of a concept that could have more easily been turned into a made for T.V. snoozefest painfully catering to a younger audience into a witty and challenging drama. <br/><br/>From my point of view, those who believe that this film is on the side of any of its characters is surely mistaken. Many critical reviews do not seem to be criticizing the film but the film's subjects, when that is honestly not the way to go. The film itself is mostly neutral when portraying its cast of characters, portraying them as the fascinating and flawed beings they truly are. Almost everyone in this movie is, for lack of a better word, kind of a d*ck. Zuckerberg is among film history's most complex characters, an excruciatingly intelligent man with an endless capability of technological genius, but he is also a man who hurts and betrays others, including those closest to him. He is borderline narcissistic in his ways and, yet again I fail to come up with a better word, often comes across as no more than the standard annoying Harvard smartass. Its a film about the forces of evil, friendship, love, destiny, inspiration, greed, business, conflict, and so on and son. <br/><br/>Rapid fire laugh out loud dialogue is constantly exchanged through one of the most well written and ingenious film scripts of all time. Fincher adapts the boundlessly brilliant script in the best way possible by incorporating his fine visual flare and knack for perfectly paced editing. Seriously, I find this to be among the finest edited films of all time. The editing is able to communicate the feelings of chaos and disorientation throughout without giving the viewer a headache, and entertainment is never sacrificed, for Fincher proves that eh can make any situation as engaging as it possibly can be.<br/><br/>Each and every crucial element of cinema is utilized in the best way possible in ""The Social Network"". Each performance is pitch perfect (Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, and Justin Timberlake all provide some of the finest film performances of the past decade), the editing (as I have already stated) is unbearably incredible, the pacing is highly well done, the subject matter is handled in a way that is mature but not at all devoid of humor, the visuals are beautiful, the soundtrack is amazing, the script is among the greatest ever written, and the film functions as one of the most fascinating and complicated character studies I have ever witnessed.

","The Social Network is a biographical film based on the founder of Facebook – Mark Zuckerberg's experience. Beside Mark Zuckerberg as the hero, other main characters include Eduardo Saverin, Sean Parker and the Winklevoss brothers. The present timeline in the movie was an accusation from Eduardo and the Winklevoss to Zuckerberg. Narration about how Facebook was invented and developed was interspersed with flashbacks. The movie depicted the hero as a humorous genius at the beginning process but a friendship- traitor in the end of the story (i.e. in the present timeline). The movie was outstanding not only because of its unique narrating structure, but also due to its objective perspective about the person. The movie directly reveal the immoral side of Zuckerberg who was generally considered as a successful, gifted young entrepreneur. Except the complete delineation of the hero, the supporting roles are absolutely perfectly and logically portrayed.

I was very disappointed to find out that it wasn't about this, it was more about the dispute between Zuckerberg and his friend Eduardo Saverin. The story the movie tells about the creation of facebook is, to my dismay, littered with fiction. It felt like the director based the character of Zuckerberg not based on the original but on a slightly different version of Zuckerberg who is a insecure and asinine genius. They portray his character this way by changing a few things about the real story of Zuckerberg. In reality Mark Zuckerberg is none of these things and the portrayal of him in the movie is so far off from reality it hurts. Aside from this flaw the movies main focus as far as plot is not the rise of facebook and the different challenges the team face but the relationship between Mark and Eduardo. In fact the movie is almost entirely about their feud. This makes sense, seeing as how the movie is based off the book The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook: A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal. A book that tells the story of how facebook was created without any help from the creator of facebook himself Mark Zuckerberg. Instead the author received a lot of help from the friend of Mark's who only funded the project Eduardo. It's frustrating how to think that they would make a movie after such a crappy book but there really isn't much we can do about it now. In conclusion, I wish this movie had never been made 0 stars"

","'The Social Network' is a rare modern biographical movie that succeeds on almost every level possible with each character,scene etc. This movie has got everything that you would expect from a biographical drama with awesome screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and brilliant direction by David Fincher that keeps viewers hooked to the movie. A compelling lead performance by Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield and a great soundtrack that absolutely gets all along with the theme of the movie.This movie is so inspirational in its own terms and the common themes like friendship,ego,etc. have been portrayed effectively.David Fincher has been always consistent with his direction and he never fails to entertain.This movie is definitely awesome for repeated viewings.I have probably watched this movie more than 7 times and in every single viewing,it gets only better and better.This movie deserves a little higher rating in IMDb and a spot in top 250."

","In some ways I do think this film was made a bit early. Facebook isn't that old a phenomenon, and thus a movie about its origins seems rushed as I don't think we have enough distance to view it objectively. That being said, David Fincher has pulled off some miracles here and I think this is about as perfect a movie about Facebook as was possible to be made. Some of its events and depictions can be argued with and you can definitely see that sometimes things are stretched in the name of drama, but as a story it works really well and will definitely give you some perspective on the web page most of us have come to rely on.<br/><br/>And at the centre of it all is Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg in probably his best role performance so far. Zuckerberg is a great character. From the very first scene, where he's talking with his college girlfriend, you get this guy. He's a genius and in his case it's also a burden, a curse. He's in a constant state of frustration because to him everyone else seems to be moving in slow-motion. Everyone is always one or two steps behind and he has to slow done to let them catch up.<br/><br/>The movie deals with Zuckerberg's days in college while he was getting Facebook off the ground and with the legal battles that he had to go through later because everyone tried to stake their claim on the pot of gold he had founded. The movie is good at not taking sides and showing that while Zuckerberg certainly did some slightly questionable things, it's not like the other side was completely in the right either.<br/><br/>All in all The Social Network is worth a watch because it has great actors lead by a great director and the subject matter is something we're all familiar with and know personally. Best film of the year? Probably not, but it's up there."
"The-Social-Introvert","7","0","0","21 January 2016"," Quickie Review: The Social Network
","Here is another David Fincher movie that I enjoyed watching but ultimately was left rather indifferent. The bromance between best friends Zuckerberg (Jessy Eisenberg) and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Gardfield) is what drives this story of Facebook's creation – allegedly stolen by Zuckerberg from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (played by the same guy – wow! I couldn't tell at all). The much- raised dialogue in the movie was good but maybe a bit too much, as sometimes multiple sentences are stuffed into a scene that end up rendering it lifeless. You get the sense that the filmmakers are trying to make the scenes seem real and everyday-like, but I don't think they quite pulled it off.<br/><br/>For a film that's pretty relevant to today's users of social media the story is pretty by-the-numbers. I feel that the story of Facebook's creator is still going, and the movie was ended (or even made) prematurely. Even so, the subject matter doesn't really interest me much. If nothing else The Social Network shows just how sad, lonely and artificial you can become when surrounded by modern technology. That's what I thought of the protagonist anyway, since it seems the director wanted to show him as some misunderstood and sympathetic character. That, or he actually admires him?<br/><br/>Best Scene: I somewhat enjoyed the legal proceedings towards the end of the film and the feisty interactions between the once-friends"

","The Social Network (2010) Reviewed by Martin Davis. Retrospect Film on Facebook. Emerging in the 90's as one of Hollywood's most exciting talents, David Finchers' decision to direct 'The Social Network' seemed an unusual one to many at the time. The man who had brought us 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club' was now going to take on what some were dismissively calling ""The Facebook movie"". 'The Social Network' is, in reality, much less a film about the creation of Facebook and much more about the age old themes of betrayal, revenge, ambition and greed. The opening scene sets the tone perfectly. It is late 2003 and Harvard University student and computer genius Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is being dumped by his girlfriend. It is clear from Eisenberg's portrayal and Aaron Sorkins' distinctively brilliant dialogue that this is not the most likable of leading men, yet somehow, as the film progresses we find ourselves rooting for him. Returning to his dorm Zuckerberg writes a spiteful entry on his blog about his ex and then creates a website called 'Facemash' by hacking into the college databases and stealing photos of female students to allow site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After causing the Harvard servers to crash Zukerberg is given six months academic probation. The fuse has been lit though and inadvertently he has caught the attention of several influential figures, most notably the Winklevoss twins and their business partner Divya Narendra who approach him with their idea for a social media site. With financial backing from his best friend Eduardo Savarin, Zuckerberg creates what he calls 'thefacebook'. With his business partners kept in the dark about its launch, a bitter legal wrangle ensues. The courtroom scenes are interspersed throughout the film and having relocated to California and cut his ties with Savarin, Zuckerberg and his team watch the newly renamed 'Facebook' grow in strength, culminating in its first one million members. Eisenberg is excellent as Zukerberg, a young man consumed with ruthless ambition and not prepared to let anything stand in his way. Superbly scripted, directed and acted, the film defied all preconceptions and was a success both critically and at the box office, going on to win three academy awards and three Baftas. Recommended. Martin Davis. Retrospect Film on Facebook."

","If I had to sum up ""The Social Network"" in just a few words, I would probably say, ""It's an interesting movie about an unlikable man"". At least, that's the impression the filmmakers seem to have about Mark Zuckerberg. Though to their credit, they don't completely portray Zuckerberg as unlikable - he is shown to be socially awkward, among other things. I can personally relate to that trait myself. That's one of the many interesting things to be found in this movie. Other things include showing how the world of business can be a cutthroat game, where friendship and loyalty sometimes don't mean a darn. <br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect - though then again, few movies are. I would have liked to have been given a little background on Zuckerberg - we learn nothing about his past. Some of the technical jargon is a little hard to follow if you know little to nothing about computers (or Facebook, for that matter.) Also, the second half of the movie does have some lengthy portions that run a little slow (though they don't get to be downright boring.) All the same, the praise this movie has received is definitely worthy."

","I love David Fincher. I love his style, his cinematic poise; and, above all, what he represents. He is the walking, talking counterpoint to anyone who says film was better 'back in the day.' He uses modern sensibilities and techniques to tell modern stories. <br/><br/>Okay. Author interruption over. I'm not here to talk about what Fincher represents. I'm here to talk about what I believe to be the crowning film in his multi-jeweled golden crown. This film, The Social Network, is about one of the defining men of the twenty-first century, Mark Zuckerberg. It is not a straight historical retelling, of which I am mercifully glad. If the so-called historical purists had their way, this film would a snore. There are some people whose factual life stories make for good film; the subject of my last review, General George S. Patton, is one of them.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg is not. Other than the fact that he founded a multi billion-dollar company, his life would hardly make for a better story than would mine. Granted, that is a big 'other', but still; he does not have grand tales of drama and adventure. This is not helped by the fact that he is, at the time of this piece's writing (Nov 11, 2015- Veterans Day), only 31. None of this is a knock on the man who I believe to be the living, breathing representation of why, despite it's many, many faults, I love the country that I live in. He is, in fact, an idol of mine. But his life still would not make an interesting movie told straight-up.<br/><br/>That's where Fincher comes in. Okay, not just Fincher; the film's writer, one Aaron Sorkin, deserves a lot of the credit too. As does Jesse Eisenburg, the actor who plays Zuck; despite looking nothing like the billionaire, he is convincing and emotive and a strong conduit; if he was bad, this film would not work. But he is, and it does.<br/><br/>As a self-proclaimed expert on titles, I can say that this film has a good one. Consider that they could have easily just named it 'Zuck' or 'Zuckerberg' or 'Mark Zuckerberg' or 'Facebook' or another one of the standard biopic titles, and did not; something that fits the fact that this film is decidedly not a straight biopic, as I have repeatedly mentioned. But it didn't just avoid being standard; it was great; again, like the movie.<br/><br/>The title of the book that this film was based on was 'The Accidental Billionaires.' I'm not going to pretend that's not a good a title; it is. It shows how success just rushed up on these guys like a rushing tsunami, leaving them to deal with the consequences. But the film is titled better, tackling a larger scope. I can't go two feet or two seconds nowadays without hearing the words 'Social Network' or 'Social Media' or something of that sort. But Facebook isn't just 'a social network'. It is 'The Social Network.' Everyone who came after Zuck has been living in his shadow, and perhaps they always will. He pushed the world onward like few others of the past few decades, and the title reflects that.<br/><br/>Many people (well, some; this movie does have a ninety-six percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes and will be on many best of the decade lists) have a problem with what they consider to be simple characterization of Zuckerberg. I would not quite say that this is a nothing complaint, but I do think that it was expanded greatly by people just seeing what they want to see. Zuckerberg has built with his hands and mouse one of the largest and most successful startups ever; I think he has a right to be a little defensive and aggressive. I know I would be. No, the real Zuckerberg is probably not like this. And if you're in the wrong mood, it could get a bit on one's nerves. But I think this is a primary case of people not checking their personal moralities and beliefs at the door and embracing the art, as you should every time you're watching a good movie. Remember this point; I will bring it up again when I review Amelie.<br/><br/>Anyway, the soundtrack is subtle, the visual style captures the tone and subject matter of the film perfectly, and the script is tight enough. The dialogue is sharp and on point because of course it is, it's a Sorkin film. There are a lot of blues in the film, making it look visually striking. But even if you don't prefer style over substance like I do, don't worry. There is enough in the film for you too. it has a certain way of blowing you away while keeping your feet on the ground.<br/><br/>The narrative arc for this film is incredible. You feel every high and every low, and at the end, you are right there with Zuckerberg, wondering how it has all come to this. It is an introspective and contemplative film, one that evokes on an artistic level, a philosophical level, and an entertainment level. Inception may be my favorite film of this decade, but if there is one that I believe to be indicative of everything worthwhile from it... this movie would be right up there in consideration. Go see it if you haven't.<br/><br/>(P.S. The biggest surprise for me when watching this was how good JT was. He is a good actor when cast properly.) (P.P.S. In case you're wondering, yes, I do believe this film was screwed out of Best Picture because Oscar voters are a bunch of old white men who probably have no clue what a 'face-book' is.)"

","I went into this movie with pretty high hopes. Considering I'd just watched a handful of great movies with lower user scores and higher metascores, and I thought I'd love this one just as much as those. It was a lot slower than I expected, but it may have felt that way due to the fact that I started watching it at midnight. <br/><br/>The Social Network is a pretty interesting movie. It follow the guy, Mark Zuckerberg, who created facebook and all the problems that occur during and after this process. It's well made, and the plot is interesting. As someone who uses facebook a fair amount, it was interesting to see who made it (I know it wasn't Jesse Eisenberg, don't worry) and how it was made. <br/><br/>The characters were the primary driving force in the movie it seemed. Jesse Eisenberg, as usual, played a great nerdy character who doesn't seem to understand human emotion that well. It's a typical role for him, but he does it extremely well. As for everyone else, they were all interesting characters who change throughout the movie, making it feel a lot more realistic. Although it is a biography so of course it's expected to be realistic. <br/><br/>Overall The Social Network is a solid movie. With great acting and interesting characters and plot, it's worth a watch. It wasn't as great as some of the previous movies I've watched lately, and it was definitely a slower paced movie, but it's still good. If your interested, give it a watch. It's worthwhile. If you didn't enjoy it, then that's okay, I can see why. In the end I probably would recommend it, but maybe only to people whom I think would like it."

","I'm not sure just what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. The DVD cost $5, for a two-disc set! I watched disc 1 last year, rated it a 2 and wrote in my journal - ""can't be bothered to see the bonus features"". Is that fair? So, now I've seen disc two, and rated that a 2 also (and wrote the only (so far) review), then disc one again and then again to get the director's commentary.<br/><br/>OK, the acting is good, Eisenberg looks and sounds like Zuckerberg. But Zuckerberg is portrayed as clever, ruthless, manipulating, unscrupulous, devious, unpleasant, dishonest, disloyal ... and yet, he hasn't sued! So, is it accurate? That is not my impression of Mark. (from all sources, not personal of course). Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2010 was Zuckerberg and they were writing the story as the movie was released, and it is mentioned a couple of times in what is otherwise a real hagiography. Zuckerberg's only comment is to question their representation for the motivation for the whole idea of Facebook.<br/><br/>But the article doesn't mention the names Winklevoss or Saverin once. Not really a surprise? Here is my advice. Watch the first scene (which took 99 takes to get!), but be warned, you will have to turn the subtitles on, otherwise you'll miss half what is babbled. This must be the worst ever first scene of a movie? Then go to Scene Selection and go to #15 (the second to last) by then Facebook is flying and they go past the 1 million members, it is a huge success. But then we learn that the lawsuit that has occupied most of the scenes from #2-#14 is to be settled out of court and it involves the payment by Zuckerberg or Facebook, of a HUGE sum and another, the details of which remain a secret but is even HUGER.<br/><br/>There are times when I was really impressed by the production, and there are some good little scenes, but overall, it leaves a bad memory, and nearly all lawsuit films are *boring*."

","Actually I have been a member of facebook since 2009. When I heard for the first time that one of my favorite directors, David Fincher, is going to make a movie based on facebook's story, I was wondering ""what kind of interesting point Fincher sees in this!"" It could be a boring movie without any sign of excitement we used to see in his previous movies. By the way he proved that I was wrong! This is on of his best movies and I'm glad that Fincher successfully turned this typical story into some valuable narratives. The Social Network isn't a story based movie with assertive plot like Se7en, but I can say it's a plot-based movie. There are some young people coming up with an idea, making a website which gathers people together in a limited range of places, Harvard university in the first place. As Mark Zukerberg says in the movie -You don't get 500 million friends without making a few enemies- Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), founder of the website, finds himself disputing with some people including his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). The movie goes forward very well. The main story happens in a court in which the history of founding of the website is told in flashbacks. All the scenes, present and past, are related perfectly that face you with a pleasant story until its very end. You may don't like villains of the movie –Winklevoss brothers- because of course they are not the second version of a eloquent serial killer like John Doe, but I'm sure they are in the best place they could ever be, however it depends on your standpoint whether like them or not because they are just some inept geek university students. Fincher with The Social Network proves that you don't necessarily need to have a criminal story to keep the viewers up to the screen, and he also proves that even most commonplace events can be complicated deep inside."

","It did take me quite a long time since the release to enjoy this lovely piece of work by David Fincher. Knowing David for his style of storytelling was in fact the reason that made me to sit & give this movie a try. Looking into any biography movie or any other movie that is based on a true story so far, one could definitely point out the flaws on the storyline or the casting choices. Yet accepting the challenge of doing such a movie is what differentiates such directors from other. The casting of the movie does needs to be given a special appreciation as they bought all the real life characters into life, especially bringing in some of the youngest talents in the business such as Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake & Armie Hammer. The movie opens with a couple in a crowded college bar and ends with a man alone in a room repeatedly hitting refresh on his laptop soon after a friend request. In between, David and Sorkin offer up a creation story for the digital age and something of a morality tale, one driven by desire, marked by triumph, tainted by unfaithfulness and inspired by the new gospel: the geek shall inherit the earth."

","Social media. It dominates our everyday lives. We can barely remember a time when we weren't glued to our phones, or even when ""phone"" wasn't a ubiquitous term for ""cell phone,"" or when ""cell phone"" wasn't an antiquated term for ""iPhone"" or ""Smartphone."" Sites like Twitter, YouTube, and foursquare (or Swarm) comprise the majority of our everyday online experiences.<br/><br/>It was Facebook that took it to a level no one could have possibly predicted.<br/><br/>With the creation of Facebook, *everyone* had a chance to view each other's lives in a way that was not previously conceptualized. Or was. That's what this film is about. The lawsuits that arose after Facebook's founding was called into legal question makes for thrice-Oscar- nominated cinema that is paralleled by no other. Now connecting upwards of 1/7th of humanity, Facebook has given rise to people and organizations previously unthinkable in that Harvard dorm room straight out of A Beautiful Mind.<br/><br/>But this is only the beginning.<br/><br/>As President and Head Administrator of the Facebook group Future Presidents of the United States, and having been contacted by the White House thanks to my efforts, I can safely say that Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Severin, and countless other individuals responsible for the creation and upkeep of Facebook have not yet fully realized the scope and scale of what they have unleashed upon the world.<br/><br/>The intersection of history and technology has been demonstrated to change the course of humanity throughout various eras. I think it's safe to say that this is the beginning of one of those eras. Though Facebook turned 11 this past February, it's only in its infancy. Where will it be at 20? 30? 50? 100? The Internet and Cyberspace in general won't be going anywhere anytime soon. Democracy and politics in general won't be going anywhere anytime soon. How will Facebook and the Internet in general change the landscape to make way for the most technologically-literate generation the world has ever seen, Generation Y, to not only take the reigns of power, but to *keep* the reigns of power?<br/><br/>It appears to me that in my many platforms of research that Millennials are somewhat of a novelty. We seem to be stuck in a kind of Purgatory, neither advancing on the world stage, nor shrinking away from it. There is no one central figure among us who we can point to and say, ""That's who we are. That person represents us.""<br/><br/>That person will more than likely come from Facebook.<br/><br/>Not necessarily the founders, not necessarily its current architects, but one of us. One of its members. And no, not necessarily me, either. I'm not looking to gain publicity for the sake of gaining publicity. I'm just looking to set myself apart from the crowd and call attention to a number of issues facing not only my generation, but the generations that will depend on us to receive the passing of the torch. The coherency of the message is lost in the roar of the crowd. People have to be willing to make themselves vulnerable and stand up for what is right. Alone. And in this hyper-connected day and age, that's not something many people are willing, or even able, to do.<br/><br/>But I am.<br/><br/>I am one of many. I am not alone. I have made it my professional intention to look ahead and ponder the long-term future of not only Facebook, but the Internet in general. This second dimension of humanity isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Neither is Facebook. It is *essential* in the everyday lives of *billions.*<br/><br/>It all started in a Harvard dorm room.<br/><br/>Look for sequels to this movie. There are a *lot* more to come."
"lucasversantvoort","8","0","0","6 May 2015"," Not just a film about Facebook
","Making a film based on the creation of something which is in a sense 'invisible' is challenging. But Fincher's impressive The Social Network is less about the popular website itself and more about the people involved in its creation and subsequent popularity growth.<br/><br/>The film opens smack-dab in the middle of a conversation in a bar between soon-to-be Facebook 'inventor' Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and his girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara). Erica, eventually fed up with Mark's desire to attain status, breaks up with him. Mark, enraged, starts posting degrading comments about Erica and women in general on his blog. He also creates a website called ""Facemash"" where Harvard students can rate women based on their 'hotness'. The website becomes massively popular the very same night and causes Harvard's severs to crash, which for a 'computer geek' like Zuckerberg is an achievement rather than a problem. Two other students, the Winklevoss brothers, are impressed and recruit Mark to create a website focused on social interaction. Mark, however, takes their idea, adds things and creates his own website behind the Winklevoss' backs, called ""The Facebook"". The film then proceeds to go back and forth in time to show both the (legal) drama that is to come and the current evolution in popularity of ""The Facebook"".<br/><br/>One of the film's highlights is the quick-witted script by The West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin. For those who say the script feels unnatural, I can only refer you to Network, a film made about 30 years ago, known for its brilliant and yes, unnatural screenplay, that is still talked about to this day. Anyway, there's not much to say about the script that hasn't been said already: it's occasionally 'tech-y' but not too much, clever, smart and lightning-fast, something the film's fantastic editing emphasizes (the first time I felt I had a chance to catch my breath was during a rowing match somewhere halfway in the film!). Fincher's direction believably places the viewer in the college experience, showing glimpses of parties, classes and the oppressive college culture lying underneath it all where financial success is everything. Fincher also deserves a lot of credit for coaxing uniformly excellent performances from such a young cast. The extras present on the special edition reveal how Fincher spent weeks around the table with the actors, endlessly discussing the characters.<br/><br/>A film like this, based on historical events, will always be partially judged on how well it stays true to the very history it attempts to recreate. I have doubts whether The Social Network follows everything down to the smallest details, but I always saw the film more as a social commentary. Fincher seemed to have a strong interest in the moral degradation underlying the character's world and actions. This is something Fincher is more than familiar with, having explored similar issues in films like Se7en, The Game and Fight Club and (his next film) The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note in hindsight the battle between The King's Speech and The Social Network at the Oscars. While The Social Network had been dominating the awards season up to the BAFTA's, the Academy went with The King's Speech in the end, awarding it Best Picture and Best Director among others. Why this sudden change? There are a number of reasons, two of which are the most popular: 1) The King's Speech checked more boxes in the so-called 'award bait' category (disease/disability, British Royalty, overcoming the odds) and 2) it captured the 'hearts' of the Academy. People expected voters to vote with their hearts than with their minds. In other words, The King's Speech was the more likable film. I'll end this review with a quote from the ending to The Social Network that, in retrospect, captures this sentimentalism:<br/><br/>MARYLIN I'm talking about a jury. I specialize in voir dire--jury selection. And what the jury sees when they look at the defendant. Clothes, hair, speaking style, likability—<br/><br/>MARK Likability?<br/><br/>MARYLIN I've been licensed to practice law for all of 20 months and I could get a jury to believe you planted the story about Eduardo and the chicken. Watch what else. Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party that night?<br/><br/>MARK You think I'm the one who called the police?<br/><br/>MARYLIN Doesn't matter. I asked the question and now everybody's thinking about it. You've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Note that Mark says 'Likability?' in a mocking manner, showing he already knows he's not the most charismatic guy around. Also, replace the word 'jury' with 'Oscar voters' in that last sentence and you see why The Social Network lost its chances at the Best Picture Oscar in the first 10 minutes."

","First off I'm not going to go into how close to real life this film is (or isn't) and how much is true or not because I just don't know and am not too fussed to be honest the little I did tho I thought they did very well and ill be speaking about the film not how close it was to real life and all the rest of it. <br/><br/>The social network is all about Mark Zuckerberg and how he invented Facebook and becoming the youngest billionaire in history. This film shows how he got there and the success and complications in doing so. <br/><br/>First off I loved this film as a daily user of Facebook I was intrigued to see how it all started for Mark. First off I loved how this film was directed it was a joy to watch the cut scenes between the court room discussions and how they got to said court room discussions was beautifully done. The casting was nothing short of perfect now I'm going to give some credit to David Fincher for this but Jesse Eisenberg played Mark Zuckerberg so incredibly well you really believed he was a genus who was a bit of a loner, in just how he would presented himself. To make him likable, understandable and at the same time make you realise he wasn't perfect and was at times an ass hole, is one of the biggest compliments i can give to somebody who is playing a character like this, in a film like this. One of the biggest things people didn't like about the film Jobs is that it idealised the main guy too much, made him perfect when he wasn't how could anybody be after becoming that successful. So too see that so brilliantly done in this film is a massive highlight for me. Since this film Andrew Garfield is well known for his Spider-Man role and i thought going back to this film would make me just see him as spider-man but i was wrong he immersed himself into the role and you really understand why he's upset at least i did. I was pleasantly surprised at how good Justin Timberlake was in the film he really sold the character and the fact i didn't like him shows that he did a really good job. A quick note to the man who played the lawyer for Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss he was perfect something about his voice and how he produced his lines really made me feel that this was a proper lawsuit and it was much more serious than it seemed. This takes me to the script which was magnificently done. Overall I really enjoyed this film a lot and thought it was an interesting film that was excellently directed and acted out. A solid 8/10"

","David Fincher has directed many thrilling and perceptive films in the past; however his latest film can be seen as his best work yet. <br/><br/>Fincher doesn't just explore the obvious ideas of personal theft, violation, contradiction and inhuman endeavors; we are taken inside the minds of Zuckerberg, we are taken into this world of social manipulation and categorization and we are inadvertently left creeping behind the door yearning to identify more of what our societies future offers.<br/><br/>Facebook is used as a tool to portray mistrust, connection and denial. It explores this new wave of social media and technological connections, however the film really highlights our generations lack of human interaction and need to live inside their social conscience, unable to listen to their own."

","Seems typical of our new century that a product whose original selling point was ""exclusivity"" is now being consumed by over a billion people. For once, Aaron Sorkin's turned out a script where the characters aren't a whole lot smarter and quicker and funnier than any group of people could possibly be (cf. The West Wing, The Newsroom). His portrait of Mark Zuckerberg as a geeky outsider who can't relate to women may not have much to do with the real MZ— ex- captain of the Exeter fencing team who's been in a stable relationship since his sophomore year in college—but Jesse Eisenberg does a great job reimagining him as a remote, high-functioning sociopath who keeps his eyes on the prize at all times. Justin Timberlake does even better as Sean Parker, the Napster bad boy, who made sure that the Facebook stayed cool and didn't sell too many ads for the Harvard bartending course. Haven't seen 'em all, but this one seems like Fincher's best since Fight Club. And not to worry too much about Eduardo and the Winklevii (pitch-perfect performances, btw)—looks like they all managed to land on their feet somehow..."
"Ferdinand_99","10","0","0","27 September 2014"," A masterpiece
","I watched this movie for the 7th time today because because Gone girl is coming out next week. And once again I was struck by just how good this movie is. Wonderful acting, excellent directing, beautiful cinematography, incredibly sharp editing and an amazing screenplay.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook talking to his girlfriend Erica in a bar. At the end of the conversation Erica breaks up with Mark. From this starts the story of the birth of Facebook. The story is told through flashbacks while Zuckerberg is going through two lawsuits: one from the Winkelvoss twins, from whom Zuckerberg might or might not have stolen Facebook and one from his former best friend and the co-founder of Facebook, Eduardo Saverin. In the flashbacks we follow birth and rise of Facebook.<br/><br/>The script of this movie is amazing. It's easily the best script in years. The dialog is smart and fast, just what you would expect from the film's writer Aaron Sorkin. Mark is an interesting and layered character but he's not a nice guy. The script is actually full of mean and annoying characters and that's quite shocking because everyone else would like to tell the heroic story of how young Zuckerberg created the great Facebook. But Sorkin doesn't. He's not interested in that. Perhaps none of these guys are good but they're interesting and through these characters Sorkin tells a much more important and interesting story. The movie has themes that don't have anything to do with Facebook so it doesn't matter if you don't care about Facebook. I actually personally hate Facebook and think this is a great movie. Because this movie is not about Facebook.<br/><br/>The movie is of course about human relationships. All that Mark wants in the end is to have friends. He is someone who has almost no friends (pretty much only one) and he is not a nice guy. He is rude to everybody and he doesn't even notice it. He wants to be someone like Sean Parker, someone who has friends and still can say exactly what he wants. But even Sean can't do that even though he looks like that is exactly what he does. And in this play of wanting to be powerful and get friends he actually loses the one person who he could actually call his friend. He has surrounded himself now with people who aren't his friends but just people who act like they like him. And he is not happy about that because he knows that these people aren't his friends. So he tries to connect Erica, the one person who has been his friend and who he cares about that might be able to forgive him and who is probably the most honest and caring person he knows.<br/><br/>The performances are wonderful. Andrew Garfield is really good as Eduardo but the movie's best performance is easily Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg. He is excellent in every single scene he is in. The way he performs Sorkin's incredibly fast dialog is amazing and he also knows how to perform the quieter scenes.<br/><br/>But this movie wouldn't have been nearly as good as it is without David Fincher. He knows exactly what he wants from every scene and he goes and does it. Every scene is masterfully made and the feeling of the movie is really interesting.<br/><br/>Fincher also hired a lot of great artists to work on the technical aspects of the movie. The editing by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall is close to perfect, Jeff Cronenworth's cinematography is excellent and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score is extremely good.<br/><br/>I watched the movie for the first time when it came out in 2010 and I hated it. I thought that it was boring and Zuckerberg was annoying. And when Mark betrays Eduardo I became really angry at him because the only character I really cared about was Eduardo. Now I've grown up a bit and understand and appreciate the movie. The social network is a great movie and one of the best movies of the 2010s so far."

","Looking through the reviews on this site, it's hard to really add anything new about The Social Network. It's brilliant. I can hardly fault it. However, I am a serious Facebook addict (currently undergoing electric shock treatment to help myself cut down) so it fascinated me to hear about the back story as to how it was created, who owned it (and who nearly owned it).<br/><br/>I would rate this 9/10 – great performances, great direction (David Fincher, I now officially forgive you for your part in Alien 3) and great pace.<br/><br/>So, as an experiment and, in keeping with my 9/10 rating, I invited my Mum and Dad round to watch it. The second time around I enjoyed it as much as the first. In short, when I asked my parents to rate it out of 10, they gave it a 5 and a 6. They didn't get it. They didn't understand Facebook, or ""the fuss"" about it. They didn't understand anything more technical than the term ""the web"" and they found all the characters unlikeable and annoying. Only a few hours after the credits rolled and my Mum was having difficulty remembering anything other than people were generally moaning at each other over something that involved money.<br/><br/>I guess if you're one of the stereotypical 'Facebook generation' you may love this.

It's kind of ranking system. As for me, his action wasn't permissive. Anyway, he's a clever business man considering everything. As the advertisement says, ""you don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies"". This message represents his way to promote his company, I suppose. We might not be able to get everything in order to make a great success.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg, who plays Mark Zuckerberg, mimics Mark's way to speak.

","While clearly written with a stress on the importance of the hyperbolic idiosyncrasies that define the main character Zuckerburg, the script was also tastefully crafted with underlying, witty humor that was carefully sculpted into something that could get a chuckle from the audience while maintaining the authenticity of the events. This combination of heavily intellectualized prose and the aforementioned dry comedy made for an efficient, yet subtly entertaining film.<br/><br/>The one genuinely overlooked part of this picture that many have failed to assess as a failure is simply the ending. While seeing Zuckerburg refresh again and again in hopes that his old girlfriend will accept his friend request shows the audience that the road to success does not come without lost connections (as mentioned in the film's production poster), it is clear that his success is inspirational and should be mirrored by many young entrepreneurs in today's society. My fear is that with this notion of the creation of enemies, it will discourage the pursuance of dreams and ultimately eliminate any future successful entrepreneurs."

","""The social network"" the story of how the youngest ever billioner Mark Zuckerberg created facebook when he was in college and how it effected his life until the legal negotiations against his formal partners. As a biography, or part of it, the movie is great, with the story shifting from the past to the future, presenting the facts nicely and without confusing the audience. The performances are great too, especially Eisenberg as Zuckerberg and Garfield as Mark's best friend Eduardo Saverin. The characters are presented as they are, with their passions and flaws, without making them look as super humans, so that's a plus for the film. Finally the movie doesn't get boring, which is a relief, and there aren't many layers of depth, so there is very little food for thought. However, The social network is not a movie that entertains lot of people, and it is difficult to be watched again, as all you have to see, you can see them the first time. And that's why I am giving it 6 out of 10."

","Im not old by any stretch of the imagination. Im 17 years old and have had a Facebook account for about 4 years, I grew up with stories of Napster and Facebook in the news, this film interested me and, its good but, why do people consider this genius filmmaking.<br/><br/>The characters are all played very well by their respective actors. But the characters themselves I find hard to care about. There not the worst people in the world, there not the best either, so I don't really care if they succeed or not. The story itself, finding out how Facebook was created, is fairly interesting but thats practically wrapped up in the first 45 minutes, leaving the remainder of the film to wrap up how everyone ends up suing Mark Zuckerberg. <br/><br/>The film is good though. It may not sound like it from what iv said but, its good. Jesse Eisenberg is very good as Zuckerberg and although, like I said before, I found it hard to care for him as a person, it doesn't diminish the performance which is spot on as a social inept genius who wants everything, even if it means betraying everyone who's ever cared for him. I enjoyed seeing Zuckerberg strive for more from his company, shutting the outside world out, shutting his friends out and ultimately thats what lead to the lawsuits.<br/><br/>I really like the score too, its got this great ambiance that affects the entire film. It gives it this hip, here and now atmosphere that fits the tone and theme of the film perfectly. The films also perfectly shot, what else would you expect of David Fincher.<br/><br/>Overall, The Social Network is good, but disappointing. I expected another masterpiece from the man who directed Fight Club and Panic Room, but we got this instead, and i'm fine with it."
"ajjpacifica","9","0","0","29 March 2014"," A fantastic showcase of brilliant acting
","What makes The Social Network such a fantastic movie is the extraordinary performance of all the actors involved as well as the film's ability to have you rooting for every side. Jesse Eisenburg was a fantastic Zuckerburg and displayed how it truly feels to be a socially awkward nerd. In a not at all kiddish way, Zuckerburg simply wants to be cool. He does not found Facebook with the intent of being successful, he simply wants to be liked and superior. This film fantastically conveys this with moments such as the rejection of the idea to begin advertisements on Facebook because, though this would bring a large sum of money, it wasn't ""cool"". Zuckerburg constantly battles with his inability to connect with anyone outside of himself and others with his same motivation and in the end, it costs him his best friend and a small fortune. Andrew Garfield, for lack of a better description, is the standout actor of the film. The relatively unknown name of Eduardo Saverin would have remained as such had Garfield not given his character a personality that portrayed the view of the common man observing the passage at play. Throughout the film Saverin is used repeatedly by his best friend and finally discarded like a broken tool. Saverin provides the mood for the entire movie, being the comic relief in lighthearted scenes and demonstrating the anger and betrayal felt in the upsetting scenes. Though this movie is a success on many fronts, it does become noticeably less interesting in scenes in which the Winklevoss twins and Sean Parker were prevalent. This is not for lack of performance, but rather that the scenes were often unnecessary and irrelevant. For example, the scene in which Parker tells Zuckerburg about the founding of Victoria's Secret could have been completely erased with no negative repercussions. The same applies to the twins' meeting with Larry Summers. Despite these few flaws, this is a must watch movie in the age of technology that sheds light on the controversial introduction to one of the world's current most well-known companies around the world."
"ilsonowl","10","0","0","26 March 2014"," Deserving of every accolade
","In 1987 Oliver Stone produced a film that encapsulated a whole era and captured the Zeitgeist perfectly, the character of Gordon Gekko crystallising the most prevalent of the seven deadly sins of the time. In 2010 Stone is set on repeating this trick by attempting to pull off one of the hardest tasks in the film industry; the sequel that matches up to its predecessor. The timing seems perfect, with the current financial crisis reflecting the true bust of the late eighties boom and the impending release of the original film's central character in real time. However, his film has been eclipsed by The Social Network. As the seventies had All The President's Men, the eighties had Stone's aforementioned Wall Street, the nineties had The Insider and now, after a decade without a major time capsule of a film, the new millennium has The Social Network.<br/><br/>With The Social Network slamming Wall Street 2 at the box office it seems that while Stone has been missing the mark with presidential bio- pics and fumbling around South America stroking the egos of Bolivarian political leaders his position, that he earned cutting his teeth (or should that be grinding his teeth) working on Scarface, as the major socio-political-commentator-director has been usurped by a younger model in the form of David Fincher. Presenting the skills he has crafted and honed since his 1995 breakthrough picture Se7en, Fincher is backed by a killer script from The West Wing's Aaron Sorkin. It is testament to Sorkin's ability that he managed to pull it off. The facebook story is RAM full of absolutely un-writable characters. After all, if you were to conjure a pair of opponents for Zuckerberg upon the battlefield of intellectual property, would you have chosen identical twin Olympic rowers christened with the inimitable moniker of Winklevoss? I wouldn't imagine so. But, it is in characters such as these that some of the wittiest of dialogue comes; as one of the twins negates the need to hire someone for the job of intimidating facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg: ""I'm 6'4, weigh 220 pounds and there's two of me.""<br/><br/>Fincher has also assembled a great cast. A handful of the best young actors in America appear in this movie. Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of the character is so deft and on point that we are treated to a mesmerising display that excels past even the usual high standard of performance Fincher manages to extract from his casts. He is ever unlikable, ever untrustworthy and ever petty, but does manage a small amount of sympathy in being that guy (we all know one), that brilliant, borderline genius without a clue. If Zuckerberg is truly anything like Eisenberg's version, then an argument for Asperger syndrome stands on firm footing. Andrew Garfield continues to impress, slightly twisting and improving his character and performance adeptly from the film Lions For Lambs earlier in the decade playing original facebook CFO Eduardo Saverin, I doubt, however, that the script, or demand on his acting ability, will match up to this role in the upcoming Spiderman movies. Despite these two lead characters portrayed so excellently, it is Justin Timberlake who shines as Napster founder Sean Parker. In a pivotal scene Parker sums up the ideology of today's intelligent and irreverent youth echoing Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko giving the ""greed is good"" speech in 1987 verbally wrapping up the 80s yuppie mentality. I can smell the outside bet for Best Supporting Actor at next year's Oscars now. And I'm sure this will pick up a whole load of nominations elsewhere, and maybe some statuettes. Lord knows it deserves every accolade it receives. ********** (2010)"

Sorkin's work always centers on rapid-fire dialog and smartassery and this film has no shortage of either. From his media appearances I don't believe for a second that the real Mark Zuckerberg was as calm, ""cool"" and ruthless as portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg, but a nerdy portrayal wouldn't have worked in the film. On a scale of rewatchability, I can't say I'd go higher than 6/10, but for the superb acting and scripting, I must rate it higher. 8/10"

"walter_cantarero","9","0","0","9 March 2014"," The social network
","The Social Network is a film describing the creation of Facebook. This film takes place at the University of Harvard were the student Mark Zuckenberg play by Jessie Eisenberg, creates Facebook just with his laptops and his impressive intellectual. This movie take us back to 2003 when Mark starts to study programing at Harvard. This movie helps us to understand all the secrets and problems it took to create the famous, Social Network.<br/><br/>Being the best programmer of your class seems pretty cool, but don't having friends is an exception; maybe it's the consequence of creating face Mach or crashing the web. Mark has his pros and cons characteristics but that didn't matter for the Winklevoss and their friend Divya Narrendra when they ask to Mark to create a special project of communication for Harvard. Mark accepted but he knew he had the ability to do something better, so Mark start to write codes for a special project he had in mind. We could see that Mark wasn't alone, he had his friend Eduardo that financed and sponsored his projects. The big problem begin when Sean Parker was contracted by Mark and when the brother Winklevoss and their friend heard about Mark project they knew they have to do something to confront him. <br/><br/>The social network has many incredible features, but out of doubt acting was the best from all. Jesse Eisenberg pictured himself as Mark Zuckenberg. He used to talk as a really intellectual guy making hard to gain a dispute against him. He always knew what to say, when to say it, and how to say it. He could also express the trait of leadership and how to be the alpha; he didn't let anyone to intimidate him or to take an advantage from him. Jesse Eisenberg did a great job as Mark Zuckenberg even with his problems of concentration and hyperactivity he knew how to control them and satisfy his viewers. Andrew Garfield as Eduardo also play a great role as being the best friend of Mark Zuckenberg, and he could express with great distress the courage and anger Eduardo had when Mark made a bad play with him. <br/><br/>In a movie like the Social Network a university environment is needed for a better expression, that's why a good setting didn't missed. As we know Mark Zuckenberg studied at Harvard University, so that's why most of the movie was film at it. This help to create a teenager environment, were we could see a better expression of romance, disputes, drugs, parties and among other universities things.<br/><br/>The Social Network has a lot of impressive exponents, but as we know perfect movies don't exist, that's why in this movie we may find some tiny defects. In the movie we may find suddenly changes of scenes from the interrogation to Mark, to the sequence of the creation of the social network. At first this is confusing but later you recognize what this means. I had like to know more about the ending relationship between Mark and Erika Albright after all what they passed thru the movie. These are some of the details we could find, but as I said they are just tiny defects. <br/><br/>This movie has shared to us the way of how Facebook was created. Most people thought that this movie was going to be like a documentary, so they obviously thought it was going to be bored. All their ideas about the movie change when they felt the delicious combination of History, love, troubles, and impressive ideas. This film let us know facts we didn't know about the creation of this impressive social network. If I had to rate this movie I will give to it a 9/10, and remember that if you want to know more of this impressive film, you just have to Log in."

I gotta say, after this, he's an actor to watch out for. Although Eisenberg was incredible, the person who literally stunned me with his acting was Andrew Garfield, this is the second film I've seen that stars him, I saw The Amazing Spider Man, he was decent in that movie, but here, he is outstanding in this movie as Zuckerberg's friend, Eduardo Saverin(Vai Brasil!) I was on his side the entire movie, partially because Zuckerberg's a dick, but also because of Garfield's acting, really something, I can't believe he didn't get at least an Oscar nomination, he was robbed right there. The weakest actor in the movie was Justin Timberlake, but he wasn't bad either.<br/><br/>The writing in this film is also outstanding, every single line of dialogue is so interesting, the story is really incredible, Aaron Sorkin, this guy is incredible, he really made this movie fantastic with the screenplay.<br/><br/>And wow, the soundtrack, another incredible aspect of the movie, every scene went along perfectly with the music, I loved the slow pace of the soundtrack, it really suited the film impeccably, it is very memorable, one of the best scores I've heard.<br/><br/>The directing is also amazing, David Fincher made a masterpiece. He made even the scenes that were supposed to be super boring, like the rowing scenes, and made them awesome. I can't really describe it, but he showed a style of shooting that's really different from other directors, I can tell this guy is great, because he made a movie about Facebook, and it's not boring, it's great, you get so invested in the story, and the way it's told, with scenes about the lawsuits in between the actual story, and as time passes, it explains everything, why those guys were suing Zuckerberg, and it worked incredibly well for the movie. I look forward to seeing more from him.<br/><br/>The Social Network is a fantastic movie, really, all aspects are amazing, everything goes together so well, and it doesn't make much sense that it's so good, it's a movie that could have been a documentary, but the people in charge of this made a true masterpiece, I strongly recommend this movie, really go watch it!

But ""The Social Network"" changed my opinion about that.<br/><br/>Almost every single detail of the picture is perfect – Fincher know how to do everything perfectly and how to keep audience at the screens throughout the film. One of my favorite things in the movie is the work of cinematographer – I enjoyed his shooting style and how he competently picked frames. I think it is one of the best cinematographer's work I have ever seen. Also hard work of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin is magnificent: the film literally can disassemble the citations.<br/><br/>But my favorite thing is cast: Brilliant acting play of Jessie Eisenberg struck me and made me change an opinion about him into the positive way. Also work of Andrew Garfield I liked very much – he did really good and from this moment for me he is not only associated with Spider Man.<br/><br/>Besides positive moments this picture has some problems: Sometimes the film sags and loses rhythm, but fortunately it happens for a couple minutes and then the picture starts to grow again. Very well chosen slogan: You can't get 500 million friends without making a few enemies – this movie not only about creating Facebook, but also about human relationships. Usually when someone achieves something really big other people begin to envy him. It happens always and especially in huge businesses. And it also happened to Mark Zuckerberg – everybody wanted to be in deal with him to earn tons of money. And also I can add very good phrase to this movie: Old friends and old vine are best – about conflict of two best friend Mark and Eduardo. Money always make people worse, and even best friends can become total enemies cause of that.<br/><br/>I think ""The Social Network"" is a brilliant movie and almost everything about it is perfect. It is very inspiring story that really convinces to do something. I liked it a lot."

(His music sucks, so I always knew he was no musician!). Although he has been in a few movies previously, he has never had a major role, and I have always regarded him as appearing in movies to add star appeal, rather than for his acting ability. He is excellent in this, though you feel this is the role he was born to play, as the personality and life of Sean Parker seems very much like that of pop star.<br/><br/>No matter how much truth there is in the story, a great movie and definitely worth the watch.

","The real star of this film is the extraordinary screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin. The characters he creates here are dark, flawed, and the epitome of the worst of the 2000s culture that the target audience of the film sprang from. Fincher does a fabulous job of interpreting this and bringing it to life on the screen. His visual of the script is bold and vibrant, exactly what was called for by the script.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is that the performances aren't really that spectacular. They are good enough to carry the film but that's the best I can say for them. Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss twins was probably the weakest link of the bunch. He hammed it up big time and turned them into caricatures. I still haven't figured out why Jesse Eisenberg's performance was so applauded.

The Social Networks looks to unveil the brutal struggle for profit, what it stems from, and whether it was really intentional.<br/><br/>The acting was impeccable, making the tension between Eduardo and Mark almost tangible. Justin Timberlakes performance was very impressive and genuinely portrayed Sean Parkers personality (in the movie, I personally don't know much about his real personality). Another familiar face which I managed to recognize with a bit of research was Brenda song in her more serious role, known for Zack and Cody.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie was amazing.

The movie managed to maintain a relatively neutral viewpoint on what happened between Marks ''invention'' of Facebook and it hitting 1 million users, and deserves a lot of recognition."

","""The Social Network"" is a movie which shows us the true story of Mark Zuckerberg who is now a well known person because of his creation, the Facebook. It shows us also all the story between him and two brothers who sued him because they claimed that he stole their idea. Another thing that this movie shows us is that Mark Zuckerberg squeezed out of the business his best friend and co-founder of Facebook.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because is based on a true story facts and because of the direction of David Fincher which I think that it was just magnificent. I also liked the interpretations of Jesse Eisenberg's who plays as Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Garfield's who plays as Eduardo Saverin the co-founder of Mark Zuckerberg and Rooney Mara's who plays as Erica Albright and is simply beautiful.<br/><br/>Finally I have to say that ""The Social Network"" is a really nice movie which I believe that everyone have to watch it because it shows us many things that all of us must watch and think about them."

","This film is about Mark Zuckerberg creates Facebook and how to make Facebook. Before watching this film, I've never known about him. After watching this film, I'm not impressed by him. However, I really respect him because he made the most wonderful website in the world. I think everyone watches this movie won't have good impression of him because this film makes him bad man. I don't know what is fact and what is a fiction in this film. However from the directorial technique of this film, everything looks like fact. I think actors in this film are very nice. I really think Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg and I dislike him from bottom of my heart in the scene he gets on girl's bad side. From this film I learned that importance of decision and awfulness of desire. I think Mark mistook what he chooses because he wants to make Facebook cool more and more. This film makes us think importance of decision and awfulness of desire."

","This movie is based on the true story of Mark Zuckerberg who is the Facebook founder. The boy who became the youngest billionaire in the world lose his family, best friend and lover on the way that he reaches the top. This movie is different from the simple success story of the man who get millions wealth and fame. In contrast with the rhythm that picture and BGM flowing slowly, characters have a speedy conversation. The discord between them is interesting. Although there are various movie, I felt empty after watching this movie. Portraiture of Mark Zuckerberg is consistent from the beginning to the last. He changes nothing whereas Facebook he made grows up steadily. It is surprising that the man who makes the Facebook lacks communication skill. Various human relations in the modern society are drawn cleverly. It can be never said that it was an interesting work, but it makes me think about various things."

"shephe28","Null","0","0","3 August 2013"," Film Appreciation Review
","""The Social Network"" takes you on the journey to the top of social media, but also takes you on the journey of Mark Zuckerberg's college life. Mark faces a break-up, gains/losses friends, goes through two tough law suits, and makes millions of dollars. Mark, played by actor Jesse Eidenberg, goes through what seems like a tough break up (not because they have been dating for a long time, but more because Mark does not take rejection well). This break up sparks a late night drunken blog spree that ends with Mark creating Facemash, an online hot or not rating system for female college undergraduates. This is the first time you see just how truly brilliant Mark is when it comes to network programming and breaching systems security. Mark's partner in crime, Eduardo Saverin, helps Mark with the rating algorithm for Facemash. In this scene, you get the sense that with these two Harvard geniuses' they could create any type of computer/internet programming.<br/><br/>Facemash eventually crashed the Harvard network and Mark does get into some academic trouble for hacking the system to obtain the needed pictures of the undergraduates, but with this stunt he gets the attention of some other students. Cameron, Tyler, and Henry are also Harvard students that seek out Mark to ask him to be their network programmer for a social media idea that they have. Mark agrees to help them, but in the end never does as the idea they present to Mark is filled with issues. Mark does however elaborate on their idea and partners with Eduardo to ultimately create Facebook. Mark is the brains and the programmer of Facebook; Eduardo is the financial backing and marketing of Facebook. The movie portrays that fame, no matter how much or how little, can divide even the closest of friends. Even though it was out of spite and to prove he could, Mark created Facebook to generate a social media craze that would bring college students together and make it easier and more enjoyable for them to communicate. He sought out to bring people closer but in the end it tore his social life apart.<br/><br/>Facebook takes off quicker than Mark and Eduardo could ever imagine. The movie takes you through the rise and fall of Mark and Eduardo's partnership and takes you through the litigation process as Mark gets sued by not only Cameron, Tyler, and Henry, but also by Eduardo. The movie does an excellent job of calling your attention to the heated or important scenes by the use of silence. You can feel the raw emotion between Mark and Eduardo in court as such a wonderful friendship is coming to a horrible end. Silence is not only used in court, but throughout the movie to call attention and have the audience captivated by the drastic change in sound. The director uses lighting to change the feel of scenes throughout the movie. During the court scenes the lighting is crisp and cold to enhance the coldness of the emotions, during the scenes where Mark is inventing Facebook it's dark and melancholy to showcase how immersed Mark is and how he is shutting out everyone around him to make this idea come to life; brilliant lighting during the party scenes which showcase the rare happy, carefree scenes of the movie. The director really does a brilliant job using the lighting to transition to the next scene and emotion. The actors selected were great at capturing those raw emotions and pulling you into the whirlwind of fame and loss.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" really follows the same bases or theme as the 1999 movie, ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"" directed by Martyn Burk. ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"" is about the battle between Apple computers and Microsoft computers and the rise of both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Both movies showcase the familiar theme that fame, if not handles correctly, and can destroy the social life of the smartest of men."

","Jesse Eisenberg earned a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in playing Mark Zuckerberg (the genius behind Facebook). This film recounts the history and the court case against him. The film flashes back between the depositions and the real life accounts. The supporting cast is first rate and the writing is nearly perfect. Justin Timberlake is fantastic as Sean Parker, the Napster genius, who mentors the young college students behind Facebook. Jesse's Mark isn't a likable character at times. Mark comes across as a jerk and obsessed with Facebook's success. The Harvard students are just like everybody else. We see Mark move to Silicon Valley where he rents a house across the street from Sean Parker. We see how Mark screws his best friend and business partner, Eduardo, who is a likable character torn between his devotion to Facebook and reality. The cast is first rate and I can see why this film got several accolades."
"donuthaters12","10","0","0","3 July 2013"," A Relationship Destroyed By Ego And Ambition
","Facebook. The social networking site that have been used by millions and allowed people to become closer to each other. Facebook may reignite old friendships or destroy current ones. The aim of Facebook was always to bring people together but yet the film doesn't see it that way. This website caused a destruction of a friendship fueled by ego, ambition and visionary differences.<br/><br/>The Social Network is about a boy in college who has decided to create the Facebook and how this idea affected his friendship, relationships and partners. The film's screenplay is adapted by the novel, The Accidental Billionaires, written by Ben Mezrich. I myself have not read the book so I came into this blind and my only knowledge of Facebook is only at a consumer level. Aaron Sorkin adapted the novel into a screenplay that is entertaining as it doesn't try to become to complicated. The film's main focus is not on the creation of Facebook as that is only a supporting plot tool in the main storyline, which is the slow separation between two friends. I have no idea whether the film is accurate or not but it is damn entertaining. Sorkin has written fantastic dialogue in this film that feels natural. He also knows how to write conversations that not only are necessary to the plot but doesn't feel too cheesy or overused. Everything that is written seems to develop more about Eisenberg and Garfield's character and that the more they talk, the more you understand about these people. The first time I watched this, I felt that the ending didn't really conclude much about Facebook's aftermath, detailing about its importance and contribution to the world, but it is not ever about that. In my second viewing, I started to realise that the relationship between Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) and Saverin (Garfield) is the main point of the film and how one's ego has affected the relationship. This is drama that have been tread before but feels fresh and executed excellently.<br/><br/>David Fincher is a director I associate with in films that are dark and moody. This doesn't film doesn't feel that but rather it is more emotional and sympathetic. I didn't mind his direction here as he has created something intellectual and different from the other sad story dramas in recent years. I can't say this film is original but it is his execution that makes it different from the pack. He wanted this film to feel very personal and intimate, just as a relationship would. There are moments in here that are heartbreaking to watch and some moments are much more subtle but yet still does something for the audience. I cannot say this is Fincher's best but it does show something different from him.<br/><br/>This film was edited well, it feels smooth and slick. The film cuts a lot between actors as their emotions and facial expressions drive the story forward. It's not trying to become something of its own like it was on Fight Club but it does try to aid more in its ability to tell the story.<br/><br/>Jeff Cronenweth has done three films with David Fincher; Fight Club, The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. I felt this was his most safest compared to the three. It's very focused on capturing the drama rather than being something different and off the wall. The title sequence, where Zuckerberg runs through the campus of Harvard and the final shot that slowly zooms in on Zuckerberg's face, was shot beautifully. Cronenweth's work on this one is not something that I would remember as much but it does apply appropriately to the drama.<br/><br/>Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' work on this film is definitely a plus for me. There was a composition that plays after Zuckerberg's break up with Albright (Rooney Mara) that combines razor violins that haunts the track with a piano that is feels so simple and delicate. It not only sets the film up to a sad start but it also enhances certain moments in the film that make the drama even more dramatic, particularly the scene where Garfield walks up to Zuckerberg and smashes his computer and having an argument. That particular scene is the final cut in their relationship that destroyed their friendship, the ultimate betrayal. That particular composition is used in scenes where Zuckerberg has lost someone important in his life. It is heartbreaking to listen to.<br/><br/>Both Garfield and Eisenberg gave their most emotionally driven performances I have ever seen. I don't know if it's accurate or not but it doesn't matter as long as their performance drives the story forward and that they are believable in their roles. I felt that Garfield should have been nominated for a supporting actor at the Academy Award as his performance dominates everyone else in this film. Justin Timberlake in this film plays Sean Parker efficiently, he knows how to convincingly act like a jackass. It was a character though I did not like when on screen as I felt he was written to unlikable but I guess that was the point. Rooney Mara's character is a crucial piece but she was a little underused in this film, all is well though cause she has a leading role in Fincher's next film. This film definitely proved that both Garfield and Eisenberg has acting chops and are Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>This modern drama is not about Facebook's impact on the world but it's impact on the guy who made it. It is emotionally driven and will have you either liking this film or be intensely uninterested. It has good cinematography, along with a memorable score soundtrack and a stellar cast. Definitely great but not Fincher's best."
"adu30032","5","0","0","19 March 2013"," What a waste of a movie
","Fincher has done well in creating a film in which half of it is a lie, but is covered up by good performances. First of all when the movie is trying to be biographical there is no point in showing falsehood that is so exaggerated for more than half of the film. <br/><br/>Yeah, you know what I'm talking about: Since when did Eduardo come to California with Mark? All documentaries based on the actual creation of ""Facebook"" show that Eduardo wanted to stay back and complete his college and then perhaps join 'Facebook'.. This covers up at least if not more half of the film. The thing with this film is that it is so exaggerated especially in scenes like Eduardo breaking Mark's computer. The whole idea was to make Mark look like the asshole brains behind Facebook and Eduardo to be the nice fool (I know this is true, but the film takes it way beyond actuality only to be a crowd entertainer). The only good thing in this film is some fine performances by Jesse and Andrew and the Winklevoss brothers.<br/><br/>If Fincher wants to create a film based on true events, at least stick to the facts rather than showing staunch lies."

"dansview","7","0","0","16 January 2013"," Genius is Double-Edged
","This film attempts to serve multiple purposes. It tells the story of the founding of Facebook, employing flashbacks within the context of subsequent lawsuits. It's a character study of a peculiar boy-genius and his associates, and it offers a sociological depiction of elite universities. Finally, it includes implicit commentary on the mindset of the ""Digital Generation."" Aaron Sorkin can write well. Some may say that real people don't talk with the rhythm and glibness of ""Sorkinesque"" characters. In his defense, his goal is to entertain first and foremost. However, it's not unrealistic to attribute great lines of dialogue in clever streams of consciousness, to brilliant youth.<br/><br/>This movie employs many memorable lines, and makes us wish we could be half as witty in our daily interactions. There has been some criticism that some of the main characters exhibit an eerie coldness. I had no problem with that, given the fact that the ex-girlfriend, and the best friend, both show signs of warm humanity.<br/><br/>While Jesse Eisenberg is no stranger to roles as the socially dysfunctional nerd, this role required a darker edge, and he pulled it off to perfection. Particularly ""driven"" people are more likely to achieve their dreams than the rest of us, and Eisenberg skillfully portray's Zuckerberg's driven nature. Congratulations also to the Director for his role in bringing that out in him.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the shots where the main character is trotting across campus with focused purpose. You actually hear the pitter-patter of his tiny footsteps to imply his drive.<br/><br/>Don't overlook the power of loneliness to scale mountains or level buildings. Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber of 1995, was a deeply frustrated individual. Much of that came from his awkwardness with women, and his inability to get a girlfriend.<br/><br/>Apparently girls were at the root of Zuckerberg's drive. His ex referred to his project as a ""video game,"" while rejecting him. He immediately steps up his effort to expand, presumably to show off for her.<br/><br/>At one point the Zuckerberg character remarks to his associates that meeting someone of the opposite sex is the motivating factor behind many or most of our decisions in college.<br/><br/>His best friend gets positive recognition from an elite campus social club, and begins a relationship with an Asian girlfriend. Eisenberg does a wonderful job of portraying his character's brooding jealousy.<br/><br/>There is no ""action,"" per say in this film, but it moves quickly. We do not see any back story involving the childhood of the characters. The father of twin students appears once, and the best friend refers to his dad once or twice, so it is not entirely one of those movies about kids that seemingly exist without parents. There is no reference to Zuckerberg's family.<br/><br/>We do get a decent shot of San Francisco and feel the contrast between the East and West Coast settings, with the use of a swimming pool and a few shots of a suburban street. There is no actual sex, but we do see a couple of implied sexual encounters.<br/><br/>What started as an arguably shallow social enterprise, evolved into a vehicle for families and friends to stay in touch, aritsts to promote their projects, businesses to share their latest concepts, and thinkers to discuss their ideas.<br/><br/>Facebook itself can be used for good, for evil, for vacuous mediocrity, and for profane narcissism. Zuckerberg has the free will to use his genius for whatever legal means he wishes, and we have the free will to use Facebook for whatever legal means we wish.<br/><br/>I recommend this film for anyone who enjoys quick, clever dialogue, likes technology, or identifies with underdogs."

There is no action in the movie , so the director had to keep the dialogues crisp ,and fast-paced. This ,the director has succeeded in doing , and thus creating an engaging movie.<br/><br/>In this movie , Mark Zuckerberg emerges as a total nerd , somebody who might have made a lot of money , but would be difficult to live with , in real life. The movie starts with him breaking up with his girlfriend , who is fed up with his nerdish ways , and he retaliates by passing insulting comments on her in his blog .<br/><br/>However , the movie is made by inputs given by his former friend Eduardo Saverin , who eventually filed a lawsuit on him ,so he is bound to give a negative image of Mark Zuckerberg.

","****This review may contain spoilers****<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin are college buddies who are eager to meet the girls on their campus. After Mark is dumped by his girlfriend, the two put their brains together and come up with the idea to create a web page. The web page allows one to compare pictures of girls on their campus and rate them. After they complete the web, the web link is sent via email to their classmates. The site did give them recognition, but not in the way they anticipated because Mark receives academic probation for crashing the schools servers, the female population on campus shuns both of them and gains the admiration of the male community for their creativity. The school does shut down the web page, but the popularity was not easily erased. The recognition caught the attention of the Winklevoss brothers, who reach out to Zuckerberg. They ask Mark for his help to create an exclusive dating website for their campus, but Mark comes up with a better idea. With the help of Eduardo business intelligence, the two create a single website that would allow college students the ability to simultaneously communicate with each other and share pictures. The Social Network depicts the story of how word of mouth was a powerful tool for spreading the word. Then Mark's creative mind takes social networking to a different level with the release of his website. Does the new website work in the way they anticipated and give them the notoriety they seek? Jessie Eisenburg and Andrew Garfield show convincing roles as college students, who thrived on the intention of reaching for notoriety on their campus. Many college students may breeze through college, but struggle to get a decent job. Esienburg and Garfield illustrate the role of college students who try in achieving the fame not ever reached. Or do they? Are the two creative minds able to take social networking to a different level with the help of computer programming and the internet? Bring It On Again (2004) showed us how cheerleaders used their creativity to draw attention to creating new squad for their college. This effort took them days and probably weeks to get the word out to their campus; not mention the sweat and tears. What if the cheerleaders of BIOA had the innovation and technology shown in TSN? The possibilities could be infinite and shocking at the same time."
"j-hernan","Null","0","0","16 September 2012"," The Social Network Review
","The Director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin rush through a series of attempts and failures, achievements and disloyalty ending with what feels like a gloominess conclusion on an lonely soul. This film is extremely entertaining and feels like a psychologically roller-coaster. The film is created around a depressed inconsistency: in 2003, Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg, is a 19 year old sophomore at Harvard. Mark formulates Facebook and ultimately creates a 500 million person network of ""friends,"" but he is so narcissistic, driven, and introverted that he can't stay close to anyone. Mark dumps his one and only real friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), who is also a student at Harvard and assisted in helping Mark initiate the social network. The film The Social Network contains amazing satire because the inner theme is not connectivity but rather a disconnection. This movie is about the beginning of a technology calculated to get people closer together and showcases a main character who learns the agonizing disbanding of social connections. The theme has a strong connection with the movie You've Got Mail. The new technology shows how social connections can be made without really understanding the real life connections that goes along with it. The Social Network contains social disbanding is weakened by its swarming network of known, friendly signifiers. It implies that yes was friends with these signifiers as much as we are friends with hundreds or thousands of people on Facebook. As represented in the film, the social site doesn't really carry people together in a significant way. The film contains dissimilar lawsuit depositions as the movies framing tool, it follows this intellectual but socially uncomfortable student Mark Zuckerberg as he heads down the path moving to Facebook after breaking up with by a girl he likes (Rooney Mara). As an Internet joke he pulls for redemption for his punishment, lands him in a mess with the Harvard board members. At the same time he gathers the attention from other wealth Harvard students who would otherwise keep away from him, the Winklevoss twin brothers (Josh Pence & Armie Hammer). They offer him a job to work on their social site and later claim he stole their idea. Mark also gets sued by his once best and only real friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). Eduado was one of the original investors to start the site Mark envisioned. Mark is eventually courted by Sean Parker (Justin Timerlake) the owner of the music site Napster. Sean convinces Mark to move his site home base to Silicon Valley to allow access to wealth venture capitalists seeking outside inventors. The last scene in my opinion contains the mastery of the film by never breaking the 180 degrees during the heated conversation between Mark and Erica. This meeting illustrates the spectator more into the story because there is a smaller amount of a need to resituate the person within the scene. The motif that all of us can relate to is that social acceptance occurs throughout the film. Mark is building Facebook because he is trying to gain social acceptance. The scene that highlights this the most is when Erica questions Mark's fascination with ""Final Clubs"" because of the influence they supply its members. Facebook is shown as a social network but it also shows the variations from the competitive sites. The film itself is more about the creation of Facebook and the history of how the company was started, more than the actual social networking site itself. The movie is really about human actions more than anything else. How personal agendas and greed sometimes get ahead of friendship, morals and teamwork."

","""The Social Network"" is an enticing film to view which highlights the debates surrounding founder Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Severin, the Winklevoss Twins and Divya Narenda over who will get the credit for being the inventor of the world's biggest social network in the world, Facebook.<br/><br/>Written by the legendary screenwriter Aaron Sorkin who claims that it this is a nonfiction piece, but sadly I beg to oppose. The movie has Zuckerberg being portrayed as a condescending, self-centered unscrupulous jerk and on the verge of getting dumped by a woman, which never happened in real life. Sure this scene makes me wonder if it is entirely nonfiction, but I digress, the scene is perfect in its pitch and the dialogue is quite sublime even if I thought Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) was treated in an unfair way. The acting is virtually tantalizing and the direction by David Fincher was near perfection. There's a real reason why a lot of reviews written are more longer than normal. Mainly because the dialogue raises a lot of provocative questions that will likely leave anyone intrigued. It is an overview that how a social networking tool has become one of the most innovative of inventions since the invention of the telephone. It's also compelling to note that with the exception for Eduardo (Andrew Garfield) I thought that most of the characters are billed as unimpressive (even Zuckerberg).<br/><br/>Another thing that irked me about ""The Social Network"" is that I appalled at the way then Harvard President Larry Summers (Douglas Urbanski) was portrayed. Urbanski is a recurring guest on Rush Limbaugh's program so I was aghast that there was no portrayal to cast Summers to a more darker character. Some were irked about the Winklevoss twins were dismissed of their allegations that Facebook was their invention, I found it revolting that the twins demanded Summers (who's now President Obama's economic advisers) demanded that Zuckerberg should be disciplined based on these pretenses.<br/><br/>Numerous articles have been written chastising this movie for it's low opinion towards women. Well even though the time are changing, there is still a lot of misogyny in top Ivy League Colleges like Harvard and though it shouldn't offend anyone, sadly the truth hurts. It's still debatable if this movie is 100% accurate, ""The Social Network"" is very scintillating movie to enjoy. And sure it's not my all-time favorite movie, it is still highly recommended to watch."

I wouldn't be surprised if the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in this movie was come up in this fashion.<br/><br/>With 95/100 on Metacritic, 3 Oscars and so much hype, The Social Network can be called a monumental success in Hollywood. David Fintcher may have again proved that he is not only a storytelling master, but also a mastermind of medias, as evidenced by the convoluted nature of the Social Network project, and the explosive media coverages after-wards. I believe this movie will be discussed, analyzed and staying in its controversial status for the next decade. I, for one, am totally compelled to find out about the real Zuckerberg. However, such interests only garnered me more curiosity in digging deeper about him. After all, the aftertaste of watching a big screen villainous main protagonist is strong, especially if such a figure feels like your unfriendly neighbor who is in possession of similar, uh, admirable qualities.<br/><br/>Liked I said, I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the real-life Zuckerberg is quite friendly, and easy to get along with. However, the real issue here, is how I should live with the fact that, as a fellow geek/nerd, would what Zuckerberg wants to say be similar to what I want to say? Having been following the discussion board here, I cannot help but notice that people are generally offended and raging out against Mr. Z portrayed in this movie, pulling no punches in calling him ""douche-bag"" ""self-absorbed"" and so on. Some also said he's probably autistic and even aspergers. Moreover, some went on to say that being autistic doesn't justify what Mr.Z has done in the movie, which I totally agree. But still, under all these fancy terms, these extravagant wrappings, what would Zuckerberg feel? Is he really comfortable with being a modern day Butch Cassidy, aka a role model for renegades and rebels? <br/><br/>Thus I remembered a time where all people felt compelled to justify themselves to their subjects. The rich wished to justify his wealth either by appearances of hard-working or good heritage; the religious would wish to justify themselves by their deeds, as holy as possible; while rebels generally overlooked, or lived in the limbo created by other people's justifications. If Mr. Z was a 1st-century Jew (actually he's a 21st-century Jew), he would most likely end up as someone like the prodigal son in the Bible's ""Prodigal Son Parable"", instead of the billionaire he is now. The sheer difference of these two outcomes drives me to ask, if Mr. Z in the movie, a rebel and a billionaire, felt the need to justify himself? Or more personally to us commoners, would he feel totally free and more-evoluted if he reaches a point of completely no need to justify himself, when he's crowned with all these paramount achievements? To my disappointment, when I saw his business card, which said, ""I am Mark Zuckerberg, Bixxx"", I knew instantly he was still compelled to justify himself and his legacy, just like the old-fashioned religions. This business card is essentially saying, ""I am the Lord of this business, and this is my Ten Commendaments for you, which is actually only One-commandments, that I AM Mark Z, and you're my Bixxx."" Why is that? Aside from raising more brows and attract more medias, wouldn't 2 Billion dollars have made him feel safe already, that he needs stunts like this? That's when I realized that, the sheer irony for people like Sean Parker and Mr.Z in the movie, is that they went so far in denying their religious nature, and the fact that by saying something like ""This is our generation, our rules"", they're essentially creating new religions, for both themselves and the others . The prodigal son in the Bible, despite his rebelliousness and reckless, childish behaviors to destroy himself, saw no point in gratifying his own namesake, or writing down his own legacy and epics. However, we modern people are so into raging against the old values and creating our own, that when something backfires at us to make us feel there are after all something wrong with the whole idea, we are only left in a position to regret (or like Mr.Z did in the movie, expressing his contempt to the judge and jury).<br/><br/>The movie ended with the friendship between the two lead roles presumably broken forever, while the lawyer got some insight into Zuckerberg's deeply troubled self, which he seldomly leak to his 500 million Facebook friends. Once a friend of mine told me that, justification is for reconciliation, at least that's what happened in the Prodigal Son parable that the Father reconciled beautifully with his prodigal son. The Bible told me that whether you're an authentic A-hole or just someone who tries very hard to be one, you're welcome to accept Jesus' love, and be reconciled with him. I truly wish Mr. Z and Saverin can be reconciled in a graceful fashion, too."

","""The Social Network"" is an excellent film and the reason that I know this is because in the first twenty minutes of the film I wanted to strangle Mark Zuckerberg in real life because he is undoubtedly a pompous ass.I am amazed that the man who was a college student who was crass,cruel and a braggart became a billionaire so young.I do not like braggarts,I never have and I never will.Braggarts make the world a miserable place because they never stop talking about how supposedly wonderful they are and the whole time they know full well that they are pathetic,sad human beings.The part in the very beginning of the film made me incredibly sad because the whole train wreck started because Zuckerberg decided to rate girls on the web.What a vicious and rude thing to do.I know that Mr.Zuckerberg is widely admired worldwide and worshipped as God,but God he is not.Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg are just a symptom of American society that is now lost and on the way out of existence."

","The social network is a drama directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin. The movie follows the journey of a 19 year old computer major of Harvard, Mark Zukerberg, who is played by Jesse Eisenberg. The movie begins with an unpleasant date in a dark lit bar with his girlfriend, now ex, Erica Albright, played by Rooney Mara. The dark atmosphere helps to set the mood of the friendly conversation that will soon become unpleasant. This scene depicts an argument over Marks attempt to get into a Final Club, which Erica doesn't understand. The over the shoulder angles, quickly switch back and forth keeping the viewer into the in depth conversation. As the conversation becomes more intense the cameras become closer and closer to the actors faces, putting you into their seat almost. This scene sets the whole movie into motion. Filled with frustration, and slightly intoxicated, Mark lashes out at the women at Harvard by creating a small website to rate the look of women side by side. The new websites impressive growth and popularity over a span of hours draws attention to him by the Winklevoss twins, both played by Armie Hammer. The Winklevoss brothers present an idea for a ""Social Network"" site to Mark, who quickly decides to help. The movie then begins to focus its theme on the value of friendships.<br/><br/>With the new project underway Mark dodges calls and emails from the twins while he works on his own social site that is greatly parallel to that of the twin's idea. Marks friend Eduardo Saverin, played by Andrew Garfield, helps fund his website called ""Thefacebook"" which was exclusive to only Harvard students. As time passes the popularity of Thefacebook greatly increases, both causing legal issues with the twins for theft of intellectual property, and gains attention from Napster founder Sean Parker, played by Justin Timberlake. Sean decides it is time to expand the Thefacebook, which is later renamed ""Facebook""; and he puts his best foot forward to help expand the website, while taking his fair chunk of profits. From here on in you see many conflicts of friendships, and betrayal between many of the characters, mostly by intercut scenes of Mark, in a room full of lawyers trying to settle with both Eduardo and the Winklevoss twins. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an in depth pop culture movie. The creativity behind it is pure genius and is a must see, not just once, but multiple time!"
"sad-eyed-angel","8","0","0","14 April 2012"," It shouldn't work.... but it does.
","This is the kind of movie that shouldn't work on a number of levels. First the obvious of when word about first got out people were all ""a movie about facebook? perish the thought!"" and the story itself is basically the plight of privileged douchebags. You've got the head douchebag, Mark Zuckerberg, who in theory would be the protagonist because he well, invented Facebook and everything but given the story he's kind of the protagonist and antagonist rolled into one. Everything knows a guy like him: he's incredibly brilliant and gifted, but the problem is he knows it. All too well. If he had a theme song, it would be ""intellectually gifted and I know it."" He goes through the entire movie fueled by and in love with his ambition that he is almost a completely unlikable character (when he gets busted towards the beginning of the movie, he suggests the university should thank him for finding holes in their system). Next you've got Sean Parker, not as privileged but still plenty douchey. His thing is that because he has had some success he has confidence in himself much like Zuckerberg does and sees the opportunity to help mold Zuckerberg into a bigshot and ride his coattails in the process. Then you've got the Winklevoss twins, the tall and tan douchebags. Zuckerberg accurately (like I said, the man in brilliant, it's no accident he is where he is) states that the Winklevoss twins are suing him because they didn't get their way for once. Admittedly, the Winklevoss twins only sued Zuckerberg because of the bruise to their fragile egos and the fact that Zuckerberg made it possible for people to watch them lose a race on another continent. Lastly, you've got Eduardo, more privileged than some (he funds everything for the first half of the movie) but the least douchey in the bunch. In fact, he is the most endearing, earnest, and likable character in the movie. Like most college students, he's trying to join an exclusive club but agrees to help Mark because he's his best friend. Eduardo has the most conscience and is always the one to step in when he thinks Mark is crossing a line he shouldn't be crossing, but Eduardo is a loyal sonofabitch to a fault. Loyal until Mark doesn't reciprocate and at Sean's urging, screws his pal over. Eduardo is the one character who you feel sorry for and want to root for.<br/><br/>As you can see, there are so many things in this movie that should make it not work. But... it does. Beautifully. What it comes down to is that this movie is wonderfully written and superbly acted. Aaron Sorkin was at his element here because the dialogue moves along so quickly and effortlessly and the story is fun to follow and watch. Next, every actor does a phenomenal job with their part. Jesse Eisenberg, before this movie was cruising down the Michael Cera highway, playing a string of awkward, likable underdogs, but a lot less annoying than Cera. He truly shines as the pro/antagonist Zuckerberg, making it so he is a complete jerk, but an interesting fella, to boot. As Eisenberg said in an interview, it's liberating to play a jerk because you don't have to worry about offending anybody...because that's all your character does. Next up to bat is Justin Timberlake. I really don't know why people hate on Justin Timberlake, I mean, is it simply boy-band backlash? Guys, the world needs boy bands, too. More to the point, Justin Timberlake is legitimately a good actor, and perfect for the smirky, smarmy careless trainwreck that is Sean Parker. And then there's Andrew Garfield, aka Eduardo. While I had never heard of him before, he was a knockout as Eduardo and makes me look forward to see him as Spiderman. Lastly is Armie Hammer, who plays both Winklevoss twins. Another not very well known actor who is able to play both twins convincingly enough, you do believe they are two different people and are flummoxed when you look it up after and realize he played both. Especially because that means he had to row both sides of the boat. This movie, a story about privileged boys fighting, is actually a masterpiece. It is the kind of movie you watch so you can say you've seen it and look/feel smarter, but you'll actually enjoy watching it, too."
"gurqk85","8","0","0","7 February 2012"," Film review - The Social Network
","""Has more than 845 million active users"", ""Has the 3rd largest population in the world"" and ""Estimation of the company is worth an estimated $84 billion"", all these describes one-the Facebook-is the most popular social networking service. Facebook was created by Mark Zukerberg who was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2010 and marking as the world's youngest billionaire. The Social Network, won the Best motion picture, best director and best screenplay at the 68th golden globe award, is about the founding of Facebook website and the resulting lawsuits that motived from the real story of Mark Zukerberg and his friends. <br/><br/>The story begins in the fall of 2003, Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg gained popularity by creating an on-campus website called Facemash.com, a site that allows users to rate the attractive female students. The Facemash.com's popularity and the fact that he created the site in one night was enough to draw attention of the Winklevoss twins. The Winklevoss twins asked Zuckerberg to create a dating website called the Harvard connection. From this project, Mark gets a new and better idea and created new social networking website called Facebook with his friend Eduardo Saverin. Zuckerberg soon expanded the Facebook's network from Harvard University to public with helping of Sean Parker, the young entrepreneur who became the pioneer of Napster. As the Facebook hit a great success all over the world, Zuckerberg faces two lawsuits, one from Saverin and the other from the Winklevoss twins. The movie portraits these story ironically that even Zuckerberg created successful social networking juggernaut, but it turned out that he lost his close friends (his social network).<br/><br/>The film was directed by David Fincher who is famous for such as his debut film-Alien 3, Fight Club, Panic Room, Zodiac and Curious Case of Benjamin Button. It is somewhat unexpectedly considered that the director chooses non-fiction dram genre instead of the thriller because most of his works are based on thriller genre, except for the Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Fantasy-melodramatic). However, when the movie begins, we could find David Fincher's touches in The Social Network- impeccable camera works, attitude for the perfection of movie and his own dark and murky but vivid cinematography. For example, the scenes at the Harvard University are far from clear, cool and gorgeous, the movie offering a historic, dark, and edgy scenery. The Social Network also takes non-linear narrative structure. Most memoir movies are usually takes linear narrative structure-one single path from beginning to end, however Fincher takes a different approach. The movie seems to take a standard form (chronological) at the beginning part, but the movie starts to jump over the time and space-Mark Zuckerberg's recall of his memory when he developing the Facebook (the past) and various legal battle scene (the present). <br/><br/>The performances of the actors are also pretty impressive. Jesse Eisenberg played the main character-Mark Zuckerberg who earns enormous wealth and fame by creating online social network, but ironically fails in off-line social network. It is really true as the Mark Zuckerberg's real character, Eisenberg ties to craft not only the successful computer genius's outside, but ironic-tragic character's inside-humanity such as anger, sad and even as a freak.Andrew Garfield, who known for 'Never let me go' and 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus', plays the Zuckerberg's friend- Eduardo Saverin. He successfully acts on Saverin character as near-perfect man with emotions-straight and foolishness. Justin Timberlake also gives an inspire performance as Sean Parker as clever, savvy and narcissist entrepreneur. <br/><br/>Similar to the Social Network, there are some similar movies that take motif from the true-story or real person's story, for instances, Beautiful Mind (2001), directed by Ron Howard, is a drama film based on the life of John Nash (Russell Crowe stars) who is a Nobel Laureate Economics, 21 (2008), directed by Robert Luketic, is developed by the true story of the MIT Blackjack Team in Ben Mezrich's book Bringing Down the House and Catch me if you can(2002), directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks, based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr. These movies are not exactly same as the Social Network film, but these moves are developed based on the true-story and real- life story. <br/><br/>Not dominant, but some movies are takes same non-linear narrative structure as the Social Network. For example, Batman Begins (2005), directed Christopher Nolan and stars Christian Bale as Batman, takes a non-linear structure by showing the Bruce Wayne's memory and the present back and forth and Old-boy (2003),directed by Chan-Wook Park, also showing a non-linear narrative story progress by mixing Oh-Dae- Su(main- character, stars by Min-Sik Choi)'s the recall of the past memory and the present story progress that gives the clue why he custodies for a 15 years. <br/><br/>In the Social Network, the director David Fincher and scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin are try to develop the movie from the shy and silent young man's ordinary but special story. How personal desires correspond with the spirit of the age? Whether Mark Zuckerberg is a genius who cleverly read the human's common desire or just an astute cheater who steals and modifies quickly from someone's idea? How the World Wide Web transformed into another type of living space, which is similar to the real world(social communication), but somewhat totally different(unreal)? The answer might varies and interpretation also different from each audience. But,in my opinion, the movie the Social Network is the specific and analogous story which reflecting the Web- oriented world that mixed with our real life."
"moviemajesty","8","0","0","19 December 2011"," Well Made but Flawed
","A movie about Facebook? Really? This is what I was thinking when I first heard about this film. Thankfully, after viewing, my opinion changed. Director David Fincher has pulled off a very well made film thanks to the story, dialog, and the acting.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg, a student at Harvard University who has begun work in his college dorm with his roommate to make Facebook, a social networking website in which users can create a personal profile and connect with other users. However, lawsuits arise that accuse Zuckerberg of stealing the idea from another group of students. As the site continues to grow, Mark meets Sean Parker, a very successful entrepreneur. Mark beings to gravitate more towards Sean, leaving his roommate behind.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed the film. It was engaging, intelligent, and above all, fresh. The acting was phenomenal. Jesse Eisenberg truly comes off as a witty college kid. Justin Timberlake, who played Sean Parker, does a terrific job in a fairly clichéd role as well. However, I felt that the film's biggest downfall was the portrayal of Zuckerberg. Although he is humorous and intelligent, he ultimately was egotistical and arrogant. From the opening scene, he comes off, in my opinion, as very unlikeable; someone who really needs to take a class on thinking before speaking. So for the entire film, I often found myself rooting for his roommate, a much more down to earth guy, as opposed to Zuckerberg. So yeah, I enjoyed the film, but if I was the real life Mark Zuckerberg, I would not be pleased with my portrayal."

","Well acted for the most part. It Seems to be a quite factual and yet a completely middle of the road true story. I find that there is very little that is remarkable about the people who created Facebook. But then Facebook itself is not necessarily remarkable, given that all the programming architecture contained within it already existed at least 5 years before it's time, the difference being not all elements were combined into one complete suite. I found The Pirates of Silicon Valley to be a much more compelling if a somewhat more sensationalized version on other programmers lives and success stories. Both movies end with a somewhat bittersweet end and perhaps teach us that money and success is truly not the only ingredients towards leading a happy life. This movie is worth watching if you have a desire to learn more about the software industry in North America."

","This movie deserved the accolades thrown on it. With a good script (penned by Aaron Sorkin, who breaks out of the habits that killed his previous show), nice pacing, smart acting and a few clever tricks, it tells the story of Facebook in convincing fashion. Proceedings are kept lean and smart: there are not too many characters and they are kept relatively uncomplicated. In fact, that might be the main criticism: for something dressed as a factual interpretation of events, it's all rather shallow. The main character has the most depth, but the rest more or less tumble into the situations they were designed for. In short, it lines up a lot of caricatures of people and them shoots them down in appropriate fashion. Near the end a character makes a comment that counters one of the opening lines in the movie: it's intentional and works if you don't think too much about it. But under close scrutiny it falls apart.<br/><br/>That is the trick to this move: don't think too hard and it appears to be intelligent. But dig too deep and the whole saga seems a tad daft. Much like Facebook!"

Besides all that, the movie still fills you in and gives you perspective of what is most important in our lives, which turns out to be our nearest and dearest, not fame, nor money.<br/><br/>What I believe works as an argument for the awards The Social Network got is: It's relevant, it's fresh, everyone can relate to Facebook - because we all use Facebook. Due to the fact that all that is true, I still cant see the genius in The Social Network, which it got its awards from.<br/><br/>I can leave you with this.

This is a personal observation and in no way indicated that Zuckerberg has been diagnosed with Asperger's. (Many computer programmers deal with Asperger's Sysdrome, Bill Gates being one of the most famous people with Asperger's) I think this movie has something for people of all sorts of walks in life, from computer geeks, programmers, Facebook users, students, health professionals, and people curious on how am incredible website like Facebook would come to life.<br/><br/>I for one knew people in school who shared many of the personalities of the characters in this film and smiled many times as an individual personality would match up with someone I know.<br/><br/>This is one of the better movies I have watched in a long time."

","The Verdict <br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is one of the best movies of 2010. It is definitely worth watching even if you are not a Facebook fan and do not like social networks in general. The story of Facebook is only a showcase for the modern American society, American elite colleges and American business world in particular. At the movie core is a deep and non-trivial exploration of such eternal human culture themes as friendship and betrayal, power and money, youth and coming of age, life choices and life priorities.<br/><br/>The Positives <br/><br/>Perfection is something we have learned to expect from David Fincher's movies. Whether we like them or not, lack of professionalism is never among their flaws.""The Social Network"" is not an exception from that rule – it is as close to perfection as it gets. <br/><br/>Rarely can we find such a well-balanced movie, where all the high quality components are assembled together in a perfect harmony. ""The Social Network"" won Oscars for adapted screenplay, original music score, and film editing and earned the five other nominations, including directing (David Fincher) and lead actor (Jesse Eisenberg), as well as the overall best picture nomination. <br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is a very, very good movie that easily earns a well deserved ""A"" grade, but in my opinion, it is not a truly outstanding movie, which brings us to ""The Negatives"" section of the review. <br/><br/>The Negatives <br/><br/>I think that the absolute majority of people feel mixed emotions towards the main character by the end of the movie. They of course admire his intellect, his passion, his hard work, his almost instinctive business grip. At the same time, they look down on him with disgust: a cocky nerd, almost a sociopath, and a king of antisocial behavior, an insensitive, cruel, deceitful person who betrayed his best friend, publicly and rudely insulted his former girlfriend on the Internet, and stole an idea of Facebook from the business partners who trusted him with it.<br/><br/>Moreover, the movie gives us that warm and fuzzy feeling of superiority over the youngest billionaire in the world. Yes, maybe we are not that smart, not that rich, and not that famous, but look what a terrible price he paid for his success! <br/><br/>He sacrificed everything to create Facebook and to grow it into a billion dollar company. He thought it would make him the biggest winner, but look who is the biggest loser - his best friend is a laptop, his soul mate is a web site, and his world is savaged by arrogance and loneliness.<br/><br/>The main problem with the dramatic and nasty ""dark side"" of Mark Zuckerberg so skillfully portrayed in the movie is that it is not real. It exists only in our imagination fueled by the Aaron Sorkin's masterfully written screenplay that adapts Ben Mezrich's 2009 fictional book ""The Accidental Billionaires"". <br/><br/>The real Mark Zuckerberg is very different from his portrayal in the movie; see for example the article by David Kirkpatrick. <br/><br/>I am not saying that Mark Zuckerberg is a saint, or that every bad thing told about him in the movie is a lie. He is not an angel, but he is also not a demon - he is just like you and me, only slightly smarter, a bit wealthier, and somewhat more famous.<br/><br/>I am not trying to say that intellect, wealth, and fame are the ultimate things, in fact I believe in quite the opposite. However, I wish the movie were more honest in that respect and showed us a real Mark Zuckerberg rather than his overly dramatic caricature masterfully created for feeding and captivating our lazy imagination.<br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"

To do this he creates what would become the most popular website in the world, and he's accused of betrayal several times along the way. Is he a backstabber or simply one of the greatest businesspeople of our time?<br/><br/>The Social Network paints Zuckerberg as neither hero nor villain. He's merely obsessed with his mission and, paradoxically, both a brilliant manipulator of social needs on a broad scale, and blind--perhaps willfully so--to the emotions of those closest to him. (Eisenberg's performance nearly screams ""Asperger's!,"" but otherwise the film never raises the syndrome as a possibility.)<br/><br/>Being a Sorkin creation, this version of Zuckerberg gives us a vicarious thrill in each flash-forward deposition, during which the powers that be smugly attempt to squash him down and he answers with a crushing, unanswerable retort every time. However we are never sure if what he is speaking to power is actually truth, or what he would like it to be.<br/><br/>Why you should see it: You enjoy a good, profound Sorkin speech.

As you can watch several conversations of Mark Zuckerberg on YouTube and somewhere, you may doubt that the portrait of him in this film is a bit exaggerated toward ""nerd"". There is undeniable sense that so-called a genius hacker is top-drawer in mathematics or programming skills but has no skill on communication, and the guy who run the world's biggest social network site has simply less social networking skill.<br/><br/>Geekish elements are spreading out such as unix commands, recruit in a hacking competition, or Sendmail book is put up in untidy heaps.

","In ""The Social Network"", computer science student Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) was a socially awkward student who began his first social site as revenge for being dumped by his girlfriend. Flash cuts were used to compress the time Mark runs, when he goes to the dorm to hammer out his revenge social site. Dark lighting was used while Zuckerberg completed most of his site coding and in his dealings with ex-girlfriend Erica. Zuckerberg, known for his social site coding, was approached by the Winklevoss twins (Arnie Hammer) to create a Harvard dating site. Zuckerberg avoided working with the Winklevoss twins and went on to create his own social networking site, The Facebook. Zuckerberg didn't care about making money from social networking but he and his best friend decided to make it a business venture. Eduardo (Andres Garfield), Zuckerberg's best friend, became the business manager of The Facebook. As a business decision, Eduardo and Zuckerberg met with the founder of Napster. Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) stressed to Zuckerberg that The Facebook needed to grow fast and provided advice on how to make The Facebook grow, including modifying its name to just Facebook and moving to California. Once in California, Parker was made a major business partner, while Zuckerberg's best friend was placed on a back burner. Facebook began making millions in advertising dollars as millions of users signed up for Facebook. The Facebook site became widely used throughout college campuses all over the world. The wide use of Facebook reignited the Winklevoss twins' urge to sue Zuckerberg for a share in the site's success. Throughout the movie, Zuckerberg noted he didn't care about the amount of revenue produced by Facebook. The majority of the movie provides insight into the ending of the movie. The Winklevoss twins and Eduardo sue Zuckerberg due to feeling betrayed and ripped off as business partners. During the Indirect-subjective scenes of Zuckerberg in the court mediation room, he reflects on other's views of him and his business decisions. Although sued by his best friend, Zuckerberg made amends by not only settling the lawsuits, but also returning his best friend's partnership shares and name to Facebook.

","In the film The Social Network, Mark Zukerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg) is the founder of the social network known worldwide as Facebook. The film covers his journey of becoming so successful and the theme that a person can do anything it takes to get to the top and become rich and famous but once they get there they may look back and wonder if it was all worth it to end up lonely. Originally Mark set up a site known as Face Mash through hacking the schools' records to provide information and photos allowing people to rate the faces of female students, after his girlfriend Erica Albright (played by Rooney Mara) breaks up with him. This is the start of a number of relationships Mark ruins on his way to the top. Eventually the site receives so much input it crashes the system. When the Winklevoss twins (played by Armie Hammer) hear news of this they already have a team in place trying to build a social network for Harvard students and invite Mark to join their team and help them. After reviewing their ideas and work Mark goes off on his own and with the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield) to set up the network known as Facebook which mirrors the Winklevosses' idea without their consent or telling anyone that he has done this. Mark disregards any communication from the Winklevosses again severing relationships to benefit himself alone, leaving them out. As Facebook progresses and becomes larger Mark eventually begins moving the company forward at his own discretion and manipulates his best friend, Eduardo, out of having any ownership in the company; yet another ruined relationship of someone who has helped Mark succeed. By the end of the film mark has no friends and it closes out with him looking up his ex-girlfriend on the Facebook network. The theme in this movie is similar to the in the movie Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, in which the father in the movie uses his daughter to build a relationship with his son in law. He then also uses his son in law to his benefit to get revenge and shut other companies down. In the end the father ends up just as lonely. Two film techniques used in relation specifically to the theme of The Social Network were dramatic acting and irony. Throughout the entire movie Mark is coldest through his intense sustained dialogue with people, requiring little action on his part. For example when he is speaking in the courtroom against the Winklevoss twins, Eduardo, and their attorneys he comes off very cold to the point showing no emotion towards them in which the audience feels the emptiness of mark through his dialogue alone. The most ironic part in the film is that Mark's main concern was climbing the social ladder and in every attempt to do so, including making the world's largest social network, he is left sitting alone refreshing the Facebook page of his ex-girlfriend after being sued by his ex-best friend as well. After everything was it worth it to end up lonely?"

","This definition is the root of all the lies, lawsuits, success, and failure seen in the movie The Social Network. After Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jessie Eisenberg) and his girlfriend Erica (played by Rooney Mara) break up, you see Mark running back to his dorm. This flee is one of many that we see throughout this film. Once back to his dorm, Mark begins to inhale some beer while blogging away on his online journal. He determinedly posts female's pictures as a ""Who's hotter"" competition on a FaceSmash that later develops into school punishment. As a plethora of people log on to FaceSmash, Mark and his good friend, at the time, Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield) realize how much spotlight would come from this. After Mark received the punishment of six months academic probation, he is confronted by the all-star rowers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer) with a ""Harvard Connection"", Mark easily accepts the offer to build the website. Mark tells Eduardo the idea of blogging, friend request, and all the other perks of this facebook web page. As the low-lighted scenes continue, Mark continues to create this Harvard Connection that he will claim as Facebook. Mark creates this web page mainly with what he claims as his ideas, and also his best friend's money. The Facebook launches, and Eduardo and Mark then celebrate the fact that this social network is moving forward. The Winklevoss twins then realize that Mark had scammed their idea, and then began the plot ways to get credit for what was theirs.<br/><br/>Vance-2 As The Facebook becomes more popular, the creators start ruling in the money and fame from this ""Mark Zuckerberg Production"". Mark and Eduardo soak up all the attention from the gorgeous females, and all their classmates. When Mark receives a letter from the twin's lawyer, Eduardo then begins to question if Mark really was lying. Eduardo eventually parts ways with Mark for the time being, and then Mark really starts the work on The Facebook. He meets up with Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake), who is the creator of Napter. Sean is the type of man of business man who likes to get involved. He weasels his way into The Facebook action, and gets Mark to sign into a big deal. During business with Sean, he splits percentage of ownership with even more people. Mark is an intelligent individual, but does not know what he was getting himself in too.<br/><br/>Eduardo eventually notices the suspiciousness of Mark's actions, and is out of the deal with The Facebook.<br/><br/>Throughout this movie, there is questioning occurring between the twins, Eduardo, Mark, and lawyers. The questioning is of Mark stealing the idea and codes from the twins, and Eduardo still had ownership on the company and contributed the money in to the company, and got back stabbed by Mark. During these questioning sessions, there are scene flashbacks of to what really happened at the moment the lawyers were questioning.<br/><br/>The cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth, and the director, Jeffory Fincher both use the great ideas to bring the effects out during this film. The low lighting scenes really bring out the suspicion, lies, and deceit in the film. The angles used during this film also are unique. Some scenes are closer up to the actors, especially during the questionings. There are times, like in the Vance-3 questioning session, when you hear music start to play as Mark begins to reflect on the beginning of The Facebook, and how it all turned into such a mess with his former best friend, and the twins.<br/><br/>This is a film that attracts so many due to the obsession billions of people have with this social-networking called Facebook. Mark may have used someone else's ideas, but he did create the site. I will bet that most people would accept his friend request any day."
"paudie","Null","0","0","17 September 2011"," Highly entertaining -and you don't have to be on Facebook to enjoy it!
","I really enjoyed this movie. It was written by ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin so don't be surprised that the the plot quickly and an amazing amount happens on screen even though the movie is less than two hours long.<br/><br/>Of course Mark Zuckerberg has strongly disputed the truth of what is in the movie. However it is certainly based on indisputable facts. The phenomenon that is Facebook was created by Zuckerberg and some friends at Harvard and subsequently there was a lot of legal wrangling and compensation was paid by the company. However I think most viewers are probably aware that this is the most entertaining possible version of what actually happened.<br/><br/>The acting is also top class. Eisenberg nicely underplays it as Zuckerberg. As those around him get upset about various things Zuckerberg gives nothing away and leaves all his ""friends"" guessing as to what he really thinks, while getting on with what he is best at - nerdy computery type stuff. Justin Timberlake also impresses as Sean Parker, the one man who seems to be able to influence Zuckerberg.<br/><br/>Don't worry. You don't have to be on Facebook or even own a computer to ""get"" this movie. Zuckerberg might just as well be called Guttenberg and be inventing the printing press. The movie is about people, what makes them tick, why they pick their friends and discard them and what happens when someone invents something amazingly successful. It deals with a particular type of person - male Harvard undergraduates- but they have the same hang ups (ego, status, petty jealousies between friends, how to succeed with the opposite sex) as we do. Zuckerberg himself realises that Facebook will be more successful the more he understands what people want it to do for them.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg is richer than entire nations and there is undoubtedly an element of ""schadenfreude"" as we observe that super intelligence and vast wealth doesn't bring him happiness. Not in this version of his life anyway.<br/><br/>A funny, sad, self confident movie that is brilliantly written, acted and directed."
"jakebyrer","Null","0","0","17 September 2011"," The Theme of Deceit in The Social Network
","The movie The Social Network details the creation of the wildly popular social networking service called Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, first comes up with an idea to rate the looks of girls on the Harvard campus after his girlfriend abruptly leaves him earlier in the night. As he is stirring in his anger and drunkenness, he comes up with the idea for rating the looks of girls and calls the web page FaceMash. After e-mailing the site to several people, the news about FaceMash spreads around campus like wildfire and eventually crashes the Harvard computer network in only four hours due to the abundance of network traffic. Mark Zuckerberg then teams up with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, played by Armie Hammer and Josh Pence respectively, to create a type of social network service for Harvard students called the Harvard Connection. Mark Zuckerberg builds upon the idea of the Harvard Connection as he works with Eduardo Saverin, the financier played by Andrew Garfield, and Dustin Moskovitz, the programmer played by Joseph Mazzello. The rest of the movie follows the events that lead to the Facebook that is known today as it is remembered by the characters during their discussions about the two lawsuits against Mark Zuckerberg. <br/><br/>A main theme in the movie The Social Network is deceit as it deals with the relationships between Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins and also between Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin. One of the two lawsuits against Zuckerberg is initiated by the Winklevoss twins because they feel that Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for the Harvard Connection and renamed it Facebook. Saverin leads the other lawsuit because he feels that he was cheated by having his stake in the company diluted to an amount less than one-tenth of one percent. He originally was the person to put up money to get Facebook started and feels that he deserves a share of the millions of dollars made on that idea. Instead, the trickery of Zuckerberg and Sean Parker, played by Justin Timberlake, lead to the complete dissolution of Eduardo Saverin with Facebook. The main theme of dishonesty and deceit are well known to fans of the movie titled Deception that was released in 2006. It is easy to think that someone is your friend, just to find out that everything was a big lie in the end. <br/><br/>Many times throughout the movie, the theme of deceit is illustrated through the emotional reactions of characters. One such instance is when Saverin goes to Palo Alto to the new headquarters of Facebook in a house that he is paying for. After waiting for an hour for Zuckerberg to pick him up, Saverin arrives at the house to find Sean Parker on the phone making business decisions on the phone. The camera switches between subjective point of view shots of Saverin and Parker. The camera is able to catch the raw emotional feelings of deception on Saverin's face. The ensuing discussion between Saverin and Zuckerberg further reveals the hurt and treachery that is felt by Saverin.<br/><br/>Another extremely important scene involving Saverin and Zuckerberg is near the end of the movie. When Saverin is told to come to California to a party for celebrating the one millionth user of Facebook, he learns that Parker and Zuckerberg agreed to issue more stock. The result is that Saverin's one-third ownership in the company is reduced to less than one-tenth of one percent. Eduardo instantly feels betrayed and rushes over to Zuckerberg, who is wired in with headphones on. The camera uses a low angle shot of Saverin as he swiftly walks over to Zuckerberg. The pain is quite obvious on Eduardo's face as the camera follows him to Zuckerberg. The actions following further display the pain and deception felt by Eduardo Saverin.<br/><br/>Another technique used in this movie to illustrate the mood and emotions of characters is the lighting conditions. In the scenes described above, the lighting is somewhat dim to create a negative mood that can be felt and witnessed by the audience. The use of low-key lighting puts more of the attention on the main characters of the scenes. Our attention is immediately consumed with the actions and reactions of the main characters such as Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, and Sean Parker. Low-key lighting also helps to create the gloomy mood displayed throughout much of the movie. Most of the lighting used in the movie is front lighting so we have a clear picture of the characters faces and their emotional reactions to different situations. The different lighting techniques helps the audience to identify the emotions felt by the characters and also helps to illustrate the theme of deceit as it is experienced by the various characters. <br/><br/>All throughout the movie, it is easy for the audience to see the emotions of the characters as the actors and actresses do a great job of displaying real emotion with their expressions and body language. The main theme of deceit is evident throughout the movie as many of the characters feel cheated and deceived by Mark Zuckerberg. The Social Network is a great movie that details that controversial history of the hugely popular social networking service called Facebook."

","In The Social Network Jessie Eisenhower plays Mark Zuckerberg. Mark is a very talented with computers. After a date gone wrong with girlfriend Erica Albright played by Rooney Mara he gets dumped. He then goes to his dorm to blog about it. In this time he comes up with the idea to rate girls on their attractiveness to each other. He then makes a program to do just that. Once he gets the site up and running it crashes Harvard's servers and he gets put on academic probation.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie is that doing whatever you can to get to where you want to be may not always be the best choice. This comes into play when Eduardo played by Andrew Garfield lends Mark the money to get started on his newest idea. Mark wants to set up a safe social networking site. He comes to Eduardo after talking to the Winklevoss twins played by Armie Hammer. Eduardo doesn't know that Mark agreed to help the twins set up such a site for Harvard. Eduardo then goes into business with Mark. They start the site and things go okay until they meet Sean Parker as played by Justin Timberlake. Mark is only thinking about making his site huge and doesn't care about anyone else's feelings about what is happening.<br/><br/>Once Sean comes into play the idea for the site gets even bigger. Eduardo is threatened by Sean and tells Mark. Mark is only thinking about making his site huge and doesn't care about anyone else's feelings about what is happening. Mark tells him he is over reacting and goes to California for the place of operation on behalf of The Facebook. Eduardo finds out Sean lives there gets mad and returns back home and freezes the bank account. This is where the relationship between Mark and Eduardo becomes strained because Mark feels betrayed by the account being frozen and Eduardo feels he is being booted out of the whole idea since Sean arrived. Eduardo is being used for his money and isn't getting any credit for the site even though he has been there from the beginning. Even though all he did was lend Mark the money he should still be considered a founder and Mark feels like he is the one that deserves everything and no one else.<br/><br/>Soon Mark gets sued by Eduardo and the Winklevoss'. He is being sued by Eduardo for cutting him out of the company and the Winklevoss's sue because they say Mark stole their idea. This is where the theme comes in. Mark loses one of his good friends because he is too concerned with what he wants to happen. He thinks it was all his idea and not one of them deserves a piece of the money or fame from it. This movie and Mark remind me of the movie Citizen Kane. Kane and Mark both care more about the fame and money than the idea of losing friends and family. He alienates himself from his friends to achieve his goals. The low key lighting in the movie helps show the viewer how isolated he is from everyone. The motif that is repeated in this movie is scenes with Mark by himself because he has once again alienated himself from his friends by his actions.<br/><br/>Mark lost all his friends due to making this social site. He was interested in making his site come to life than working on his friendships. He lost a lot to achieve his goals. I found this movie to be a little misleading. I thought it was going to be about how Facebook was made and it was more about the legal side of it. The acting was good because Jessie played himself as an outsider. He acted like he didn't care about anything that was in front of him except the website. It did give a lot of insight on the person Mark Zuckerburg is. All in all it was a decent movie."

","I was a very reluctant user of the Facebook page and I also had doubts about seeing this movie which I thought could not possibly be interesting. Plus, when I heard that the writer was Aaron Sorkin and the director, David Fincher - that just seemed like an odd combination.<br/><br/>Pleasantly surprised, I couldn't believe how good it was. The character of Mark Zuckerberg is unsympathetic to put it mildly. I was baffled by how petty, jealous and stone cold he was. Then, the revelation. This is a movie about a screwed up person who can't relate to anyone and he unites everybody else in creating the page. How ironic.<br/><br/>There is no happy ending, no perfect resolution between the conflicts and no character you can absolutely root for here. That is quite an achievement. Not even the Andrew Garfield character who is supposed to be the sympathetic one. He may be the one who gets screwed over, but we realise as we learn more, that he is also misguided in thinking that his way is right. Don't we just all hate those ads that he wants on the site.<br/><br/>All the performances are great, but I especially liked Armie Hammer's Vinklevoss twins. It was quite difficult as I heard it, but he really nailed the different nuances of two people who look exactly alike.<br/><br/>Fincher has made some less than stellar movies like Alien3 and I was not a big fan of Se7ven either, but this is one to be noticed. One big minus, though is Justin Timberlake."

","Programming doesn't sound very interesting, does it? Maybe with a few fictional twists that make it more appealing and understandable to the general public, but it is really hard to realistically explore the world of computer magic and make it so entertaining as in The Social Network.<br/><br/>The plot follows the creation of the social network website Facebook, while also jumping in time forward to the lawsuit against Facebook's creator, Mark Zuckerberg. The Social Network isn't just a drama about programming and lawsuits, but also a story of friendship, love and betrayal.<br/><br/>The Social Network has a lot of great points, so it is tough to pick out the best of them. Firstly,it has one of the best acting ensembles ever seen. Not just the Oscar-nominated Jesse Eissenberg, also Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer and surprisingly Justin Timberlake are all outstanding and add a great plus to the movie.<br/><br/>The writing and directing is also amazing, telling the story in an unique, intelligent and entertaining, while the stunning dialogs that simply explode out of the actor's mouths are only even better with the great actors. Of course, there are also te two other Oscar-winning elements: The music and the editing. Both are great, especially the score's main theme and one of the most epic scenes of past years: The Royal Regatta scene.<br/><br/>In short, The Social Network, won't entertain only people who use Facebook and are interested in programming, but practically anyone who knows a good drama when he sees one."
"AyvaMeadows","7","0","0","27 August 2011"," Acting
","This film was decent. Not bad, but not amazing either. Garfield and Eisenberg were amazing as actors though. The way that Eisenberg manages to portray this eccentric, socially inept and seemingly cold character in a way that still makes him almost endearing is an art in my opinion. There have been few characters that I have like and hated equally and simultaneously and I think the film would have failed without Eisenberg's natural ability to engage the audience while portraying a character that is essentially abhorrent. Garfield's character seems to lack all the emotion that Eisenberg's doesn't possess. The scene in which he discovers that he has lost the majority of shares in in a company he helped to build is superbly performed on the part of Garfield. The scene remains captivating even with the annoying interruptions of Timberlake's character. Justin Timerlake's character simply annoyed in a way that I can't put my finger on. It wasn't that he was a bad actor or that the character of Sean Parker came off successfully as a moron but I just hated every aspect of the character. So he was a 24 year old irksome, millionaire who liked to show off. I just didn't care for the character at all and didn't think it did much for Justin in his bid to prove himself to the acting world. The also think the Winklevi twins played by Armie Hammer and Armie Hammer were too typical. The characters didn't have much depth beyond the whole ""rich guys with rich daddy that play sports and happen to have a light bulb idea that someone steals"". The fact that one has a heart and the other doesn't isn't much character development. Yes I get there is a limited amount of time and not everyone's life story can be portrayed in a film but as they are quite important I wish they had been executed as more than just the vengeful rich kids that row.<br/><br/>To conclude I enjoyed the performances of Eisenberg and Garfield. The writers and director did very well on the two characters but unfortunately not enough time was spent on all the other characters. In truth I give the film 6.5/10 but seeing as no decimals are allowed, I kindly rounded up."

I have to be honest i'm not a huge fan of Jesse Eisenberg, i never was , but i really really have to give him a huge credit for this film, he was fantastic truly. pretty much all of the cast did a great job. Justin Timberlake did a great job playing a jerk. <br/><br/>One thing that really did it for me was the Score and music, great choice of music , mixed with the talent of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is one of the strong points of the film which really brings out the story , so good job to them. <br/><br/>So to my personal believe , a near-perfect film.

","When I first heard the concept for The Social Network I rolled my eyes. ""The Facebook Movie"" is what they were calling it, and what many are still calling it; a nickname that gives the impression that this is nothing more than Hollywood cashing in on a fad. I mean really, a movie about facebook? What a joke. However, this is not ""The Facebook Movie;"" sure there may be a bit of cashing in on a fad, but that's mostly just being cynical. <br/><br/>What this movie is is a well written, beautifully shot film, featuring great performances, and led by wonderful direction from David Fincher. The film tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg and the process he went through creating and eventually defending facebook. The film jumps back and forth between two time lines and does a great job building suspense by showing you the consequences of actions that you aren't yet aware of. There's no real twist to the movie, but the film constantly keeps you guessing by referring to events that haven't been revealed to the audience yet through the structure of the narrative. Fincher and Aaron Sorkin (the writer) did a fantastic job putting this film together, both the writing and the direction are impeccable and they are able to tell the story at a mile a minute without leaving the audience confused in the wake of the rapid fire dialogue and the abrupt changes of time line. <br/><br/>There was some great cinematography in the film utilizing dynamic use of focus to center in on what's really important to the moment, and even using some trick photography techniques like tilt-shift. While everything is set in the real world, in close to present day, the film has a distinct visual style because of it's use of photography. <br/><br/>Also, I have to mention that the acting was great as well. Every character felt completely natural in their roles and while dialogue was a big part of the film, the subtleties of facial expression and physical acting were not forgotten. I can't pick out just one performance that stood out because they were all great, but Andrew Garfield, Jesse Eisenberg, and Justin Timberlake shine the most because they had the most prominent roles. <br/><br/>My only complaints with the film are minor; we all know that sex, drugs, and alcohol are part of the stereotypical college image, but in a way I think that making the party image so prominent in this story it may have taken away from some of the grounded reality of the film and even lessened the impact of certain scenes near the end. Also for once I want to see a movie based on true events not conform to the clichÃ© of using ""and they went on to..."" paragraphs of text at the end of the film to wrap up the loose ends. We payed to see a movie, so if it's important enough to the story to mention show us, don't tell us, otherwise we're perfectly capable of reading the Wikipedia page ourselves. <br/><br/>The Social Network was one of the better movies this year; that's not a great honor considering there haven't been that many great movies to choose from so far this year, but the movie was good regardless. There's nothing terribly groundbreaking and if you look back in a few years on the films that came out in 2010 you're much more likely to remember Toy Story 3 or Inception than this, but despite that, it's still a good movie with great performances, great writing, and a great cast. Definitely worth going to see (besides, it's not like anything else good is coming out in October). <br/><br/>Rating: A-"

","So I watched 2010's most over-hyped film ""the social network"". So was it good, well yes, was it as awesome as advertised well no. This film has quite a pedigree Oscars, David Fincher, Aaron Sorkin (not a fan, I personally think all his characters speak with the same tone, just watch Sports night to get an idea of what I am talking about), and universal critical praise. I personally liked this movie but did not love it. It is a fictionalized version of the truth, a truth that is still the present for the most part. I personally don't see what is so great about facebook. I have an account, but most of the time when I log on I see someone ""likes q-tips"", thanks for sharing. But it is fascinating that this genius named Mark Zuckerberg, basically took being socially awkward, having a chip on his shoulder, and programming skills, and turned all that into a company that is somehow magically valued at around 25 billion dollars (another thing that I just don't understand). Zuckerberg apparently did all this while he sacrificed friendship, and screwed over a couple of uber twins to become the king nerd. This film does give us some sense of the basic story of how someone became the world's youngest billionaire. It is also interesting, well acted, and has broad appeal. However, just like facebook itself I think it is overvalued, over-hyped, and may very well be more of a fad than a classic. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"

The movie apparently ""loosely"" depicts a real-life Mark Zuckerberg in his quest to make Facebook a social and wide ranging Network for grandiose visions of being the one-stop haven for connecting for others in society. The movie does a poor job of creating conflict by somehow showing the Zuckerberg character as unhurt or unaffected by lawsuits by former school-mates and friends. It's an excuse to show preppy sheltered kids and their materialistic dreams - hardly stirring. The cinematography and soundtrack are well done, but cant make up for a lack of honesty.

My wife and my just found the boring background music too high in volume and we spent most of the time having to read subtitles to be able to follow the dialog. We are not deaf, we have never had this problem with other films, so why does the director (David Fincher) spoil the viewer-experience with such an unnecessary inconvenience? We got the impression that David Fincher is a Spike Lee wannabe, and this spoiled what could have been a far better film.

That goes for someone taking ideas, to another giving out help. Mother Teresa had enemies, as does a CEO. Someone out there is going to have their feelings hurt or rights violated when someone else wants to advance. Although, if there's a line where does it get crossed? At the expense of your friends and business partners over your own ambitions? ""The Social Network"" centers around a remediating legal case in progress between different parties who feel they had their rights violated. This switches from past to present with some stylized filmmaking mechanics to make one think more is going on than meets the eye. The backdrop is basically your average college kids--think National Lampoon minus the comedy--doing what they do between classes. There is no doubt a minor story to had, though the filmmakers slipped in some tabloid scandal to pad the rest and it didn't require two hours to tell it, insignificant ties to it, or extremely loud music that drowns out conversations to sell it. This would have been better suited as a documentary as it would cut away the flash and trivial fat.<br/><br/>Conversations range from incoherently fast to frequently drawn out. Literally word for word is expressed without pulling away or cutting back on whether it's significant. This isn't rewarding like a ""A Beautiful Mind"" where you got a balanced understanding of how a unique process works and an intimate knowledge of the unconventional person behind it without wanting to wring their neck. Facebook mogul Mark Zuckerberg is like Spock from ""Star Trek"" or Chloe from ""24"" who looks at situations as logical as opposed to emotional. Zuckerberg doesn't see companionship like you or I, but sometimes wants to fit in despite mostly being a jerk without necessarily doing it on purpose. Possibly his only true friend and co-founder, Eduardo Saverin, gets the short end of the stick as he's a nice guy in a dog-eat-dog world. Napster renegade, Sean Parker, is a leech that sucks onto opportunity without actually bringing in technical skill but instead charisma and connections. The three who originally brought their social network idea to Zuckerberg--Divya Narendra and Winklevoss twins--range from reserved, outspoken to confrontational, though each equally want what is deserved by bringing lawyers to the table as a last resort to negotiate. For all parties, it turns into he said this, he said that bickering. When millions of dollars are on the line maybe you would too, though that shared connection doesn't make this any more intriguing or even noteworthy to watch with all the minute nit-picking and overdramatization.<br/><br/>""The Social Network,"" like the film ""Flash of Genius"" about Ford using windshield wipers without permission, brings a deal gone sour to the public's attention. It's hard to say if this is 100% accurate as it's based on the book ""The Accidental Billionaire"" from the perspective of Eduardo Saverin: the co-founder who got the short end of the stick. If all parties were involved, this would have been better suited towards a sanctioned biography, as it's still interesting that these sexed up, drinks down college guys started out young and made something out of themselves by sheer luck and risk. The film tries to tie it all together by hinting that a socially awkward guy used the only skill set he had to create a massive social network to win over the girl. Of course, he doesn't care about those billions of dollars but the love of the game: writing code. Though getting to that point and trying to sympathize after dragging through the nitty gritty was an exercise in ad nauseam. (Also submitted on Cinema Freaks, http://docuniverse.blogspot.com)"
"jdkraus","8","0","0","15 June 2011"," Fincher, Sorkin, & Eisenberg=a very good movie
","I initially did not see this film because it looked like a contemporary Animal House with a little bit of Facebook thrown in the mix. No, director David Fincher and Academy-Award winner screenwriter Aaron Sorkin had something much more interesting in mind. Yes, there is partying and the film explores how Facebook was invented, but the film's true goal is how low Zack Zuckerberg sunk in expanding his website as well as the prices he paid in doing so. Without giving much of plot away, Zuckerberg not only made one of the most popular websites out there, but he betrayed and practically sold his soul to shady characters to fulfill his dream. Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg is astounding. He depicts his character as a genius, but also as a cold hearted, callous jerk. This though is mostly likely due to his lack of social skills, perhaps a little Asperger's Syndrome? Anyway, Jesse Eisenberg is what makes The Social Network such a fun film to watch. Though he becomes the youngest billionaire in the world via an organization that brings people together, he can never have a solid friendship, much less a relationship. It is quite pathetic, but I also take pity on his character. <br/><br/>One scene that is quite engaging to watch is at the end where he adds an ex-girlfriend, whom he humiliated and insulted on his blog, adds her as a friend on Facebook. Every few seconds, he keeps refreshing the page, waiting. He knows what he really wants, but he can't have it. This is what's so unique about Fincher's film. <br/><br/>Fincher does an excellent job as director. He puts the viewer right into the film, making it engrossing. Aaron Sorkin's Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for this feature was well deserved; though there is much technical dialog, particularly by the fast-paced Zuckerberg, it is broken down to simplicity for even the most inept computer users to understand. Well done. The dim lighting, deep shadows, and green color tone of the cinematography added an almost atmospheric mood to the film. The editing is clean, crisp and well timed; another well earned Oscar. Trent Raznor and Atticus Ross's score is both haunting and beautiful to listen to, specifically with the combination of piano and synthesize, though I would not scream Oscar. There were much better choices at the 2011 Oscars. <br/><br/>The Social Network is a very good film, I would not mind seeing it again, but I am honestly glad that this did not earn Best Picture. Eisenberg for Best Actor however, it is a tough call. Personally, he did as good, perhaps even a better job than Colin Firth in The King's Speech. Again, a tough call. There were a lot of good films in 2010. This is one of them, though not the best.<br/><br/>My rating: ***/****"

","Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed as a maniacal and egotistical punk who happens to be a computer programming wizard.

Mark also sells out his co-founder Eduardo Saverin leaving him with not his original 30% but a mere .03 percent of the company.<br/><br/>However, the standout character for me in this film is the Harvard University President Larry Summers - who is incredibly obnoxious and arrogant. Summers fails to see the potential value of the social networking website. He totally blows off the Winklevoss brothers who attempt to bring to his attention the theft of their intellectual property in violation of Harvard student policy. Summers completely dismisses them and it doesn't take much research or insight to figure out why. <br/><br/>This is the same man who said in 2005 that the under-representation of women in science and engineering could be due to a ""different availability of aptitude at the high end"".<br/><br/>Actor Douglas Urbanski plays the role perfectly and even looks a lot like Summers.<br/><br/>The Winklevoss' case may yet go to the U.S. Supreme Court based on the assertion that the settlement they accepted in 2008 was based on an inaccurate undervaluation of the company."

","I took a while to write this review because, for one, I was hoping to be original; I watched the movie three times since its release. I looked up the basics such as the writer and the director's credentials; they have excellent credentials and that certainly explains in part why I liked the movie each time I watched it.<br/><br/>The characters, though not always and certainly not rigorously true to the people they portray, are very interesting to watch and to hear; the Zuckerberg-Saverin dynamic was compelling. Eisenberg brought the right character DNA and even if I seem to have seen that personality in his depiction of James Brennan in the movie 'Adventureland', he nevertheless played Zuckerberg as the perfect irksome individual we all wish we sometimes could be. The scenes having to do with the deposition were my favourites; Fincher's interposition of the deposition to contextualize the events worked extremely well. That process, when applied in the right measure, tends to spice up the story and control its pace, in my opinion; we can all agree the pace was just right and the 'timeline hopping' worked quite well.<br/><br/>The whole cast was elucubrating on queue; or if you prefer, everyone's timing was impeccable. The book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" by Ben Mezrich could not have provided a better basis for the master Aaron Sorkin to write his screenplay.

","As I'm sure many of you know, David Fincher's The Social Network (2010) is a riveting story about the creation of the social networking site, FACEBOOK, and the whole mess in between. I must say, I was not exactly sure what to expect going into this movie. I remember seeing the trailer for the first time and thinking, ""What the crap? FACEBOOK movie already? It's just too soon."" To my great surprise, The Social Network ended up being quite a treat. It's the perfect film for this era, where anyone between the ages of 15 and 30 dive into social media as a means of communication. First off, the performances are absolutely phenomenal. Jesse Eisenberg, who plays Mark Zuckerberg, the 'creator' of facebook, plays this role in a way I could not have possibly imagined. Normally, I would refer to him as ""poor man's Michael Cera."" However, I've gained an incredible amount of respect for the actor after catching this flick. Let's just say he was made for this role. The script is so quick and witty, and he delivers his lines so freely, as to create one of the most accurate youth pics I've seen (in terms of dialogue) since Greg Mottola's Superbad (2007). I was even proud of Mr. JT in his role as Sean Parker. He's the perfect parasite. I haven't disliked a character so much since Mo'Nique as Mary in Lee Daniels' Precious (2009). This film grips you and drags you into a world where you can't identify with anyone. Everyone is flawed, but, this works. That's what makes it so real. The Social Network is not just about FACEBOOK. It's about friendship, greed, and betrayal. It illustrates how far one is willing to go, even if it means risking everything,; even if it means throwing it all away; even if it means sacrificing all of your real friends for 500 million facebook friends. This film is not simply for entertainment. It's art for art's sake. A true masterpiece of our time."

"Polaris_DiB","8","0","0","24 April 2011"," Sork the Finch of the Eisenzuckerberg.
","To paraphrase 99.9% of the reviews about this movie out there, ""David Fincher helms Aaron Sorkin's script about Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg, who's Jesse Eisenbergness infuses Sorkin's Zuckerberg with Fincher's unique style of Sorkinian Eisenberg Sorkin Fincher, of which Fincher Sorkin make Eisenzuck and Sorks to the Fincherian Jesse Mark Zucksenbergergerai. I loved/hated it, it was terrible/brilliant. Facebook is a terrible thing even though I use it."" With reviews like that, I expected a movie with Personality, capital P. Actually, it was just a really good corporate thriller, which is nice because if we're going to mention Fincher, he's a director who can pull off anything technically, but obviously really prefers to make thrillers (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, at times, seemed almost sad that there wasn't a serial killer stalking the Katrina-looming streets). The movie firmly places Zuckerberg at well past the awkward computer geek to suffering some level of antisocial dysfunction, spins him into a dog-eat-dog world of ego and greed, and then throws him off as a tragic hero at the end before they can go as far as to implicate him as some sort of murderer. It's high-octane action whilst the characters mostly sit at computers and hearing boards. As goes the Sorkinish writing of Fincherian plotting of Eisenberg portrayal of something or the other namedrop Justin Timberlake.<br/><br/>Anyway, underlining most of how the movie works is the character Zuckerberg's habit of lashing out verbally like a cornered rat--even as the movie is opening. Those moments are the punctuation marks that structure the beats in this general shark frenzy, and would probably explain why most of this movie was shot as if Mark were in prison from the get-go. Thing is, if you watch contemporary biopics of people of the past, you tend to see such underlying emphasis (some call it exaggeration; others call it ""drama"") in aspects of real people's character, placing this movie quite firmly in the ""inspired by"" spectrum of the ""based on a true story"" paradigm. This is some story, indeed, but it was a mistake to make it so soon--firmly centering the audience's grasping of what's real and what's fantasy as a major drama where otherwise a rather fun genre film would suffice.<br/><br/>But the Internet is boggling Hollywood and so someone like Fincher has to step up to make something that isn't Eagle Eye. I still do not think Hollywood ""gets"" the Internet. Just look at the DVD cover, visually weighted almost completely by an entire pillar of critic blurbs. They seem to be expecting that us Internet kids with our multiple tabs opened in Firefox and columnar listings of interests are attracted by visual noise in graphic design, when such phenomena exist specifically because covers like that are tl;dr. But at least the movie itself doesn't fall into the same detachment from its audience as Sony's marketing department, firmly establishing its type-A personalities and biting ironies as existing in some horror land Harvard far beyond the well-lit streets of lolcats and message boards.<br/><br/>At least they didn't make a 4chan movie.

"Turfseer","7","0","0","1 March 2011"," Sorkin serves up respectable biography of computer generation's 'Citizen Kane'
","Aaron's Sorkin's screenplay, based on the 2009 non-fiction book 'The Accidental Billionaires', attempts to turn Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, into the 'Citizen Kane' of the computer generation. Like 'Kane', it's the chronicle of the rise of a boy genius to the heights of power, who is a dogged by a character flaw. The question in both films is whether each of the protagonists truly has an 'Achilles heel' that tarnishes their legacy or is it some sort of unconscious jealousy on the part of the films' scenarists who seek to drag these boy wonders down from their high perch in order to take them down a peg or two in the public eye? <br/><br/>As an only occasional user of Facebook, I hold no implicit disdain for the social networking site that Mark Zuckerberg created. I've noticed that some internet posters hate Facebook so much that they refuse to be objective about the film. If they were honest, they would recognize that the material the film is based on, is difficult to make into a compelling film. 'The Social Network' IS dry material and veteran director David Fincher has managed to turn this story into something that moves along at a fairly brisk pace. I also wonder why some posters find the subject matter, not to be worthy enough to be made into a feature length film. Certainly the way in which Zuckerberg rises to the top as the world's youngest billionaire, to my mind, is a compelling enough subject to merit the attention of the average film goer.<br/><br/>Sorkin's technique is to tell Zuckerberg's story as a double flashback: the two alternating depositions in which a bored looking Zuckerberg must give testimony at. First is the Winklevoss brothers' lawsuit, fellow students at Harvard who claimed Zuckerberg ripped off their original idea for a Facebook-like platform. The other lawsuit is instituted at the behest of Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's former friend, who provided some small start-up capital in the early days of their business venture together.<br/><br/>While I was overjoyed that Jesse Eisenberg finally got to play a role where he wasn't a geeky good guy, as 'The Social Network' moves along, his performance as Mark Zuckerberg becomes a bit one-note. It's really not Eisenberg's fault since the script calls for him to play Zuckerberg as both the manic overachiever and sullen bad boy who basically remains the same throughout the narrative (the real Zuckerberg doesn't see himself worthy as a dramatic character—he's quoted as saying, in substance, that he spent most of his time writing computer code during those heady days). A bit more interesting is Eduardo (Andrew Garfield) who gets to emote a lot more, especially after he discovers that his best friend and partner has ripped him off royally! (Garfield's Eduardo also collects a few laughs when he attempts to deal with a girlfriend who will not change her mind about dumping him).<br/><br/>What 'The Social Network' really comes down to is our verdict on Zuckerberg's moral character. And in my opinion, that verdict must be a mixed one. Certainly, the Winklevoss part of the lawsuit seemed to me to be without merit. In the end, we find out they prevailed to the tune of $65 million but did Zuckerberg really copy any of their ideas? They may have had the same concept but web pages are all in the details—and it was Zuckerberg who came up with all the unique ideas. As for Saverin, Zuckerberg probably would not have become successful if he took the cautious advice of his business partner. By seeking out the wild and unpredictable Napster founder Sean Parker (who Saverin couldn't stomach at all), Zuckerberg found a partner who truly had the connections to make things happen. Nonetheless, the way in which Zuckerberg and his new business associates 'tricked' Saverin, was reprehensible. Saverin counted Zuckerberg as a friend and Zuckerberg took advantage of this fact because he knew Saverin would never read the fine print of the contract he was signing. Zuckerberg was right about one thing: Saverin, as a successful Harvard business student, should have read the fine print and hired an attorney to go over the contract he was about to sign.<br/><br/>In Citizen Kane, Orson Welles offers up the image of 'Rosebud', a childhood keepsake which symbolized the loss of love for the film's protagonist. Here, in 'The Social Network', Sorkin serves up Zuckerberg's 'Rosebud' as something much more mundane: a college sweetheart who rejected him. The audience gets to have their 'Rosebud' moment when Zuckerberg tries to send a Facebook friend request to his lost love. In an earlier scene in a restaurant, Zuckerberg can't bring himself to apologize for his crude blogging when he was a student at Harvard, and ends up begging his ex to join him in a private tete-a-tete where presumably he'll try to rationalize his behavior once again. It's a long stretch to suggest that Zuckerberg's occasional sour disposition is all due to his rejection by an ex-girlfriend. The implication is that this is the one thing Zuckerberg can't have—and it consumes him (just as Kane/Hearst pines for the lack of love in his childhood).<br/><br/>'The Social Network' is no masterpiece as some have maintained here on the internet. It's really a workmanlike story chronicling the machinations of a driven overachiever who becomes insanely successful in our new computer age. Mark Zuckerberg's story is certainly worth watching at least once. If I do see this film again, I'll be sure to concentrate on the technical aspects since I'm quite satisfied that I've already absorbed most of the major plot points and internal/external arcs of the principal characters."

"imagiking","7","0","0","5 February 2011"," The Social Network: A Fitting Modern Treatment
","A movie about Facebook? A movie about Facebook?! Not even the bottom of the barrel could be so lined with mawkish garbage as this, a film following the foundation of a bloody website. Have they no better ideas? My thoughts exactly, dear reader. My thoughts exactly.<br/><br/>Dumped by his girlfriend, who finally recognises his apparently incurable horridness, Mark Zuckerberg slanders her on the internet and creates a website for comparing the attractiveness of female Harvard students. The success of this and the invitation to programme a Harvard-exclusive online social network combine in the mind of the professed genius to create what would become Facebook, and the eventual pair of lawsuits that would turn up along the way.<br/><br/>Like just about everyone else, I was incredibly sceptical toward such an idea as a Facebook movie: surely a ridiculous concept for any film. The involvement of well-liked screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and acclaimed director David Fincher seemed to win a great deal of sceptics over to the premise, yet I remained unchanged, dismissing it as uninteresting and silly. A website's success warrants a film now? Pfft... The scene which opens the film is the one in which Zuckerberg is dumped, the particular posterior-based vulgarity applied by the departing girlfriend the general label hung upon him by many of the film's characters. Jesse Eisenberg portrays Zuckerberg, combining the flashy sarcasm of Sorkin's dialogue with his own cynical glances of self-assumed intellectual superiority to create a character that we never quite get to like. His sneering put-downs alienate us as they do their recipients, preventing all from ever really sympathising with the computer maverick. And so too it should be, the protagonist—if even that title can rightly be applied to him—portrayed as largely deserving of the general disdain held by most toward him. The narrative is structured as flashbacks told through two contemporaneous depositions as the now multi-billionaire Zuckerberg is sued by both the proposers of the original website idea and his former best, quite probably only, friend Eduardo Saverin. The reason behind the former suit is evident, the latter initially unknown. Both Zuckerberg and Saverin appear to maintain a cordial respect for each other, never quite making eye contact and each appearing sorry that this is what their friendship has come to. As Saverin, Andrew Garfield is perhaps the film's strongest facet, his performance as the popular guy still faithful to his nerdy friend reaching a splendid climax in the scene wherein we finally learn the reason behind the lawsuit. Eisenberg and Garfield play off each other very well, the tension between them when the latter's character is accepted into a social club greatly desired by the former left to subtlety rather than a more visceral reaction on either part. Throughout the film, the comedy of the script plays a key supportive role, keeping us thoroughly entertained with Sorkin's quick-fire wit. It's not all heavily quotable one-liners, however, the simple story of friendship the film's thematic core. By its finale, as Zuckerberg sits alone in the deposition room, we are left to wonder if his newly amassed multi-billion dollar fortune has really changed anything. Riches, as his ex-girlfriend might argue, do not an asshole unmake. An old and well explored parable it may be, but it is given a fitting modern treatment here.<br/><br/>A movie about Facebook? A movie about Facebook?! No, actually. A movie about friendship, about jealousy, and about the destructive influence of one upon the other. Perhaps the explanation for the somewhat exaggerative praise heaped upon this film lies in the fact that such an initially bizarre idea has—through a well written script and powerful performances—become so much more."

","The Social Network<br/><br/>Prequel to Facebook<br/><br/>""Can the ""Facebook movie"" be one of the best of the year? Yep, it sure can..."" – Trevor Todd<br/><br/>Everyone I know really enjoyed watching The Social Network mainly because we all use Facebook and it is a movie about the famous social networking tool. I personally have been using Facebook since 2007 and have been addicted since. Right now everyone is Facebooking or using some kind of social networking tool. <br/><br/>99% of my friends have Facebook and are addicted to it, so it only makes sense that almost all my friends have watched and loved this movie. We really like the fact that this movie is more like an invitation to us into the world of Facebook and how it was created. <br/><br/>Before watching this movie, none of my friends knew how Facebook came about and thought it was created by a team of people instead of by one guy. He might have been shared about this idea by his peers, but he was the one that created this ""friends networking tool"" where people can connect with their friends.<br/><br/>What was once only a social network for colleges in the US blossomed into a worldwide, multi- generation tool where everyone know what Facebook is and what it is used for. This light hearted drama focuses on Mark Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, and how the idea of Facebook came about. This movie is intriguing in that it is a simple movie, easy to watch and understand. No major event happens in this movie besides the fact that the Social Network is created, friendships are lost, and Eisenberg gets sued by the people who originally came up with the idea of the Social Network. But it is interesting because everyone who watches this movie seems to be experts at Facebooking and know that Eisenberg and this site is worth billions and billions of dollars. I always wished that I was the one that came up with this idea of connecting people together, and so do a lot of people. <br/><br/>In the contrary, the main character, Eisenberg, in this movie doesn't seem to have it all like a perfect character in the movie should. He lost his best friend because of this business and it seems sad that he doesn't have a lot of people by his side besides his business partner Sean Parker, Justin Timberlake, and his employees.<br/><br/>This movie was also great to watch because it was one of Timberlake's first serious role as an actor and he did super. We all know that he can sing, dance, and write songs but who knew that he can act until you saw this movie. I think that he played his character well and it was effective. It is effective because in some parts of the movie, when he sold thousands of shares, and left the Eisenberg's best friend with nothing. I really hated him and felt the hatred that his best friend has for him. I was surprised that he is such a great actor and can't wait to see more of his future roles."

","This film takes us inside to the beginning of the Internet explosion of Facebook. A success story is told,with the edges of truth cut against the illusion of a billionaire fairytale, leaving instead the bitter reality of finding success almost overnight in a world of greed and ambition.<br/><br/>The lesson to be learned is The compromise of loyalty to friendship and moral honesty is worth the end result of extreme gargantuan success? The film shows us the crazy roller coaster ride that Mark Zuckerberg (Played by Jesse Eisenberg) gets on both willingly and unwillingly in his ambitious endeavor. Behind his ambition you see a character who is socially outcast and emotionally awkward trying to both seek revenge against those he feels intellectually superior too, and to impress an old girlfriend by whom he was jilted.<br/><br/>The other characters are Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield) who is Mark Zuckerbergs, best and maybe only friend, he also comes from money and is able to finance the start up costs of the venture. Erica Albright (played by Rooney Mara) is his ex-girlfriend whom he both loves/hates and obsesses about. She was the main catalyst for Mark to blog online about and bring attention to his pain after being rejected by her.<br/><br/>Both An opportunity and an idea come along for Mark in the characters of the Winklevoss twins, both Tyler and Cameron are played by Arnie Hammer. The twins approach Mark early in the movie with their idea of an exclusive Harvard online dating site. This idea plants the seeds in Marks head for The Facebook.<br/><br/>In the opening scene is when Erica is dumping Mark. Mark feels he has to do something now, right in this moment to save himself and prove who he is. He tries to convince Erica she is making a mistake and all of his ambition over emotion is a good thing. She doesn't give in.<br/><br/>Mark progresses with the dating turned social site idea and continues to blow off the twins, even after saying he would build their website for them. The website morphs from a ""dating site"" into what is now known as Facebook. With the seed money of Eduardo, he is able to buy a space on a Harvard server and launch. With the launching of The Facebook the twins are enraged and feel they have been swindled.<br/><br/>As The Facebook grows in popularity, Eduardo envisions bringing advertisers to create revenue, but Mark is feeling something even greater and doesn't want to turn it into something ""uncool"". This shows the beginning of the end between the two friends and their differing ideas on where to take the business. As the movie progresses flashbacks take us back into disputes and battles, and the respective events that lead the characters into the deposition rooms. Lawsuits had been filed from both the twins and Eduardo.<br/><br/>Girls are easy now, and Eduardo starts hanging with a new girlfriend named Christy (played by Brenda Song). The three of them get to meet with Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake) the founder of Napster, now broke and washed up after losing millions in lawsuits against the music industry.<br/><br/>Sean and Mark see eye to eye and Mark taps into the vision that Sean describes and agrees with the hugeness of what The Facebook is capable of. Eduardo is clearly upset and feels helpless against Sean, and stubbornly sticks to his vision of bringing in advertisers one at a time. In the meantime Sean is wining and dining Mark and luring him away from his partnership with Eduardo.<br/><br/>The courtship of Mark by Sean continues and Mark leaves for California where its ""happening"" and Eduardo leaves for New York on an Internship and in search of advertisers. The separation is symbolic of the rift that has grown between Eduardo and Mark. Although Mark does not tell Sean he is moving to California, Sean manages to him and innocently appears at his door (hardly a coincidence), further emphasizing the snake-like personality of Sean.<br/><br/>As Sean penetrates the Facebook momentum, he also brings investors (not advertisers) to Facebook along with a half a million dollar contract to go public and bring in stockholders. As an initial and legal business partner Eduardo has to fly into California to sign the new papers. He is obviously a stranger to all the new people at this point. Eduardo observes the wild party going on, and is thoroughly disgusted with both Mark and the situation, however all that changes when he meets with the lawyers and realizes he owns over a million shares of the company.<br/><br/>Eduardo leaves to go back to school. Sean now owns a small portion of the company along with a few other key players. As they reach their one million member milestone a party is planned. Eduardo flies in for the festivities only to find he has new papers to sign. The lawyers tell him his shares have been diluted down to zero value. A strong emotional scene follows as Eduardo confronts Mark and finds out the new cronies shares' were not diluted, and he has been swindled out of his share of the company, even his name was removed from the legal credits. He is bitter and angry, and leaves the scene with a threat.<br/><br/>The film climaxes with Sean getting busted that night with under aged girls, alcohol and cocaine. Sean cries wolf and claims that he was busted on purpose and accuses Eduardo of tipping the bust. However, Sean realizes the implications of his actions on the friendship between Mark and Eduardo and wonders if maybe it was Mark that called the police. Mark retreats and goes to Erica's Facebook page, and realizes an empty satisfaction in knowing that she too sold out, and despite her declaration against his ambition, in the end she created her own page on ""his"" Facebook."

","Though it has brought the human race together, the Internet has one flaw: the human factor. People talk (or nowadays text) each other, but don't necessarily understand each other, and that's the point of ""The Social Network"", a slightly fictional account of the creation of the ubiquitous network website, Facebook. It's a two-hour hammer to the gut, and no bandage will stop the bleeding.<br/><br/>When dumped by his girlfriend (Rooney Mara of the ""Elm Street"" relaunch) for making an unintentionally rude comment, the brilliant but socially awkward Harvard University soph Mark Zuckerberg (always brilliant Jesse Eisenberg of ""Zombieland"" and ""Adventureland"") delivers drunken e-vengeance via a blog and a comparison contest of the university's distaff students, earning their animosity, but he earns XY fans, particularly uber jock sibs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Arnie Hammer doing a digital double job) and their token minority chum Divya Narenda (Max Mighella of ""Art Schoo Confidential"") who approach Mark to engineer their student-based networking site.<br/><br/>Mark's more ambitious, possibly more subversive since the aforementioned three never gave him the time of day, pre-e-vengeance; he creates ""the Facebook"" with financial backup from roomie Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield of ""The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus"" ). The site goes wide, turning Mark and Eduardo into fringe celebs and attracting the attention of Napster's co-framer, Sean Parker (a shady Justin Timberlake). However, Mark's eccentricness and Eduardo's traditional business sense collide, making a friendship unravel.<br/><br/>Adapting Ben Mezrick's ""The Accidental Billionaires"", samurai scribe Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing"", ""Studio 60"", ""A Few Good Men"" and a bit part here as an executive) and zeitgeist helmer David Fincher (""Seven"", ""Fight Club"", ""Zodiac"") don't concentrate as the genesis of Facebook, but the destruction of human connection by its' existence, and the victims/perpetrators are the people who forget their humanity on the success trail. It's obvious through the film's flashbacks intertwined with legal conflicts. Fincher was so impressed with Sorkin's sharp script, he left it untouched, let alone permitted the writer to be involved in the production, a rarity in the director-centric venue of feature films.<br/><br/>No character here is neither good nor bad but mixed in the road to success. Having a heavy role, Eisenberg breaks out of the ""second-rate Michael Cera"" label, being smart, idiosyncratic and unconventionally cruel; he loses interest in a court testimony, vexing the Winkleloss' legal eagle (David Selby of ""The Supercops"" and ""Rich Kids""). Garfield reps morality here, but gets swallowed into the abyss, especially when having a paranoid, ""wired"" girlfriend (Disney sitcom stock actress Brenda Song).<br/><br/>Timberlake, just like in ""Southland Tales"" and ""Alpha Dog"" has a lot of acting chops as the opportunistic Parker; all he needs is a straw hat, a white-colored suit, a mustache and a devil horns! As twins, Hammer (some guest spots on the horror comedy series ""Reaper"") embodies the average alpha male (times two) who gets everything without working for it, but gets karma this time and is cartoon fussy about it. Though she has a few scenes, Rashida Jones (""Parks and Recreation""; daughter of the legendary music producer/composer Quincy Jones) is eye-wink perfect when giving good moral and legal advice to Mark as one of his legal eagles. The electronic main tone by neo-rocker Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross perfectly reflects the coldness of technology.<br/><br/>The real Mark Zuckerberg isn't an expletive (he's been philanthropic of late) mentioned in the film but neither is the fictional, who's forced to be one because it's a dog-eat-dog world. Sorkin and Fincher expertly show that. The tragedy is technology has evolved, but humanity has a long way to go."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","0","30 January 2011"," Sorkin and Fincher Create Wonder
","Anything written by Aaron Sorkin is worth seeing. To say the least, his work is sharp, witty, clever and funny. I doubt I would have been as eager to see 'The Social Network' if it was written by someone else. It only adds to the excitement that David Fincher is directing the film. He's more of a visual director whose films have a dark claustrophobic feel. Now I was very curious about what a Sorkin-Fincher collaboration would yield.<br/><br/>Even though I pretty much knew I was going to like it, the outcome still surprised me, especially how Sorkin's lines and Fincher's direction came together. Needless to say, the execution is first rate. Fincher maintains his trademark dim lighting and spacious in motion cinematography. The editing is equally meticulous.<br/><br/>Given that the concept is about Facebook, one would expect pretty much an almost rags to riches story and if I hadn't known of Sorkin and Fincher, I would have expected the same but this is far from the clichéd underdog becomes billionaire story. The themes presented are quite dark and 'The Social Network' is a character driven film.<br/><br/>The majority of the cast is very good. Jesse Eisenberg is excellent as the awkward and intelligent loner who's making millions all of a sudden. Andrew Garfield is competent as Mark's only friend who stands by him. Rashida Jones stands out in a brief role. The only weak link is Justin Timberlake who cannot seem to act even under the direction of someone like Fincher.<br/><br/>To those of you who think 'The Social Network' is just some ditzy movie about Facebook or is all hype and low on substance, you'll be surprised. I doubt one can go wrong with Sorkin and the addition of Fincher only makes this a must-see."
"movieevangelist","10","0","0","30 January 2011"," Review: The Social Network
","The Pitch: A Few Good Rasho-men.<br/><br/>The Review: Every generation has one or more events that shape and define it, transforming the lives of those living through it and allowing those who look back on it in later years to understand it better. In the twentieth century we had two world wars, jazz and rock and roll transformed music, television and the cinema transformed the visual arts, and in the twenty-first century? We have a thing on your computer or your phone which allows you to play farm or jewel games, to stalk people you used to go to school with and to tell all your friends when you've had a bowel movement. It's easy to be sniffy about Facebook (really, it is – I just did it, try it if you don't believe me), but social media, of which Facebook is the pre-eminent form, have transformed the way that we interact with each other. My online friends range from their early teens to their late eighties and every demographic in between; but how do you capture such an abstract concept on screen? First, you hire Aaron Sorkin, responsible for one of the foremost small screen achievements (The West Wing) of the last ten years. Sorkin also scripted A Few Good Men, famous for its Cruise / Nicholson courtroom confrontations, which is handy, as this is where The Social Network spends most of its running time, for of course the more interesting story is not about Facebook itself, but about the men (or should that be boys?) who created it. Sorkin is a past master at getting the most out of static situations, because he knows how to write cracking dialogue, but he also knows how to structure a story, and so when the prospect of sitting through a succession of depositions where the finer details of the story of Facebook's creation gradually unfold feel too dry, Sorkin's solution is to interleave the court actions with the rest of the narrative, admitting a Rashomon influence in terms of the use of differing viewpoints, and we are actually left to work out for ourselves initially what's happening and when, as the time-line skips back and forth from past to present.<br/><br/>Then, you hire David Fincher. When he realises that Sorkin's script is fantastic, but is coming in at over two and a half hours, his simple solution is to crank up the pace of the dialogue. Relentless, straight from the off we're thrust into a scene with Mark Zuckerberg and his girlfriend Erica who isn't real but just a construct of Sorkin's to engage us in the narrative but she and Mark rattle through their conversation and in eight minutes they flirt with each other's attention and they talk and they fight and they grandstand and Erica tells Mark what she really thinks of him and she walks out and Mark's off and he's inspired and he makes Facemash and his friends get involved and his ideas get bigger and he's growing out and outgrowing them and we see where he was and where he is and how it comes together and how it moves so fast and never stops and you have to keep up but soon you adjust to the pace and the speeches burst out like a Marx brother on speed but it's exhilarating and it whips by so quick that by the time you realise Mark's out of his depth The Social Network has you in its grip.<br/><br/>None of this would be possible without the quality of the cast that Fincher's then assembled. Jesse Eisenberg falls into that genre of young actors that causes regular comparisons to Michael Cera, but like the curly-haired Scott Pilgrim star, Eisenberg brings great subtlety and variety to the roles he plays, and his Mark Zuckerberg is multi-faceted, at once compelling but dislikeable, pathetic but powerful, driven by his ego and a walking contradiction in terms. Andrew Garfield has the less showy role as his closest, possibly only friend, Eduardo Saverin, who mirrors Mark in key ways and then proves the diametric opposite in others. Rounding out the headlining trio is the character of Sean Parker, who is probably the closest to a rock star that the internet generation's had; so who better to play him than Justin Timberlake, in a sort of life-imitates-art kind of way? Well, that would be fine if Timberlake could act, of course, but instead it's remarkable, Timberlake is a revelation and serves to add further momentum when he's introduced just when you thought that wasn't possible.<br/><br/>Everyone else is fantastic, including Arnie Hammer as the Winkevoss twins, which also serves to underline the depth of technical flair going on that you may not even notice. But crucially, the movie manages to stay impartial, using the varied viewpoints to explain actions without at any point sitting in judgment, although there are various inferences to Mark's similarity to a certain bolidy orifice but the overall attitude is more of pity than disdain towards him. Somehow, the talent assembled have taken what could have been a simple story of a trivial software development and made very much an epoch-defining movie which effectively explains Facebook's relevance to the social strata of today at the same time that it spins its classic tale of men seeking power and clashing egos. Fincher is now developing a long list of masterpieces and remains one of the most remarkable directing talents of the last twenty years; The Social Network sits very well in that company.<br/><br/>Why see it at the cinema: Because Fincher and Sorkin are masters of the art form, and this really does justify the praise and awards talk being heaped on it.<br/><br/>The Score: 10/10"

","I have been a Jesse Eisenberg fan since I saw him in Zombieland two years ago and pretty much instantly fell in love. <br/><br/>He was half of the reason I ended up watching Adventure Land – the other half being that it was filmed at Kennywood Park, my personal little slice of heaven. The only reason I didn't want to see it was because of Kristen Stewart, and she was ultimately why I never saw the end of that film.<br/><br/>But that's not the focus here, is it?<br/><br/>I have to admit – I was not disappointed by his performance when I watched The Social Network; he played the part of a douche bag nerd spectacularly. He made me hate Zuckerberg and feel bad for him (but only slightly) at the same time, which is quite impressive in my opinion.<br/><br/>I definitely thought that the movie was confusing in the beginning. They didn't explain things – which I actually prefer most of the time – but the competing lawsuits thing was difficult to follow at first. I thought that all of the actors did an awesome job, and I really, really liked the character Eduardo; he was the one I felt the most sympathy for throughout the movie. I did, however, get a lot of the characters confused. I felt like they weren't introduced properly, and I had to keep asking my friends who certain people were. I thought Eduardo and the twins' friend were the same person for a really long time, and by the time I realized that they were not, in fact, the same person, too much of the movie had gone by for me to figure out what was happening.<br/><br/>I pretty much left the movie thinking, ""Mark Zuckerberg is a total dickhead; I would never be friends with him because of what he did."" I'm actually surprised that Zuckerberg okayed this movie because it casts him in a really, really bad light, in my opinion. I absolutely love nerds, and this is the first time ever that I have watched a movie about a nerd and not fallen in love with the character, which was really disappointing.<br/><br/>I didn't actually think that this movie was as great as everyone else made it out to be. I'm not impressed by movies that seemingly go nowhere, and I don't like endings that kind of leave the audience hanging. Yes, they put up some text to ""clear everything up,"" but I kind of think that's like the cheater's way of ending a movie. I also think that putting pictures of the ""real people"" should be mandatory during the credits of a movie that's based on ""real life,"" if that makes sense. I like to be able to connect actors to people, and I don't want to have to Google them to do it.<br/><br/>I give The Social Network a seven out of ten. It wasn't awesome, but the acting was really good and I liked the way that the film was structured. It was way, way too long, though, and I thought the ending was kind of dumb. I suppose I would recommend it, but only if you're looking for something so real-lifey that it's annoying. I felt like the whole thing was building up to something big that they just forgot to put into the film. I hope, though, that if Facebook ever crashes, someone somewhere writes a story about its downfall, because that would make a really cool sequel."

","I just finished this film about 10 minutes ago and felt myself immediately motivated to check my Facebook. I've been a fan of David's films since first seeing Fight Club, and I personally view this as one of his top 3 films, if not number 1 or 2. After noticing the recognition it's been receiving at such award ceremonies such as the Critic's Choice and the Golden Globes, I first thought it was over estimated after seeing blockbusters like Inception. I did feel the urge to check it out though. It is a fantastic film without all of the big-budget explosions and special effects. This is truly great story telling and David can make the most dull scenes feeling extremely exciting. After watching this film in it's entirety, I now understand why it has received so many awards.

","How could they ever make a film about Facebook? The Social Network is one of those films that could've been bland and pointless. But screenwriter Aaron Sorkin's brilliant script is the exact opposite. With a lot of dialog and very little detail about the surroundings, director David Fincher's priority was to use his imagination for that part. And boy did it pay off. The Social Network is a beautifully directed, brilliantly scripted film. The story revolves around young 19 year old Facebook creator, Mark Zuckerberg, and the stemming of his idea to create ""Facebook"", a social networking website, that is immensely popular now with millions of users.<br/><br/>The film's killer opening scene, really starts off the film nicely, with the witty quick dialog that Jesse Eisenberg and Rooney Mara exchange. The film really is a gem with the wicked score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Cross. The bleakness of the music at times, really generates a somber scene. Greatly acted, and beautifully written and directed, The Social Network really has no faults. But clocking in a 120 minutes, the film does a seem a little bit overstretched."

","Imagine a 500 million users active in a social networking site that beats the competition. Isn't that a perception that we are willing to receive? Or we need to take the risk to do a lot of bad habits just to improve the creation that a person is really passionate about? Mark Zuckerberg (the real one) falls into this category, but he made his creation millions of milestones worldwide. But before he made his dorm room project called Facebook, the law was definitely against him.<br/><br/>The Social Network is based on a biographical book The Accidental Billionaires written by non-fiction author Ben Mezrich who also wrote Bringing Down The House and also titled differently as 21. The film plots about Mark Zuckerberg's (Jesse Eisenberg) revenge on his girlfriend by getting wasted on his college dorm room and starting to hack his way on a website called FaceMash that is similar to HotorNot, and comparing her to farm animals by hacking through a bunch of photos on Face Books on Harvard. He was aided by Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). As a hacking prodigy, he was sued by the Harvard community for an intrusion from the university's computers. Started only as an offensive idea, but it occurred to Zuckerberg that the fact is that there is a fascinating idea behind FaceMash. Afterwards, Zuckerberg's programming skills were recognized by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Nerendra whom are students in Harvard and asks for writing codes for a social networking site called HarvardConnection but will use the domain from Harvard's website. But later on, Zuckerberg tend to ignore Winklevoss' idea and turn it into a social networking site that was only exclusive to Harvard students. And he was aided by his dorm room friends particularly Chris Hughes, and Dustin Moskovitz. It turn's out that they failed to privately secure the site to Harvard studs and it was exclusive to all prestigious universities. As the company grew, it reveals that what they were aiming is all about the money and business.<br/><br/>It is completely based on the book which was quite a false biographical statement. Zuckerberg never took revenge to his girlfriend. His idea for FaceMash were only for fun according from an interview. But it was completely offensive, yes. And Zuckerberg apologized publicly for that. In amidst of accepting the help of the Winklevoss' he was also accused of stealing an idea for a social network. He was hacker, but not a stealer. He created a social networking site called thefacebook back in 2005 and ranked to be the most visited social network exclusively to college studs and later on to all of ages. And the whole wide web is patronizing the only social network that beats Friendster and MySpace which were a former bright companies. It is now called Facebook.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this film gave a lot of impact to the real CEO of Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg never liked this film, because they made it while he was still living. And he didn't want his fidelity to be revealed. Writer Aaron Sorkin also made the whole story to fictional and his naivete insulted Zuckerberg a little bit. This was a good biographical film that David Fincher directed after all, as in Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button that garnered Oscar awards. Facebook already won the heart of the world wide web. The question is, will it win the heart of the 2011 Golden Globes or the Oscars?"
"Capo-idFilm","Null","0","0","29 October 2010"," Engaging but not profound
","The Social Network's promotional tag line reads, ""You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies"". As a matter of fact, the narrative seems to suggest, you don't get a site as global or profitable as Facebook without some serious big-money investment. Indeed, without the flashy business bluffing of Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), thefacebook.com remains the popular but unendurable dream-that-never-was of Havard friends and co-founders Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield).<br/><br/>This point is significant: the raison d'être for the film, both in story and narrative terms has its very seeds in the gem of Facebook itself. The very nature of this story is governed by its necessary pace: it's arguable that Facebook could only become the site that it now is by expanding so rapidly that it could beat any other would-be competitors and meeting the profit demands of short-term capital. This would preclude Saverin and Zuckerberg making it alone, and thus in turn making it at all – and so, since their final decision to sue is because of Facebook's international success, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer) would never have sought compensation from Zuckerberg for violations of their intellectual property.<br/><br/>This is the quiet tragedy at the heart of Fincher's film. But if this is inherent in the material, the director doesn't stress it. From the outset, there's that contradiction familiar to all of Fincher's films: a certain level of interest in the material as it presents itself to him, but a careful, deliberate detachment from it on his own part. This means that even if Fincher knows how to stage a scene and his directorial style is consistently immaculate, his work as a whole is uneven; when the script is formidable, you get something like Zodiac (2007), when patchy, something like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008).<br/><br/>Fincher's latest film presents its world in a matter-of-fact manner, and in doing so creates an apparently authentic sense of life at one of the world's most elitist institutions. In having events unfold mostly through Zuckerberg's viewpoint, though, Sorkin's script lacks the critical emphasis required of Fincher to make a genuinely provocative film that reaches beyond the betrayal of friendship between Zuckerberg and Saverin.<br/><br/>More at idfilm.blogspot.com"

","I have to admit - When I first heard of this movie, I basically could not believe that a flick based on a story of a computer nerd, who invented the biggest social website, can be really interesting. After seeing the trailer it came to me - the Facebook, in fact, is just a device that generates the old-as-our-world motifs of friendship, betrayal, greed and need to belong. Just then, I wanted to see it so badly to be reassured that my vision is correct. And I was not disappointed. This two-hour movie takes the viewer on a ride, which can surely be attached to a thriller or action genre. It certainly is unconventional for a classic biopic. The rapid dialogues written by Aaron Sorkin are the daisies of this picture. They make you feel like you are in a room with the Harvard geniuses themselves. What is more, we finally see Jesse Eisenberg (Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and the wit behind Facebook) arise from the shadow of Michael Cera, giving us one of the best acts in his career. Right after Jesse, we get brilliant performances made by Andrew Garfield (Eduardo Saverin, CFO, the deserted one) and Rooney Mara (the girl who dumps Mark and is a direct cause of Mark's creation). Moreover, listen carefully to the original score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross - back pins and needles delivered. I will not reveal the plot, but I can assure that most of the audience will be delighted. Now, just to reaffirm my point - I gave The Social Network 10/10, because honestly, I have to say that this is so far the best movie of the year 2010 and it will for sure fight for an Oscar or two, and will be remembered as one of the best flicks about networking in history."

","At first, I was hesitant to see this film because it was based on the book ""The Accidental Billionaires,"" which is basically character assassination of Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker in the form of a book. I was pleasantly surprised to find that while ""The Social Network"" doesn't pull its punches in the portrayals of everyone involved in the creation of Facebook, nothing comes across as overtly malicious.<br/><br/>The movie's opening scene shows Zuckerberg and his then-girlfriend Erica Albright sitting in a bar, discussing Harvard social clubs. Albright struggles to keep up with Zuckerberg's erratic train of thought, becoming more and more irritated with him, until he offends her so badly that she dumps him. Depressed and angry, Zuckerberg returns to his dorm room, gets drunk, and creates a website that allows users to compare girls from Harvard and choose which one is more attractive. And that's how the whole journey begins.<br/><br/>Along the way, the audience is introduced to Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (the Winklevi, as Zuckerberg refers to them in one scene), who serve as one of the major conflicts in the film (they sue Zuckerberg for stealing their idea for a social networking site), Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's one-time friend and former CFO of Facebook, and Sean Parker, the paranoid, almost delusional founder of Napster and Facebook partner.<br/><br/>Viewers do feel rather sorry for Saverin, who, at first glance, seems like he got screwed over by Zuckerberg. But closer inspection reveals that he was not completely innocent either, being driven by a desire to make as much money as possible. Zuckerberg is portrayed as a driven, visionary young man who at the same time had a rather warped personality. And Sean Parker, who gets deeply involved in the Facebook venture, is shown as a hard-partying paranoiac, although he does seem to genuinely want to help Facebook become a success.<br/><br/>Altogether, ""The Social Network"" is a cautionary tale about how power corrupts, and money can cause good friendships to fall apart at the seams. Engaging and thoughtful, this film is worth seeing."

","""The Social Network"" is a fascinating look at the creation and legal dilemmas surrounding the ever-present Facebook. The film moves at a lightning-fast pace, covering a multitude of relationships, legal issues, messages, and themes. The filmmakers took a true story and used it as a backdrop to reflect on our current social hierarchies. When I first heard about this film I didn't really see a compelling story. It felt more like a 60 Minutes interview than anything else, but leave it up to a great script and strong director to visualize this computer-orientated material. <br/><br/>Typically, director David Fincher won't tackle a project unless it has a buzz on it, so hot—it drops on the lap of every major agent in Hollywood. I wasn't sure how the filmmakers were going to setup the dramatic arch of such a computer-bound narrative, and then it hits you twenty minutes into the film; reveal the story slightly out of chronological order, based on the specific legal elements. I'm not saying it wouldn't be fascinating to watch the eventful rise and fall of a young adult's hubris in the order it actually happened, but sometimes, a narrative works a little better if the structure is tweaked—crafted in a way that better serves the character dynamics.<br/><br/>I'm not going to lie, a second viewing won't hurt. The combination of intelligent, argumentative dialogue and thematic understandings of success is so layered, I'm sure I missed out on a few important messages. Sometimes, when you tend to focus on how well a film is shot and crafted, it's hard to concentrate on the details of the story, along with the rapid-fire dialogue.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" follows the cynical, somewhat misanthropic, computer rebel, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), who created one of the largest computer websites in the world. His best friend and Harvard roommate, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), is his so-called partner in funding and establishing his new website. Along the way to success, Zuckerberg befriends a Californian connection, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), who invented the widely used Napster music program. According to the film, Zuckerberg stole the Facebook idea from two, buffed-out, Harvard elite twins and cheated them on their original idea. This and many other legal infringements lead to a multimillion dollar lawsuit. This goes to show you, when the economy is down and a lot of money is involved, friendships will be betrayed, egos will be conflicted, and entitlement will be the name of the game.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg, a strong Jewish-looking actor pinpoints this character as much as he nails the timing of the razor-sharp dialogue. He understands this young, ambitious individual. Zuckerberg really isn't a bad guy or as rebellious as he comes off. He's a man of strong principles, even when those principles betray the ones around him. He believes that the one who created is the one who is credited. Well, in this fiercely competitive American society, where lawyers, agents, and government officials run the game, Zuckerberg is really just a pawn. Even when his points come across as valid, there are certain principles in society, which undermine his own, and the only way to save his reputation is to play the game his own lawyers conduct. When all is said and done, Zuckerberg is still just a young man who wants to be accepted. He comes off as a rebel, but in a key scene where his new, party-animal friend, Sean Parker, gets arrested at a frat party, his image is suddenly tarnished. We finally see that his reputation means a lot more than his credit. This is a prime example as to why this character works—it's three dimensional, and by the end, Zuckerberg's personality backfires on the audience's expectations.<br/><br/>I think one of the film's strongest themes is social elitism. The film questions the importance of elitism in a university, which is bound to its social upbringing, more so than a student's GPA, at least I speculate. In the scene where the Harvard twins are in a rowboat competition at a prestigious English school, director Fincher blurs out the edges of the frame in certain close-up shots. The rowboat scene is understated by Trent Reznor's (lead singer for Nine Inch Nails) tantalizing and operatic score, which goes to show you that music can reveal a whole new level to a scene. The overall understanding I received from that masterly shot-and-edited scene is that Fincher is both revealing and mocking the students' focal point and sheer determination to be accepted in Harvard's elite social circle.<br/><br/>This is as far as I'm going to delve into the narrative. As you can see, it covers a lot of ground and David Fincher's craft is in top form. Checkout The Social Network and I guarantee you'll have your own thematic understanding of this entertaining true story."

","I first learned of Jesse Eisenberg watching ""The Squid and the Whale"" a few years ago, and it wasn't just the movie that blew me away but the sheer screen-presence of this self-assured young actor. Since then he dazzled me in - among other films - ""The Education of Charlie Banks,"" ""Adventureland,"" ""Zombieland,"" and he was a welcome participant in minor projects like ""Cursed"" and ""The Hunting Party."" All that said, his depiction of Mark Zuckerberg, the socially awkward computer genius who created guess-what internet behemoth, is simply incredible, and I am thinking Oscar nomination which, of course, will not happen since Mr. Eisenberg hasn't even reached 30 yet and, hopefully, has a long and prosperous career still in front of him. But wait, there's more. Andrew Garfield is impressive as Eduardo Saverin, dodging the clichés of a role that could have easily drifted into self-pity. Justin Timberlake shamelessly steals every scene he's in, and hats off to Armie Hammer who plays both Cameron Winklevoss and his twin brother Tyler with natural ease which is no small feat considering he had to play off himself. I have no idea how David Fincher did it, all I can tell you is I didn't waste a single thought whether there was one or two actors in front of the camera. Which brings me to the main masterminds: Fincher and wordsmith extra-ordinaire Aaron Sorkin. The big question was after ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is there any way Fincher can top this? Well, there isn't but, together with Sorkin who - at his core - is a playwrite, he was able to maintain the high level of quality entertainment you've come to expect from this director. I don't give a damn how much of the story is fiction or how little of it is fact - all I know is this two hours+ movie went by in a blink without a single dull moment, and that might as well be the biggest compliment I can pay a film in general and ""The Social Network"" in particular."
"starlit-sky","8","0","0","14 October 2010"," A movie about origins of facebook
","The Social Network is a well-made movie about the origins of facebook. The movie begins with Mark Zuckerberg (to-be creator of facebook) having dinner with his girlfriend and this opening scene perfectly introduces Mark's character and sets the tone of the movie. He is an intelligent kid who is not socially adept. You can tell this by the way he talks to his girlfriend and what he does after the dinner. He goes to his dorm and writes bad things about his girlfriend on the web and insults her publicly. He also breaks into the school's database server, steals people's pictures from the directory and sets them up on the web in doubles as part of a competition to pick who is the hotter girl. <br/><br/>The Social Network shows how someone, while creating a brilliant tool that minimizes the distance between people, is creating a distance between him and the people around him. That is ironic. It also makes you question if morals and smart business decisions should always be in agreement. Because the decisions he makes are actually earning him benefits as an entrepreneur but creating conflicts with the others. I found myself wanting to side with him because he is a clever guy but he also has a way of looking down on people in a condescending way or pretending as if they don't exist.<br/><br/>The movie also makes you think the delicate connection between an idea as inception and its execution. You may have an idea but if you don't have the ability to execute the idea and turn it into a reality, you will be dependent on someone else. The executing ability could be better than just having the idea. I think this is a movie that anyone can appreciate and will find its subject matter interesting. After all Facebook has revolutionized how people socialize today."

","At the end of the millennium David Fincher's visceral take on Chuck Palahniuk's novel 'Fight Club' defined a generation and, while it seems like only yesterday that it was released, eleven years have passed since Brad Pitt and Edward Norton contributed towards what is now regarded as a cult classic. Over a decade later the revered director has once more attempted to capture a moment in time, bravely deciding to focus his efforts on real events from very recent history, by filming a compelling drama based entirely on the creation of a single website that quickly became a worldwide phenomenon.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg plays Marc Zuckerberg, the brains behind Facebook, and The Social Network opens with a snappy dialogue between Zuckerberg and a female companion that ends disastrously, allowing the audience to fully comprehend the social awkwardness surrounding the film's lead, and his motivation for the creation of his website. Assisted by a number of friends, most notably Andrew Garfield in a stunning performance that is reassuring to fans of Spiderman (Garfield is scheduled to play Peter Parker in the upcoming reboot), Zuckerberg utilises his computer skills to create an exclusive club for Harvard students that remains accessible to the less sporty members of the prestigious University. In doing so he unwittingly unleashes a social medium that begins to spread across America and eventually over to Europe, as more and more students become obsessed with their online presence and the ability to check up on their friends, and more importantly their relationship statuses, wherever they are in the world.<br/><br/>There is no denying that The Social Network tells an incredible story, with Fincher's visual flair perfectly matched with the powerful soundtrack by Trent Reznor, especially in a standout rowing scene that is guaranteed to get your heartbeat racing, but the only downside is a lacklustre ending which cannot really be levelled as a criticism, after all this is real life and the story will continue long after the credits are rolling. People familiar with Facebook will find a lot to love in this movie, the inspirational story is a great backbone to the character development as well as providing a very personal account of Zuckerberg's rise to fame. The humorous references to situations that most of the sites user's will have found themselves in are very effective and provide a perfect balance to the tension in some of the more dramatic scenes, as well as enabling the audience to connect with the film on a more personal level.<br/><br/>The Social Network is an engaging and provocative drama that may just make you think twice before you update your Facebook status in the future. I would recommend it to anyone who uses Facebook on a regular basis; you are guaranteed to give it the thumbs up."
"Marter2","8","0","0","13 October 2010"," Not the best movie ever, but still highly entertaining
","The Social Network is a 2010 drama film directed by David Fincher (Se7en, Zodiac). It is essentially a story that tells the drama that ensued during, and following the creation of Facebook. Starring Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's creator, the story is told through flashbacks as Mark is being simultaneously sued by two separate parties. The first party is Mark's former best friend and business associate Eduardo Saverin, (Andrew Garfield), while the second is a pair of twins, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer).<br/><br/>What's really surprising about The Social Network is how engaging the entire production is. Even when nothing all that important is going on, it's set up in a way that makes you want to see more. The vast majority of the film is just dialogue, from really smart people, but it is exciting to watch. To me, that's really impressive, especially given the fact that the film doesn't move at a quick pace. It's a slower paced film, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially with the way the film plays out. Despite being on the slow side, it's very exciting, and never gets boring. This excitement may actually come from how well you get to know the characters.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how accurate a job the film does at representing the characters within it, but the film does do a good job at characterizing them all. You actually end up feeling worse for the people suing Mark, than for Mark himself. Zuckerberg acts like a jerk for the majority of the film. He's unlikable, and ends up losing his girlfriend before the opening credits. His former best friend, Eduardo Saverin ends up not being in the film for a good portion of the final half, but really is the character that ends up being empathized with the most. He more or less gets cheated out of the company by Mark, and is abandoned mid-way for Napster founder Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake). Parker is far less serious a person than Saverin, but promises Mark that Facebook will take off if he comes on board. The other main characters, the Winklevoss twins, also get deceived by Mark. They came up with an idea similar to what Facebook ended up being, and they hired Mark to program for them. He ended up turning around and creating a basic version of what is now known as Facebook.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, you end up caring about all of the characters, even if you don't want to. Like mentioned above, Mark Zuckerberg is a jerk, and while you don't like him for that, he's built up in such a way that you will end up caring for him. Each of the other characters gets enough screen time to develop as well, and this is brought out by the excellent acting done by each actor. They really all do a great job bringing their characters to life, and do it with consistency. There are not really any times where a character acts unexpectedly, or their emotional response doesn't relate to the current situation. The subtleties of acting all appear to be there, and for that, I'm quite grateful.<br/><br/>I am not, however, grateful for the way the story was told. It's not so much the idea of flashbacks being the driving point of the story, but it's the fact that this storytelling idea gets constantly pushed aside after the film takes off. There are 30 minute sections at a time where this tactic is forgotten about. Having flashback sequences that long is a maneuver that I didn't feel worked out all that well. If given a couple intermissions, where the present day interactions occurred, even for a minute, it would have been a great way to tell the story. As it is, it ends up being fairly meaningless. The only other grip I really have with the film is the CGI used during one scene. Mark and Eduardo go outside into the cold, and their breath seems really fake. By far one of the pettiest gripes I've ever had, but it did eliminate some of the immersion that the film tried so hard to have.<br/><br/>The Social Network is a film that works on almost every level. It's engaging, entertaining, well made and well acted. It's a solid package of everything required in a film coming together. It has real tension, the characters are well-developed, and while they aren't all likable, you'll end up caring about them all. While the flashback structure of the film doesn't always work the way it should, it ultimately is a decent way to show the story, instead of just jumping forward in time. If nothing more, it's the best film I've seen so far from David Fincher, and it's an impressive film to watch."

","Dramatic films are usually solely dramatic. Humorous films are usually solely humorous. The Social Network truly creates the best of both worlds and provides a sense of humour laced with satire, irony, and sarcasm, from a true genius, Mark Zuckerberg. The lines were absolutely fantastic, with every line having a deeper effect than the last. Mark lives his life with a condescending manner towards anyone and everyone, and prides himself on his true coding genius. There are somber and stern moments, as well as lighthearted and funny moments, showcasing the contrasting sides of Mark's life. The story of the origin of Facebook is undoubtedly quite entertaining, but the overabundance of characters sometimes becomes too much. Furthermore, there is a slight divide between the characters and the audience, because they are portrayed at an almost superficial intellectual level, far superior to most audience members; hence making it hard for the audience to connect. Nonetheless, The Social Network was an overall enjoyable film and gave me some nice Friday night entertainment."

","""The Internet isn't written in pencil, Mark. It's written in ink."" warns Erica, Mark Zuckerberg's ex-girlfriend, after he tries to apologize to her for posting photos of her online without her consent in one of the film's early scenes. This clearly is one of the facts of our life and our future, whether we like it or not. The Internet, and more specifically social networking sites - with all their benefits to society, along with all of their pitfalls, aren't going anywhere.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg is of course well known for being one of the co-creators of Facebook, and currently holds the title of the world's youngest billionaire at a mere 26 years old. In David Fincher's masterful ""The Social Network,"" we follow the story of the juggernaut website's creation through the eyes of Zuckerberg, his friend Eduardo Saverin, two of their fellow classmates at Harvard, the founder of Napster Sean Parker (played brilliantly by Justin Timberlake-in a performance worthy of a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and a whole lot of lawyers sitting between all of them. On the surface, this topic would seem to make for a fairly boring film, as movies about lawyers and their clients arguing about settlements and copyright issues rarely would be considered intriguing or exciting to watch. However, in the hands of Aaron Sorkin's fast-paced script and David Fincher's crisp and well-edited direction, the movie is so enticing and fast-paced that it feels almost like an action movie - even though the movie is 2 hours of dialogue without any action whatsoever. Scenes of dialogue between characters often only last 20 or 30 seconds before quickly moving onto another scene. I am not sure if I have ever seen a movie with as much dialogue and exposition as this move at such an exciting pace.<br/><br/>Without going into too many details about the plot, much of the story is focused on the large egos of each of the creators and how they each crave individual recognition, power, and prestige for the site's sudden growth and success. After the website begins to show promise and becomes highly profitable, the creators then file lawsuits against each other and each claim ownership of the idea. The first 2/3 of the film are set on Harvard's campus, where the characters give us a wealth of insight (no pun intended) into America's cultural definition of success, as measured by wealth and individual success, even at the expense of others. I found the topic to be a fascinating look into the ongoing struggle societies and cultures have between trying to balance individualism and pluralism. Cultures in the West, most specifically America, are of course mostly individual-based, focused mostly on capitalism and economic power, even at the expense of others, including family and community relationships - whereas more cultures in the East are focused primarily on families, communities, and pluralism, and those people care less about wealth, prestige, and individualism. One feels that the characters in this movie are all good, well-meaning people, but they feel an uncontrollable urge - an almost addiction, to look out for themselves and their own prestige first to create a zero-sum game of success, even though one can sense of level of loneliness some of them feel, most specifically Zuckenberg's lack of friends or a social life.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" explores the complex relationship between these values, and does so in an intelligent way that never preaches or talks down to its audience. The film simply tells the story of these characters in a very restrained and straightforward manner, and allows the audience to form its own opinions of the story on the screen. Capitalism and competition in America are never directly criticized, nor should they be, as without them we wouldn't be the economic or military superpower that we are today. However, even with our financial and individual successes, one can't overlook the downsides that also come from living in a culture that values those over pluralist and community-based ideals. Given the fact that Facebook and other social networking sites will certainly be around to stay, what does this mean for America's future? Will America always continue to be a ""me"" society where individualism and competition are valued over pluralism? And will social networking sites just promote those values only more so in the future? Is it possible for technology to change our values, or does technology only serve to reinforce our values? Now those are the 6.9 billion dollar questions."

","When it was announced that Hollywood was going to make a movie about the founding of Facebook, no one, including me, expected it to succeed. How could anyone turn a seemingly mundane subject such as Internet communication into a worthwhile film? Moreover, why would anyone want to? It appeared to be nothing more than Hollywood trying to cash in on the latest cultural phenomenon, a move no less sleazy than, say, churning out endless sequels to a tired franchise. And yet David Fincher and his team managed to not only prevent The Social Network from becoming an embarrassing failure, but they transformed it into one of the most critically acclaimed movies of the year and a prime Oscar contender.<br/><br/>How did they do it? <br/><br/>With The Social Network, Columbia Pictures faced the particularly tricky task of promoting a movie that, despite its much-admired director and screenwriter, held little evident appeal to any audience, mainstream or indie. Nonetheless, with subtle efficiency, Columbia managed to assemble a clever advertising campaign that steadily garnered the film hype – a simple poster featuring star Jesse Eisenberg and a catchy tagline; a riveting theatrical trailer that highlighted the movie's dark sense of humor and explosive arguments – and ultimately, it was clear that this was not a high-budget thriller or a quirky comedy but an intelligent, character-driven drama aimed primarily at adults, an increasingly rare genre nowadays. The buzz turned into legitimate excitement once The Social Network premiered at the New York Film Festival to glowing reviews.<br/><br/>Still, hype does not always translate to success (see: Changeling, The Lovely Bones). The Social Network fortunately escaped the fates of those early Oscar favorites-turned-critical duds, with help from the sure hands of director David Fincher, writer Aaron Sorkin and a cast of young, up-and-coming actors.<br/><br/>Arguably the most impressive aspect of the movie and certainly the most likely to acquire awards attention, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay is a labyrinth of wit, suspense and twists, the dialogue zipping like balls in a pinball machine. Sorkin, most famous for penning 1992's A Few Good Men and the beloved TV show The West Wing, shows off his deft hand with legal issues, generating tension and excitement from the most mundane activities, such as people discussing copyright laws at a conference table, which absorbs a generous portion of the movie. By telling the story through flashbacks, he weaves a beguiling mosaic of conflicted voices and hidden motivations, an intricate web of lies and betrayal, rejecting black-and-white ideals in favor of moral ambiguity and flawed, even despicable characters. This is a screenplay any aspiring writer (myself included) would admire and envy.<br/><br/>The cast, a truly impressive ensemble, delivers Sorkin's lines with deceptive ease, virtually disappearing into their respective characters, a feat most likely assisted by their collective anonymity. In a surprising yet inspired move, director David Fincher warned the actors against interacting with their real-life counterparts, as movie stars often do when portraying real people, discouraging them from doing impersonations instead of bona fide performances. Amid the universally solid supporting cast, Armie Hammer and Josh Pence stand out as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, respectively, even though Pence was faceless and voiceless (employing technology similar that used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fincher superimposed Hammer's face on Pence's body in an effort to make the non-related actors appear identical).<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that the stars of the film – at least visibly – are its three male leads. By far the most well-known cast member, Justin Timberlake proves here for once and all that he has the talent needed to succeed in the film industry, that the promise shown in 2007's Alpha Dog was no fluke. As disgraced Napster co-founder Sean Parker, he exudes aplomb and charisma, the kind of brazen confidence one can expect only from a person well-acquainted with the world of celebrity and fame, and he manages to create sympathy – if only a little – for a vastly unlikable character by lending Parker a hint of childlike optimism along with the conceited swagger. In the most emotional role of the film, Andrew Garfield imbues Eduardo Sauverin with passion and drive, holding his own against his more well-known costars. Of the actors, he arguably has the best chance at nabbing awards attention as he gets a plethora of scenes to show off his budding talent.<br/><br/>Personally, though, I was most astonished by Jesse Eisenberg, the fresh-faced lead whose previous movie credits include 2009's Adventureland and Zombieland. Here, it is obvious that he is more than ""another Michael Cera"", playing Mark Zuckerberg as an arrogant yet socially awkward genius whose ambition and frustration override his central integrity. He remains, for the most part, emotionally detached, articulating Sorkin's lines with flawless deadpan acidity and relying largely on verbal nuances and body language to convey his character's feelings, yet he is so electric, so comfortable, that the audience has no trouble connecting to him. Possessing the maturity of actors twice his age, Eisenberg deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance.<br/><br/>Lastly, one cannot overlook the efforts of David Fincher and his technical crew. Utilizing mostly dark and mute shades, Fincher gives The Social Network a bleak yet polished vibe with significant help from the gorgeously atmospheric score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, which swerves between melancholy and vivacious without difficulty. Also, editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall do an impeccable job of intertwining the past and present story lines.<br/><br/>Against all odds, The Social Network has defied expectations and become a legitimate critical and box office hit. Skillfully assembled by a team of both veterans and amateurs and alive with humor and pathos, it is a film about friendship and rivalry, truth and fiction. The Social Network explores the fragility of human connections, the psychological barriers we erect to protect ourselves from each other."

Armie Hamer could not be more spot on as the wealthy, stereotypical ivy league Winklevoss twins. Andrew Garfield is great as Zuckerberg's only friend, Eduardo Saverin, who only wants to support his friend and be involved with facebook, but who eventually gets left behind. another Oscar-worthy performance may come out of Justin Timberlake, who portrays Napster Co-Founder Sean Parker, who has the lifestyle of a playboy, but who also is Zuckerberg's intellectual equal. you leave wanting to love and hate zuckerberg in this film, you can see how badly he wants people to like him, but how he pushes everyone away from him. Eisenberg is well known for portraying insecure, sweet, sensitive guys in films like The Squid and the Whale, Adventureland, and Zombieland, but this time he uses his insecurity as an excuse to be a jerk to everyone. from the first scene you can tell what this character is going to be like. He insults his girlfriend unintentionally about her education, as well as other things. She storms out and tells him ""you're going to be rich, and successful, and you're going to live your entire life thinking girls wont want to go out with you because you're a nerd. but i want you to know from the bottom of my heart that you're wrong. it will be because you're an asshole."" zuckerberg then goes home, drinks, and creates Facemash, a website where fellow students can rate girls based on their hotness. this eventually leads to the idea of facebook.<br/><br/>there is no film like this. it is smart, entertaining, fast-paced, and really, really fun. plus nothing blows up. i love every aspect of this film, and it is going to fight Inception for best picture."

","The Social Network stars Jesse Eisenberg who plays Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg in his college days at Harvard less than a decade ago. When we meet him it is difficult to believe that he was working on a multibillion dollar idea. At the time Zuckerberg was more concerned with girls and joining exclusive fraternities than developing his unrealized potential.<br/><br/>The origin of Facebook begins when three students approach Zuckerberg to design a social network site for fellow Harvard students. He then enlists financial help of his best friend named Eduardo Saverin, played by the impressive Andrew Garfield. As soon as the new site is launched, the battle for control of Facebook begins.<br/><br/>I went into this film very sceptical about how this subject matter could translate into film. And then I realized that the film is more about the control, both financial and influential over the social network website that claims over 500 million members. And this is where screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher get it right.<br/><br/>The Social Network plays out more like a sequel to Wall Street. The film's great strength is its compelling drama. Fincher shot the film in short scenes that transition flawlessly one to the next. The screenplay packs several good lines that act as comedic relief. But what works best is the tension that unfolds in front of your eyes.<br/><br/>The performances are terrific all around, particularly Jesse Eisenberg who should get a best actor nomination. Justin Timberlake gives an excellent performance as Sean Parker, co-creator of now defunct file-sharing website Napster who takes Zuckerberg as a protégé.<br/><br/>The film gave me a feeling of disgust. It is difficult to like any of the characters in this film. From the frat boy mentality of Zuckerberg's fellow Harvard students to the superficiality of Shawn Parker, there are not many sympathetic characters in this film. But that is exactly why you will be taken in by this film. It evokes so much raw emotion that it will keep you enthralled for its entirety.<br/><br/>It is rare to find a film that is flawless on every level and the Social Network falls into that category. The academy I am sure will take note of this. The Social Network I am sure will be given a host of nominations."

I believe Mark Zuckerberg may have poor social skills, but I don't know if he is really as far on the Autistic continuum as this movie portrays. Also, having had a son at Harvard during this exact time period, I think the pompous aristocratic clubs and parties were highly exaggerated. And yes, Larry Summers can be an ass, but his scene was a little over the top. I think it made the Woosledick twins look like jerks, which they were."

","David Fincher is one of my favorite directors. I had high expectations going into this movie and my expectations were met. This movie is not like most other David Fincher movies. It doesn't have any twists to it like fight club or seven. Its a straight forward incredible true story. Even though this movie isn't all true it is still a great story. The acting in this movie is very good and i was very impressed with Jesse Eisenberg. But the most impressive acting part in this movie is Justin Timberlake. I never really liked him unless he was on SNL but he really delivers here and does a great job of making people have mixed emotions about his part. Some people will like him and some people will think hes a total douche bag. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes great screenplays and great acting."

","I liked this movie a lot. Another accidental invention. I'm guessing that without Sean Parker's inspiration, Facebook wouldn't have evolved from where it was. Probably someone else would have done it. Facebook is a stripped down version of My Space. More devoted to the chat room aspect as opposed to having your own website. Very good acting, all of them seemed involved. The strong story helped. If I were Zuckerberg, I would be flattered. Maybe he felt he had to disclaim a few things. One of your more interesting and intelligent people. One wonders why he isn't in NASA, the military or corporate world (maybe he consults?) Facebook has become a bit more than he envisioned. I personally see it as a means of expression. Nice look at the computer world for the layman. Reminded me of PI, HACKERS and SNEAKERS . very impressed with Eisenberg and Timberlake. I liked how the Jessica Albright story tied the film together, and gave you perspective as to Zuckerberg's character. Like the lawyer tells him, 'you're not as a**hole, but you try real hard to be'. Almost like he's trying to emulate some of the people around him. He's an obsessive minded programmer who has to take on some of the aspects of corporate chicanery. Can't wait until the DVD comes out so I can watch it at my own speed."

","Right out of the gate, we are hit full force with nerdy West-Wing-style dialogue, and some of the most realistic descriptions of computer programming I have ever seen in a movie. Technically the movie is very well done. Every actor is really talented. Justin Timberlake plays up the sleaze really well.<br/><br/>The only part that struck me as a little off was the 'crazy girlfriend' breakup scene. My initial reaction was there must be some deleted scenes that further developed the craziness, or maybe it was just a fact too juicy to leave out. But it's also an echo of a theme- she tried to get Ed's attention with the fire, he tried to get Mark's by closing the bank account. In the final scene, billionaire Mark is desperately trying to get a girl's attention, and even the exclusive club he's created can't help him."
"george.schmidt","10","4","12","4 October 2010"," Revenge of The Nerds: A 21st Century ""CITIZEN KANE"" - A Damn Entertaining Movie!
","THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010) **** Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer, Josh Pence, Justin Timberlake, Max Minghella, John Getz, David Selby, Rashida Jones, Rooney Mara. Filmmaker David Fincher's masterful direction and a clever adaptation of Ben Mezrich's book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin is exemplary in this look at the starting point of the Internet phenom, Facebook, and how its 'founder' in question Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg in a star-making, shrewd turn), a Harvard computer science geek whose 'revenge of the nerds' trappings belies his genius in tapping into the social zeitgeist of enhancing the college experience into the global ethersphere by incorporating a shred of an idea consulted on by fellow classmates, the Winklevoss brothers (Hammer & Pence), crew rowing to-the-manor-borns-wanna-be capitalists and throwing his best (and only) friend Eduardo Saverin (amiable patsy Garfield), the chief financier, under the boss in his seemingly ruthless chance to cash in on something truly amazing (no thanks to gadfly turn by Timberlake, the catalyst as Napster creator Sean Parker, seeing dollars & sense for his comrade-in-arms). Telling true just how maddeningly addictive the format is (me? Guilty as charged) and how one can be overwhelmed and yet embraced of the fruits of one's labor (apparently at any cost) is the stuff dare I say it as a 21st century CITIZEN KANE? Easily the film of the year (so far) and a damn entertaining one too boot!"
"NolanFincherBoyle","10","3","8","2 October 2010"," The Social Network is not all you think it to be
","On October 28, 2003, at approximately 8:13 P.M, Mark Zuckenberg, a then student enrolled at Harvard Universe, then drunk and angered from an argument from his former girlfriend, Erica Albright, launched out a very derogative and hateful blog on Livejournal depicting her to being nothing more than ""just a pretty face"".<br/><br/>Who would have known that one little offensive blog post that only sent Zuckenberg to a 6 month (then shortened) probation of ""academic activities"" and from crashing the Harvard servers due to a survey of who was the hotter girl on campus could have lead him to almost 7 years, 500 million users, billions of dollars, and the ultimate American dream of running the biggest social networking site? <br/><br/>Let me say this right from the start: this is in my eyes the best film of the year (yes, even better then ""Inception""). No, it's not the ""Citizen's Kane"" or ""the film of the decade"" that almost every critic seems to hype it up to be, but I must say: it's the best acted, written, and overall enjoyable film that I've seen in these last eight months by far. It combines something that I haven't really seen this entire year: creativity with a pure sense of norm. What I mean is that this film is creative in a sense of storytelling while remaining one thing we all in a film: for it to be not only watchable, but to be entertaining and ""out of the box"". ""The Social Network"" does this, and almost flawlessly in that sense.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckenberg is a very interesting character to say the least, not knowing what he's up to or thinking off. And it's all thanks to the brilliant performance by an actor that I even considered a ""Michael Cera wanna-bee"": Jessie Eisenberg (Zombieland, Adventureland). The way he portrays Zuckenberg as this intellectual mind with such knowledge of how to run a company, yet he can't run a personal relationship or keep his friends together was so interesting to watch. Every scene he sits in just gives off a very professional vive for such a young actor. Eisenberg is so worthy of an Oscar that I'm even going to proclaim that he's provided, to me at least, one of the most interesting characters in years to follow on screen. Especially scenes with him and Marylin Delpy, played by Rashida Jones, he really shines the best. Even in those scenes, he admits that he didn't want to do anything wrong to hurt those around him. He just what he felt was right, and that Facebook took from his ""social life"" and instead made the ""social network"" his new reality. Eisenberg shines in those scenes the best, as someone so flawed in personality but so flawless in mind. It's a tragic performance that, really, I won't ever forget.<br/><br/>And that's not all for the acting case: not at all. You also have two award-worthy acting breakthroughs for one newcomer, Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, Mark's long time friend and roommate, and Justin Timberlake as the very controversial Napster creator, Sean Parker. Yes, I just said Justin Timberlake, former NSYNC pop star and music superstar, gave a great performance away from his singing and instead in front of a movie camera. No matter who you talk about, both Garfield and Timberlake, deliver such knockout jobs that I have to commend them with not only the script that they were handed (I will talk about the script more bellow), but how much they really got into character. Fincher's directing and Sorkin's amazing script translates so well to the screen, its almost unmisable as to why you can't seem to hate Mark Zuckenberg.<br/><br/>And going back to Zuckenberg: it's more about the genius side of him that is the ultimate flaw in his master plan to get everything right: he can't compute in real life. A prime example of this is in the court room scenes, both being a self-centered know-it-all and a underprivileged snob that thinks he knows it all, while the only thing protecting him from losing everything is some faulty evidence and a good lawyer. Even with the first scene in the film (destined to be a classic in the dialogue department) between Eisenberg and Rooney Mara, its heavily shown that Zuckenberg doesn't live in the real world, but his own world.<br/><br/>In conclusion: For one of the very first time watching a film, I was more impressed with the script then the actual film itself. For such a film to come along, and not only surprise me to how amazing it was, it was just captivating to finally see Fincher return to the screen once again and bring another great film under his belt. His direction, Sorkin's script, and all three leads will get awards come Oscar time. This is the film of the year, and even though it pains me to say that I thought ""Inception"" was more mind blowing, this was the overall better film. From a drunken outrage over something minor, Mark Zuckenberg became the youngest billionaire in the world. And we have him to thank for changing how the world communicates with one another, no matter where on this earth. But to horror of Zuckenberg's world, he lost his own personal life and friends. Even with the lawsuits, the suing, and the final total in terms of who owns what, Zuckenberg will never get over he lost both Saverin and Parker as friends and business partners. I will continue to use it as well, but somewhat changes in one stance: trusting Zuckenberg as a person ""you can be glad to have as a friend"" is no longer the case. Even in the final scene tells how you can have everything and still have nothing. Even with the line that Rashida Jones provides before the credits role: ""You're not a @$$hole, Mark, you just try so hard to be one.<br/><br/>10/10"
"MovieProductions","10","3","8","2 October 2010"," Easily the best movie I've seen this year
","**** out of (****)<br/><br/>You know how each year, before the closure of the year, there's that one film that's just so highly captivating and involving, that you just know it's the movie of the year? ""The Social Network"" fits that bill completely. Out of all seriousness, I could not find a single flaw in this film. ""The Social Network"" is layered with such perfection that trying to find an imperfection in the film is like trying to believe ""Troll 2"" isn't the worst film of all time. Words can't describe just the absolute top-notch quality of this film. David Fincher is not a man behind the camera that just got lucky in the past. Potentially excluding ""Alien 3"", every film of Fincher's has been a home run. A director can make a fantastic film, but hardly does one get away with perfection. There has to be at least one plot hole, one character that wasn't fully developed, or maybe the pacing may be off. Nope, ""The Social Network"" isn't inclusive to any sort of flaw or imperfection. Actually, typing this review is a mere waste of your time. Just pay those ten dollars, see the movie, then see it again, and then see it again. ""The Social Network"" may be the only film missing on your top five of 2010 list and I sincerely doubt another film will fill in that open slot, so I highly suggest you fill in that slot. Don't underestimate Fincher's ability or don't second guess the critical acclaim. Every great feedback from an individual is simply worth reading because ""The Social Network"" is simply a phenomenon. It is so perfected that I'm willing to say that Fincher is on par with Tarantino. Yes, I said it.<br/><br/>The Social Network revolves around Mark Zuckerberg (Jessie Eisenberg) who recently became the dumpee by ex-girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) and frets about being excluded in clubs and decides to join his own. Meanwhile, Mark meets up with some interested intellectuals who share their ideas about a website. Mark is also influenced and inspired by similar chatting websites known as Friendster and Myspace. Zuckerberg decides to create a website called ""Facebook"" and is exclusive to Harvard students. While Zuckerberg is ranking in the cash, Eduardo (Andrew Garfield) is his supporter. Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) wants to support Zuckerberg's plan so he steps in. However, Eduardo and Mark's friendship seem to become lose once profit has gotten in their way. Eduardo and Mark must suffer the consequences of having a Facebook and even getting sued for supposedly stealing the idea of Facebook.<br/><br/>First of all, the script is so outstanding that I guarantee it will be nominated for an Oscar. The one-liners are tossed rapidly and certainly witty, while steering clear of being pretentious. It certainly is a hipster script. Furthermore, the character development couldn't be stronger. There's not one actor or actress who doesn't give it their all. Every performance in this film is Oscar potential, especially Andrew Garfield. Man, can that guy act. Moreover, the pacing is simply perfect. The film moves at a slow, yet smooth pacing and while there's an abundance of dialog, we are so invested with the characters, that the conversations are simply indulging. To top it off, the cinematography is phenomenal. You can tell that this is a heavily budgeted film. <br/><br/>Overall, ""The Social Network"" doesn't hit the mark, it destroys it. Everything about this movie is simply phenomenal and flawless. Rarely can a film be both, but Fincher accomplishes that. The performances, the script, the cinematography, the direction, the pacing, the soundtrack. Nothing misses a beat and nothing, I tell you nothing, can be perfected because it simply is. If there's only one movie you see this year, make sure it's this one. Never have I came out of a theater so proud of spending my hard-earned cash. So far my favorite films of the year are ""The Social Network"", ""Inception"" and ""Toy Story 3"". Dear Mr. Fincher, if film directors could be contenders for God, you would certainly be."

","Why are we all so addicted to Facebook?<br/><br/>""The simplest explanation I can think of is that basically everyone has friends and family that they want to stay connected with, and social networks are the best tool we have today to stay connected with all these people at once.""- Mark Zuckerberg (the real one)<br/><br/>The Social Network isn't simply ""The Facebook Movie"", this isn't the movie that many are expecting by any means. Mark Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, created Facebook in his college dorm room and now is one of the richest men in the world. To some, Zuckerberg is a complete dick and many who watch this film might even think that. One of the most important things to do when watching The Social Network is to factor everybody's perspectives into everything. Without this, the film can be completely misinterpreted.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg is a person just like you or I in every way possible. His Facebook profile says that he likes The Godfather, Gladiator, and The Matrix. The difference between us and him, he has almost $7 billion dollars. That and he's a prodigy, a genius, and an innovator. Not only is he all of those things, he's better than a lot of people at them. Zuckerberg launched Facebook, originally known as TheFacebook, back in February 2004 with his friend Eduardo Saverin. Who is Eduardo Saverin though? People know of Mark Zuckerberg, but nobody knows of Eduardo Saverin. Saverin co-founded Facebook with Zuckerberg by fronting many of the initial start up costs and also served as the company's Chief Financial Officer. In the film, Saverin is pushed out by Sean Parker (founder of Napster) through a series of documents that eliminates his role in the company. The Social Network isn't just about the founding of Facebook through hours of computer coding, it's about the relationships between these individuals.<br/><br/>At the film's running time of 120 minutes, the translation from script to film is quite amazing. The dialogue is fast-paced and doesn't give you a break to sit in your seat and relax. For some this may be difficult to soak in, however this is how Zuckberg's world works. One of the best parts about Aaron Sorkin's screenplay is how intelligent it is, it doesn't dumb itself down at all to make it completely accessible to everyone. What's also interesting about Sorkin's script is his ability to have such opposing elements work so well. While the film is a drama in many ways, the film is actually quite hilarious at times in it's own little ways. The film's ability to seamlessly work through the creation of Facebook and the depositions that Zuckerberg faced is rather interesting. The film is bookended by some of the best scenes I've seen in a while. It begins with Zuckerberg fast-talking with his girlfriend Erica in a bar over random facts about Chinese intelligence. Erica breaks up with him because as she puts it ""you're an asshole."" Zuckerberg lives his life with tunnel vision and for this reason many don't understand him, it's not his choice but simply who he is. The ending is just as good with Zuckerberg cowering over his laptop in hopes that Erica will be his friendon Facebook. What's so interesting is the journey that takes Zuckerberg to that end point of the film. There's never a dull moment in The Social Network with the constant flow of information flowing and engaging you into the movie.<br/><br/>The ability for somebody to like this film will most likely hinge on their ability to like Zuckerberg or not. If you walk out of this movie and think that Mark Zuckerberg is a complete jerk, you didn't understand the character. In the film, I saw a bit of myself in Zuckerberg was able to identify with the character. Zuckerberg isn't really afraid to say screw you to somebody else to insult them. Some might conceive this as a mean thing, while others may think the other person is just unable to handle the truth. He's constantly trying to bring himself towards success, but for what reason? I guess that's a question we all have to ask ourselves.<br/><br/>The acting performances in this film are all terrific and I'm quite positive that Jesse Eisenberg will be up for Best Actor this year. This is by far his best performance of his career and a new road for him as an actor. The former star of The Love Guru, Justin Timberlake, redeems himself and shows that he's not only a talented musician but an actor too. Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin is great too by being one of the only sincere friends that Zuckerberg has.<br/><br/>This is probably the best David Fincher has ever been as a director. His ability to make the film so engaging and interesting is what makes it so great. The film is well balanced in all regards unlike some of his other films that lacked unity. The Social Network is the movie to see this weekend and one of the best films of the year."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","9","2 October 2010"," It's not about Facebook; it's a story of ambition in a high stakes modern world
","You'd be hard-pressed to think of a film concept more socially relevant and relatable to 500 million people than a movie about the origins of Facebook. ""The Social Network,"" however is not some insouciant attempt to capitalize on the world's most popular social networking site for revenue purposes. It is a loaded drama that unlike most based-on-true stories, is a bit unforgiving of its ""protagonist"" (or anyone else for that matter) and unafraid to handle the unflattering side of human nature. Check the idea of this being a ""Facebook movie"" aside; this is the story of what can happen in today's age when an arguably stolen idea can be born at a frat party and turn into a $25-billion-dollar property in fewer than 10 years.<br/><br/>We learn right away that our quick-tongued smart-allick main character, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), is ""special."" After the opening scene finds him dumped by his girlfriend (Rooney Mara) for obsessing over winning social approval from the elite Harvard clubs and insulting her in the process, he goes back to his dorm, pounds a few beers and writes a website code for evaluating the comparative hotness of Harvard girls using the his best friend Eduardo Saverin's (Andrew Garfield) algorithm and pictures he hacked off the women's clubs' sites. We're then overwhelmed with techno-babble in this early scene that one can't help but realize not just anybody could've created Facebook.<br/><br/>Although we're certainly not asked to like Zuckerberg, we never find him so deplorable that the film becomes intolerable. The first of many contentious actions in the story involves Zuckerberg using the idea of Harvard boys Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss as the springboard for creating Facebook. With the excitement of watching Facebook unfurl also comes the web of deceit. The script doesn't give Eisenberg many redeeming moments to work with, but the humanity comes through just as much as the jerky characterization in his performance.<br/><br/>It doesn't take very long to get hooked into ""The Social Network."" The pacing of David Fincher's film is exquisite; the scenes are meticulously calculated and never let up on drama or intrigue with the lone exception being an overextended rowing scene/analogy toward the end. But the highlight is certainly ""The West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin's script: sharp, intelligent, thought-provoking and seamlessly telling two narratives at once as the film jumps between the story of Facebook's creation and the ""present day"" civil suits filed by Eduardo and the Winklevosses, separately. Throw Trent Reznor's cool mood-generating electronic score underneath and you have one of the better produced films in a while. ""The Social Network"" certainly has a share of live horses in the Oscar race.<br/><br/>Anchoring it all are these young, blossoming actors. Fincher has a reputation for bringing along remarkable talents (just look at what he did with Brad Pitt) and Eisenberg and Garfield might be two of the best in their generation. Eisenberg will shed the Michael Cera comparisons with this performance, but Garfield (future Spider-Man) really impresses. It's possibly because his character earns the most sympathy, but his confrontation scene with Mark is powerful. If the best actor categories weren't such gentleman's clubs, these two would certainly be there.<br/><br/>The strength of ""The Social Network"" lies in the ability to show the flaws in every character and to make us realize that in the shoes of Mark and Eduardo, we would have made just as many mistakes. When Justin Timberlake's character Sean (creator of Napster) enters the picture and starts trying to sell the boys on becoming billionaires, we begin to see how unforgiving the business world can be. Mark might have done some questionable things, but he kept himself afloat. Eduardo might have been cautious and pragmatic, but he got lost in the shuffle.<br/><br/>So ""The Social Network"" is not ""the film that defines our times."" It's not about social networking, but a story of ambition and dreaming big and the harsh realities of the business world. That's a timeless motif, not a modern one. Sure, there are plenty of nuggets for those ""fans of Facebook"" who will enjoy the moment when Mark realizes to put relationship status on the site or when the Facebook wall is referenced, but that merely dresses the film up as ""with the times."" If anything, it shows how we live in a world today where there's a value on intellectual property and it's a high stakes competition to turn ideas into tremendous revenue. So how can you fault these ""kids"" for the mistakes they made? It's a lot for anyone to handle. ""The Social Network"" helps us recognize that admitting fault and making amends after the fact is sometimes the best you can do.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

"3xHCCH","9","2","5","19 October 2010"," ""Like""
","I saw this much-buzzed film in an advanced screening yesterday, and I must say it lives up to its hype. I was really doubtful how anyone could charge up a story about such sedate topics as computer and business, and create a generally engaging movie. However, watching ""The Social Network"" dispels those doubts.<br/><br/>This movie shows us how the Facebook came to life. It seems that hell hath no fury like a computer geek scorned. From that one night when Mark Zuckerberg was rejected by Erica Albright, events were set into motion that led to the creation of an internet phenomenon. The subsequent events involving friendship, inspiration, back-stabbing, and double-cross that drives this story forward. It is said that the story was derived from court documents. Zuckerberg himself denies the story happened exactly that way. We will never really know how much of this is false testimony or dramatic license.<br/><br/>The lead actor Jesse Eisenberg perfectly plays the flawed protagonist Mark, who was so self-absorbed that you'd hate him, yet still admire him for his talent and drive. Justin Timberlake plays Napster founder Sean Parker, who was instrumental to push Facebook into the big time. This character was written to be so annoying, and Justin succeeds to annoy. On the other side, Andrew Garfield sympathetically plays Edward Saverin, Mark's only friend and financier in Harvard, and alleged ""victim"" of Facebook's rise into the financial stratosphere. Comic relief was provided by the ""Winklevii"" twins, who turned out was just portrayed by only one actor, Armie Hammer. Good camera trickery there. Also, you will be surprised by what the foxy Brenda Song (ex-Disney's Wendy Wu) will do here.<br/><br/>However, as a movie, ""The Social Network"" works. The script of Aaron Sorkin (best known for writing ""The West Wing"") is very rich and witty. The direction of acclaimed director David Fincher was sure and precise, following the tradition of his previous films like ""Se7en"" and ""Zodiac."" Yes, this is a movie with a lot of talk, but the pace, cinematography, and editing were all on point. It was not boring at all, as the atmosphere is kept interesting and tense despite the techno-babble and legalese. If this movie were a Facebook page, I would click ""LIKE""."
"MovieManMenzel","9","2","5","5 October 2010"," ""The Social Network"" just might be the best film of 2010!
","""The Social Network"" tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), who at this point is known to the world as the guy who invented (or stole based on who you talk to) Facebook. ""The Social Network"" is an interesting take on the story as it doesn't really give any concrete evidence of whether or not Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook or had the idea all along and just needed the push from the Winklevoss's to get it going. The movie not only focuses on Zuckerberg but also on the sites co-founder Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and Napster creator Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake. This movie while it doesn't feature any amazing special effects or any breathtaking animation, it does feature the best acting I have seen in a film all year, not to mention probably the only film that has a more interesting story than ""Inception."" <br/><br/>Despite what people have been saying about 2010 being a bad year for movies, I have to disagree. I have given four films a solid 9 rating, with ""The Social Network"" being the highest 9 of the bunch. The story alone of Mark Zuckerberg is fascinating but there is just something about David Fincher's vision of this story that made this movie something out of the ordinary. Maybe its the pure fact that Fincher decided to hire a cast of mainly unknowns to the mainstream film world to star in the movie. I knew most of the actors before seeing the film but than again I am a film buff, who loves independent film making. Fincher made a bold move casting unknown leads to play in a film about Facebook because this could have caused the film to flop but not with Fincher. He not only knows how to direct films but market them as well.<br/><br/>The cast as I mentioned above is superb! Jesse Eisenberg may actually earn his first Oscar for his performance as Mark Zuckerberg. The role seemed to be tailor made for him. He seemed sincere and really fit the original Mark Zuckerberg's shoes. Even the outfits he wore in the film were similar to those that the real Zuckerberg has wore. I always been a fan of Eisenberg and always labeled him as an underrated and under appreciated actor. He has had several solid roles before this film including ""Adventureland,"" ""Squid and the Whale,"" and ""Zombieland"" but ""Social Network"" will mark the film to put him on the map. He hopefully will be featured in more roles now! <br/><br/>As for the other lead roles, Andrew Garfield, who is set to be the new Spider-Man, was terrific as Eduardo Saverin. He was emotionally charged and just perfect in the role. Timberlake, was everything you expected him to be. He played the smooth talking and ultra cool Sean Parker like a pro! Its odd to see a film feature so many actors who seem so perfect for their roles. I also have to give Rooney Mara a little bit of credit here. While Mara wasn't in the film for very long, she definitely makes a mark in this film. Having met Mara in real life and seeing some of her other work, I was wondering when she was going to be put in a film that would exhibit her talent. ""The Social Network"" doesn't really feature much of Mara but gives her a chance to prove she deserves better than ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Tanner Hall."" <br/><br/>I must give some credit to Aaron Sorkin, who was the writer on the film. Now remember folks, this movie was based on a true story but also based on a book by Ben Mezrich. Sorkin proves that he is not only a great writer but great at adapting a book to film. Books to movie translations don't normally spell Oscar but in this case it does. Sorkin's script was powerful, interesting, funny, and thought provoking. Fincher and Sorkin is a match made in heaven for the film world.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Social Network"" is hands down the best film of the year so far. I definitely predict this film getting a lot of Oscar Buzz and being one of those films that will get a lot of nominations. The film is a near perfect masterpiece. It is brilliantly acted and the story is fascinating. When you add Sorkin's witty sense of humor in with the amazing story and Fincher's vision and eye for excellent casting, I don't think you could ask for a much better film. ""The Social Network"" is the must see film of the year and should be seen by everyone. This is probably one of those rare films that people from the ages of 15 to 85 could really appreciate.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Social Network"" is a high 9 out of 10. This is definitely the years must see film!"

","I can't remember the last time I attended a film that had me simultaneously entertained and engaged. After the movie TSN instantly became a hot topic for discussion at my house. The people I went with to see the movie were all across the board age group wise and everyone walked away with a different perspective and opinion. Sounds silly, but I hope they make a sequel 10 years from now as we continue to experience the effects of Facebook and become privy to the power play and players involved. Bravo to Triggerstreet, Columbia, Sony for a top rate picture. I've been back twice now to see the movie, something I haven't done in years. Be great to see some more work spring forth from this great combo of Writers, Director, Producers."
"dymingirl00","10","2","5","4 October 2010"," The Amazing tale of FACEBOOK..well a tale anyway
","This film was without a doubt genius. I am an avid user of Facebook and really enjoyed knowing the history about something that I use pretty much every day. Although with the way he was portrayed in the film it made me HATE MARK ZUCKERBERG and not even want to use his product. But since I make movies myself I know that even when telling the truth about something it can be ENHANCED shall we say.<br/><br/>So it starts off with probably the worst date I have ever witnessed. He basically calls his girlfriend an idiot and not pretty and that he is better then her. She politely dumps him and tries to leave before he gets things heated enough that she has to be nasty.<br/><br/>He then goes back to his dorm, gets drunk, writes a horrible blog about her and then creates a facemash site with his roommates. It got tons of hits and he felt better about himself. Kinda douchey way to go but hey, he got out of an expulsion.<br/><br/>So then these rich twins and their friend find out about what he designed and they have an idea. They want him to be the program writer for it and approach him. Well because he always seemed to feel like an outsider, they were part of the exclusive clubs he wanted to be in, so he says yes. To top it off, his BFF Eduardo had been approached by one of those ""CLUBS"" so he wanted to be part of the IN CROWD too.<br/><br/>So he gets going on this and then begins to think he can do it even better and WITHOUT THEM. After dodging them for a while he makes.....FACEBOOK.<br/><br/>So things are going good til they decide to sue him, but he is so into thinking he is the best he ignores all that and gets involved with the NAPSTER guy Sean Parker (Played by Justin Timberlake, who I can say gave a fantastic performance.)<br/><br/>So it all goes badly, and the lawsuit goes on. He screws people over left and right and then has to pay through the nose.<br/><br/>While we have all heard tales like this a million times, the performances of everyone and the way the story just flowed so fast it was a fantastic film! Go see it, and then in the words of my friend Mike, GO INVENT SOMETHING!!"

","When watching The Social Network the first thing that jumps out at you is the dialog. It is so fast paced and witty it barely leaves you any room to breathe. The second thing that jumps out at you is the amazing quality of the film, and it wasn't even shot on film. The Social Network was shot on a Red One Video camera. The cinematography was flawless, and mesmerizing. The acting fit perfectly, and the soundtrack was superb. The movie itself however is not flawless. It does drag on at times, and the ending was a bit abrupt it seemed. But the sheer quality and importance this film holds more than makes up for those minor setbacks. The most powerful performance came from the lead Jesse Eisenberg. His strong on screen presence was undeniable. He commanded the attention in every scene he was in, and drew us closer and closer to understanding this very complicated person. Overall The Social Network is the third best movie of the year behind Inception, and Toy Story 3, and I expect it to clean house at the Oscars."

"LadyLiberty","8","2","5","3 October 2010"," Facebook Story Earns a Definite ""Like""
","I'd heard of Facebook, of course. Who hasn't? But it wasn't until just about two years ago that some (college-age) friends of mine convinced me to set up my own page. To tell you the truth, I didn't think a whole lot about it. Innovations on the Internet are proceeding at such a rapid pace that I can't keep up with most of it let alone all of it, so the fact that Facebook existed really didn't make me think anything of it one way or another much less do any research into it. And then I saw The Social Network.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is a brilliant Harvard undergraduate in 2003 with far more intelligence than he has social skills. After a brutal break-up with his girlfriend, Erica (Rooney Mara), Zuckerberg opts for some very public revenge. He begins by posting some less than flattering blog entries about Erica and then, in an all-night flurry of programming, he sets up a Website that features photos of female Harvard students where each can be rated for ""hotness."" These actions not only wound Erica but garner the attention of the Winkelvoss twins (Armie Hammer, with Josh Pence as a body double upon whose face Hammer's likeness is digitally imposed) who have a Website idea of their own.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg meets with the Winklevosses (or ""Winkle-vi"" as he amusing terms them) and their friend Divya Narenda (Max Minghella) to discuss doing programming work for them on an application they want to put together to enable girls to date Harvard guys. But Zuckerberg thinks he can do something both broader and better, and ""The Facebook"" is born. With assistance from his friends Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and Dustin Moskovitz (Joseph Mazzell), his idea takes off in a major way even as the Winklevoss twins are still trying to get him to do something—anything!—for them.<br/><br/>""The Facebook"" has such an impressive take-off that it gets the attention of Napster's mastermind, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). And once Parker and his marketing skills and ideas get involved, Zuckerberg never looks back even though his few friends are being left further and further behind him.<br/><br/>The Social Network is based (obviously) on true events, though those involved with the movie have never pretended that parts and pieces aren't dramatized for the big screen (Zuckerberg insists that most of it is). Written by Aaron Sorkin (who was the driving force and writer behind one of what is, in my opinion, the best written television shows of all time, The West Wing), the dialogue is both witty and strangely natural when being voiced by the true computer nerds who are featured in the movie. Eisenberg says his rapid-fire lines so convincingly that I almost believe I was there when he loved, lost, and then won in a big way with his online creation.<br/><br/>The other cast members prove they are also well up to the task of bringing these real life people to movie life. Though Eisenberg carries almost every scene on his shoulders, he couldn't be as good as he is without the very able efforts of the supporting cast. I'd also point out that the one genuine special effect in the movie—that of making Armie Hammer's face and voice an integral party to the body of Josh Pence—is flawless (and I was watching).<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: The Social Network has already been touted as a potential Best Picture nominee come Oscar® time. I'm not entirely convinced that the movie as a whole is quite up to that standard, but I'd be truly stunned if the screenplay wasn't nominated, and I certainly wouldn't consider it undeserving if Eisenberg got a nod. I'm not always interested in recent American history (after all, I was there for some of it), but I also found the behind-the-scenes look at the invention of a phenomenon to be fascinating. And frankly, even if computer applications or online interactions aren't your thing, The Social Network remains a compelling exposé of what has become a huge influence on relationships in today's society. That it's entertaining, amusing, appalling, and heart-rending by turns is almost just icing on a very substantial cake.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: There have been numerous privacy concerns related directly to Facebook. In fact, one of Zuckerberg's problems with his first ""hot"" ratings site (which he called Facemash) involved what school administrators termed a violation of the privacy of Harvard students. Facebook has addressed some of the issues, and continues to say it will correct or modify others. It remains to be seen, though, just how much privacy some people will willingly forgo in exchange for the complete experience of what has become very much a real life social network.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Social Network is rated PG13 for ""sexual content, drug and alcohol use and language."" There are moments within the film where parents of younger teens may find themselves having to explain things they'd rather not, or where they could feel obligated to comment on things so their children don't think those actions are quite as ""cool"" or acceptable as they appear on screen. The plot is also fast-moving, and scenes switch back and forth from several venues and viewpoints, which makes the storyline relatively complex, perhaps too much so for younger viewers. I'd recommend The Social Network for older teens (15 or 16 and up) and adults."

"KnightsofNi11","9","2","5","2 October 2010"," How many synonyms are there for incredible?
","How can a movie about the creation of Facebook and the legal battles that followed it be interesting enough to warrant a two hour film? When you attach talents to the project like David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin the question is how could this movie not be interesting enough to warrant a two hour film? From the dark and elegant mind of David Fincher, the genius behind movies like Fight Club, Seven, and Zodiac, and the intelligent writing ability of Aaron Sorkin, the creator/writer of the multiple Emmy award winning series The West Wing, comes The Social Network. It chronicles the creation of the most popular social networking site in the world, Facebook. The word facebook should mean something to anybody who owns a computer. I have a Facebook. Most of my family has a Facebook, grandparents included, and I could count on one hand the amount of friends I have that don't have Facebooks. But this innovative and extraordinarily convenient social tool that we take for granted nowadays has a twisted and surprisingly corrupted past. And this past all stems from the manipulative mind of a man named Mark Zuckerberg.<br/><br/>In the opening scene we are also introduced to our protagonist of the story, Mark Zuckerberg. This character is where the greatest risk of the film occurs. Normally when the protagonist does not fit the role of good guy hero character, he or she is the antihero who is not an entirely good person, yet still retains their likability. Zuckerberg breaks this role. He is not at all a likable guy in the beginning of the film. He's a genius who doesn't know how to handle it. Zuckberger displays a glaring disposition where he sets himself above everyone else intellectually. He is extremely pretentious and arrogant towards his piers and colleagues, who he views as all inferior to his extreme level of intelligence. The character reminds me a lot of Jason Schwartzman's role in Wes Anderson's Rushmore, only not being as much of a caricature, so much as a human being (not to say that Rushmore isn't a great film). The way we see the character of Mark Zuckerberg, who I will say is excellently portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg, evolve is incredibly intriguing and constructed very well.<br/><br/>After the opening scene, we are cleverly guided through this story of betrayal and deceit which never loses its charisma. I give huge kudos to this film for its consistency. The dialouge never slows down or trails off and the film as a whole consistently hits a high mark for me. I was never bored, never disinterested, and never lost. I've brought up getting lost or confused multiple times because this film does deal with so much intellectual computer and legal jargon that it could have potentially been extremely confusing to anyone who doesn't have an understanding of the world of coding or lawsuits (including me). Fortunatley, Sorkin writes in such a convincing and clear cut way that as long as you pay attention, you will understand what is going on and you will understand the meaning behind everything that happens in this film and how it all builds to the end in a fulfilling way. Everything about the script is incredible and downright intoxicating. I found myself practically in a trance during long stretches of fast paced conversation. There was never a single moment in this film where I felt unsatisfied with what I was viewing.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, it still retains its gripping story and witty dialouge, but it begins to morph into a story that goes far beyond just the creation of Facebook. It deals greatly with corporate greed and the lengths that one can go to achieve something so incredible, but lose so much in the process. The subtext of this film is where it doubles in its intrigue, and makes it all the more impressive and memorable. It also is a film which defines this generation where technology is part of daily life in the social world. The film presents the pros and cons to this new age of social interaction, yet is not overbearing on one side or the other. The Social Network is, in essence, what every film should be, something that is incredibly well made, while also having a socially relevant credibility and worth. Hypothetically, The Social Network is perfect.<br/><br/>Even fantastic dialouge like this will have to be backed up by great audio/visual work that matches the compelling nature of the script. The Social Network plentifully succeeds on this level as well. Fincher has an impressive talent of creating very gripping visuals, even without immaculate and elegant artistic backdrops. He can create a dank and disgusting basement into a bloody and brutal fighting ring, or a plain and boring deserted desert road into a perfect scene for the final showdown between detective and serial killer. Fincher succeeds once again, as he turns a college party, something we've seen a million and one renditions of, into something so intelligently and artistically crafted in it's own razor edged contemporary fashion, that we forget what kind of simplistic scene we are in. He can turn a slow and monotone boat race into something so beautiful and delicate.<br/><br/>The combined talent of Fincher and Sorkin is thankfully not a wasted one in The Social Network. It lacks in no area, and while it succeeds above and beyond in its script, this is far from the only good thing about the film. Everything comes together so well in this film, and it works like clockwork. The Social Network is a film which defines a generation of technology and connecting through its vast network of social capabilities. It is done so incredibly well and means so much that it is a definite must see."

","""A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? A billion dollars."" Sean Parker's statement sets a mood for the battleground that is the Social Network. A film that depicts the bitter battle between the simultaneously brilliant and conceded Mark Zuckerberg, and practically everyone else who was involved with the invention of Facebook. But not only does the statement give a summation of the movie's core, it gives a summation of capitalist U.S. culture, as does the rest of the movie. Think about it as you watch; the alcohol swilling Harvard rich kids are eerily familiar to the Wall Street royalty who really rule this country. Is the destruction of Mark Zuckeberg's relationship with his best friend do to a business venture and greediness meant to parallel the collapse of the economy due to the continuous push of businessman for more money? I think so.<br/><br/>But that is another essay. Let us now speak of the other fantastic aspects of this film: Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake without a doubt give the best performances of the movie. I would like to shed special light on Jesse Eisenberg who plays a character that is much more than the nice guy geek he usually portrays. Here he plays a man who is drenched in his own configuration of loneliness, alienation, despair, and pessimism, a man who suffers from an over-inflated ego, who despite being brilliant cannot advance past the point of a computer screen. The character of Mark Zuckerberg is much darker than the role Jesse Eisenberg took on in The Squid and the Whale, who was almost as irredeemable, but eventually proves to be likable. The Mark Zuckerberg within The Social Network is entirely irredeemable, unlikable, but Jesse Eisenberg's amazing talent saves him from being unwatchable, and he can at times even be charming.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake gives perhaps the best performance of his acting career, playing Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster who sleazily snuck onto the Facebook bandwagon, in every scene whispering things into the ear of Mark Zuckerberg, almost in an allusion to the Serpent of Genesis, causing the change in Adam and Eve that caused their fall from grace. This all could've been overly obvious, but the charm Justin Timberlake infuses the character with makes it very subtle, and much more ambiguous as to whether it's even there or not.<br/><br/>All in all, I believe The Social Network to be the satire of the decade, a title I previously rewarded to There Will Be Blood. The only difference for me is that at time There Will Be Blood can be unwatchable or hard to watch for some people, and seem like five hours instead of two and a half. The Social Network is infinitely watchable and entertaining, something that There Will Be Blood just isn't."
"Supachewy","10","2","5","2 October 2010"," The Year's Best
","Aaron Sorkin called this film a court room drama so I will too, The Social Network is directed by David Fincher and stars Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, and Justin Timberlake. The film takes place at Harvard in 2003.<br/><br/>The film begins with 19 year old Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) on a date with a Boston University student Erica Albright. At the date Erica breaks up with Mark because of how rude he is. Mark tries to get her back but is unable to. Then Mark gets drunk and starts blogging about how much he dislikes his girlfriend while at the same time with his roommates creating a website known as facesmash where students at Harvard choose which one of their female peers are more attractive. The site crashes the Harvard network because it got 22,000 hits extremely quickly at four in the morning. The film then goes on to show how the Winklevoss twins hire Mark to create a social networking site. The film cuts back and forth to the future where Mark Zuckerberg is simultaneously being sued by his best friend Eduardo (Garfield) and the Winklevoss twins.<br/><br/>The screenplay for this film was absolutely brilliant. Like many people when I heard that there was going to be a movie about the founders of Facebook I was not too excited, but this film really is not about the founders. It is about the relationships they have with each other and the dark deeds they did to get Facebook going. The writing is very fast paced as well, just like the world of Facebook. Sorkin fills the script with brilliant wit, and is able to keep a bunch of kids in a house interesting for a surprisingly long time. The characters are extremely well developed and I support them all yet I see their faults. The end of this film is absolutely brilliantly as well, one of the best conclusions I have seen in years. If Aaron Sorkin does not win an Oscar for his screenplay then I do not know what the world is coming to.<br/><br/>The direction for this film by the Oscar nominated David Fincher was stunning as well. First of all, the rowing scene. That scene was some of the best cinematography I have ever seen and I remember turning to my friend and saying to him that I bet this film wins for the best cinematography at the Oscars and he said that he would not take that bet even though he would get every other film that came out this year. Now personally I would have taken that bet because the odds are fantastic. Fincher got great performances from all of the actors and I really liked seeing how he evolved from really a director of cult hits like Fight Club to something so beautiful as this that everyone can enjoy. Like Sorkin, I believe he deserves an Oscar for this film as well but I do not think it is as high of a chance as Sorkin winning one.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how good the acting was in this film. Usually when I think Jesse Eisenberg I think about Michael Cera because they always play the same sort of awkward roles. But The Social Network is to Eisenberg is like what Boogie Nights was to Wahlberg. It shows the world that not only can Eisenberg act, he can act really well. His magnificent portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg may even earn him an Oscar nomination. The way he moved and his facial expressions, and even that blank stare on his face was just magnificent. This is the first time I have seen Andrew Garfield act and I thought he did a fine job as well as Mark's best friend and the CFO of Facebook Eduardo Saverin. Not Oscar nomination worthy but he made me care about his character that was being left behind the rest of the Facebook founders. Justin Timberlake played the part of Sean Parker and had some great comedic moments in the film. I have always respected Timberlake as an actor ever since I saw him in Alpha Dog and in this film I thought he was perfect. The rest of the cast was also great throughout the film.<br/><br/>The score for this film I liked a lot as well. It was basically almost all sort of electronic sounds for the most part which really worked with the internet theme of the film. The only part that I remember where it did not sound electronically was the rowing scene I mentioned in the paragraph about the direction was that very famous classical piece that I do not know the name of. The score was perfect for this film.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a 10/10. There was absolutely no way it could be improved in my personal opinion and I believe it is a perfect film. I would not be surprised if this film wins Best Picture at the Oscars, I know I would support it to. In my review of The Town I stated that it was the best film of the year that I have seen so far. Well The Social Network blows it out of the water. Everyone must see this, stop reading and head to the theatre."

","In The Social Network, we follow Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a sophomore at Harvard University who is looking for a way to make his mark on campus, but more importantly to get himself into one of the elite Final Clubs at the prestigious institution, but that is easier said than done. After creating a website that allows users to rate how ""hot"" a female is compared to another, he turns the heads of some of the club members. Two in particular approach him in regards to an idea they had about social networking for Harvard. Mark agrees to help, but along the way realizes that this idea is much bigger than they all realize. Thus, Facebook is conceived.<br/><br/>Mark's aim is to put the social experience of college online. With the help of his good friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and his computer programming friends, they make a model for what will eventually be the most popular site this side of Google. As the project gets bigger and bigger, the network needs to evolve in order to stay alive. Enter Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the man who created Napster. Sean shows Mark the possibilities of his website, while Eduardo is looking to make money instantly. Mark, who clearly doesn't see eye to eye with Eduardo, decides to move on without him, creating a divide between the two that would never be repaired.<br/><br/>The film is cut up between the story and development of Facebook, and the lawsuits that Mark found himself in following his massive success, one suit coming from the Harvard club members who claim Mark stole their idea, and the other from Eduardo, who accuses Mark of cutting him out of Facebook unfairly.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around the character and motives of Mark. Jesse Eisenberg gives a career defining performance, really embracing the role and giving it everything he has. His dialogue is so snappy, making him sound so smart, clear, and ready for anything. The writing by Sorkin is outstanding. He doesn't wander about the story. He gets right to the point, highlighting the major incidents that occurred during the early days of this Internet phenomenon.<br/><br/>The supporting cast around Eisenberg couldn't have been better. Garfield as Mark's friend has great presence on screen, much like Timberlake who surprised me with his somewhat straightforwardness about Parker. It was clear that he was trying to play the character, not like his over the top performances from SNL. He is doesn't steal the show, and he doesn't have to. What I like so much about the casting is how nobody has really proved themselves before on the big screen. Timberlake is a superstar, but hasn't proved until now that he can handle a serious role. Eisenberg and Garfield are just starting to get their feet wet and the rest of the cast is for the most part unknown or in the same boat. It's because of this that we accept them as the characters they play, instead of watching someone like Seth Rogen. I was able to watch this movie and just focus on the story, not who was up there.<br/><br/>When I first heard that Eisenberg and Timberlake were slated to star in this film, I was a little uneasy. When I heard David Fincher was directing, I thought it was a joke. How could someone like this direct a movie with two actors who primarily do comedy (or music videos for JT's sake)? After watching the trailer, I was bought into it. This has Fincher written all over it. Like his other films (Fight Club, Se7en, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button), this has a dark, sometimes grimy look to it, like a cloudy film was placed over the camera lens, creating a dingy, often muted look. It compliments the old fashioned campus of Harvard perfectly, and also creates a much needed dramatic tone. If this were shot with bright, popping colors, it would be a confusing film. With the help of Sorkin's script, Fincher creates a fast paced drama that really opens our eyes to the world around us.<br/><br/>What this film does an excellent job of is instead of focusing on college and it's rules and regulations, we focus on the impact of this website on all scales, from campus to global. We see that the power one website can have is astounding, but more importantly how rapid an idea can surface, be put into production, and impact the world.<br/><br/>For those who aren't familiar with Facebook, this is still a movie you can enjoy. This isn't a love ballad for the now multi-billion dollar company, but it's an examination of what happens when friendship meets business, when desire becomes creation, when innovation turns into a nightmare.<br/><br/>By the end of the film we don't know what exactly to make of Mark Zuckerberg. Granted this film isn't totally accurate, but it's clear that this is a man who knows what he wants, and understands the risks of acquiring it.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things to like about this movie, and not too many things to hate. I would undoubtedly expect great things to come from this film during the award season. It rules on all fronts; acting, directing, writing, cinematography, production design, music. This one has it all. The one thing I hope doesn't come as a result of this movie is ""The Twit Flick."" Let's keep it to one social networking film for now."

","Rarely does a film come along that poses important issues and ideas about what it means to live as a human being. Even more rare is a film that truly gets to the issues at hand; what is happening to us right now in these modern times. The Social Network is such a rare film.<br/><br/>Everyone with a computer knows about Facebook. In less than five years, it has gone on to become the latest and most fashionable way to keep in touch with people you either know, don't know or would secretly like to know. It is the ultimate source of knowledge about people; whoever doing whatever whenever. Because this is such a permeating idea, the decision to release the film only six years after the website was launched is indeed brilliant. Then again, so is the film itself.<br/><br/>With a film based on computer programming and website building, in order for the vast majority of people to be drawn in, the screenplay must be exceptional. Aaron Sorkin's is such. Each and every character has that unique brand of speaking he has used in dozens of scripts: the dialogue is suave and intelligent, the delivery is snide and sarcastic. There is so much talking crammed into this two hour film that most people will be amazed they sat through a film like so. Yet, with the acting and directing, this is hardly a chore.<br/><br/>In the acting department, all are sublime and elegant in their respective performances. From Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss twins to Andrew Garfield as co-founder Eduardo Saverin, not one actor misses a beat or step. Everyone is remarkably on track in keeping within the confines of the story. Of course, the characters with the most face time are the ones everyone will remember and everyone needs to remember Justin Timberlake and Jesse Eisenberg come Oscar time. Both are magnificent in their respectful performances, portraying two men of opposite personalities but similar goals.<br/><br/>However, David Fincher must be given most of the credit for the sheer intensity and brilliance of the overall structure and experience of this film. In the end, it doesn't matter what actually happened or what is accurate. Being a fictionalized interpretation of the facts, Fincher creates with his slick editing, low-lit scenery and smooth camera-work an intelligent and marvelously well-sculpted piece of filmmaking that will be remembered for a very long time.<br/><br/>The final issue that must be addressed is the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook and the youngest billionaire in the world. Some, including Mark, think it's a bit harsh on him, seeing him as a totalitarian and ruthless businessman with no heart or sentiment. I would argue that it actually is very sympathetic to the Zuckerberg character and the real villain of this story is Sean Parker, who lured Zuckerberg away from his friends and supporters with the sensational dreams of changing the world. He's already done that and there's no telling what Facebook will turn into next. Of course, we'll all know about it. Just check your Facebook."

","The Social Network is a good film to contradict a frequent argument that cinema is running out of Ideas. History is always in the making, so there are always new stories to tell. The question is not so much which stories are worth telling but how they are told. This one is worth telling and told well enough to earn its place as one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>FACEBOOK is among the greatest cultural innovations of the free world so far this century, and even with 500 million users, I'm not even sure the site is in its prime yet. (It has yet to be legalized in China). Ironically, the simple fact that FACEBOOK is young is the movie's only problem (from a film point of view) David Fincher is telling a story that feels incomplete<br/><br/>Imagine if Citizen Kane ended with Charles Foster becoming the king of American Newspaper. It would be an epic build up, but there would still be much to tell. That's sort of the way it feels with The Social Network. The ending is rushed, but then again what else was there to do, wait eighty years for Mark Zuckerberg to die, and make the movie then? (encompassing his whole life). <br/><br/>The Social Network is about how Zuckerberg came to power. When the film ends, he has a little over a million users. It is a short time span to work with, but it is to the great credit of David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin that this motion picture is without a dull moment. This is a rapid fire motion picture, is one clever line after another, and some are pretty funny. Jesse Eisenberg gives a fiery performance, aided in part by his dialogue, and I also got a kick out of one sequence with involves a kayak race directed in music video fashion (which is where David Fincher has his roots)<br/><br/>I can definitely see the Social Network finding its way to the Academy awards. It will certainly be a proud moment for David Fincher who with each movie seems to be getting a larger voice."
"danjakubik","10","2","5","1 October 2010"," An absorbing, intelligent and timely pop culture technology portrait of the last decade
","""The Social Network"" / Directed by: David Fincher / Written by: Aaron Sorkin / Based on the book: ""The Accidental Billionaires"" by Ben Mezrich / Released September 2010 (Chicago) / Viewed October 1, 2010<br/><br/>* * * * Excellent<br/><br/>I liked this, almost masterpiece of a film, very much. Director David Fincher keeps things moving along at a lively pace and shows a refreshingly original style and mastery of how to best tell the story of the film. Due to the subject matter, this is a case where the product is much more famous than it's creators. <br/><br/>Based on the startup of facebook.com by Harvard student Mark Zuckerburg and friend/fellow student, beginning in 2003 on the campus of Harvard University. After telling the beginning/genesis of ""the facebook"", as it was known at Harvard at the time, the film then tells the remainder of it's story in flashback, during a double law suit deposition by four Harvard students, alleging Zuckerburg stole the idea of facebook from them.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin delivers an absorbing and intelligent screenplay with biting humor and wit. The film itself is part social commentary, with some thought provoking statements about the popular influence of social websites and the good and bad of the current Internet information age we live in. Accessing too much information, too quickly, easily and the ability to share it freely with the whole world, presents some problems. Without maturity, wisdom, good judgment and reasoning, harm can be easily done, intentionally or unintentionally. Things can be taken out of context and facts distorted easier than ever before.<br/><br/>The film looks and feels very authentic. I was impressed by the focused direction and the intelligent, witty and humorous writing style. The film begins with a good bang. The opening scene is set in a college bar. It's 2003. Mark Zuckerberg and a female friend are having a passionate discussion about many different topics. Zuckerberg is presented as riding a thin line between highly motivated and obsessed with ideas. He's a very intelligent young man and his brain is jam packed with many ideas swirling around at the same time. His female friend comments that, conversing with him, is like being on a stairmaster. It's simply too tiring and also a little confusing.<br/><br/>Fincher knows exactly the right pace and rhythm and exactly how to set up and execute each individual scene, while getting some excellent all around acting performances out of his mostly young cast. The first two things I noticed and was impressed by, early into the film, were Jesse Eisenburg's exceptional acting performance as facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg and the screenplay. The excellent direction of Fincher then becomes apparent.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenburg nails his role, portraying facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg, convincingly, as a highly intelligent, introverted, slightly immature, social inept and nerdy 19 year old Harvard student, who entered Harvard with an impressive, perfect 1600 score on his SAT. He does a great, if unusual job at defending himself against his accusers during the deposition. Also, Justin Timberlake gives a convincing supporting role performance as slightly paranoid, but passionate and driven Napster founder Sean Parker and third startup partner of facebook.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is definitely one of the most timely, intelligent and engaging films to come along in a while."
"siddhantadlakha","10","4","14","29 September 2010"," The Social Network: The Film Of Our Generation
","It's hard to decide where to begin talking about a film like this when there are so many aspects to touch upon. Let's go with the subject material first. Partially based on the 2009 novel 'The Accidental Billionaires', after a series of distinctly Facebook-esquire trailers, The Social Network gained the reputation of being ""the Facebook movie"", or ""the movie about Facebook,"" and to those who know a little bit more about it, it's most likely ""the movie about the creation of/legal battle over Facebook.""<br/><br/>Well technically, that is in fact the premise of the film.... But that isn't what it's really ""about""<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin's witty screenplay is immersive, to say the very least. Was it down-to-the-letter accurate about the facts and events? Probably not even slightly. But I don't think I've ever seen a film which so skillfully takes the un-truth and presents it as reality....<br/><br/>From the get-go, we're given an insight into the personality of Mark Zuckerberg, a character within this cinematic world created by David Fincher. We're soon introduced to his best friend Eduardo Saverin, played by Andrew Garfield, and a host of other characters played by a set of brilliant young actors. Characters who either love one another, hate one another, and even envy one another.<br/><br/>All young. All connected. All people.<br/><br/>And this is what The Social Network is really about.<br/><br/>Our generation. You. Me.<br/><br/>The screenplay follows the events leading up to the creation of facebook, alongside the two law-suits filed against Zuckerberg a few years later. This rare then-and-now narrative simultaneously tells multiple perspectives of what took place, just as the entire chronology itself is more of the writer's perception. Hey, if you want to see things exactly as they happened, go watch a documentary. This is narrative cinema.... and of the highest possible quality.<br/><br/>The film itself is presented in a rare fashion, its cinematography reflecting its ever-changing yet ever-constant tone, and focuses not only on the various people involved in the events it follows, but the intricacies of the relationships between them. These people are presented in such a realistic and complete way that I wish that I could actually meet these versions of them. Written with the dual purpose of narrating a story while following a number of characters, it flows quickly and energetically, but at the same time, it involves you in each and every single moment, no matter how pleasant or devastating. Every performance was pitch-perfect, and immensely impressive, especially considering the complexities of the characters. Their actions are at times commendable, and at times despicable. They can be loved and hated. They are exactly as they should be.... Real.<br/><br/>Filled with irony, humor, moral ambiguity, and unrelenting intensity, The Social Network perfectly mirrors the media age, an age in which people are at the same time both removed and connected, and is an important film for our generation. <br/><br/>In fact, it's not just a film. It's a statement. How many of us would have really anticipated that a movie about Facebook would be the film of the year?<br/><br/>Yes, you heard me. The film of the year."
"Naomh","5","3","10","17 October 2010"," Felt nothing
","Felling nothing to me is the sign of a bad film - personally I think that's why I go to the movies; to feel excitement, sadness, joy, horror, humor - whatever. The Social Networks showed rich aholes being aholes to each other. I found not a single character to root for and it felt that nothing was at stake, not really. Even their friendship wasn't made out to be any great thing in the beginning before it all went upside down.<br/><br/>Sure it was interesting in a news article kind of way, but it was souless. Was that the point? I doubt it, and if so - so what? Add to that the worst CGI 'cold breath' and falling snow that wouldn't look out of place in a cartoon and you have a film that seems to be over hyped because it involves 'recent events'. My prediction? It will not be remembered so fondly in cinema history. Fincher hasn't made a truly great film in over 10 years. Maybe The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo will find him back on form. We can hope."
"fiziko","9","3","10","24 September 2010"," Entertaining and balanced
","One of the world's most popular sites has a heck of a history behind it, and that history is well delivered by Sorkin's script and Fincher's direction.<br/><br/>As a piece of non-fiction, the film effectively balances the various perspectives from the legal entanglements involved. By jumping through time in a nonlinear fashion, the film reveals the emotions of upcoming conflicts early, but leaves the details of their origins until the appropriate time later in the flick. I will not cover these in detail for fear of spoilers, but know that there is no clear message about who was right and who was wrong, and the viewers can decide for themselves if they want to take sides and which sides they'll be.<br/><br/>As a piece of entertainment, the film also succeeds, drawing the viewer into the very believable human conflicts and likable, if quirky, set of staple characters. Though I cannot attest to the accuracy of representations of the characters, they all seem very real in their actions and dialog.<br/><br/>In short, this is one of the few movies that is both entertaining and informative. If you head in looking for either of those outcomes, you'll walk out happy."
"abcll27","1","5","21","1 February 2011"," Racist and blinded by the whiteness.
","Did they really say Asians can't dance? I will bitch slap the writer who put that into the script. I can't stand how there's no diversity in this movie. I never wanted to see this but started because it won so many awards, I said, fine I'll give it a try and not long before it started did it annoy me.<br/><br/>The music sucks. The music should not be noticed, thats why its called background music. Its too loud and does not fit the scenes. I still don't understand why this movie is doing so well?<br/><br/>This movie just shows what America really appreciates- political bull crap."
"stevejod","9","2","6","18 July 2011"," A Class Above
","Subtly and slyly David Fincher turns to address head-on a theme which has only been tangentially hinted at in his previous movies - the American social and power elite. Fincher turns his attention to a depiction of the intellectual and social elites that attend such schools as Phillips Exeter and move onto attend Ivy League universities such as Harvard where the action takes place. Seemingly a story about the founding of a website this movie is also a blackly comic look at the most privileged section of US society during their formative student years before they go onto enter politics and business at the highest level. It is an excellent depiction of the Facebook creation myth in that it is very funny and quite gripping - and it takes skill to make a story such as this either funny or gripping. Hats off to those involved in making this movie - it is an entertaining treat.<br/><br/>Here we encounter the angst-ridden but aggressively acerbic IT genius Mark Zuckerberg who founded Facebook and his clashes with friends and rivals who wish to claim the invention of Facebook as their own. Fincher and Sorkin portray Zuckerberg as an outsider-insurgent motivated by resentment at exclusion from a ""hierarchy within a hierarchy"" represented by exclusive fraternal societies at Harvard such as the Phenix Club. Compliments must go to Aaron Sorkin, the scriptwriter, along with Fincher for this absorbing, and sometimes outright hilarious, portrayal of competing ambitions in the intellectual dog eat dog hot-house of Harvard.<br/><br/>Here students are portrayed as already self-consciously worrying about what mark they will make on society before even graduating let alone accepting their first seat on the board of a Fortune 500 company. Armand Hammer (his own casting a worthy joke in itself) steals the movie in the role of the Winklevoss twins who claimed they were owed a slice of ""The Facebook"" equity - but he has stiff competition from none other than Justin Timberlake who gives a powerful and smart (in its restraint) performance as Sean Parker of Napster fame.<br/><br/>Fincher's interest in the entrenched, dynastic social networks of wealth and privilege which rule America - despite one of the culture's strongest myths being that it is a ""classless society"" - could be glimpsed tangentially in previous movies. The representations of institutional politics,big business and the legal system in Seven and The Game were not centre stage although the placing of Jodie Foster's character in Panic Room among the social elite of Manhattan was a clearer marker of where Fincher's real interest might lie. <br/><br/>In these cynical and ""post-political"" times it might be thought redundant - or even ludicrous - to describe this movie as subversive or to even think that subversion was Sorkin and Fincher's aim. The movie merely portrays in a scathingly funny way a part of the American social fabric which is normally either invisible to most people or whose very existence is denied - the American aristocracy. A great movie. Fincher's last movie Benjamin Button was an adaptation of an F Scott Fitzgerald short story and the influence of Fitzgerald is all over this movie too. Mark Zuckerberg as a Gatsby for the 21st Century? The biggest joke of all of course is the alleged valuation of Facebook - but that is a different movie."
"pgodders","2","2","6","13 March 2011"," Possibly the least entertained and gripped I have ever been by any film
","After the generally fantastic media and critical reception of this film along with the ridiculous number of award nominations it received (seemingly 1 nomination for every dollar the film cost to make) I was frankly stunned and appalled at how mind-numbingly dull this film is. The script alone would make far less interesting reading than a phone book, or indeed a book filled with random numbers and letters. The cinematography was relentlessly uninspired, the score cheap and cheerful. To my ears as well the mixing seemed to be off, the dialog sometimes too fast and quiet, drowned out by the ambient noise (particularly the first scene). <br/><br/>Upon doing some research it seems that large swathes of the film are wildly inaccurate, which in itself is not a bad sign for a film. After all 'based on true events' is a slogan that often precedes a moderately entertaining picture, albeit one that recognizes that the true events aren't quite up to standard and need spicing up with lots of guns, explosions and cleavage. In The Social Network there is none of this; the spicing up entails the twisting of the story to make Zuckerberg look as much like some Aspergers suffering Nazi Savant as is possible, and a pure fantasy representation of the context of the story (namely life for an Undergraduate at Harvard University) through uninspired 'American Pie' standard stereotypes. <br/><br/>In short the remake of this film cannot come quickly enough, and next time around they should follow in the tradition of a long line of films which proclaim themselves to be based on ""fact"" (sort of... probably... possibly... maybe a little bit...). This time perhaps if / when the servers crash this could lead to a nuclear meltdown in the submarine's reactor (did I mention it should be set upon a submarine) where several of the crew die heroically attempting to affect repairs, then Zuckerberg and Saverin could land on the shores of South America and go on a motorcycle road trip of personal and political discovery seducing some South American super-models on the way... Then on his way to a meeting to secure investment Saverin could get his hand caught in the closing doors of the lift, and having faced 10 minutes of the excruciating aural torture that is lift music, been forced to sever his own hand through repeatedly stabbing himself in the wrist with a sharp pencil. Meanwhile Zuckerberg could be possessed by an evil spirit and repeatedly stab himself in the crotch until a priest with a tendency to see suicide as the only way to solve the problem in hand can show up and save the day. Finally Zuckerberg and Saverin waltz out of the front door of their London club with a bank account numbering in the billions and it all looks rosy, until Zuckerberg is shot by his girlfriend's love-sick ex and Saverin suddenly discovers that some African Dictator has severed all his limbs and sewn them on back to front, promptly dropping dead.<br/><br/>In short what I am saying is... this film is rubbish, it is about as deserving of any Award, other than ""sleep-aid of the year"" as I am deserving of the presidency. The disappointing thing is, this isn't even one of those bad films, that is so bad it becomes entertaining (although not for the reasons envisaged by the producers). This is a terrible work of fiction, professing to be truth, with average acting, a weak score and a script that is less inspired than a pile of sand. If you have not seen this then don't bother, only watch this in 30 years time when the film industry has collapsed due to file sharing and you are absolutely sick of watching Inception over and over again."
"valgreet","3","2","6","11 February 2011"," Why was this movie made?
","It is hard to imagine what possessed anyone to think that this story would make for an entertaining film. There is nothing inspiring, or profound, or even very interesting in the story - stories like this play out in the corporate world just about every day. The only reason the movie was made is because someone became obscenely wealthy at the age of 23 due to his technical savvy and Ivy League connections. So what? That has happened before, too. The main character is really unpleasant, and not in a fascinating way. It is depressing to know that people who behave in such a reprehensible manner can profit so greatly. How many people can even relate to the characters in this film? I am glad that I saw it at a friend's house and didn't pay ten dollars in a movie theater."
"skysaxon","3","2","6","26 January 2011"," Wildly overrated, shot in yellow/green pallor with unlikeable characters
","This movie seems to be the critics' darling of 2010. Yes, it has a brilliant script. That is until the end, when one of the main character's legal staff absolves him of all guilt. Aaron Sorkin, I bet you didn't write that in the script. It was obviously put in later to make Zuckerberg not appear to be as much a monster as the rest of the script paints him to be. It's appropriate a legal person speaks those words because it is nothing more than a device to absolve the filmmakers from any legal recourse the real Mark Zuckerberg might take against them.<br/><br/>But that little bit of convenient cheating by the script is nothing compared to the vile yellow/green pallor that envelopes the film. David Fincher hates whites and blues. He refuses to use them. I scratch my head that all these high falootin' critics never mention that this film looks like it was shot on Mars. It looks horrible. My advice when you watch this at home is to remove the color and watch it in black and white. Along with the one-dimensional characters and flat acting (especially from the one-note Eisenberg), what you will get is a decent old-fashioned black and white movie. But not much else. <br/><br/>What really hurts is that the yellow/green David Fincher is currently spoiling the gorgeous earthbound whites/blues of Niels Arden Oplev's masterful ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and placing them onto the lifeless surface of Mars. Sacrilege."
"Killingforcompany","10","2","6","2 October 2010"," Does ""The Social Network"" Define an Entire Generation?
","Early reviews of The Social Network claimed that the film based upon the book, The Accidental Billionaires, about the sordid history of Facebook defined an entire generation. When one gets passed all of the hyperbolic praise and adulation I would say that The Social Network is indeed a very well made film. It does indeed sum up the 00's in a way that no other film has done so far. And much like previous films about generational conflicts, The Social Network takes a snapshot of how young people socially interact with one another in the new millennium. Still, many people have accused the film of doing a hatchet job on Facebook's CEO and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, but I would argue that this film does no such thing. Instead this is a film where Zuckerberg is portrayed as a rather ruthless character with the drive to take Facebook as far as it could possibly go. No one else in the cast, despite their accusations of being ripped off by Zuckerberg, had this driving force behind them. Simply put, if you would have invented Facebook, then you would have invented it. It isn't original ideas that have made Zuckerberg a multi-billionaire, but being in the right place at the right time, riding the ascending cultural wave of a major fad.<br/><br/>It is this ""moral ambiguity"" that makes The Social Network a compelling movie. The characters live in a dog eat dog world. Certain individuals are propelled to the forefront, but that success doesn't come without any sacrifice. Friendships deteriorate, grudges are formed, lawsuits are filed, and the very legitimacy of Facebook itself is questioned. In the end, I would have to say that this is one of the year's best films and definitely deserving of an Oscar nod."

","2 unbelievably spellbinding hours. The Social Network is one of the best films of the 2010's. A film emblematic of the cold, cutthroat word of tech as we know it. Unlike most biopics about influential people, The Social Network does not portray Mark Zuckerberg as inspiring. You could call him an antihero, but that would suggest that the audience likes him enough to sympathize with him. Zuckerberg is a villain. A villain that won. The Social Network tells a story of injustice, with enough self-awareness to know that despite the damning details, it won't matter a wit. Zuckerberg created Facebook and there's not a thing anyone can do about it. In that sense, there's an irony to the story. It's a film about a social network built on the premise of friendship, that was forged in a avalanche of broken friendships. If that weren't enough, Zuckerberg is seen here as an obnoxious sociopath. The opposite of anyone to be friends with. David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin were a match made in heaven. It's Sorkin's most biting and cynical written work, paired with the green, gloomy visual realm that only Fincher is known for. Jesse Eisenberg is Zuckerberg, and it's the role of his career. I don't know what it says about him that he can play this character so well. One would hope he's nicer than this in person."

","I've heard about this movie years ago from lead star Jesse Eisenberg in Batman V Superman but didn't see it until last year. My thought then was that it was lame. I mean, why should I watch a documentary about a website populated by 40 year old moms?<br/><br/>Now that I've recently become more attentive to cinema as an aspiring screenwriter, I started watching Youtube videos and reading Screencraft articles on the matter. Whenever the topic ""best writing"" comes up, I saw The Social Network in at least all top 10 countdowns. Out of curiosity, I checked the clip of Eduardo, Andrew Garfield of TASM (in)famy being hushed out of his own company. I liked it, and so I thought maybe this film isn't so bad after all. I caught the movie on Netflix and watched the whole thing in one sitting.<br/><br/>I regret not a single second of it. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has a masterclass on how he wrote this and his other films, but honestly if you're on a budget I say skip the $90 fee and just watch this movie while reading the script. In it, you'll find some of the most crazy witty dialogue ever known to mankind. This movie is the reason I got hooked into writing, and if I make it I want to thank Mr. Sorkin for fuelling my pursuit of the art.<br/><br/>The directing from David Fincher is just as amazing. I don't know what is it about the guy, but he managed to turn a movie about men suing each other into arguably the finest film of the 21st century, beating all sorts of special effect fiestas like Marvel and DC's superhero blockbusters. I also liked Trent Reznor's music, as of the coolest film composers I've heard of, he and Hans Zimmer should probably collaborate on something some day.<br/><br/>Watch it if you can, it's amazing."

There are, for all intents and purposes, no faults to be found whatsoever when it comes to this aspect of the piece's production; the quick-firing, quick-witted script meshes wonderfully with the astutely self-assured direction and the almost sickly slick cinematography. The movie only goes so far in being an entertaining experience, however, mainly because it has a somewhat seedy feel to it and it usually takes a more hands-off, analytical approach to its focal events. It always feeling like there's something slightly off at its just out-of-reach centre (ironically, this is perhaps a fantastic allegory for both the central character and his ever-expanding creation). Still, there's no doubt that this is a compelling story that sinks its teeth into you and, ultimately, leaves things up to audience interpretation - mainly in terms of who you feel is 'right' and who you want to root for - while also including a number of nuanced performances that make that decision a lot harder than it might, at first, seem. 7/10"

","In 2004, the world of social media skyrocketed when an enterprising Harvard student emerged with a little site called 'The Facebook.' Shortly after, the 'The' was dropped to create the one word social site that is now forever ingrained into popular culture.<br/><br/>David Fincher once again returns to the drama genre after the well received 'Curious Case of Benjamin Button' in 2008 with this true story drama that documented how Mark Zuckerberg and his company became the leading social media site in a time when YouTube was also coming to fruition. With a script by Aaron Sorkin (who would bag a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for this feature) and based off Ben Mezrich's book, the film tells primarily in flashbacks how Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) went from potentially developing a dating site for three fellow students to eventually creating his iconic company despite soon facing personal issues with former friends and then a lawsuit by the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) and former (and now again) co-founder Eduard Savrin (Andrew Garfield, pre-Peter Parker/Spidey).<br/><br/>The youthful cast that Fincher enlists is truly one of his finest ensembles in the director's career. In particular is of course Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, who goes from ambitious Harvard business student to the youngest billionaire in history (lest we allow Kylie Jenner to take that mantle). While the real-life subject was't entirely impressed with the film's depiction of him, it cannot be denied that Eisenberg nails the youthful arrogance of the boy wonder as he continuously back-stabs his friends and colleagues to achieve his own ends (though this irritated the real Zuckerberg). There is also a calm charm to Eisenberg as he silently calculates his next moves while also quipping with a sharp barb should he not care to hear or respond to another's remark; this is most evident in the present-day time narrative as Zuckerberg faces the accusations of the Winklevosses and his former friend, Eduard Savrin. <br/><br/>The film's supporting cast are the equal hearts of the narrative since they are the catalysts for the dramatic narrative: In the role that put his name on Hollywood's call-list and A-list is the dual performance of Armie Hammer as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, wealthy students who attended Harvard with Mark Zuckerberg. The Winklevi (as they are dubbed by Zuckerberg in a snide comment to one of the lawyers) initially proposed creating a dating/social site with Mark, but when Zuckerberg eventually decided to create Facebook the twins become vindictive and attempt to sue the latter for stealing their idea. While actor Josh Pence provides the physical body for Tyler Winklevoss, it's Armie Hammer who provides the voice and also physically portrays Cameron. The then-unknown actor makes an impression from our first view of the twins as their lavish indulgence as members of the rowing team shows their superiority complex to when an incensed Cameron declares that the duo should go after Mark once Facebook begins to become popular. While his twin sees no point in trying to combat their rival, he eventually relents upon a poor rowing performance.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield as Facebook's co-founder and primary investor in his friend's dream is arguably the young actor's finest hour. As Savrin, Garfield is the socially confident member of the founders and wants to build interest for the site while Zuckerberg seeks to mostly expand quickly to irritate the Winklevi and raise his own profile. While Savrin initially tries to be slightly hands-off and be the business mind and drum up investments for Facebook, his relationship with Mark immediately takes blows as Mark continues to make his own choices without consulting his friend and business partner. Upon learning what Mark does behind his back, Savrin gives him a choice: let Savrin make the decisions on finances and PR or he walks away. When Zuckerberg decides to have Savrin bought out, the latter's feelings become hurt and jaded so he makes the choice to go for his share of the now-popular company. During Savrin's testimony at the hearing, we can see he is trying not to harbor resentment towards Mark and only wants his fair share of credit for Facebook's success despite Mark's snobbish attitude and disinterest in the proceedings. In real-life the outcome has been happier as Savrin has again become part of the phenomena that is Facebook and has his share of credit.<br/><br/>While the run-time is a bit tedious and could've fit a ninety minute or slightly less shorter length, this move should've eliminated crucial time to fleshing out Sorkin's witty and engaging script and development for how we ended up with such an obsession with social media."

","David Fincher is a genius filmmaker- one of the very few true auteurs who can sell a movie on their name alone. Combine that with the screenplay being penned by Aaron Sorkin and the expectations for the social network were sky high and thankfully the film is good- really good. It charts the beginnings of Zuckerberg's empire and traverses through everything he goes through. Brilliantly paced, amazingly lit and well-acted by all the young stars at hand this is a film you should watch regardless of your opinion or interest in Facebook."
"jetlu","8","1","2","24 June 2018"," The film is good
","Social net work is about Facebook, but not the company, it's mainly about these two character Mark and Eduardo, the friend ship and conflict are great, and you really buy Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, at least in this movie. I have no idea what kind of person is Mark Zuckerberg, but in this movie Jesse is Zuckerberg. 
i really don't think there is much flaw in these movie, i mean it is based on true events. The story is amazing, I love the way they tell the story through ""flash backs"" if you even can call them flash backs. It is very interesting that they over shadow the story with the reading of the law sue. Most of the time you will get bored or annoyed but the exposition, and this movie is basically full of that, it haves to be, but the movie it's not boring. My greatest concern before i watch these movie that is this movie going to be boring as hell, you expect this movie to be full of dialog, and scenes that just two characters with close up, cut to another cut, but it is not. I think they change the characteristics of Mark Zuckerberg from real life, not completely different, but different enough to makes this character interesting, because they have a very interesting story in hand, all they need is interesting characters. When they have dialog, the way they to keep us audiences interesting is to constantly change locations and scenario. Every time they give out important plot information, the scene is different, the location, the relation between the characters, the situation, sound in the back ground, it keeps the scene fresh enough for the viewers invested. But yet again, this movie is all about exposition, and there is really not much they can do about it, even it's entertaining, and the scenes are fleshed out, it still gets a bit bored from time to time, it's not at a point that is bad, it's just a little flaw of the movie that the creators really can't do about it, i really think they make the best out of it, every second of them hacking is extremely entertaining, from cuts to cuts, sound design, and the lighting, it is just beautiful.
I said it before, this movie is all about the character, and they really did fleshed out these two characters. Everything that happened, you buy it, you believe it, not because it is real, it's because of you believe these characters would do such action. And i have to say, the performance is amazing, there is just one thing i like to point out, mainly because of the actor Jesse Eisenberg, he always do this, most of the characters he play, they all tend to talk really fast, it's not out of the character, but after seeing some movies, he talks fast all the time, I don't know why, but it's not wrong, at least in this movie. The clash of these two character seems so natural, the build up of the conflict and distance starts early all the way to the climax of the movie, and the impact was extremely powerful. And there are a lot of smart film making and writing.
In conclusion, this movie is beautifully shot, and characters are great, the story is great, you can actually feel something after seeing this movie, unlike most films today, so I recommend people watch this movie."
"virek213","8","1","2","21 May 2018"," Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, A Billion ""Friends"", And A Few Enemies
","Of all the Internet social platforms that have ever existed, Facebook is, and unless something better comes alone, will likely remain the best known. Initially a platform conceived by Mark Zuckerberg on the campus of Harvard University in 2004, Facebook was then later expanded to other Boston area institutions of higher learning, plus other Ivy League schools, and then to Stanford Univeristy, the latter which is, not coincidentally, located within driving distance of Silicon Valley. Zuckerberg founded the site with roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes; but as is the case with more than a few projects of this kind, Zuckerberg's ego got the best of him, and got him more than a few enemies in the process. This great saga of the Internet became the subject of the 2010 film THE SOCIAL NETWORK.<br/><br/>Based on Ben Mezrich's book ""The Accidental Billionaires"", directed by David Fincher (FIGHT CLUB), and scripted by Aaron Sorkin (of A FEW GOOD MEN and ""West Wing"" fame), THE SOCIAL NETWORK stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg, who, along with his friend Severin (Andrew Garfield), Moskovitz (Joseph Mazzello), and Hughes (Patrick Mapel), came up with the social networking site that started life with a somewhat grotesque name called ""Facesnash"", Eisenberg later changes the name to Facebook via a suggestion made by high-tech Silicon Valley hustler Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). But those efforts come to enrage the Winklevoss Brothers (Armie Hammer; Josh Pence), who had come up with the idea that may have inspired Zuckerberg's moves. And then later, other moves that Eisenberg makes on his own enrage the guys who helped him start it, resulting in the young Internet genius getting himself into legal hot water. And, as we have seen of late, it wouldn't exactly be the last time both Facebook and its creator would end up in hot water, both legally and politically.<br/><br/>With numerous flashback and flash-forward sequences detailing the rise of Facebook and the legal entanglements that Eisenberg must go through, many of which were of his own making, THE SOCIAL NETWORK is noted for a huge amount of expository dialogue that, as is the case with more than a few films done from Sorkin's screenplays, is delivered in rapid fire and often blackly comic fashion. But the overall impression, layered in with a great neo-futuristic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, is one of a feeling of uber-superiority on the part of Zuckerberg getting the best of him, and in the process, even as Facebook gains a billion-plus ""friends"" (as of 2018), making enemies for himself, mostly unnecessarily. And, as is the case with films like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and WESTWORLD, to name just two, THE SOCIAL NETWORK is also about the rapid pace of technology outpacing our ability both to deal with it and not allow us to be thoroughly immersed in it. Eisenberg does a good turn as the resident genius Mark Zuckerberg, as do a lot of the other, mostly younger, actors in this epic film that will, in the future, be seen as a portrait of the world that was shaped in the first ten to twelve years of the 21st century."

It doesn't even matter if most of the stories being told are true, or false, or highly exaggerated: the important part is that it captures the mood of Silicon Valley, it's treatment of people, its ruthless agenda.

The fantastical story of the making of Facebook is just as intriguing as it is to browse the website itself. Or maybe not so much nowadays.

"renegadeviking-271-528568","6","1","2","6 January 2017"," For better and worse this movie represents America.
","Was everything in the movie 100% accurate to what actually happened? Almost certainly not. Did that stop the filmmakers from taking basic facts about the situation and turning it into a riveting piece of new era drama? Absolutely not.<br/><br/>For better and worse this movie represents America. The ability to create, free enterprise, the internet, without having a dollar to your name, you can use these things to make yourself a millionaire. But we all know, being a millionaire isn't cool anymore. What is also inherently American is to take someone else's idea and improve upon it, with or without their consent. Though what follows, will likely be a lawsuit, another American tradition.<br/><br/>From a filmmaking standpoint the story was told incredibly well by one of the greatest screenwriters of his generation, Aaron Sorkin, using the legal proceedings as the wraparound for the plot from start to finish was a clever device that intrigued and enlightened without being a distraction. The score by first time screen musician (and long time Nine Inch Nails member) Trent Reznor and his tandem composer Atticus Ross was probably the best thing to happen to this film. Without the score it isn't the same movie, it provides a somber tone that gives the movie it's unsettling feel.<br/><br/>You could make the point that the movie also embodied another American ideal, greed. Although Zuckerberg didn't seem to care much about money (in the film and apparently in real life) the corporate greed of the lawyers during the takeover, as well that of the way Sean Parker was portrayed seemed to leave a heavy footprint.<br/><br/>But in the end Rashida Jones' character was right. Paying everyone who was rightfully owed a piece of the pie was nothing more than a speeding ticket. At the time of writing this Mark Zuckerberg has a net worth of $49.7 Billion (making him the eighth richest person in the world), and no amount that was given away could even be remotely considered as significant to that sum."
"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","9","1","2","29 January 2014"," A timely tale of success.
","The film is jam packed with some great acting and writing. Aaron Sorkin really is a master of dialogue. <br/><br/>I've always liked Jesse Eisenberg, and I thought he did a great job in this film. That being said, he's overshadowed by a powerhouse performance from Andrew Garfield who plays Zuckberg's best friend (maybe only friend) and co-founder. <br/><br/>Soon to be Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Rooney Mara has a small role, but she sets the tone for the whole film. It's going to be hard to fill the shoes of Noomi Rapace, but I feel confident that the combination of Mara/Fincher will get the job done. <br/><br/>It doesn't stop there. Justin Timberlake also turns in a great performance playing Napster creator Sean Parker. He's young, smart, cocky, rich (maybe not so rich) and you just know his presence is going to complicate things. <br/><br/>The Social Network is an interesting film for many different reasons. I find it amazing how somebody can become so rich with such a simple idea. It's also cool because Facebook is something that many of us use everyday. It's not often you can see a film about something that can be an integral part of your day. <br/><br/>I know a lot of people might not be interested in a film about the creation of Facebook, but The Social Network is about a lot more than that. <br/><br/>The film touches on many different themes including greed, friendship and trust. It's also really fun to watch really smart people do really dumb things. <br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer, I wasn't so sure if I'd be interested in The Social Network. Then the film started to get overwhelmingly good reviews and I just had to see it. I'm glad I did."
"Theflyace","10","1","2","19 September 2013"," A Great Film Technically and Emotionaly
","Back in 2010, I avoided this movie when it first came out because I wasn't really interested in Facebook and the poster looked strange. I was 100% wrong about this movie. David Fincher's ""The Social Network"" is one of the finest films I have ever had the privilege of watching. This is a showcase for a great director, a fabulous writer, and a great cast of characters and actors.<br/><br/>The story is about the inception of Facebook back in a dorm room of Harvard University. After a date goes wrong because he is too arrogant, Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg) drunkenly creates the prototype of Facebook (called FaceMash) with his best (and ONLY) friend Eduardo Saverin (played by the brilliant Andrew Garfield) The resulting controversy lead the Winklevoss twins (both played by Armie Hammer) to hire Mark to develop an idea of theirs. Mark arrogantly steals the basis of the idea, improves upon it, and creates Facebook. Another big cat interested in Mark's new thing is Napster founder Sean Parker (played surprisingly well by Justin Timberlake) He manipulates Mark to screw Eduardo out of the company because he wants a big stake in the next big thing. All this plays out in flashback as we see Mark in the middle of two lawsuits simultaneously, one from the Winklevosses, and the other from Eduardo.<br/><br/>One of the big keys in how the story plays out is Oscar Winner Aaron Sorkin's unique style of delivery and framing. He uses his trademark rapid-fire dialog and complicated characterizations to great effect. Of course no writer's script is gold without the right director to guide it to the screen. David Fincher works wonders here, giving us the proper mood inside the campus of Harvard and layered and nuanced performances. Both made the right choice of making the story a very cold one, even though we can root for some characters. Friendships are broken and it hurts.<br/><br/>The cast is amazing, and unexpected. Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark as a cold conniving nerd who is stung by the fact that girls hate him because he's so arrogant. He wants to prove to everyone that he is worth something and that he isn't a nobody, even at the cold cost of losing his only friend Eduardo. Andrew Garfield (who I think was unfairly snubbed for an Oscar nod that year) has a lot of meat too. he may not be the right approach for getting Facebook off the ground financially, but his heart's in the right place and he is loyal to his friend, until his friend royally screws him and he comes after him with lawyers. I mention these two specifically because I feel that that's what the story is really about, these two friends driven apart by this uncontrollably growing monster. Justin Timberlake is deliciously cocky and manipulative as Sean, but he is also pretty brilliant about how to get Facebook off the ground. He's not really a villain, but he just wants another huge new creation under his belt to show off to others.<br/><br/>I also have to mention, on the technical side, Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography and the editing by Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter. Cronenweth gives a strangely warm lighting against a cold story. What i mean is, it's warm and shaded during the Harvard scenes, and as soon as we meet Sean parker in Palo Alto, it become cold and more real. Like Wally Pfister, Croneweth know how to keep the audiences' attention to the detail and give them a rich palette to look at, but its there to tell the story. The editors Wall and Baxter compliment the story and the dialog beautifully. It finished the sentences, criss-crosses between the lawsuits and the flashbacks, and keeps the flow very well.<br/><br/>This movie is a wonder. I am still shocked that it did not win Best Picture or Best Director for Fincher. It won a few (Score, editing, and Adapted Screenplay) but not the ones it was seriously predicted to win. And like my review for Inception suggests, both this and Inception were passed over for a safer film that is full of clichÃ©s and boring characters, The King's Speech. This a modern film for the ages. it tells a modern story with modern dialog and storytelling, but is still timeless. Its one of my top 10 favorites, and if you like Facebook or hate it, check it out anyway. It is a treat full of great characters and a tragic story of greed and lust for glory and acceptance."
"Lejink","6","1","2","20 August 2013"," Out Come The Geeks
","Who would have thought a feature film could have been made about a bunch of nerdy students creating a web-site? I suppose though in the time-honoured fashion of the likes of ""The Paper Chase"", ""Cider House Rules"" and ""Good Will Hunting"" there can be gold in campus drama,although the difference here of course is that this isn't fiction, being an account of how Mark Zuckerburg with a little help from his friends, got the concept of Facebook out of his head and onto the market, making billions in the process. You'd have thought, mind you, that was more than enough money for him to share, rather than allow himself to be embroiled in high-profile and no doubt expensive court-cases by some of the people he trod on and used to get to the top, but thin as it is, that's the premise for the movie.<br/><br/>Right from the start, director Fincher shows Zuckerburg in an unflattering light, a geeky, self-centred, pretentious student who expects everyone to bow down to his intellect, but after his then girlfriend dumps him, a petty act of revenge on her leads to his Eureka moment in setting up an online club appealing principally to the young set.<br/><br/>The film is highly watchable, due to the pacey direction and Aaron Sorkin's ear for needle-sharp dialogue, but some posters here are right when they say that this film probably wouldn't work as fiction at all and it's only our real-life interest in the background to one of the biggest business success stories of modern times which compels our attention. Certainly there are no likable main characters here, besides the venal Zuckerburg, his meal-ticket friend and partner Eduardo Saviano seems just too gullible to be true while Napster-king Sean Parker ruthlessly lords it over his adoring acolytes in repellent messianic rock-star style. I almost wished that Zuckerburg's girlfriend stayed in the film throughout (she turns up briefly again later) as she seemed by far the most credible and sympathetic character here. Seems to me she should have shared in the mega-wealth too, as she inadvertently inspired Zuckerburg in the first place!<br/><br/>The acting by the leads is very good, none better than Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerburg, plus there's an excellent modern soundtrack courtesy of Trent Raznor. On the debit side, there's some uncalled-for gratuitous sex and Justin Timberlake is too big a celebrity to play big-nobody Parker. On the whole I'd probably hit the ""Like"" button for this film, but consider it a bit overrated both by the Academy, where it received a Best Film Oscar nomination and probably the public at large including the community here."

","I suppose it satisfies the American's need to feel smug and superior, but I wonder how many viewers from elsewhere are similarly impressed. This isn't because many of us either went to or have associations to universities older and more prestigious than Harvard: it's because we don't like the swagger.<br/><br/>I imagine those who say they don't like the movie are accused of not understanding it, but this isn't true. There isn't much to be confused about, the plot isn't complex, the issues involved in the litigations aren't difficult to understand. In fact the contrary is true, the dialogue is easy to follow when the protagonist isn't trying to impress by speaking too quickly. That's a failing of the film, by the way: I would like to think modern audiences (perhaps particularly those outside the USA) aren't impressed by the such an obvious ploy. ""Gosh isn't he clever, he speaks SO quickly!"" Of course it might be said the real Mark Z speaks quickly: this might be true, but he isn't in a film.<br/><br/>So what are we left with? A movie with all the failings of trying to impress too much. Acting which is adequate, casting which is the same, a plot which unwinds almost tediously and dialogue which would be the highlight of the film if it weren't spoken so quickly.<br/><br/>It's a very underwhelming experience."

It's a very believable story. I am sure not everything is like depicted in the movie but does that really matter? It's a movie, not a documentary. The characters play very believable personalities. I am not a ""drama"" watcher really, thrillers, war movies, that is my thing. But, I really enjoyed this movie.

","Mark Zuckerberg (character) is an unfunny version of Big Bang Theory's Dr. Sheldon Cooper. He speaks too fast, doesn't care about anyone else, is extremely arrogant and seems to be unfamiliar with any kind of ethics. <br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is a film that shows how the facebook website was founded and the issues that happened between the creators-- I don't know if the story of this film is real or fictional, but I really don't care. The actors are pretty decent, with exception of Justin Timberlake that doesn't look like an entrepreneur at all. Actually, he doesn't fit in any kind of character; he should maybe just stick to his singing career. Sadly, this David Fincher's movie suffers from the same problem of all his other works: it's too long. They don't have enough interesting story for 120 minutes, just like ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club"". I believe David Fincher likes to extend his films for some unknown reason-- even thought there isn't enough plot for that. In fact, there isn't any character that you can admire or at least like, so I just went them all to drop dead and end this whole mess.<br/><br/>All in all, this seems to be just a Hollywood flick with a new subject, made for those interested in pure entertainment and nothing else.

"ajs-10","9","1","2","11 September 2011"," A great film!...
","I remember when this came out there was an awful lot of debate, praise and general talking about it. Unfortunately it never made it to my local cinema (surprisingly), but it finally made it to a pay TV channel this week. I was quite keen to see it given the amount of attention it got, and also because it was written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher, both of which I admire greatly. Here's a little about the plot before I give you my thoughts.<br/><br/>After a disagreement with a girl, Erica Albright, computer genius Mark Zuckerberg goes online and writes a program called ""Facemash"". It was available only to students at Harvard University, where he was studying. It caused quite a stir when the University servers crashed. He had the help of his friend, Eduardo Saverin, who would eventually be credited as a co-founder of Facebook. Moving on from this, Mark is approached by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and their associate Divya Narendra, to write a web site for them that had elements common with what Facebook would become. Instead of working on their site, Mark works on his own idea, with backing from Eduardo. Eventually 'The Facebook' goes live at Harvard University and is an instant hit. They expand to other Universities in the United States and eventually across the world. Mark is contacted by Sean Parker, the inventor of Napster, and he eventually moves out to California to use his expertise. All this time, Eduardo is being squeezed out of the business. It all comes to a head when Mark is sued by Eduardo, the Winklevoss twins and Divya Narendra. It is this action that forms the central part of the movie and it is from here the various parts of the story are told in flashback. I've probably said too much, but the film is about so much more so I'll stop before the Spoiler Police (Universities branch) escort me off campus.<br/><br/>As you'd expect from Aaron Sorkin, an excellent script with some really great dialogue! The film is beautifully made, expertly paced and I found it very easy to get into. Great performances all round, particularly from Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, a real departure for him and he pulled it off brilliantly. I must also give praise to Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, for me, he put in the best performance, maybe because his character was more likable, but still a great performance. Honourable mentions go to; Armie Hammer as Cameron Winklevoss / Tyler Winklevoss and Max Minghella as Divya Narendra.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film, the subject matter is one that's close to many people's hearts and so I guess it was bound to be a hit. I did find the picture very dark though; so much so that curtains had to be drawn (it was a daytime viewing). I think it's one of those films that will eventually become a classic, but it is one you have to watch It's very easy to get lost in the twists and turns of a piece of dialogue written by Aaron Sorkin. (I mean that in a nice way). Over all, beautifully made, a great script, an enthralling story and some great performances Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 8.5/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 149,604 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96/100 (based on 272 reviews counted at the time of going to press)."

","Title- 2 Movie hours where i can definitely say: they were not wasted, but.... well spent.<br/><br/>Wow, what a great film. One of the few 2 hour films that i have been glued to screen for the whole of the film. The quality of the picture and sound in this movie is of the utmost quality for what they were working with. You can easily see how if not enough budget was given or bad decisions on cinematography how plain the film could of looked: because of the nature of the film. Justin finally arrived on screen after about an hour and he fitted in well. Strong performance for such a renowned artist in a different area being singing. He looked very much at home. His qualities appear to have expanded. The all round acting was top notch and from the actor Jesse playing Mark . Z i was definitely impressed. A lot of congratulations has to be given the script writers as it was pretty much flawless. 9/10 for me and definitely would recommend to watch, even more so if you use Facebook. Which is pretty much everyone. There are small relations that you can make to yourself and experiences which adds to a personal nature. Finally it shows that determination in face of all emotional/ phycological/ physical pressures can be defeated if you just stick to what you know and never give up. The world of business is ruthless__~ !"

","I've heard everyone around me say that this is the 'true' story as to how Facebook came to be...the truth is we will never know..But this presents a picture of how the pursuit for wealth can destroy us.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg sits at his desk one night after being dumped by his girlfriend, out of anger he begins to furiously type away at his computer that talks about his girlfriend and then publishes it online through his blog....Then, he has an idea..He compiles a database of the girls at Harvard by hacking into the school system and acquiring their photos, his act of anger proves to be very popular among his fellow male students....and thus he meets three senior students who want to design a site were friends can create a page and meet other friends....Mark agrees only to delay their so-called project and begins work on 'FACEBOOK'...when he unleashes the social network, his troubles seem to have only just begun.<br/><br/>I thought that for a fictional representation of what could be, it was quite compelling. Jesse Eisenberg does a marvellous job as his greed for power overshadows everything including his only friend played by the future Spiderman 'Andrew Garfield'. Their is a sadness to Eisenberg's portrayal as he yearns for someone who is gone forever. While Garfield outshines any other actor in the film because of what happens to him at the end...it's a heartbreaking scene when he realises of the great deception; wonderfully done by Garfield. While Justin Timberlake is surprisingly quite irritating as the Napster creator, Sean Parker. I loved the ending, it does not provide any closure; but we get to see that even Zuckerberg refreshes his FB page continuously!"

","Admittedly I'm the wrong demographic for this movie. I find all the hoopla about it curious. It's a good film, absorbing, and I loved its various messages, but I was not blown away.<br/><br/>The film purports to be the story of Mark Zuckerberg and his founding of Facebook. Like a lot of films based on a true story, it takes some liberties. Jesse Eisenberg does an excellent job as Zuckerberg, portrayed here as a brilliant young man who likes to create computer programs. When he creates Facebook, he encounters legal problems and comes up against former friends.<br/><br/>I liked the points made in the film - it's not the person who has the idea -- it's the person who takes the idea and makes it a commercial success who is rewarded. The person we remember is the one who takes something and makes it a go. The other point is, when it comes to money, everything else flies out the window. That includes friendship and loyalty. It shows us that business decisions are cut and dried, bottom line events.<br/><br/>The acting is natural and low key, and though this story could have been deadly, it moves at a decent pace and at least kept me interested. I was sort of expecting Citizen Kane and instead I got something several notches below. That's the problem with seeing something after everyone else has seen it. But I can certainly see its appeal to the younger generation."
"nickmesafilms","10","1","2","6 April 2011"," The Social Network (2010) - A Tale of Friendship, Loyalty, Greed, & Betrayal
","""The Social Network"" takes us back to the time when Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg creates the social networking of Facebook and the consequences that follow. But even though one of the movie's supporting details is the Facebook creation, there's actually a real plot behind that. It's about the presentation of everyday society, and how the Facebook's creation tears everything apart. The many consequences of society include friendship, greed, loyalty, and betrayal. These lessons of life are brought together into a movie that represents today's society, and that's what I like to see. Every single moment in this movie was written brilliantly, directed brilliantly, casted brilliantly, and everything brilliant was involved. Aaron Sorkin wrote a powerful memoir of everyday society, and David Fincher used his clever mind to bring it all together. Fincher's directing gave the film a certain style unlike his previous work. He wanted the viewer to dig deep into a world where it can sometimes not be a bright place. He used the creation of Facebook to represent not only how social media has affected our world today, but how certain real-life events such as greed and betrayal can be involved in the process. Aaron Sorkin's script is filled with well-written dialogue shared between the characters, clever and unexpected twists, interesting side info, and terrific depth. The movie is also accompanied by a haunting score that helps guide the audience through the story, the fast-paced editing used to go back and forth on Facebook's creation and it's aftermath, showing it's cause-and-effect theory, and the performances are some of the best cinema has ever seen. From Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, the trustful co-founder, to Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, Napster founder that joins Facebook to make it more edgier. But it's Jesse Eisenberg's Oscar-nominated scene-stealing performance as Mark Zuckerberg himself that definitely carries the movie. His fast-paced usage of the dialogue helps give the script a lot more attention to detail, and keeps the viewer along for the ride. If one is expecting to watch a biopic on Facebook, they'd better not think that much of that. They should really see this movie, while knowing it's actually a modern representation of today's society, with Facebook's creation at it's core. ""The Social Network"" is David Fincher's best film since ""Fight Club"", and it's one of my all-time favorites. ""The Social Network"", in my review, ""Expertly written, acted, and directed, a master-class""."
"d_art","8","1","2","1 April 2011"," Sharp and refreshing, 'The Social Network' has much to Like.
","Directed by David Fincher (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button), with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men) based on a book by Ben Mezrick called Accidental Billionaires, The Social Network is the story of Harvard undergraduate and computer programmer Mark Zuckerberg (Jason Eisenberg), who works on a new idea for a social website with his friend straight out of his dorm room. Called Facebook, it becomes a global social network, garnering 500 million users and making Mark the youngest billionaire in history, while also creating some enemies and legal complications. <br/><br/>Right off the bat, let me first say that The Social Network is a well-made film. Director David Fincher's stylistically visual direction, Aaron Sorkin's acerbic dialogue, and Jason Eisenberg's near effortless-seeming performance are what make this film beyond the usual biographical businessman-and-his-dream Hollywood tale. What's unusual about this film's subject is that the main character of this film is to this day, quite young, which also means the story doesn't span a very long period of time. So, a good majority of the film focuses on the details--dialogues, interpersonal relationships, and brain-storming sessions. I take it the main reason for even making a film about this is the fact that Mark Zuckerberg holds the title of being the ""youngest billionaire."" <br/><br/>The majority of the film takes place in Harvard, where we see Mark, his calculated personality, his interactions with his friends, and nurturing of his ideas. Jason Eisenberg is able to bring out the nerdy genius of Mark Zuckerberg with spit-fire delivery helped by witty, acerbic dialogue and geek-speak. His performance is convincing and makes it seem like Eisenberg is just playing himself and that he is the genius. Also good is his business-minded best friend, Eduardo Saverin, played sympathetically by Andrew Garfield (reportedly the next Peter Parker in the Spider-Man reboot), the more level-headed of the two owners of Facebook, portraying both the uneasiness and insecurity of being out of the loop when Sean Parker (played smart and confidently by Justin Timberlake), founder of Napster, comes into the picture, wanting to take Facebook to another direction. Advertisement<br/><br/>On the whole, the story is about how Facebook came to be and the people who created it and people who fought against it. There are some familiar conventionalities in this film like many biographies of this kind, along with greed, sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Structurally, it's nothing new. The story is framed within a meeting between Mark and the people and their lawyers who want to sue him for breach of contract or intellectual theft. We go back and forth between this current event and the past events in Harvard that helped create this popular network. <br/><br/>Not unlike Fight Club, David Fincher has a way of making any scene visually interesting. With camera blurs for depth of field, along with his sense of composition and color schemes, he makes scenes feel both surreal and personal. Even the beginning wide-shot credit sequence of Mark walking through the Harvard campus amongst groups of people he doesn't know is interesting in how it visually portrays the whole ""social network"" idea. <br/><br/>While Zuckerberg is portrayed sympathetically in this film, he isn't particularly seen here as a good guy, either—thus, the enemies. I suppose the irony of the film is how a site that is meant to create friends also created enemies for Mark. I enjoyed the quick-witted dialogue that came out of Mark's mouth. They don't try to dumb down the character for the audience, which is refreshing. To appreciate this film, it probably helps to know how Facebook looks like and how it works. For those who have used it, they know Facebook itself isn't really that complex or new—it's a site that is incorporated in such a way that it's easy, loads quickly, is somewhat safe, and works great with plugins. And, it is, of course, quite popular. There's little doubt there will be some who will be confused by the computer jargon in this film, but they need not worry as it doesn't contribute much to the plot (yet still cool to hear anyway). I wouldn't go far as to say this film defines the modern generation, like some have, which I found to be a strange statement. It is, however, a sharp, nicely-made film, and more refreshing than usual. I'm sure many users will have little problems putting this film on their Facebook's 'Like' list. <br/><br/>You can also follow my movie review updates on http://twitter.com/d_art"
"kenjha","7","1","2","22 March 2011"," Geek Tragedy
","This film chronicles the founding of the website Facebook. The story is told in flashbacks, turning a simple tale into a rather clumsy narrative. It is somewhat of a geek tragedy in that Zuckerberg, the founder of the most successful social network ever built, is a social misfit - basically a rude, arrogant jerk. Yes, it's the story of the little guy who makes it big, but the little guy is such a wet blanket that one can't root for him. Eisenberg delivers his lines so rapidly that one has to strain to understand what he's saying. Sprinking the dialog with technical jargon doesn't help matters. It's entertaining for the most part, but never rises above mediocrity."
"Robert_duder","10","1","2","21 March 2011"," Worthy of all the praise, brilliant cast, great story, and just a terrific film
","I went into The Social Network with zero expectations. I knew the context and thought in the back of my mind it sounded a little silly but I didn't know the story behind the juggernaut that is Facebook. Whether you want to see The Social Network as truth, or fiction or somewhere in the middle it doesn't deny how incredibly fascinating the film is, brilliantly acted, with great characters. I was actually surprised that the critics jumped on the band wagon for this one because I didn't think this would be their type of film but it turns out that the movie received great awards and notice and all for good reason. The film is a drama that will keep you glued to the story from beginning to end thanks in no small part to the powerful performances. On top of that the film has a terrific haunting soundtrack (Academy Award winning) that will stay with you long after the film has ended. This just seems to be one of those films where everything works...the cast, the score, the director, and the tone of the film. I suppose it doesn't hurt that Facebook is something that 99% of the world is familiar with, but really it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg headlines the cast as the brilliant and perhaps ironically socially awkward Mark Zuckerberg. Eisenberg gives this subtle and incredibly pathos fuelled performance. You dislike him, love him, and pity him all at once and constantly but his success and brilliance is easily portrayed by him. This will certainly sky rocket his career although I'm not sure his acting ability goes far from this performance. Andrew Garfield gives, in my opinion, the best performance in the film as Zuckerberg's best friend and partner Eduardo Saverin. Garfield's performance is incredibly emotional and depthy and he goes through so much in the film and he is the character I rooted for the most. He is certain to be a rising star especially with the new Spiderman on the cusp of his career. Armie Hammer does an amazing job playing a dual role as the twins who sue Zuckerberg for 'stealing' their idea. Certainly he plays the role well enough that each twin has their own distinct personality and you would have to stop and think about it before realizing it is the same guy playing both roles and that speaks worlds to his performance. Up and coming It girl Rooney Mara gets top billing in the film usually with the rest of them but she has a very small role although pivotal to the story as Zuckerberg's ex girlfriend. She has good chemistry with Eisenberg and the opening scene with the two of them sets the stage for the entire film really. I think, similar to Garfield, Justin Timberlake's performance is very under-appreciated in this film. He gives a great performance as Napster founder Sean Parker. He is sleazy and fast talking but a great business man and he carries his parts flawlessly and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves in future roles.<br/><br/>With successes and some stumbles Aaron Sorkin is an amazing writer. Despite its quick cancellation his TV Series Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip had some of the most witty and brilliant writing I have ever seen. He also penned cult fave The West Wing, Charlie Wilson's War (also very well written but poorly received) and its good he got some great recognition (Oscar win) for this film because it has the perfect pace, great characters and just a really terrific story. Add into this the amazing David Fincher (Se7ven, The Game, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button are three of my favorites from him...truly amazing films.) David Fincher knows better than anyone how to set a tone and he does it perfectly with this film. This isn't his usual type of film and yet he still brings in his dark, foreboding, broody, emotional tones to it and it works perfectly. Some people love it, and some people hate it but I was blown away by how amazing the film was. Give it a chance because it is entertaining and brilliantly put together and just a truly terrific film all around. I don't usually agree with professional critics but in this case I think they truly nailed this one down when they showered it with awards and nominations. 10/10 Riveting!!"
"hlederhosen","9","1","2","21 March 2011"," Best Picture? No. Brilliant? Yes.
","It was about 2 weeks after the first time I had ever watched Fight Club, and as an aspiring filmmaker- I was going through a ""ZOMG David FINCHER IZ THE BEST FILMMAKER EVAH"" phase. I figured since the Oscars were the following week, i'd rent myself a copy and see what all this hype was about.<br/><br/>Firstly, I'm going to put it on the record that I do think The King's Speech deserved to win Best Picture. Colin Firth was incredible, every moment of the script was enjoyable, and even as a person who is as jaded as myself actually cried during the film. However, I will say that comparing the two is like comparing ""Donnie Darko"" to ""Toy Story 3"". <br/><br/>Alright, with that little chunk of opinion out of the way let me get to the actual film which is in a word ""brilliant"". They made what could be Razzie Fodder into literally one of the best films made in the decade (Not in the top 15, but somewhere in the upper 50's). The script is brilliant, and creates vivid characters, all of which are perfectly cast (Although being of the age where I actually watched some of Brenda Song's Disney material- it was kind of disturbing on some levels).<br/><br/>All in all it's a great film, with a brilliant script and sublime acting-but I stand by the academy entirely in their Best Picture Decision."
"hassan-ilahi","10","1","2","18 March 2011"," David Fincher's best film which guards his Oscar.
","The Social Network 'appeared' to be one of the most anticipated/profound films of the year, so my expectations for this film were high. The Facebook 'story' was a one I had actually never known about, and was extremely curious/interested to find out more. Lastly, with David Fincher, who had directed so many great and underrated films, you couldn't go wrong...<br/><br/>To tell you, I wasn't a tad bit disappointed with the outcome of this film. It was actually almost perfect! It featured fine performances, a sophisticated soundtrack, brilliant writing, and outstanding direction.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting too much from young lads such as Eisenberg, Garfield, and Timberlake. In the end, they were all perfect for their roles. Eisenberg was strong, aggressive, and jubilant to show his hidden talent. Garfield was even more impressive; playing his character with speed, expressions, and perfection. Last but not least, Timberlake was actually the weakest. Yes he was aggressive and near-perfect for his role, but at times, he just blew it! The sophisticated soundtrack was creepy and made me shiver the daylights out of me! Reznor and Ross did an excellent job of putting it together.<br/><br/>The writing was actually the 'stand-out', meaning the best category I praised this film for. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay seemed hard to follow, but the guy did one hell of a job! Overall, (as you can see), The Social Network is one of the best films of the year that guard Fincher's deserving Oscar. I'm just keeping my hopes up for him to get it, otherwise it'll be another foolish mistake from the harsh Academy."

"mysteryfan04","10","1","2","11 March 2011"," Inspired and Marvelous
","The Social Network is my pick for the best movie of 2010. On the surface, it may seem to be just a movie about Facebook, but it is much more than that. Its script weaves together eloquent conversations about friendship, betrayal, jealousy, and intelligence. Jesse Eisenberg masterfully portrays Mark Zuckerberg, a gifted student at Harvard with a brilliant idea. Little does he know that his brilliant idea will throw him into two lawsuits which ask for a great deal of money. The film moves back and forth through a timeline of a few years, with events ranging from the later involvement of Sean Parker to a fantastic canoeing race. The directing from David Fincher is remarkable, with each scene of speedy, expertly crafted dialogue seeming like cinematic heaven. The performances of Eisenberg, Garfield, and Timberlake are gripping and awards-worthy. The Social Network, with its phenomenal script, breathtaking direction, and demanding performances help make it the Best Picture-worthy film that it is."
"chiayh","8","1","2","9 March 2011"," More Than Face-Value
","I admit I fell in love with The Social Network: It was smart, funny, and sympathetic. I liked it so much I watched it thrice, even though I was sitting for my GCSE 'A' Levels. <br/><br/>The Social Network is not just a snarky narrative about awkward and rich young men. It is also a portrait of human nature, as we learn how to grapple with self-identity. On screen, the characters spar with their wit and their lawyers; off-screen, we are left wondering how much authenticity is masked by their defensiveness.<br/><br/>I adored The King's Speech for it's sheer humanity - the latter made me cry, while the former made me laugh. The King's Speech appears to be the better of the two, in my extremely subjective opinion, because I was laughing and crying WITH the characters - while I was probably laughing AT the characters in The Social Network.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this movie made me a converted Aaron Sorkin fan. He ranks next to Alan Bennett, the wonderful British playwright who wrote The History Boys. Perhaps like The History Boys, I would learn to outgrow The Social Network, with all its awkward charm and angst. However, it was a profound movie that made me question issues that plague our lives today: why we are driven to success, and why we seek to escape from ourselves, to hide from our own darkest shadows."
"brando647","9","1","2","8 March 2011"," Fincher Proves He Can Make a Great Movie About Anything, Including Facebook
","I had serious doubts when I heard there would be a movie based on the creation of popular social network Facebook. What could possibly be interesting enough to devote an entire film to a website where people routinely post pictures of their meals, play hundreds of crappy games, and stalk each other's every move? Well if there's one thing I should've learned by now, it's never doubt director David Fincher. Fincher's immense talent coupled with the sharp writing of Aaron Sorkin combine to bring us one of the best films of 2010. Based on the biography ""The Accidental Billionaires"", the film tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg, an antagonistic genius who finds inspiration in a drunken night of retaliatory hacking/blogging and a subsequent pitch from classmates for a new social networking website. He focuses his inspiration, along with funding from his best (and only, really) friend Eduardo Saverin, creates Facebook and watches it explode in popularity across the world. The story is framed within depositions for two lawsuits brought against Zuckerberg, one from Saverin and the other from his classmates that accuse Zuckerberg of stealing their idea.<br/><br/>Fincher's movie is a slick, fast-paced story that immediately grabs your attention from the opening scene, with Zuckerberg's high speed rant to his girlfriend over final clubs and standing out in a college full of geniuses. Right away, we know from his dismissive attitude and his arrogance that Zuckerberg is not a good guy, and we see over the course of the next two hours how self-centered he really is. I'd thought Jesse Eisenberg was great in ZOMBIELAND and he proves he's more than just the ""new Michael Cera"" with his excellence as Mark Zuckerberg. He helps turn Zuckerberg into a complex character; in the DVD commentary, Fincher notes that it wasn't meant to be the breakup with his girlfriend that drove him to create Facebook as a means of impressing her, showing her why she should be with him. But to me, that's exactly how the movie plays out: Zuckerberg is hurt when his girlfriend leaves him and everything he does for the rest of the film is merely an attempt to regain her attention and show her what he's become.<br/><br/>THE SOCIAL NETWORK was my choice for Best Picture this past Oscar season and I was sad to see it lose. Along with TOY STORY 3, this was one of the top movies of 2010. It came as a major surprise and it blew me away. The cast was fantastic; even Justin Timberlake continues to prove he has strength as a legitimate actor (for further proof, see BLACK SNAKE MOAN). Andrew Garfield was great as Zuckerberg's former best friend, Eduardo Saverin, and I'll be curious to see how his career progresses after such a high profile film. Finally, we have Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's award-winning score for the film: a sharp synthetic sound that feels at home in a Fincher film and gives it a familiar feel. This film is wonderful; how accurate it was to actual events, I couldn't tell you. As a story playing out on the big screen, I loved it. I'm sure there are people out there who won't have an interest in seeing a movie about the creation of a social networking website, but it's a lot more than that and I hope most people will give it a chance to surprise them, as it had me."
"AtlanticSwell","9","1","2","4 March 2011"," The 452nd review of a film about someone who now has a piece of all of us
","Difficult to add to everything that's been written so I'll attack this obliquely: Aaron Sorkin's script drives the actors and the story and it's a very well-written script. I've read it and it does have a sense or urgency and discovery straight off the page which translates very well into a fascinating and hyper-realistic version of the truth. <br/><br/>If you didn't already know, the film charts the rise of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard and his journey from dorm geek to billionaire and the subject of countless law suits. <br/><br/>If you are one of the few people who do not use Facebook then this film will have less of an impact on you, that's for sure, but I think that the inter-relationship between Zuckerberg, his initial partner Edouardo Saverin and their nemeses 'The Winklevi' is fascinating. <br/><br/>My favorite parts of the movie are where people wrongly under-estimate Zuckerberg and he surprises them, closely followed by the Winklevi trip to Larry Summers' office which doesn't end quite as they expected. <br/><br/>9 out of 10."
"SamuraiNixon","8","1","2","4 March 2011"," Monomania not social skills
","Here is a film that is impossible for me to review without interjecting my own experience as a software engineer. Most of what is shown in the film I have experienced in microcosm -- everything from a lawsuit, intellectual theft, the CS courses, spending countless hours writing source code, dealing with some of the most emotionally inept humans on the planet (and some of the most brilliant), being part of a start-up during the .dot com era, having a company grow exponentially (that company fell faster than Icarus, but that has not happened to Facebook, yet), money freely flowing and being betrayed. There are not many industries that are as paranoid as the software industry. The amount of non-disclosure agreements, paranoia and intellectual theft make the industry feel more like cloak and dagger than what an outsider to the industry might just think as a playground for nerds and geeks.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg has an idea. Well technically (the best kind of correct) two twin rowers the Winklevoss's have an idea (both played by Armie Hammer). To improve a social network specific to Harvard. They recruit Zuckerberg after he performs a hack that brings down the school network with a program that allows users to compare the looks of randomly chosen females downloaded from several sites. But Mark avoids the two and with a business partner and best friend Eduardo Saverin (and one additional programmer) set out to create their own version of a social network for the school. Ideas are constantly stolen and you expect that they will be stolen. So it is a bit harder for me to feel for the Winklevoss's on this issue. Their naivety seems a bit much for Harvard, but it does happen. Its exponential popularity helps excite the interest of nerd-badboy (played well by Justin Timberlake) Sean Parker whose narcissistic behavior is legendary and only upstaged by a company he helped create in Napster. With this unholy union the company expands even more. But at what cost and will it survive the enemies that have been created not only by the success, but by the enemies created from within the company.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg is sublime and spot-on. It does not help if you have been around many variants of this personality and their borderline (or full) Asperger's Syndrome. They are certainly easier to take in a two-hour movie, but not as fun when you work with them and every single perceived fault is ripe for an acerbic comment. But the monomania that is displayed akin to The Nutty Professor while stereotypical is quite true. When you are working on a problem or a perceived solution it can dominate you and make you oblivious to anything else. His surly and sarcastic conduct no matter what the setting certainly defies social normalcy (especially in the trials), but that is also quite true of this creature.<br/><br/>While I do feel the film has been overrated, and I am somewhat glad it did not win the Oscar, I do feel it is a good film and I enjoyed watching it. There is some sloppiness to it though. In a particular scene to show Mark Zuckerberg's intellectual prowess as he leaves in the middle of a problem in a CS course (leaving for a personal issue) the professor calls him out and states that not everyone will be successful, in response he of course answers the question to the bewilderment of the professor. This is analogous to the ""Jeopardy"" scenes in films where answering is to show your mental acuity. Another scene was the ""Eureka"" scene where an individual comes to him and discusses an idea which facilitates hey The Facebook needs a marital status. That idea has been used way before The Facebook (BBSs for example).<br/><br/>It also seems weird to me that they eschewed the whole MySpace rivalry. I know you have to streamline a story, but that was such an important part of so many decisions and attitude that Facebook went through that it seem like a whitewash of history.<br/><br/>Though I have to admit David Fincher made a difficult subject interesting. If you focus too much on software concepts you will have a film full of jargon that is indecipherable to but a few. He kept this at a minimum with a few references here and there with, I think, only one mention of Perl and a few mentions of PHP. This is wrong in the portrayal because these individuals nomenclature would be esoteric (though still quite sarcastic, the amount of jokes I have heard on design patterns like a Singleton or basic concepts like hash maps could drive a person crazy), but I certainly would not dock the film for taking the high road. In fact because of this I really enjoyed the sardonic dialog. Also, the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, which would win an Oscar, is outstanding. Though anytime I hear Edvard Grieg's ""Hall of the Mountain King"" I always think of Fritz Lang's M.<br/><br/>I did have a suggestion for a name change -- drop the The."

It has got a brilliant script and dialogue, spectacular director, well acted group of young actors and though I can't really find the flaw in the movie there was something missing which kept this movie from being a classic.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Base on the true story of the man who created Facebook.com (the world largest social networking website).<br/><br/>I love the story and how everything has been arrange out in the great sequences. What really amazing was they managed to make movie with all talk so much fun from the beginning to the end. There is no dull moment in The Social Network. The movie is well pace and the script is absolutely brilliant. I love the story but I also think it is the thing that kept it from being a classic – the subject of the story is somehow to me not very ""deep"" (hard to say but I think that is the word I was looking for). Despite all the greatness the screenplay it's seem to lack depth and most character was all in the surface. I wish I could feel more. And also the fact that it was technology base movie, it will get dated sometime in the near future.<br/><br/>Love the casting of this movie – they all happen to look much smarter than their counterpart here than in real life. Anyway the actors play their part well and it fitted the movie perfectly, love the character The Winklevoss twin and Eduardo. You got to give credit to Mr. Fincher for casting Mr. Timberlake and turn him into an OK actor here. Now, that was a lot of work.<br/><br/>Who can question the ability of Mr. Fincher and his technique of movie making? This man seems to know what he is doing. Anyway what really standout in this movie is the editing and how they unfold and mix present with past in the movie really well without getting distracted. The score also fit the sequences well.<br/><br/>Final Words: I enjoy watching is movie through and through. Love the pace, the fact that they concentrated on friendship part rather than on the legal term. And I will definitely adding this to my DVD collection.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Not for everyone – but if you do enjoy well written fast pace drama, this might be for you.<br/><br/>Reason to Watch: Get the chance to see the life of the world youngest millionaire.<br/><br/>Reason Not to: Not Fincher best work.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)"

","Great movie, I just loved it.<br/><br/>Actually it inspired me to create my own unique local social network site for Gibraltar - GIBBOOK.COM. Launched just 3 months ago it already has over 750 members and working really well.<br/><br/>Who knows, I might be doing a movie of GibBook one day too ;-)<br/><br/>I really love the part where he runs from a friends gathering to his room just because he had an idea. Reminds me very much of myself, think of something and its gotta be done straight away - ""Don't leave for tomorrow what you can do today"".<br/><br/>The actors are really good too however, are they telling the real story of how Mark is? I guess that they have to make it more exciting and spice it up by bending the story a bit. Who cares, it worked well!"

","I went into this movie knowing only that it was about the creation of Facebook and was apparently incredible (I believe Rolling Stones rated it as the #1 movie of 2010, beating movies such as True Grit and The King's Speech.) That being said, I began it assuming that it was a good movie--for it's genre--but that it wouldn't be too interesting to me--being a biography (a genre which I am not a huge fan of.) I couldn't have been further from the truth.<br/><br/>Of course, it WAS a remarkable movie--but not just for its genre, but by any standard. It is probably the only movie I've seen that is astoundingly dialog heavy--so dialog heavy that other movies would capsize--but remains interesting and entertaining. Almost all the characters have at least half their dialog infused with some subtle sarcasm, but not so much that it keeps you from connecting emotionally with them. Rather, I feel it helps you relate to them more and makes them more real.<br/><br/>I have a special shout-out to co-stars Andrew Garfield and Jesse Eisenberg. Andrew Garfield does an amazing job as Eduardo Saverin, the co-founder of Facebook and former CFO. His character is easily the one I personally sympathized with the most, but it wasn't so over the top that it was all pity, no play. Rather, he was very believable as a nice, young man who faces a tragic, unfortunate hardship when he is blotted out of the Facebook company and his friendship with Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) disappears. I praise Garfield's talents and I can't wait to see him in ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" As for Jesse Eisenberg, I was almost just as astounded with his performance as I was with Andrew Garfield's. The only other movie of his that I have seen is Zombieland, but looking into his acting portfolio, it appeared to me that most of his movies appeared to be similar: very fun, but simplistic. That being said, I had previously feared that his career would be defined as a ""wannabe Michael Cerna."" This movie obliterated my fear of such a fate. His character, Mark Zuckerberg, creator of Facebook, is a socially awkward, heavily sarcastic Harvard undergraduate.<br/><br/>Now, I may have lost you at ""socially awkward,"" and you are questioning my logic, with the idea of this character being different for the actor and being socially awkward appearing to be extremely contradictory. But let me assure you, this is a completely different ""socially awkward"" character than what you may think. Unlike the socially awkward character he played in Zombieland, when I say ""socially awkward,"" I'm just putting it delicately. A better description would be ""an asshole who is so overwhelmed with his intelligence that he's terrible with casual conversation or courtesies,"" but I thought this would be rather harsh to say right off the bat.<br/><br/>Having said that, his character was still one you could sympathize with, but not one that is above reproach or one that can often second-guess morally and logically. In any case, I was blown away by how different Jesse Eisenberg was from how I expected it. When I watched The Social Network, I didn't see Jesse Eisenberg playing Mark Zuckerberg, I saw Mark Zuckerberg caught on tape. And for that, my hat's off to him.<br/><br/>As for the story, I would really say you'd have to see it for yourself to understand what makes it incredible. I will say this: the movie gives itself a reason to tell the story of Facebook's origins by flashing between Zuckerberg and all others involved being in his two different court cases--one against the Winklevoss brothers and one against Eduardo. I thought the concept was clever and gave the movie more of a purpose than just ""ever wonder how Facebook started? Well..."" All in all, The Social Network is well worth the time of any serious movie-watcher, and I know this critic will gladly watch it again in the future. I'll facebook you later!"
"Buddy-51","9","1","2","24 February 2011"," a movie of and for our times
","""The Social Network"" captures the zeitgeist of the moment better than any movie of recent times.<br/><br/>This Aaron Sorkin adaptation of the Ben Mezrich nonfiction novel, ""The Accidental Billionaires,"" purports to tell the story of Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook, who rose from simple Harvard student to become the youngest billionaire in the world. I say ""purports"" because clearly the movie takes certain liberties with many of the facts of the story (most egregiously, perhaps, the fact that Zuckerberg actually had a girlfriend during the time depicted here) and, thus, the movie isn't really all that valuable as a documentary account of the way things actually went down. What the movie does do incredibly well is to capture the mood of an era and to tell a compelling story for our times.<br/><br/>One of ""The Social Network's"" greatest strengths is its willingness to feature a protagonist who is not all that easy to like. As portrayed in the film, Zuckerberg is a brilliant, amoral, petulant, socially inept, overcompensating nerd who doesn't really care who he hurts on his way to the top. Yet, oddly, Zuckerberg seems to have no real yen for fame and fortune; indeed his initial impetus for creating Facebook seems to arise as much out of a desire to get back at his girlfriend for breaking up with him as to become rich and famous (those being mere ancillary benefits). Zuckerberg also spends much of his time trying to backstab those around him, including his best friend and roommate, Eduardo Severin, who is the initial source of funding for the project and who becomes the tale's ethical counterweight to the morally bankrupt Zuckerberg. But Zuckerberg is also eventually sued by the Winklevoss brothers, some fellow Harvard students, for allegedly appropriating their initial social-networking idea and making it his own. Zuckerberg's motive for being a first-class jerk seems to be jealousy born out of his inability to fit in with the ""jock"" class at the school. Yet, every attempt he makes at ingratiating himself with others – particularly women – only serves to reinforce the sociopathic nature of his personality.<br/><br/>Yet, there's something about Zuckerberg that keeps him from becoming entirely loathsome and that actually makes us identify with him to some extent. Perhaps, it's that very awkwardness - that inability to master or even understand the social codes by which relationships work - that makes Zuckerberg a more sympathetic figure than he perhaps deserves to be. As one of the characters late in the film says in assessing his character, ""You're not an a-hole, Mark; you're just trying so hard to be."" Or perhaps it's the subtlety and depth that Jesse Eisenberg brings to the role that results in that effect.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is like a fine Greek tragedy being played out in modern dress, except that Zuckerberg's ""fall"" occurs mainly in the realm of human relationships and fineness of character and not of fame, fortune or status (since Zuckerberg still seems to have all three still pretty much intact at this point). When, at the end, the creator of Facebook sits all alone at a laptop, having lost the one person who was ever really a true friend to him, and meekly asks permission to use the law office's computer, we see the tragic emptiness of a man who's sold his soul to the devil – if, indeed, he had a soul to sell in the first place. It is that ambiguity that lifts ""The Social Network"" above the traditional morality play and makes it speak directly to our time.<br/><br/>There is literally not a single performance – whether major or minor – in this film that is less than outstanding. In addition to Eisenberg, there is tremendous work from Andrew Garfield as Eduardo; the perpetually underrated Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, the crassly manipulative creator of Napster; and Armie Hammer as the Harvard rowing twins (lots of CGI here) who fall victim to Zuckerberg's conniving - and become surprisingly sympathetic figures as a result. There are also fine performances from Rashida Jones (""Parks and Recreation"") and David Selby (Quentin Collins from ""Dark Shadows"" for the really old-timers in the audience), among many others.<br/><br/>As director, David Fincher keeps the movie racing along at a breakneck pace while maintaining a complex balance between flashbacks and flash forwards that at no time become confusing for the audience. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have also composed a simple but haunting piano score that nicely underlines the seriousness of the piece. Fincher and Sorkin make every moment count, and the final confrontation between Zuckerberg and Eduardo - in which years of unspoken resentments suddenly erupt to the surface - is the most dramatically explosive scene I've seen in ages.<br/><br/>For all its topicality and relevance, ""The Social Network"" definitely seems more attuned to the down side of modern technology than the upside (see the recent populist uprisings in Egypt), highlighting how obsessive social networking can lead people to behave in ways that tear at the very fabric that holds society together. After all, in the old days, one could vent one's grievances against others in private and be done with it. Now, with the ability to do near-constant blogging, our hurtful words, petty tantrums and malicious actions can go out to a mass audience, ruin other people's reputations, then come back and bite us big time in the end. That's the lesson Zuckerberg is forced to learn all throughout the movie - and it is one we would all be wise to heed."
"walruspower60","9","1","2","22 February 2011"," A modern-day Citizen Kane.
","This movie is a modern-setting Citizen Kane or There Will Be Blood. All three films chronicle a genius who sap their humanity and friendship for power. And I believe the social network deserves to be among them.<br/><br/>This movie chronicles the sort-of true story of the founding of Facebook. Whether or not it's true I don't care. Anyways, the main character, Mark Zuckerberg, is a computer genius, and I suppose he could be called a nerd, but besides the fact that he is smart, he is not a nerd at all. He is very sure of himself, not nervous at all, and is powered by anger, a very un-nerd-like trait.<br/><br/>Anyways, some guys say Zuckerberg, stole their idea, they sue him, his best friend sues him, and that's basically it in the large scheme of things. What's really fascinating is this character's luring into the land of fame and riches above good friends, and it's consequences. All performances are top notch, and believe it or not Justin Timberlake's pretty cool."
"jeddjong","9","1","2","19 February 2011"," Man in the Net(work)
","When news that this film would be made was first released, the internet was aflutter - but mainly with skepticism. The names seemed solid enough - David Fincher as director, Aaron Sorkin as the scribe, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross scoring - but, understandably, everyone asked ""how would one make a movie about Facebook? Who's going to watch that?"" The thing is, ""The Social Network"" is not about Facebook. It's perhaps like saying ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was about the Ark of the Convenant. We all know ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was about Indiana Jones, Marion Ravenwood, Belloq, Thot...but less I digress, the genesis the success of this movie is in deciding the route to take.<br/><br/>The film is based upon the book ""The Accidental Billionaires"", by Ben Mezrich. Mezrich has had another of his books turned into a film before, and that film was the awful ""21"". That's the thing - when I heard of ""21"", I desperately wanted it to be something like ""The Social Network"" turned out to be.<br/><br/>Spurned by his ex-girlfriend (Rooney Mara), gifted but very unlikable Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) spitefully creates ""facemash"", a website to rate the appearance of the campus femmes. And so begins his roller-coaster journey to becoming Time magazine's 2010 Person of the Year and the youngest billionaire alive. His best friend Eduardo Saverin (Garfield), the affluent and influential twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Armie Hammer, Josh Pence as stand-in) and freewheeling and charismatic Napster founder Sean Parker all become chess pieces Zuckerberg plays – and pieces will fall off the board.<br/><br/>David Fincher is known for being able to spin engaging yarns that affect on a psychological level, and pull audiences along for the ride. ""The Social Network"" is no different. From the get-go, it's a kinetic, mile-a-minute experience, akin to watching a high-quality action film - only that there's not one explosion in ""The Social Network"". With a screenplay like Aaron Sorkin's, it doesn't need any at all.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is slick and a complete filmgoing experience - it feels like a great amount of effort was put into every aspect of production. Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield carry the film ably, natch, and have immediately become hot commodities in Hollywood - the former nominated for a Best Actor Oscar (up against the likes of Colin Firth and Jeff Bridges), the latter the new Spider-Man. Indeed, Garfield gave off a strong Peter Parker-type vibe, changing my early opinions about ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (after seeing that horrid costume).<br/><br/>Stylistically and aesthetically, the film is pretty much perfect, glamorous and sexy – Jeff Cronenwerth's cinematography is smooth and cool, the film fashioning itself as an exclusive inside look behind the scenes, giving us hoi polloi a peek at the dangerous and exciting underbelly of the Facebook machine. However, that's the thing – it looks too pretty to feel like it's based on a true story. Indeed, most of the film does feel like conjecture, but it doesn't matter because it tells a good story. ""The Social Network"" probably didn't set out to be a documentary anyway.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg's Mark Zuckerberg is actually one of the greatest screen villains of all time, in the company of the likes of Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, Heath Ledger's Joker, and Malcolm McDowell's Alex. When characters who display traits of Asperger's Syndrome feature in movies, they're usually very nice deep down, or quirky and odd but likable. Zuckerberg as portrayed here is anything but – ruthless, cold, incredibly intelligent and with barely a shred of sympathetic quality until the very end of the film.<br/><br/>The way the film presents it, the only true ""good guy"" swimming in the sea of sharks is Eduardo Saverin, as played by Garfield – probably because the real-life Saverin was the only member of the Facebook team who served as consultant to author Ben Mezrich. Still, Garfield is charming, real and puts his game face on to tackle the screenplay, and wins.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is strong, particularly Justin Timberlake's suave, self-assured turn as Napster founder Sean Parker. However, I do question the decision to have Armie Hammer portray both Winklevoss twins, his visage digitally pasted onto body double Josh Pence to achieve the effect. Sure the CGI looks almost flawless, but it does sometimes (blasphemous as it sounds) remind one of any of the awful Eddie Murphy comedies where he insists on playing both characters. Hammer is a decent actor, but try as he might he was unable to sell the idea of two separate characters who look and sound alike but are otherwise individuals.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin, master of the ""walk-and-talk"" genre as displayed in The West Wing, gives us a ""run-and-talk"" instead, his screenplay demonstrating incredibly brisk and astute pacing, throwing in the right amount of technobabble so we can tenuously believe the computer know-how that went into creating the website, and also developing compelling, complex characters that you just can't look away from.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film is much like a modern-day retelling of Mary Shelly's ""Frankenstein"" – of how a brilliant, misunderstood and possibly evil genius created a monster, a monster that escaped his control, granting him fame and fortune by way of invading the lives of 600 million people around the world – and for so effectively getting such a frightening reality to take strong roots in the minds of such a mass audience, The Social Network is exceedingly praiseworthy.<br/><br/>Jedd Jong"

","I went to see this in Mexico the last day of showing, which meant that i already knew lots of opinions and praises this film is getting.<br/><br/>Taking that into account, i really liked The social network. The story is not anything groundbreaking (and it being themed with facebook does not count as anything new, but a new and modern way to tell this kind of story, which made me feel it like a win for this film for how it was presented).<br/><br/>The acting was great to say the least. Jesse Eisenberg was more than good for me, and i liked his annoying role. Andrew Garfield was amazing, and not only because of his looks, but because he really does a splendid job, and it wouldn't be the first time. I did like Justin Timberlake, but i found nothing major there. And it was funny to see the Disney channel Asian girl on the film, considering i had no idea she was on it.<br/><br/>The pacing is good, but what really keeps the film going is the quirky and intelligent dialogue. If there is something this film deserves is the adapted screenplay. I was emerged from the dialogue in the film, and quite liked it. It was obvious how the story was turning out, but how it was presented with the lawsuits and real life experiences combined that made really glad to watch this film.<br/><br/>Congratulations Fincher, good job... again."

All I have to say is this: This is one of the greatest movie's I've seen.<br/><br/>Everything in this film was incredible. Even the cast was great. Jesse Eisenberg does an excellent job as the smart and mean Mark Zuckerberg. Andrew Garfield does a great job as Mark's friend, Eduardo.

","I'd like to give this at least an 8.5. Maybe one day IMDb will implement a system that allows decimals. Oh well.<br/><br/>Honestly I thought this movie would be underwhelming just because many of us know the gist of the story. I underestimated the creators and actors because this was a very well done film all around. <br/><br/>I'm all about court room dramas and internet culture separately and it's all blended well here. The actors are all pretty much unknown to me but I enjoyed just about everyone and no one was cliché or distracting. All were believable. The movie is never boring either so I appreciated the deliberate and consistent pace. Going back and forth from the evolution of the site to the law suits was done perfectly.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure why I really liked but didn't love it. There's virtually nothing wrong with it. Maybe it's just because Facebook is such a part of our culture nowadays that it seemed old hat before it even began. Not sure, but the movie succeeds on all fronts in my opinion. <br/><br/>Some people here don't seem to understand that this is based on real life. If the characters seem cold or boring to you that's just because their portrayals are based on people that exhibited that kind of personality. It's not about what you ""want"" out of a story, they're just showing you how past events unfolded. I don't want it twisted into a story that's only about two friends who split apart or something, I just want to hear the story as it is. So many reviews ask why it wasn't about this or that. The answer is because it's about what happened, not what you want to see. I thought this was obvious but apparently not."
"siderite","7","1","2","12 February 2011"," An average celebrity movie
","They did it all before, the movie about some famous person that lives his life in a somewhat higher state of existence than anybody else, yet has human problems and deals with them while the story of their great idea is being told. I've seen stuff like that made about Einstein and the only different thing is that it is based in a college environment and the celebrity is still alive and that everything has to be put on fast forward because it is happening with young cool people. They even have Justin Timberlake in it... eeaayy!<br/><br/>Now, is it a bad film? Not at all. It does what it is supposed to do. It brings the drama and the story together while conveying the feeling that anyone can do it, if they are focused enough. And that's the main push of the story: genius is different and you must allow for some issues and forget uncommon behaviour. Einstein was Jewish too and kind of an asshole, as well, but he was brilliant. You might think that I am making a leap comparing these two guys, but it is not me, it is the makers of the film that made the two media personnas as similar as to draw connection.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckenberg was a pretty pathetic human being, but that was the kind of thing that made him able to push away every distraction and devote his life to a purpose. Put this way, anything is easy to do, certainly easier than when you are also trying to have a life. He was also inspired by others and it shows in the film, which is the best part of the movie, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Bottom line: average film, obviously altered story for dramatic purpose, everything looking really fast because it just had to feel dynamic, but good production quality and good acting. A masterpiece it is not and I can see this film split into little scenes that then are montaged together in a Discovery Channel celebrity show. It does give food for thought, as it shows you have to start early and get there first, but also that for the same reasons, the vast majority of people could never do that."

The cast is great, with Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer, and Jesse Eisenberg standing out as the biggest and most important roles. The writing and dialogue are very sharp, and the cinematography, especially in the initial setting at Harvard, (though filming didn't happen on the actual Harvard campus, of course), is memorable.<br/><br/>David Fincher did a great job cultivating a believable, fascinating atmosphere from all the melodrama. If you're wondering what could be so interesting about a ""Facebook movie"", I recommend that you do yourself a favor and see for yourself. The Social Network is a movie that doesn't try to label its subjects as good or bad guys, and it doesn't attempt to be a documentary showing exactly what happened. It does, however, aim to entertain.

"Strider_1978","7","1","2","6 February 2011"," The Brilliant Bastards- with flaws
","Final edit- sorry IMDb.<br/><br/>For those interested in the plot, SN follows the birth of 'Facebook', it's pathway to what millions knows and use, and the lies, deceit, betrayal and exploitation which may fall into the category of 'business'.<br/><br/>There are three key drivers with SN. The director, none other than David Fincher 'Se7en'. Aaron Sorkin, writer 'The West Wing', and musician/artist Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Put these three together and what we have is one of the best looking - and sounding- pieces of cinema to date. From the first line of script we are pulled into an intellectual crossfire in the perfect ambiance of a nameless Harvard Club. A scene, which in fact sets the ball in motion for future events. Everything is in near perfect proportion, and this is the trend for most of the duration of the film. There are issues and weaknesses. Though enveloped in glorious, delicious cinematography that radiates class, even in the 'party scene' in Ivy League Harvard, the seams begin to burst about an hour into the film. The script carries the weight and compensates for the acting only so long. Fire three rapid lines at the camera and the ear, more so than the eye is acutely focused. The script diminishes as the plot thins out and despite how good certain actors look, they cannot be saved from sub-standard performances. Fincher, perhaps due to budget and or time constraints has not gained the most from his choice of actors, *or* maybe it is simply a younger target audience. Jesse Eisenberg is spot on, despite certain consistency issues. Andrew Garfield who seems to have received critical acclaim for his role as Edwardo Saverin comes across as a soft, yet loyal 'friend' with as much screen presence as a wet rag. ""I'll take you for everything!"" He exclaims.. only I don't quite believe him. Timberlake as Sean Parker makes his mark, but does nothing to inspire a raised brow. The overlooked star of this film, though perhaps not so is Rooney Mara, Eisenbergs scorned love interest. Mara delivers with emotional precision. In her brief screen time the steals her scenes. The rest serve their purpose, none are 'glowing'. The Social Network has a constant up-beat vibe, and this helps dig the short-comings out of the trench when actors with insufficient gravity fail to uphold some of the more awkward scenes. The film suffers from self-indulgence and a tendency to be over zealous, something that rears it's head towards the second and latter part. We know that 'Facebook' is becoming popular, perhaps a social phenomenon. Rather than sink to cheap gimmicks like a 'Facebook' sign on a drinks machine and Zuckerbergs personal 'Facebook' cup, the audience might have been best served with a newspaper or periodical covering the 'business' and its prosperity. Less is far more. Bruce Wayne is Gothams Millionaire playboy. Atop the skyscraper we see the family slogan- that is it.. that is all. All that said, Social Network is a delicious piece of cinema. Relatively solid, that carries with it an important message, not so much of friendship and betrayal, but how modern day society and social status can be and is paramount in the lives of many. 350 friends.. dude that's nothing. Nothing eh, well let's consider how many of those 'friends' want you as friends, or merely as a means to an end.<br/><br/>It can't go to the Oscars for me, it has the ingredients, but it is an entertaining speed ball romp and missing that essential inspired quality to qualify. It *does* stay with you, and as I type, I know that I will never see 'Facebook' the same way again. One connection connects us to many.<br/><br/>Worth watching, perhaps owning. There will certainly be more viewings for me."

","The Social Network - or ""The Facebook-movie"", is one of last year's biggest surprises. How exciting can a movie about a few guys creating a popular website be? Well, apparently, very! The movies isn't about Facebook, which probably saved it from being a really boring film. We just use Facebook, we don't need to know everything about creating it, because we probably wouldn't even understand it. It's about the people behind it and what happened to them. The irony of it all...<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg is the heart and soul of this film as Mark Zuckerberg. You have to love him, because he's the perfect nerdy college kid. Too smart, funny hair, talks way too fast and writes angry blog entries. And then you start to hate him, because his social skills are so bad that he doesn't even realize what he's doing to his friendship and to his life.<br/><br/>I would have given an Oscar nomination to Andrew Garfield. He was so powerful as Eduardo Saverin, Mark's best friend. He's the important support the film needs. He's a little funny and warm and the guy we all know. He was my favorite part of the film.<br/><br/>David Fincher is a great director. He really got the best performance from his actors and made a film that we wanted to see and we didn't get bored watching. The multiple takes were worth it, the result is an interesting and exciting film about the irony behind Facebook - Mark Zuckerberg brought the whole world together with his website and with it, he destroyed a couple of friendships.<br/><br/>I give it a 9/10. Would have gotten a 10 if they featured more Erica (Rooney Mara) she was way more interesting than Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake)"

I personally believed that this film has a huge chance at winning at least one Oscar this year. Either for best picture, best actor, or best supporting actor.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenburg was spectacular at portraying the genius and or just a crazy kid willing to do anything to do what he thinks is right.

The story itself is unbelievable because it shows you how FaceBook, came about, and shows how Mark Zuckerberg was what some people would say an evil genius, I personally believe that Mark was just a misunderstood kid who wanted to prove he was better and capable than anyone else in his field of expertise.<br/><br/>Although I did catch one mistake in the film, there was a reference to Snooki from the ""Jersey Shore"". The thing is the reference was made during the timeline in the movie which was at least either 2006 or 2007 at the point of the reference. 2006-2007 there wasn't even a thought of Jersey Shore because it wasn't created back then.

","When Mark Zuckerberg's friend Eduardo pointedly put forwards his point to Mr. Zuckerberg, while testifying for his claims of corporate embezzlement by Mr. Zuckerberg, that he was his only friend and that his facebook friend's list are worthless, you realize the time's that we live in; where each one of us has created a virtual world for ourselves to satisfy our social needs. We have an apparent friends list of over 200 to 400 friends, but fail to realize we are sitting in our room all alone. These are the fine intimate scenes and moments in the movie 'The Social Network ', that makes you feel that this has got something to do with how you lead your life is what makes this movie an iconic movie of the first decade of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Directed by the always underrated Mr. David Fincher of 'Fight Club', 'Seven', 'Zodiac' and 'The curious case of Benjamin Button'; this is the movie that should fetch him an Oscar and for everyone involved with this movie. The Social Network relives the story of the creation of a website and company, which defines this generation, from a college dorm room. The controversial natures of its creation notwithstanding, the movie without taking sides, tells the tale honestly and with great compose. The controversial co-founder of Facebook and the main protagonist character of the movie Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg, seems to have his own story to tell about friendship, which is ironic since he is more or less controlling the social lives of millions of people. As a Harvard under graduate student, Mark was on the sidelines of the Harvard's social scene, when he decides to do something substantial to get attention, after his girlfriend breaks up with him. His little website about comparing woman's face with each other draws lot of attention and a suspension; but also leads him to the Winklevoss twins who have an idea of a social networking site (exclusive for people with mailing ID of harward.edu). Till that step, things are smooth, but soon takes the turn to controversial, with each side having its own versions of the story of a time in their lives that would change social networking forever. As Mr. Zuckerberg went on to create the facebook along with his other roommates, he starts grabbing attention from girls who normally would ignore him. But as he expands his website to other colleges, the website grabs the attention of Napster founder and recently bankrupted Sean Parker, who takes facebook to a new level and isolates Mark from his best friend and co-founder of facebook Eduardo who is a business major and had made the early investments for the website. What we see in the movie is the side by side hearings of two lawsuits against Mr. Zuckerberg. One from the Winklevoss twins for stealing their 'idea' and another from Mark's former best friend Eduardo for deceitful dilution of Eduardo's business share in the company. The director pitches the story towards the audience without judgment against any individual.<br/><br/>The razor sharp dialogues of the screenplay are used to pull the audiences in the conversation between characters that are sometimes highly technical but thanks to writer Aaron Sorkin not out of reach of the general public. The great casting cannot be described in any more way, except giving a standout mention to Jesse Eisenberg who played Mark Zuckerberg. In times of heartbreaks he made a generation felt his angst and in times of defending himself he let the world sympathize, feel he was a cheat as well as admire his genius.<br/><br/>Speaking about how this generation felt about Mark Zuckerberg's portrayal in the film, it is very much felt it reflected something more to them than the older generation. His was a story of great entrepreneur success in this capitalist world. A socially viable invention that is of some need to all and still all what it is to him is a business, a commanding position that a generation craves to be at this age (and also to be the youngest billionaire in the world). That he treated women like farm animals (or the movie as a whole treated women like meat) meant nothing to the audience. He found success in this dog eat dog world and is sitting on top of the pile. His success made him friendless (at least in the movie) was not a matter of concern since last check his facebook page has 2,912,375 friends. And as in the final moments of the movie, as Mark sits in front of his laptop while sending a friend's request to a special long lost girl and as he sits through clicking the refresh button, waiting for a reply to the request; it defines a generation that is including Mark is waiting for one thing in society, acceptance."

","There was a great deal of hype about this movie. I was sucked in. I watched it last night. It was a good movie. However. I watched Black Swan earlier that day, and I think that both that movie and Inception were in a different league to The Social Network in terms of concept and execution. The film offered an engaging insight into the machinations of Facebook's launch and subsequent growth, supported by excellent performances from the cast of relative unknowns. I expected it to use that central story to focus on the tragedy of the split in the friendship between the two founders. It didn't and I'm not sure why. I think there was a lack of real emotion behind the slick facade of this movie. I might be in the minority, but I think it would be a travesty if The Social Network won best picture."

","OK, so I went into this movie thinking it was going to be some boring and self serving expose on some super-nerd's rise to top of the tech bubble. I thought for sure this film would either demonize him, or them, or everyone. Instead what we got looked like a pretty decent and realistic account of how this deal went down. No one was demonized  well except for maybe Sean Parker of Napster infamy. Every side was represented fairly via their own perceptions. The dialogue was fast-paced – sometimes hard to follow. Zuckerberg was played flawlessly with lightspeed razor sharp quips that left recipients in shock and awe. I went in thinking I would be bored out of my mind. I left completely satisfied that I had ridden that crazy train of Facebook to the top. And what a fun (and bumpy) ride it was. Two thumbs up!"

","Two people are sitting on a park bench, her head leans on his shoulder. She thinks he's cute and funny after he spent a week flicking her sweet nothings with his thumbs; she hides a screen under the counter at her workplace.<br/><br/>Neither of them have ever given a minute's thought to who invented the cell phone, but things are going to work out for them because of it. ""The Social Network"" is a movie about the inventors and the programmers, and the things that make them bother to program and invent.<br/><br/>Margaret Atwood put interesting words in the mouth of her protagonist in ""Oryx and Crake."" ""The male frog in mating season makes as much noise as it can. ... Small male frogs -- it's been documented -- discover if they position themselves in empty drainpipes, the pipe acts as a voice amplifier and the small frog appears much larger than it really is. So that's what art is for the artist, an empty drainpipe. An amplifier. A stab at getting laid."" Mark Zuckerberg, brilliantly played as a borderline Asperger's case by Jesse Eisenberg, is the very incarnation of this energy. His art is programming. He uses it to get back at the people - women - he feels have given him short shrift. He uses it to gain attention, and perhaps secretly hopes to be loved for it. His frustrations lead him to build the road that half a billion people travel along, on their way to each other. For him, it may be a dead end.<br/><br/>The movie gets everything right. The screenplay has been exalted in many words; I'll only say that if you enjoy hearing intelligent conversation, the first scene is all the encouragement you need. As a place where people could plausibly have these kinds of conversations in real life, Harvard is the perfect setting - and justice is finally done to an Ivy League school, after years of nerf visions like ""The Skulls."" The pacing of the movie is relentless - no slow second act, and a big exhale after two hours. Fincher's direction and cinematography are good because they're never not good, with the rowing race scene one of the most memorable and outstanding moments in a career that has included ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club."" Actors - fantastic. Score - wonderful.<br/><br/>You really should see this movie."
"nelsonlc1","8","1","2","23 January 2011"," The most praised movie of 2010. But is it deserving?
","When previews for ""The Social Network"" began running in theaters many people wrote this movie off as the ""facebook"" movie but it has now become one of the most acclaimed movies of the year, and perhaps the decade. This movie follows the young creators of facebook during their college years and throughout their invention's rise in popularity. The two largest roles would be Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, played by Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield respectively. Both of these young actors deliver outstanding performances, with Eisenberg easily putting in the best work of his career. Andrew Garfield is some-what of a new face in America, but this role is a wonderful way for our audiences to get to know him before he takes on being the new Spider-Man. The most surprising performance comes from Justin Timberlake, who has already shown he can survive in the music world but he seems to be turning into a rather promising actor. The real star of this movie would have to be the script written by Aaron Sorkin, with it's witty, speedy dialogue this movie seems to be in a whole different league than most other current films. Director David Fincher also puts forth his best work with this movie since ""Fight Club"" which came out nearly eleven years earlier. Although the movie is primarily about the creation of facebook that only begins to scratch the surface. It really provides a story of a person who is so determined to be known for something and will not stop at nothing to earn his recognition. It provides a good portrait of the current generation because we have the ability to create anything and post it on the internet to be seen by the world. This movie deals with the sacrifices Zuckerberg has to deal with in order to be seen."

","Have you ever had the feeling of being watched, not only by your best friend but your neighbor, long lost cousin, and the kid you randomly met last night? I have, and Facebook is the reason. Now don't get me wrong, I was ecstatic my freshman year in high school when I received the email informing me I had been invited to Facebook, well TheFacebook at the time. Away with Myspace and hello to endless clicking on the mouse for hours at a time. Facebook offers an inside look into your friends personal life, creating sensory overload if you use it too much. The majority of people, even my Grandma in Canada have Facebook and I found myself realizing I could not get away from it. I along with millions have to check Facebook every chance I get, and with technological advances it became easier and accessible through cell phones. What is it that makes a person so anxious when typing in their password to login, if it has't already been auto saved? I'll tell you what is it...it's that little red caption box under ""notifications"" informing you on wall post, photo comments and whatever it is that a friend did relating back to your account. Facebook creates an unspoken language for communicating through a software that understands you because of your interaction with the website. The Social Network leaves viewers feeling like one of the creators alongside Mark and his colleagues. The dramatic music, symbolism and excellent acting makes for a compelling plot. The movie gives you an inside look at the creation of a billionaire and his company. Can you even fathom $6.9 billion, that's Marks estimated net worth? The movie takes you through every detail of the creation of Facebook and the ridiculous lawsuits against the site. It shows how pathetic and greedy some are for the sake of money. The movie exposes how fast and popular the site became in a matter of months and the cleverness of one Harvard student. If anything one might be disappointed when the credits begin to roll because it's one of those movies you don't want to end. Although the movie has ended everyone watching is wondering the same thing, what's next for Facebook? and will it ever end? After watching The Social Network twice and being completely fascinated by Facebook, I decided to deactivate my Facebook account. I couldn't get away from it and watching the movie made me realize this. After six devoted years on the site I've decided to take a break from Facebook and see how interacting with friends is different because I'm not connected with them threw a website. This was an AWESOME movie and I recommend it to any who has a pulse and knows how to use a computer."
"bob-rutzel-1","7","1","2","22 January 2011"," Good Story and Informative
","This is the true story how Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) started FACEBOOK.<br/><br/>I wasn't going to review this movie because I am not a FACEBOOK user or fan and have no interest in having potentially hundreds of people knowing what I am doing or even asking me what I am doing , what my favorite color is etc. I couldn't handle that. <br/><br/>I have heard so much about how good this movie was that I caved. So here we are. Yes, FACEBOOK is a major force out there and it will be with us until the end of time, I suppose. I have been asked by family and friends to join. I write them in another email that I have no interest in FACEBOOK, TWEETERS, MY SPACE, whatever. One of the reasons is that hackers just love all of this and try to steal identities and I don't need that. The trick is not to put so much personal info on one of these sites.<br/><br/>Back to the movie. I also wanted to see if this movie would encourage me to join FACEBOOK. Will get back to you on that. <br/><br/>Back to the movie. Really, this time. The story about how FACEBOOK happened is quite good. We see how Zuckerberg kind of gets the idea from the Harvard Winklevoss twins, but expands on it big time to such a point the twins sue him. But, to be fair, Zuckerberg had already started a college-only FACEBOOK hacking into the university data base to obtain pictures of the women there and showing two at a time and asking which one is preferred.<br/><br/>Later, Zuckerberg runs into Sean Parker (Timberlake) who started NAPSTER and gives Zuckerberg contacts galore out in California. Parker also has a hand in ousting Co-Founder of FACEBOOK, Eduardo (Garfield) and Eduardo also sues Zuckerberg. So we see the lawyers around the big table taking depositions and the rest of the story is told in flashbacks. All done quite well.<br/><br/>There are some downsides. The Casting Director only chose people who could talk at super sonic speed and boy, did they ever ? No time for reflection, just yammer away, and boy, did they ever? One really had to pay attention not only because everyone talked at light speed, but also because the music was so loud so often it was difficult to hear what anyone was saying during the flashbacks and there were many. The music didn't need to be as loud as it was. Understand about parties and loudness, but we, in the audience (remember us?), were having difficulty following everything coming out of the very-fast talkers. Somehow we managed to figure it all out. We think. <br/><br/>It's a good story and is nominated for Best Picture, but I wouldn't go that far unless there will be a remake and the downsides above corrected. Honestly they were quite distracting. <br/><br/>But, I would nominate Justin Timberlake for Best Supporting Actor. He was the breath of fresh air in here. Jesse Eisenberg performed exceptionally well as he always does. The rest of the cast were right on as well. It was nice to see David Selby (TV show: Falcon Crest fame back in the day) again. He played one of the lawyers. <br/><br/>Now, if you want to know the outcomes of everything, you could ask a friend on FACEBOOK, or watch the movie. It is informative and quite entertaining. And, no, I still have no interest in it. <br/><br/>I am waiting for the movie about who started TWITTER and hope the same Casting Director won't be used. One can always hope. <br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes some soft stuff, but only one F-bomb by Timberlake."

","The movie, obviously, hit the spot. Facebook can't be any more popular than it is right now. OK, so here's what I liked about the movie. <br/><br/>1. It made me think. And maybe I should have stopped right there and there's no need for you to read any further. This reason alone is enough to watch the movie. <br/><br/>2. It's inspiring. As Mark Zuckerberg himself said in one of his interviews, he got hundreds of messages after the movie came out where people said they were inspired and wanted to start their own businesses or to create something new. And although he didn't seem very pleased with the movie, he still confirmed that was a good part about it. It inspired me too, well, not to start my own company or something but at least to try and write my first review for IMDb. And I've been thinking a long time about this. Now, what makes it inspiring? It's not only about the money a person can get if he/she is creative, talented and intelligent. (Besides, in the movie Mark Zuckerberg appears to be more interested in the idea and its development than the money he can get out of it). It's also about the dynamics of the movie, that makes it inspiring. Right from the start, there's this atmosphere of suspense and then we see the process and hear all those incomprehensible for many of us mathematical formulas and algorithms. And here is how the story line starts to unwind. And I followed it up to the last minute.<br/><br/>3. It raised my interest towards the creator of Facebook, towards his personality. I've never thought who stands behind this powerful social community. And you may ask why we should pay so much attention to this Zuckerberg? Well, 'cause we always pay attention to those people who influence the development of the society, who form the history. And we must admit the Internet and its biggest phenomena are now creating and changing our history, the world we're living in. And if Mark Zuckerberg was known in the United States through mass media he isn't well-known here, although we all use Facebook and its prototypes actively. <br/><br/>It seems I'm absolutely positive about the movie. Well, I'm sure you can find plenty of drawbacks in there, it all depends on how you see it and whether you're in the mood for that kind of movie. However, it's definitely worth watching because if you haven't seen it yet you'll definitely hear about it from one of your friends. In the end, it's all about connection and sharing."

","Brilliant! I loved the pacing, the music, the acting and more... definitely one of the year's best! <br/><br/>The dialogue and characters are unusual, fascinating, appealing... yet also somewhat repellent in their brilliance. We get a glimpse into the challenge of being a genius at the expense of social graces, but it's also that detachment from caring that provides some of the sharpest verbal comebacks. Stinging in their truthfulness, what normally might be left unsaid is a joy to see spoken with such disdain & conviction! <br/><br/>If you have any bit of entrepreneurial spirit, you will be inspired by this movie. It's invigorating to see the incredible potential of one brilliant idea mixed with timing and understanding it's growth mechanisms (so as not to ruin the potential). Also important is the underlying message that poor business decisions and dishonesty will most likely bite you in the butt. The bigger the business, the bigger the dogs chasing you!"
"dee.reid","10","1","2","17 January 2011"," ""You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies"" - Tagline for ""The Social Network""
","OK, by now everyone on planet Earth has heard about the social networking phenomenon that is Facebook, launched in 2004 by co-founder Mark Zuckerberg in his dorm room at Harvard University. By now, no doubt we've read the stories about how it came to be and how Zuckerberg has since become one of the youngest (if not the youngest) billionaires in the world. What we haven't seen, is a movie that highly dramatizes Facebook's founding for entertainment and educational purposes. So here is ""The Social Network.""<br/><br/>I have a Facebook account, let's just get that out there. Want to friend me? Send me an e-mail. How many people at IMDb don't have Facebook accounts? Come on, be honest; shoot me a private message and we'll talk about it. OK, back to the movie. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (working from Ben Mezrich's highly embellished novel ""The Accidental Billionaires"") have created an outstanding film, a film that masterfully captures an era, and the revolutionary young tech genius behind it all, as well as the friends and colleagues he either intentionally or unintentionally alienated as a result of Facebook's mammoth, unprecedented success.<br/><br/>The problem with movies that ""define a generation"" (like ""Rebel without a Cause,"" ""The Graduate,"" ""American Graffitti,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" etc.) is that they are very much products of that time. They capture what it was like at that time, in this case, the era of social networking. By that very fact alone, the picture will become dated some time down the line. ""The Social Network"" will undoubtedly be added to that list, as well as many more. But it's still fun to live in the moment.<br/><br/>It is suggested that in the film, which opens in 2003, Harvard University sophomore Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) may have created ""FaceMash,"" Facebook's early predecessor, because of a nasty break-up with his then-girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara), to get girls, and elevate his status on campus. The online traffic from FaceMash crashes part of Harvard's server, and he is put on six-month academic probation as a result. Nonetheless, others are impressed. He is thus recruited by wealthy seniors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (played by Armie Hammer and body-doubled by Josh Pence) and their business partner Divya Narenda (Max Minghella) to help create a social networking website for them as their programmer.<br/><br/>Now this is where things start to get sketchy. This inspires Zuckerberg to start his own social networking website called ""Thefacebook"" which will be exclusive to Harvard University students. Using the financing of his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and recruiting roommates Dustin Moskovitz (Joseph Mazzello) and Chris Hughes (Patrick Mapel), ""Thefacebook"" is soon up & running, and has gone beyond Harvard's borders to many other prestigious college campuses around the U.S. and quickly, around the world.<br/><br/>This doesn't impress the Winklevoss's and Narenda, who soon cry foul and allege that Zuckerberg stole their idea for a social networking website. Another wrinkle in the scheme of things is file-sharing website Napster co-founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), whose shady personal and professional exploits are well-known to anyone old enough to remember Napster (I certainly do!). He has soon worked his way into Zuckerberg and Saverin's inner-circle and is now giving them financial and marketing advice (and he eventually became Facebook's first president), which doesn't sit well with Eduardo since he views Parker as a threat - both to Facebook and his friendship with Zuckerberg. Intertwined with their rising success, is what happened afterward, with Zuckerberg giving depositions in two different lawsuits: one with the Winklevosses and the other with Eduardo.<br/><br/>The rest is history.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is a phenomenal film, a film that perfectly captures an era; thus my earlier assertion that it's a period piece that ""defined a generation,"" the Facebook generation. Also, even though Facebook's founding is a classic tale of unlikely success, as are most American success stories, ""The Social Network"" is not a purely American film. No, it's a universal film. Hence, Facebook's appeal to people all over the world (online membership only recently surpassed the 600 million user mark), at least, to people in those countries that will allow online access to it.<br/><br/>And not only that, Facebook has become a culture all on its own. You can't go anywhere online anymore without seeing a ""Like"" button connected to Facebook, or a link offering you the choice of posting a web page to your Facebook ""Wall."" Or you can't be in a college classroom (or high school classroom, for that matter), without watching others - or doing so yourself - logging into their Facebook accounts updating their statuses with witty lines like, ""In class, so bored!"" or ""I'd rather be stabbing myself in the eyeballs with a pair of rusty scissors than listen to his/her nagging voice go on and on!"" Facebook is also highly addictive. It's almost like a drug. Perhaps when you're first starting out, you just can't get enough of it. You're on it all day/night.<br/><br/>If anything, the success of ""The Social Network"" with both critics and at the box office (and more recently, the Golden Globes) has brought in more users who just want to see what all the hoopla is about. The film might as well have been a two-hour advertising campaign in that regard. Having been a Facebook user for three-and-a-half years now, I can see that this movie was an event movie in the making, and an event movie that lived up to the event it depicted and perfectly captured a slice of an era. You can say all you want about Zuckerberg and his back-room dealings in getting Facebook started (I just don't know the guy), but you can't deny its impact and this film's deserved success in showcasing a modern phenomenon that's likely to continue for a very long time. Facebook is Zuckerberg's baby and like any newborn, it's still just in its infancy.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Christian_Dimartino","10","1","2","16 January 2011"," One of the years best. Truly, a wonderful film.
","With the Oscars next month, i'm going to catch up on the award contenders that i've missed out on before the time being. The film that is definitely going to win Best picture is The Social network. The Social network is a flawless piece of work from director David Fincher, starring an indescribably talented young cast. I loved the film a lot, though i'm not sure if it deserves the award.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg portrays Mark Zuckerburg, Facebook's creator, to be an asshole. Which made me wonder if he really was, considering the fact that he donated billions to charity. Zuckerburg went on a date, the date went bad. So, this spawned the idea of a site where you get to rate girls that you go to school with.<br/><br/>From this, spawned the meeting with The Winklevoss twins, two billionaires from a different university. They gave him an idea, he went with it, and behind their backs, came up with something better. From this, Facebook was born. And his success grew, while his life fell apart.<br/><br/>The social network is brilliantly written by Aaron Sorkin, who wrote The West wing. It was hard dialogue to construct to. The performances from Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfelid especially, and Justin Timberlake, are all sensational. I was skeptical about Garfeild being Spider-man at first, but after seeing him here, i'm sure he'll be wonderful.<br/><br/>The film, quite frankly, is as addictive and great as Facebook itself. The second this film was over, I wanted to watch it again. It has a good replay value. Fincher's direction is also unique. He jumps around a lot. Or, it jumps around a lot. The film is unbelievably entertaining, and it makes you wonder. It made me wonder about Zuckerburg himself. Is he a generous person, or is a bad person? Well, from the last line in the film, it makes you wonder more.<br/><br/>I loved The Social network. I really did. I bought it without seeing it. I had that amount of faith. Don't get me wrong, I loved the film. But I don't quite think a film about Facebook compared to a film 10 years in the making about dreams deserves it. Inception is the years best movie, and well, is unlike anything you've ever seen. The social network, I know it will win, is nearly the years best. If it wins, I will understand, though not quite agree. I still love it though.<br/><br/>A"

","This film makes you think, but more than thinking about anything in particular, it makes you remember. Much like remembering your introduction to the website itself, you'll never forget watching this movie. I remember first hearing of the movie. I'm on another website, TheInternetMovieDatabase...drop the ""the,"" and I was where you are now. I was worried about the future of liberty in art, seeing that David Fincher was making another PG-13 movie.<br/><br/>I was ignorant. When I see Tarantino get caught by commercialism, I'll be back to talk, but not before I see why. Neither here nor there, some movies deserve bigger audiences.<br/><br/>Much like ""Pulp Fiction,"" the nonparallel storytelling is propelled by pages upon pages of dialog, and we eat it up. You're dropped onto the Harvard campus in ""The Thirsty Scholar,"" if that's the name of the place where we're placed, further more, into the brutal final moments of Zuckerberg's best human relationship in the movie. As brutal as it gets, you're paying attention, as if you're sitting with the couple amongst the noisy thirsty scholars.<br/><br/>When the noise fades out, an angry tone fades in, but under an almost childlike melody of only three notes. This is our main title, and our main theme. We'll hear it again, and then again, but it means something different each time. If you listened during that opening scene, then you're ready to pay attention. They introduce not only the idea of who Mark Zuckerberg is (at least the character)...but introduce the reason behind the idea Mark Zuckerberg gets...<br/><br/>The best scene is the second time we hear the sweet melody. ""Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?"" The questioner becomes a blur and the questionee is in focus. ""It's raining."" This is movie-making. At its finest. This is dialog. At its finest.<br/><br/>Also brought to our attention is Aaron Sorkin, the man behind The West Wing, and ""A Few Good Men,"" one of the most powerful plays you'll ever see. The power is fully on here. If only life could be so perfect as to have our daily conversations be dialog written by Sorkin.<br/><br/>For those of you not paying attention, you'll become aware of David Ficher. The man behind your two all-time favorite films, ""Fight Club,"" and ""Seven."" The two-disk special edition is worth more than what you pay for, especially if you bought the Blu-ray version on Amazon when it first came out. The second disk allows your eyes to be open behind the scenes in a very entertaining documentary, but even so, you'll be able to enjoy the movie again and again. I'd say its one you can easily watch over and over, like Siskel and Ebert said about ""Pulp Fiction,"" since the film isn't told in chronological order, just a logical order. It's as if you're watching the film for the first time, every time.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is the best film of 2010, and has been said to be the best film of the past decade. Its rare that we watch something perfect, but this movie is fireworks.<br/><br/>It's refreshing that we don't need bombs, explosions, violence, or gore to be entertained. Take a look at the previous year's best picture winner (The Hurt Locker). It had all the things I just mentioned, but they are honorable mentions when it comes to that one.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is not necessarily about Facebook, but it will last longer than the website does. You won't forget it."
"g-bodyl","10","1","2","15 January 2011"," Mesmerizing!
","The Social Network is worth all the hype. I expect it to do well at the Oscars. Even though the movie is all dialog, it sucks you in because the screenplay is well written by Aaron Sorkin. I liked this film a lot cause I can relate to some of the characters and of course I have my own facebook page.<br/><br/>This movie is pretty much about the creation of Facebook and the people behind it.<br/><br/>The acting is very good especially by Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield. Justin Timberlake isn't bad as most people expect him to be. The newcomer Rooney Mara captures you in the few scenes she has.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a perfect drama. This should win at the Oscars. I hope it does. I rate this film 10/10."

","About three years ago, Columbia Pictures released 21, a docudrama about a group of collage students who changed the face of the card game Blackjack. However, 21 was awarded with poor reviews and made 82 million in the U.S. So, why did I put a short review of 21 in my review of The Social Network? Well let me tell you this. The true story of 21 had white actors playing African Americans while The Social Network was true with the characters in real life. Yes I know that in both movies some have untrue facts (mostly 21), but This movie has more than 21. It's not just about the beginning of Facebook (and ConnectU), its also a tale of the Demons in life (greed, drugs, booze, and sex). Anyway, long story short, The Social Network is one of those good movies that doesn't want to go out and letting the bad movies come out. We need a film that's like this one, well acted, directed, and written. That makes The Social Network one of the greatest films of all time."
"cnitinb","8","1","2","15 January 2011"," A Fincher classic
","The social Network directed by David Fincher is the story behind the pillar of our social lives- Facebook. It claims to dramatize the 'events' that took place in developing 'facebook'. Mark Zukerberg(Eisenberg) , just after being dumped by his girlfriend and drunk ,defames her on his blog, he later creates facemash.com a portal to rate and compare university girls based on their looks. All this leads to a lot of flak from others and then an idea. The idea that will become the most used social networking platform, ever. But this 'idea' is built on with the help of the winklevoss twins(Hammer) and funded by his best friend Eduardo(Garfield). But a few years later we see Zukerberg at a court being sued by the Winklevoss brothers and Eduardo. The film is about the events that led to the case.<br/><br/>We all know this, the real Zukerberg claimed the film is almost entirely fiction while the makers claimed its entirely true and only 'dramatized'. This very difference of opinion made millions to want to watch this movie. But all that apart, 'the social network' is another Fincher classic. Fabulous performance from Eisenberg and Garfield , also Timberlake was surprisingly convincing as the cunning and suave entrepreneur-Sean parker. The perfect casting is the highlight of this movie and a great screenplay(by Aron Sorkin) complements it. The dialogues are smart yet they don't seem dramatic, the pace of the film never makes any moment of this two hour flick seem boring.<br/><br/>And so it really doesn't matter if its fiction or completely real, the events in 'the social network' is something you will remember often , when you 'add a friend' or 'like' a comment on facebook simply because a 25 billion dollar company that puts wheels' our social lives couldn't have been made for the silver screen in a better and classy way."

","The Social Network has achieved the almost impossible,a movie about the creation of a website should be boring but they not only made it interesting, they've made it thrilling.<br/><br/>This purportedly true story about Facebook is primarily a legal drama, mostly focusing on the dispute between Mark Zuckerberg and the other Harvard University students who claimed to have also been contributory in the social networking website's creation. After burning a few more bridges and pissing off his few remaining friends, Zuckerberg finds himself in a litigation nightmare. A script written by Aaron Sorkin, who has created some blisteringly sharp dialogue that will leave you hanging on every word spoken by the outstanding cast. Eisenberg is outstanding and presents the Facebook founder as a socially stunted savant, unable to relate to other people as anything other than a means to some other end, his misogynistic attitudes towards women a particular flaw.<br/><br/>The Social Network has a definite ""revenge of the nerds"" feel about it, with its oafish jocks, exaltation of hackers and nerd-groupies. The film is also an interesting product of the hyper-fast social world it has helped to create: a biopic about someone still alive and in his mid-20s and relating events that only happened a couple of years ago. Just how much of the story is really true is anyone's guess but it is certainly thought-provoking, and the brilliant script and Eisenberg's performance make it worth seeing in any case. One of the best films of 2010."

","David Fincher is a great director with his own trademarks. I think the fact that he is the director of the film was the most anticipated thing in the movie for me. And I didn't disappoint. Fincher again showed a great skill to keep that intension till the end. He uses several time differentials which may confuse viewers who are either a little dumb or are not paying their attention. However, it's not quite clear how can you not focus cause the story is enthralling. What I mean is that, you, who you read this, you probably have a facebook account, right? And I believe you are a bit interested in how a regular 20-year old student with a bright brain managed to create the second most visited website in the world. Well, you could get you answer in this movie.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest billionaire. When Bruno Mars sings that he wants to be a billionaire so bad, then Mark Zuckerberg actually has proved that even a young man can hit the absolute top.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","2","6 January 2011"," One of David Fincher's best
","""The Social Network"" was one of 2010's best reviewed films. It was considered one of the front-runners for that year's Best Picture Oscar but ended up losing to the more conventional (but not necessarily undeserving) ""The King's Speech"".<br/><br/>The film tells the story of the founding of the massively popular social networking site Facebook. At the outset, co-founders Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) & Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) are best friends but business soon comes between them. This results in legal action against Zuckerberg, who is also being sued for allegedly stealing the idea for Facebook from his would-be employers.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin's justifiably lauded script was adapted from Ben Meszrich's non-fiction book ""The Accidental Billionaires"". Sorkin's dialogue is impeccable but the source material's questionable accuracy could be a problem for some. There's little attempt to present multiple sides of the story and some of the plot points seem more like Hollywood fabrication (particularly the ending). That's not to say that the story isn't compelling but it may turn off some viewers with its selective, embellished viewpoint.<br/><br/>From an acting standpoint, the film contains a few standout performances. Jesse Eisenberg deftly delivers his character's intricate dialogue but, to me, Andrew Garfield gives the film's best performance in the role of the betrayed friend. Meanwhile, Justin Timberlake surprises with a colourful portrayal of Napster founder Sean Parker. Armie Hammer and Rooney Mara also stand out in supporting roles.<br/><br/>The ever-dependable David Fincher's direction is expertly handled and the film boasts attractive cinematography and crisp editing throughout. However, the film's strong suit in the technical arena may be the music, which was expertly handled by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross.<br/><br/>To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of this movie the first time I saw it. I got hung up on the script's veracity and it prevented me from appreciating some of the film's finer points. Now, I'm more forgiving of the liberties taken with the facts and I can see that the film's craftsmanship is nothing short of exquisite. In my opinion, ""The Social Network"" is a must-see and one of Fincher's best to date."
"scottshak_111","8","1","2","4 January 2011"," Didn't know Facebook had such an evil yet an intelligent brain as a back-end....
","Talk about social networking and one thing that pops up in our head first is none other than the famous site Facebook. Who on earth wouldn't be interested in knowing the story behind the famous social networking websites of all time. <br/><br/>So Mark Zuckerberg is officially awesome. I was glad that the movie was being directed by none other than Fincher. I was excited beyond limit when I discovered that it was a David Fincher project, the guy behind such amazing movies like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and my all time-favourite The Game. His previous mind-boggling movies surely speaks of his virtue. As a director David Fincher has taken some of the brilliant stories of all times and metamorphosed them into the finest flicks created ever in the history of movies and The Social network happens to be one of them. Albeit Mark Zuckerberg in reality wasn't at all approached for the project and wasn't entailed anyhow in the flick, the movie was manifested as a series of events as they occurred altogether with the assistance of Eduardo Saverin(in real life). Each event was put down to the flick with the assistance offered by Eduardo and Boy! the story of facebook is interesting, must I say. The evolution of how the ideas arose from Facemash to TheFacebook and eventually Facebook is really surprising and wonderful as well. The story began with Mark Zuckerberg's(Jesse Eisenberg's) girlfriend breaking up with him thus causing him to dirty-blog about her to soothe his agonized heart. Taking it too far he compares her face to every girl in the Harvard and thus develops a website named FaceMash which had the feature of comparing 'who's hotter' which eventually brought down Harvard's network. The creation of FaceMash in one night brought him in the eyes of the twin Winklevoss brethren Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (played by Armie Hammer well that barely seemed like a single character) and their business partner Divya Narendra(Max Minghella) who gave Mark an idea about a new project of theirs - Harvard Connection website asking him to be their programmer. The main story begins when Zuckerberg gets his head to build a website named theFacebook without caring to look back at the Winklevoss brothers and in the long run dumping his best friend Eduardo Savarin(convincingly played by Andrew Garfield) as well as Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) the co-founder of Napster. The character Eduardo Savarin is well portrayed by Garfield who brings in the real sensitive part of the flick. Justin Timberlake has become more of an actor now and he did his bit in the flick very convincingly. As Sean Parker he suggests Mark Zuckerberg to drop the 'the' from theFacebook which clearly expounds why the whole world knows the website by the name of Facebook alone. The plot is very intricate and full of surprises as you would see Zuckerberg playing around with his friends turning them into foes while Eduardo's geniality is well exploited in the flick by Mark. There are instances in the movie that clearly depicts how much dedicated Mark Zuckerberg was to his website with more than 10-14 hours of coding everyday while some showed him making fun of the jury and the Winklevoss brothers of their ignorance, while one hilarious moment showed him stunning a teacher by his answers in the midst of his departure from the classroom. The movie is simply awesome. I didn't find anything wrong with the movie and I hope to see David Fincher's next as soon as it gets released. I'd recommend everyone to just go for it."
"sddavis63","8","1","2","2 January 2011"," The Origins And Evolution Of Facebook
","As someone who is admittedly a fan of Facebook (although I'm certainly no addict - at least that's my story and I'm sticking to it and I'm going to post it as my Facebook status just so everyone knows!) - I have been looking forward to seeing this movie about the origins and early evolution of the most successful social networking site on the internet. It does not disappoint. It's a fast-paced (some might say frenetically paced in places) account of how Mark Zuckerberg became (as the movie notes in its closing captions) the youngest billionaire in the world by developing the site, and of the various relationships that were built and destroyed in the process.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg was absolutely convincing as Zuckerberg, who comes across in this as the stereotypical computer geek - he has a certain nerdy likability, but nevertheless has few social skills, few friends and an obsession with computer programming. Zuckerberg's basic personality - or at least what this movie wants us to think is his basic personality (I've never met the guy, so who knows if it's true) - is brilliantly brought out in a hilarious opening scene of Zuckerberg on a date with Erica. The date goes horribly wrong. Due to his social ineptness, Zuckerberg insults Erica without meaning to and without even realizing it, gets told to take a hike and then angrily goes back to his Harvard dorm, gets drunk and still proceeds to blog about the experience in terms quite insulting and embarrassing to Erica, while at the same time developing an immediately popular website that manages to insult a significant portion of the female population at Harvard. His work brings him to the attention of the Winklevoss brothers, who want to set up a social networking site for in house use at Harvard and enlist Zuckerberg to help them. The rest, as they say, is history, as Zuckerberg takes their idea and builds on it (without giving them any credit.)<br/><br/>Zuckerberg doesn't come across well in this. He's arrogant and egotistical - and yet at the same time there's admittedly a certain admirable quality to him. He's devoted, committed and totally unconcerned with money. But he also comes across as easily manipulated, falling in with Napster founder Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake) - who comes across far worse than Zuckerberg - who helps him build Facebook, but at the expense of his relationship with his friend (perhaps his only real friend) Eduardo Savarin (Andrew Garfield), who had been the co-founder of ""The Face Book,"" its only investor for a long time, the company's CFO and had devoted himself to trying to hustle advertising to generate revenue. If there's a truly sympathetic figure in this it's Savarin, who ends up being almost totally cut out of Facebook and escorted by guards out of the company's California offices.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around a couple of legal proceedings. Zuckerberg (obviously after Facebook has become a mega-success) is being sued by both the Winklevoss brothers and Savarin, and the story unfolds as testimony is offered in the respective cases. It's fascinating to watch, and for anyone with an interest in social networking or who is in any way connected to others via Facebook it has to be rated as a must-see movie."
"didi_beraldo","9","1","2","29 December 2010"," Nice movie
","I thought I was gonna watch another ridiculous blockbuster, but in fact, it was the opposite. The movie at its totality keeps a nice pace, it doesn't make you feel tired or willing to scream at some point ""That's it!"". Justin Timberlake is a good surprise I must admit. It is not an Academy Awards play, however, I've seen a lot of worse things . But Jesse Eisenberg is such a good actor that he doesn't need to make a huge effort to prove it. Softly, as the movie goes, he makes his character as big as the Mark Zuckenberg's bank account. By the way, Mark on this movie is seen as a genius, fast, non-sociable person, in other words, the villain. But is he? I don't think so. Andrew Garfield's character, Eduardo Saverin, the Brazilian Facebook co-founder, is kind of double-crossed by Mark (in Eduardo's point of view), but he knew that it might happen. The Winklevoss' twins are the really victims on this whole situation in my opinion. Their idea was completely stolen and, as we say in Brazil, it became Mark's golden chicken."
"priyantha-bandara","8","1","2","28 December 2010"," Who want's to know the Facebook?
","I can't recall seeing a modern Biopic which was so much talked about than 'The Social Network'. In this age where the contemporary community and media cannot live without the word FACEBOOK, it's always a pleasure and interesting to see how its creators have really made it. The picture full of Mark Zuckerberg and his life after 2003 is experienced not so quietly throughout the movie. The story telling is done via bouncing in between two law suits. Starting from the early days of Marks Harvard life up to where the Facebook hits a million subscribers, the events which occur are dramatically represented without making the viewer bored. Some dialogs slip away without giving a split second to comprehend due to the talking nature of Mark which sounds speedier than a F1 racing car. Coz of this maybe a second viewing is recommended. But the story is pretty neat and easy to digest. Specially as many of us already know what really went in the creation of Facebook.<br/><br/>The important fact is to the get the line between fact and fiction correct. Especially when it's based on true events and the key character is immensely influencing the society as we speak. So you movie gores better read a few articles once your done enjoying the movie. Movies are always pretty dramatic than real life so you may need to realize that one way or the other.<br/><br/>Cinematically 'The Social Network' is a good movie. You won't get bored and the story does not let you down. Its fast as I mentioned before so you might be left out from time to time but catching up is mandatory. Acting is wonderful. I believe Jesse Eisenberg have done justice to his character and hope that Mark Zuckerberg will agree on that. If not we have never seeing the real man and will end up engraving someone else's image on our mind.<br/><br/>Overall what started with an investment of $1000 and becomes $65 Billion worth within years in the plot doesn't sound like a bad movie at all. And that's Facebook."

"Jonny_Numb","6","1","2","26 November 2010"," Doesn't Fully Connect
","David Fincher has always been one of my favorite directors, a visual stylist unafraid of pushing boundaries or putting his full effort into controversial (and sometimes even grotesque) scripts. With the exception of ""Alien3,"" my affection for this auteur has maintained stable through the years; even more difficult, patience-testing, mainstream-leaning works like ""Zodiac"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" maintain a human solidity and warmth at their labyrinth cores. And hot on the trail of those mainstream-leaning works comes ""The Social Network,"" a film that has been hailed as capturing the Zeitgeist of our time (embodied in Mark Zuckerberg -- played here by Jesse Eisenberg -- the founder of Facebook); and while nobody ever said a Zeitgeist needed to be embraced by all, I found the coldness of the film overall to be its most notable (and most crippling) aspect. The film presents Zuckerberg as a motor-mouthed, self-absorbed, and socially inept college kid who, in a fit of anger over a girl who has just snubbed him, germinates the seed of Facebook over the course of a few drunken hours (the film will return to the theme of romantic/personal failure as the seed of vengeance-through-technology retribution more than once); the remainder of ""The Social Network"" criss-crosses between present day and flashback, chronicling the bridges Zuckerberg burned as quickly as they were built, and the wake of angry, ripped-off colleagues and contemporaries left in the dust as Facebook became the Internet's premier social networking site. While Aaron Sorkin's whip-cracking dialog all too often feels like a less endearing, less caustic version of Mamet-speak that is never as clever as it thinks it is, the real surprise of ""The Social Network"" is the utter conventionality of Fincher's direction. For a film as jam-packed with characters as this, we never feel especially close to anybody, and Zuckerberg (who is essayed with an admirable lack of grace, couth, and empathy by Eisenberg), who dominates the proceedings, is both loathsome and pathetic. Perhaps a second viewing will be more fulfilling, but for now, ""The Social Network"" is a rather unappetizing contemporary history lesson without much beyond its incendiary content to recommend it. Actually, it is worth viewing for the fantastic minimalist score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross."
"dave_wlogan","7","1","2","24 November 2010"," Not quite the movie of the year, but...
","This is the true story film of the year. The big problem with it is that the story is so good, it would be brilliant in any narrative medium. Personally the most cinematic elements of the film were the rowing race and the inter-cutting of the court cases. The former being superfluous to the film in many ways.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie only works great as a movie because of the acting, which is top class. Other than that I'd happily read the story in a book or see it as a play (probably the medium where it would seem it's most profound). There are standout scenes, but nothing struck me as anything exclusive to film. This is why I rate it a seven. The story and acting make the movie worth the watch."
"chaos-rampant","Null","1","2","18 November 2010"," Rags to riches story, but is someone's soul at stake here?
","Funny thing about The Social Network is that it started life as ""that Facebook movie"", even with Fincher's name attached almost anything that wasn't a string of facebook relationship statuses updated would seem like a knockout success, then people started pouring out of theaters in raving enthusiasm about how good it actually is, expectations were miraculously installed, and now I'm forced to write surreal things like ""that Facebook movie is not that good"". That Facebook movie is not that good! There's a scene early on that annoyed me. As a bunch of computer geeks huddle around a computer screen to find cool hackster ways to get back at girls for not giving them any, we see a busload of young college girls all dressed up to please unloaded at the doorstep of a very exclusive Harvard club. Once inside they dance on laps and strip and are excited to be pawed by spoiled rich kids. That's not to say either of the two parts of that scene don't happen in real life or shouldn't happen in a film, but the juxtaposition is jarring. It's almost like the film is saying those same girls deserve to be treated as pretty face fodder for online voting contests because they are sluts.<br/><br/>I had forgotten all the negative things I was hearing about ""that rowing scene"" until it came up on screen. What the hell was Fincher thinking? His visual style for the duration was so mute and perfunctory that when he decides to flex his muscles, like a recluse who hasn't talked to another human being for a week will speak in an awkward voice, the results are cringeworthy. I haven't scene more out-of-place mood killers since the time Pino Donaggio was scoring lame funky comic relieves for Brian DePalma in Carrie.<br/><br/>Which brings me to that style. I don't like Fincher's toilet-stain brown in anything but this is muted by another remove. The Social Network has all the visual imagination of a newspaper; which is not bad for it, because it's trying to be the newspaper. It's all fact and ""he said that and then I said that"", talky like a stageplay and I don't like talky films any more than I like the theatre, and even introduces a dual flashback structure that is more framing device because nothing meaningful happens within the flashbacks. I don't want to make claims for pure cinema because that would mean some kind of ""impure cinema"" exists as second-choice for those still apprenticing to reach a cinema of higher order, but I wish more of what goes on here was translated in visual means. Like the ""happy days are over"" metaphor of the shot of coming clouds casting a shadow over tall buildings.<br/><br/>I like these rags to riches stories to be Shakespearean, to end in tragic hopeless notes, to take me to heights as a means of plunging me to black depths of the soul from where a future can't be surmised. The Citizen Kane comparisons are not completely without merit, but CK ends with a panoramic shot of a huge warehouse filled with boxes of his things, memories of life ready to be carted away. Kane is not there but the loneliness of the image chills my bones. Zuckerberg is alone at the end of Fincher's movie, but he's alone at a business room, with a laptop, and an apprentice attorney offers to order something to eat for him. He's not spent and damned like Daniel Plainview, he f-cked up but he's only starting out. The final glimpse into the soul of a man who made it to the top and is alone there, is Zuckerberg refreshing a Facebook page. What I mean to say is that his damnation doesn't ring throughout eternity for me, I never feared for his soul. I can see an easy bright future ahead of this man who is young and rich and healthy, the fall is not deep enough and so the rise is equally irrelevant to me."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","19 November 2010"," The Facebook story, so far
","There should be no worries that this movie can't sell – there are currently 500 million Facebook users worldwide, a number that is predicted to double before long, to a billion. But what would these people think when they come out of the cinema? The general consensus is that the Facebook story is well told by David Fincher who has deftly rendered the somewhat convoluted events into a lucid, clearly-understood account which is at the same time completely mesmerizing. There are some who complain that this world-changing social phenomenon has been over-simplified. What I would suggest then is that for whatever they are looking for, these critics should go elsewhere, not to a movie.<br/><br/>Except for a few people in the establishment (attorneys, education and business leaders, petty royalties), the characters in the movie comprises the young generation, ably interpreted by a young cast (which I'll come to later). The hero is of course Mark Zuckerberg the creator of Facebook, as well as youngest billionaire ever. Two other key characters might well be his inner conscience and devil: Eduardo Saverin, long-time (and some say only) friend who as co-founder provided the first financing for the project; Sean Parker, flamboyant and world-wise creator of Napster who lures him away from Saverin into a sophisticated world of endless material temptation, but should also be credited for launching Facebook into the mega phenomenon it has become. Most importantly, he is instrumental to making Mark change its name from ""The Facebook"" to ""Facebook"", a contribution that should not be taken lightly.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that something like Facebook came into existence almost accidentally, as the movie shows (perhaps that's why some people criticise it for oversimplification). The opening scene must not be missed, for its brilliant entertainment value – in a noisy campus bar, Mark and girlfriend Erica (a fictitious character) engage in a scintillating (in a confrontational way) verbal banter, in which he seems to have confused arrogant logic one-upmanship with romantic overture. Out storms Erica and he seeks revenge in engineering a blog for rating campus women (source material obtained in dubious manner), giving him instant notoriety and fame, both. The other half of the inspiration comes from a pair of young, comical snob the Winklevoss twins who try to enlist his service in developing their ""The Harvard Connection"" elite social network. The movie never shows when exactly the idea clicks but it may well be the moment when Mark gives his cryptic reply, ""I'm in"". Facebook is born, at least in the electric circuit of Mark's brainwave.<br/><br/>What follows, as far as narrative style goes, is alternating scenes between a current court enquiry and flashbacks tracing the development of events in simple linear sequence. The separate but simultaneous law suits launched by Saverin and the Winklevoss twins against Mark are well known to the public, in essence if not in detail. Moving with a crisp pace that aptly fits the subject matter, the movie retraces the events with thriller-like, spellbinding momentum and intrigue, finishing with captions of the outcomes of the law suits that are also well known to the public: out-of-court settlement with the Winklevoss (by which time the cost was only a drop in the bucket for Mark) and the restoring of Saverin as co-founder of Facebook. Throughout the movie, there is a sense of the movie makers' tendency to avoid being judgmental. They recount the facts, depict the characters, but stay away from trying to unravel the rights and wrongs of their intriguing relationships. <br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg coolly brings to the screen a Mark Zuckerberg that is forever elusive to those in the audience who wants to really understand how he ticks. A quick, sly, geek – that, we know. But want really makes him tick and feeds his ambition? He seems almost immune to material temptations, including sex. There may be slight hints of an underdog wanting to get even with the snobbish elite. His sharp mental faculty is almost frightening while his interpersonal skill is close to non-existent. He seems ruthless at times but does not appear to be entirely heartless. Perhaps the best verdict comes from his attorney's calm, stoic assistant ""You are not an asshole Mark, but you are trying very hard to be one"". <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield delivers a sympathy-winning Eduardo Saverin who seems to be the only character in the entire ensemble that has a real conscience. With dashing charm and cocksure confidence Justin Timberlake gives Sean Parker the screen presence this character deserves. He doesn't quite come across as a villain – after all he is instrumental to giving Facebook its stunning success. Yes, he did not do this exactly out of altruistic motivations and he is often devious in his business manipulations, but what else is new?<br/><br/>This movie tends to stereotypes and marginalises women, as in Erica (played by Rooney Mara who is destined to attain ""Girl with a dragon tattoo"" fame through Hollywood's remake) and Christy, Saverin's campus girlfriend portrayed with energy and zest by Brenda Song.<br/><br/>The Facebook story is continuing in real life. Will there be enough material for a sequel? We have to wait and see."

","Let me establish this first: I am a recent college graduate. I have a Facebook account, but I only check it about once per week. Whether or not this put me at a disadvantage before watching this movie, I'm not sure.<br/><br/>Actually, it probably didn't, since this movie is not about how Facebook influences our social lives. It is only about its founders, and the controversy that surrounded its inception. The protagonist is Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a clearly socially-inadequate student who is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) after an argument where he corrects her speech one too many times. Angry, Zuckerberg goes on a drunken rant on his computer, creating a ""face mash"" where students can compare the ""hotness"" of different people. When he wakes up, he finds himself in trouble since his ""face mash"" crashed the Harvard system. But it also attracts the attention of some well-to-do student athletes (Arnie Hammer playing two roles, and Max Minghella), who want his help in creating a social networking system. A few days later, Zuckerberg hatches up a website, ""The Facebook"", with his friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). This is intended to be a social networking site. As usage spreads, Zuckerberg's former contacts accuse him of theft. His friendship with Eduardo also becomes strained, especially when a Napster head named Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) proposes ideas to make The Facebook bigger than ever.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is an ironic rise and fall tale, one of those ""Citizen Kane"" type of stories where the protagonist gains money and wealth because of a great idea, but loses his friends and humanity in the process. It certainly has the right actors for the job. Jesse Einsenberg is appropriately off-putting as Zuckerberg, showing a good mix of social ignorance balanced with over-intelligence. He's not afraid to portray him as a jerk. Andrew Garfield draws more sympathy as Eduardo, the friend who fears the path Zuckerberg is going. And Justin Timberlake gets to dominate many scenes as the manipulate Parker. Who knew the lead from N'Sync had a career as an actor ahead of him? <br/><br/>Just as with his earlier films, David Fincher takes a near-Kubrickian approach to the story. He stays emotionally distant from the characters while infusing a bit of his own style, from the sharp cinematography to the precise editing. You can tell he was being meticulous with the material. Likewise, writer Aaron Sorkin delivers a story about how a great idea in a flawed head can lead to some messy results.<br/><br/>I like this film as a story on the origin of Facebook, but I wouldn't call it the next ""Citizen Kane"" or say it's ""generation defining."" First off, if it was to represent a generation, then I think it would have addressed the issue of how so many people's social lives are being affected by socializing on the Internet. But the film does not go there. It sticks with only the origins of Facebook.<br/><br/>I also did not find Mark Zuckerberg to be a tragic hero like Charles Foster Kane. When watching ""Citizen Kane,"" I felt Orson Welles brought a great deal of complexity to the character, and when the ending shot came, I was heartbroken for his life. I felt no such sympathy for Zuckerberg. In part because of Fincher's emotional distance, Eisenberg's performance, and Sorkin's script, I perceived the guy as a jerk from the beginning. The sympathetic last five minutes did not match up with my previous view of him.<br/><br/>If the creators intended Zuckerberg to be ambiguous, I'm not sure they succeeded. When the last shot came, I felt it was a too obvious reference to the final shot of ""Citizen Kane."" Not only did I find Erica Albright too underdeveloped for her appearance at the end to pack a sudden punch, in the realm of great David Fincher supporting females, I don't find her as memorable as, say, Marla Singer from ""Fight Club.""<br/><br/>But that's probably more me responding to the claims that this is an ""instant classic."" Do I recommend ""The Social Network""? In short, yes. It's still a well-constructed and involving story, and I was always interested for its two hours. But I will only call it a good movie, not a great one."
"Shashiishere","7","1","2","18 November 2010"," smart film no doubt but definitely overrated
","It is a smart film no doubt but definitely overrated.<br/><br/>The director's earlier movie ""the fight club"" had generated so much hype and when I finally decided to see it, I was very disappointed that the whole issue was so allegoric to the point of aversion. This is definitely a better movie where you see some fine performances by the leads, some whacky dialogues, a non linear screenplay which adds thrill to the drama and doesn't let your attention waver till the end as you see the protagonist wait for acceptance desperately. The biggest strength of the movie is that it is a true story based on a novel which lingers on the back of your mind throughout and you decide to excuse the director of some minor glitches like use of too much Harvard and geek jargon, slightly undercooked characters of Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker. One character you could easily connect with is his only friend Eduardo played by Andrew Garfield. ""This is not a movie for everyone"" is supposed to be an excuse for the overrating but in that sense even Avatar or Inception were not for all. This may be a smart movie but cinema is much more than being a nerd like his girl friend tells Mark at the beginning of the film. Going with 3.5 stars out of 5 for David Fincher's The Social Network. A movie you don't want to miss especially if you have a facebook account."

","Though I think ""The Social Network"" is a blisteringly good film, I can see why it seems to have landed with a thud with audiences. I'm fascinated by David Fincher's filmmaking when he's at his best (this film, ""Zodiac""), but it wouldn't surprise me to find that others think his style is cold and clinical. He's obsessed with facts and details, and though ""The Social Network"" doesn't stint on things like characterizations and thematic richness, it's just as full of tiny details about computer code, business deals and legalese.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg is perfectly cast as Mark Zuckerberg, at least as Zuckerberg is portrayed in this film. Eisenberg is an inherently unlikable actor, in that condescending way common to pompous techies and bookish intellectuals. He's surrounded by a terrific cast, most notably Andrew Garfield, who plays his best friend and business partner and who later becomes one of his chief enemies when the beast that is Facebook is unleashed on the world. Fincher is a pro at building mood and atmosphere (I can't think of a more atmospheric film than ""Zodiac""), and most of ""The Social Network"" is infused with a sense of impending doom that would feel incongruous in the context of something as trivial as social networking if social networking had not become a force so strong as to change the entire profile (pun intended) of our culture.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"chrisjcousens","9","1","2","15 November 2010"," A masterfully understated modern saga.
","Firstly, I thoroughly enjoyed The Social Network. The acting is fantastic, the direction and score pleasantly understated, and the whole package wrapped up nicely as a biopic-cum-rise and fall saga. Special mention must go to Jesse Eisenberg for an absorbing performance that manages to make the most of Aaron Sorkin's lightning-fast script. The wicked humour of the early stages of the film mellows towards the end as we start to empathise with almost all of the characters.<br/><br/>So what's wrong with it? I found the film to be almost a little too quirky, a little twee. The characters of Zuckerberg, Parker and the Winklevi seem heightened, a little too exaggerated to be fully believable. Part of this is in the dialogue which is clever, but a little too perfect for characters who are all struggling to make themselves understood. Part of it is in the occasional flashes of artsy music and camera-work, as if Fincher is trying to distance the film from the Hollywood pantheon. Maybe it is because by the end of the film, I still wasn't really sure what the message was, or what the characters had learned.<br/><br/>But maybe that's the point. We may never understand what goes on inside Zuckerberg's head, but we are absorbed by watching how it plays out. The intelligence that sets him apart also keeps him apart, and his fierce individuality set up the emotional strain that follows. While it may not quite have rung true, The Social Network is a very good film, all the more interesting given that Facebook is still gaining followers and taking up more and more of our collective free time.<br/><br/>A final note: Justin Timberlake's decision to take up acting is the best career move since Joachim Phoenix decided to stop rapping. A very talented man."
"dfle3","10","1","2","10 November 2010"," Idiot savant
","Took a chance seeing this movie, as a film about the founder of Facebook didn't really sound that interesting. It's gotten good reviews though, so I took a punt watching it. A good thing too, as this is a great movie. Many times I found it laugh out loud funny. Some of the reviews that I had come across mentioned Justin Timberlake. Not into the top 40 music scene, so I was wondering about which person he played...and made a wrong provisional guess in the process. Timberlake does make a great entrance though.<br/><br/>What's it about? It's the story of Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg), a talented university student who studies computers/I.T. If you don't know the name (like me), you'd know of his most famous creation...the social network website ""Facebook"". It's this website which provides the drama for the movie. Who really claims ownership of it or the idea for it? We get to see the contenders via flashbacks, prompted by legal arguments between Zuckerberg's lawyers and those attempting to sue him for recognition for their contribution to the site/concept, namely the Winklevi and one time friend Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield).<br/><br/>What's to like about the movie? Even if the movie was intended be a demolition job on Zuckerberg (which I doubt), I like the way that you see enough of the context of events to even have sympathy for him or at least see where he was coming from when he does the things he does.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg gives a sterling performance as Zuckerberg. Only after seeing this movie did I see Eisenberg for real (in the final episode of ""The virtual revolution"", namely ""Homo interneticus?""...good docu series on the web...it's history and impact). Not sure that Eisenberg gives a mimicking performance, but that's not the point...if you want reality you'd read a scholarly article, right? In any case, I suppose Eisenberg would be a worthy winner of an Academy Award for Best Actor.<br/><br/>To my ""Idiot savant"" remark in the header...that's how Zuckerberg comes across to me. No doubt he is very knowledgeable and highly intelligent, but sheesh, his Emotional IQ is at ""idiot"" level. One illustration of that is in the opening sequence of the movie, where he is on a date with a student he likes (Erica Albright, played by Rooney Mara). In a way, this scene is the entire movie writ small...it's what the entire movie/life is all about, it's contended (""synedoche""...thanks to a movie by that name which I haven't seen, I now know about this word!). There's a 'cute' scene to end the movie...probably artistic licence taken there, but it bookends nicely with the opening scene.<br/><br/>Another example of Zuckerberg's idiocy...there's a perplexing scene where Zuckerberg does what Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake) tells him to do. Zuckerberg would have an IQ twice that of two people of average intelligence (presumably), but you can't help but think ""What the hell where you thinking?"". Not sure if that even was based on fact, but if it was, it paints Zuckerberg as someone who might just have jumped off a garage roof with a towel around his neck pretending to be Superman. It's that idiotic. Zuckerberg as a genius man child.<br/><br/>One thing about Eisenberg's portrayal is that he kind of struck me as a Hannibal Lecter type figure...I mean, it wouldn't have surprised me if Zuckerberg was in fact a psychopath about to embark on a rampage. I'd modify my initial impression of him now to ""idiot savant psycohpath man child""! Here's the savant part...Eisenberg's Zuckerberg is like a robot...he seems to pull out zingers out of nowhere...like he's computed the optimal bon mot for any given circumstance. These are laugh out loud funny at times (in a ""Humans are the funniest animals"" kind of way). Here's the weird thing...he comes out with this kind of stuff, but it seems like he doesn't get his own jokes. I don't know of anyone at all like that. Apart from Steven Wright. But he really is a robot. Who writes jokes for calendars. Back to Zuckerberg...he's metaphorically lobbing hand grenades left, right and centre, oblivious to the havoc he is causing, because his mind his multi-tasking, and his attention is always on something more important to him.<br/><br/>Finally, as far as the resolution goes...interesting. Since I'm not trained as a lawyer and you don't really hear this stuff in a legal manner, I have to admit a degree of surprise with the outcome, as far as the Winklevi are concerned (that amusing term is used by Zuckerberg in the movie). Even though the genius that is attibuted to Zuckerberg in the movie seems to rest on him knowing abstract geeky stuff, to me it seemed to rest on just thinking bigger than those around him. But the rationale for the outcome is suggested by the female lawyer at the end. The outcome for Eduardo Saverin is undisclosed, like in reality. I sort of get why Zuckerberg may have done what he did...as in striking a bad deal with him, perhaps. A more lawyerly account might have made me disregard that. I certainly hope that he surpassed the Winklevi...I'm not sure that they really deserved anything.<br/><br/>As a morality tale, this has some subtle shades of grey in it, which is what makes it a superior movie...I would have liked to have been on a jury to hear this case, but it neve got that far...and I'm Australian...so would have had to change my nationality to do so. Anyway...<br/><br/>If you like this movie, I also recommend: ""The pirates of Silicon Valley"". It's another fact based drama on I.T. legends. Saw it on TV some years ago. Bill Gates is covered. I found myself to have more sympathy for Zuckerberg than Gates, who doesn't seem to have the same aspersions cast on him in reality as Zuckerberg does in this movie. A pity."

","""Facebook"" - The ultimate social network which is a maniac all over the world has a history that is much more than just a story. David Fincher's take on this universal tale reveals the dark side of every human hidden in him that comes out to achieve success in life. 500 Million users and still counting... a huge number that doesn't come so easy and you can't even imagine so many characters when you decide to open your own social networking site. Here, we come to know that Facebook was not invented with the intention to make billions of dollars but as time flies, the mentality of ""being just popular"" changes to ""being very rich"". That's the story of every human who gets involved in socialism or business of which a perfect example is the great betrayal hidden in the story of the invention of 'Facebook'. So, you don't care a f**k if you are pronounced guilty for that.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg(Jesse Eisenberg), the student of Harvard University is a complete gizmo geek himself for whom programming is as easy as peeing. After breaking up with his girlfriend Erica Albright(Rooney Mara), in frustration he blogged rude things about her but the most of all, when hatred against girls rise in him, he comes up with an idea to create a website to rate the attractiveness of female. He hacks into the databases of Harvardvarious residence halls, downloads pictures and names of female students and, using an algorithm for ranking chess players supplied by his best friend Eduardo Saverin(Andrew Garfield), he creates in a few hours a website called ""FaceMash.com"", where students can rate girls by their hotness. Mark was punished for six months because of ""Facemash""'s humongous traffic that brought down the network of Harvard. But however, the fame of 'Facemash' drew attention of Cameron Winklevoss(Armie Hammer), Tyler Winklevoss(Josh Pence) & Divya Narendar(Max Minghella) that results Mark to be the programmer of the website owned by Winklevoss twins & their business partner, Divya.<br/><br/>Soon afterwards, Mark comes up with an Idea to make and exclusive social networking site, ""Thefacebook.com"" an approaches his friend Eduardo for economical help. Eduardo invests a thousand dollars on 'Thefacebook' to start it. Soon, Winklevoss twins hears of this and believe that Zuckerberg stole their idea to open 'Thefacebook'. Soon, 'Thefacebook' raises it's members and Sean Parker(Justin Timberlake), the founder of Napster joins the gang when 'Facebook('The' word was removed then) crew shifted them to California. But this vexed Eduardo. Soon, situations were solo handled by Sean himself and which resulted to conflict between Mark, the creator and programmer of 'Facebook' and Eduardo, The CFO of 'Facebook'. Dancing like a puppet of Sean, Mark cheated his most best and loyal friend Eduardo and later that night, Parker, along with a number of Facebook interns, was arrested for possession of cocaine during a party thrown on the occasion of Facebook's 1 millionth member. All of this resulted to a massacre when The Winklevoss twins and their business partner Divya along with Eduardo sued Mark for cheating(with Eduardo) and stealing Idea(of The Winklevoss twins).<br/><br/>Credits mostly go to a indomitable screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. Even the film is based on the book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" written by Ben Mezrich, Aaron puts up a beautifully composed and well-equipped script where smart & fresh dialogues are the icing on the cake. Music by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross also are commendable because situationally, the songs were a perfect choice(especially, ""Baby, you're a Rich Man"" at the end of the movie was a tremendous song). Cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth was also stylish especially when he had caught the The Winklevoss twins rowing in the lake or The beautiful sights of Harvard.<br/><br/>Jeesie Eisenberg, the well known face from Zombieland(2009) was promising in the role of Mark and his smartness and attitudes in the character were proprietor of applause. It can be said, he stole the eyeballs alone. Rooney Mara was very short but inspite of being short, those moments had only 'Roonie' written on them. Andrew Garfiled was tremendous at a word for his vibrant & undramatic performance. Justin Timberlake who was 'Sean' and the only negative figure in the plot was witty and sufficient and it could be easily said that even his role was not so important, he didn't made us feel that. Others like Armie Hamme(Cameron Winklevoss), Josh Pence(Tyler Winklevoss), Max Minghella(Divya Narendra) were good but not commendable.<br/><br/>Sensitive & sober direction by David Fincher was another constituent that needs to be mentioned mostly. Adding life to a non-fictional story behind the invention of ""Facebook"" wouldn't have been such a simple job but with a super casting and severely talented crew, he made that possible. Giving super films like Fight Club(1999) & Oscar winner The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button(2008), he has relived the magic of controversial movies by ""The Social Network"" which surely needs excessive achievements.<br/><br/>Don't miss this 'Facebook' film at any cost not because it's related with the effects of 'Social Networking' in our social life but because it also inspires the fact where Money changes 'Loyalty' to 'Greed' and later 'Betrayal'. One of the greatest betrayals of all time, stands somewhere in the land of Harvard. Watch ""The Social Network"" to experience the changes in a human after fame binds him and try to find a heart behind the screen. This one's one of the greatest deliverances ever. Don't miss it."
"Eumenides_0","8","1","2","14 November 2010"," The Social Network That Ruined A Friendship
","The irony of the creation of Facebook, the social network that brings people together, is that it destroyed a great friendship. At least that's the way David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin tell the story of Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, the two friends that started Facebook. As the famous social network comes to life their friendship deteriorates until it becomes a lawsuit. It is this dramatic situation that makes up most of the movie and it's why The Social Network is one of the finest movies of 2010.<br/><br/>The movie starts at Harvard, in 2003, as Mark (Jesse Eisenberg) is breaking up with his girlfriend, Erica (Rooney Mara) because of his aloofness and inability to realise when he's hurting peoples' feelings. It's a fast-paced scene, exciting and a preview of the whole movie: Mark has a serious deficit of social skills and will drive his loved ones away.<br/><br/>Then we jump into an exciting montage which, amidst booze, daydreaming and revenge blogging, shows Mark inventing Facebook's ancestor, the puerile Facemash, which allows users to rate the hotness of college students. Mark invents what will become Facebook after getting dumped by a girl and trying to get some revenge on the entire female species (keep track of the ironies, the movie is full of them).<br/><br/>The success of Facemash leads the brothers Winklevoss (Mike Hammer and Josh Pence) and Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) to invite Mark to create HarvardConnection for them, a social network exclusive to Harvard students. The premise is that chicks just love Harvard men. Mark accepts but then gets a better idea and, with the financial support of his friend Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), starts working on Facebook instead, while keeping the Winklevoss thinking he's still working for them, a mistake he'll literally have to pay for later.<br/><br/>The movie shifts back and forth in time, in one of the best editing works of the year, seamlessly weaving two lawsuits and Mark and Eduardo's past story together in an exciting narrative. One is the lawsuit the Winklevoss file for intellectual property theft, and the other is by Eduardo, for being cut out of the business he helped create. Bit by bit all the events leading up to this fall into place until they form an incredible story about friendship, ambition, greed, backstabbing and loneliness.<br/><br/>There are three great things going for this movie: first of all, the casting. It's a pleasure to see so many fresh faces on the screen. Most of the actors involved haven't had great roles yet. But like the characters they play, I think they'll become successful overnight.<br/><br/>Secondly, the actors are very good. Eisenberg, Mara, Hammer, Minghella. Justin Timberlake surprises in his performance as Sean Parker, the infamous creator of Napster. And Andrew Garfield steals every scene he's in.<br/><br/>Eisernberg delivers a fine performance, walking the tight line between a deliberate moron and a clueless egotist. He portrays so well Mark's ability to hurt peoples' feelings without realizing it, that could almost believe Eisenberg is just like that in real life.<br/><br/>Timberlake plays a man with a chip on his shoulder, a drug-addling paranoid entrepreneur who must be the center of all attention, a man who is, as Eduardo so aptly puts it, cooler than a million dollars. Smooth talking, friendly, he's also a self-destructive lunatic who coaches Mark in the cynical world of businessmen and uses him to boost his own ego.<br/><br/>Garfield plays a man with his feet firmly grounded on the world. He's a businessman. He invests money and expects profit. He wants to monetize Facebook. Mark doesn't. In comes Sean Parker who says just what Mark wants to hear and proceeds to turn him against Eduardo. Eduardo represents everything Sean hates, the businessmen who screwed him in previous businesses. Eduardo is slow to realize that he's becoming isolated. But his response is amazing. ""You best friend is suing you for 600 million dollars"" must be one of the best lines of the year.<br/><br/>Finally there's Aaron Sorkin's dialogue. Sorkin is one of the best screenwriters alive, even if he doesn't write much for movies. Watching Charlie Wilson's War in cinema seems like something that happened a long time ago in my memory. But it's worth the wait. Sorkin has the monopoly on fast-paced, witty dialogue. All his characters speak in a vibrant, clever, entertaining, endlessly quotable way, while retaining their individuality.<br/><br/>There's not much to say about David Fincher's directing, except that I never felt I was watching a David Fincher movie. He's directed a lot better and he can direct a lot better. It was a long time ago when I watched Se7en and fell in love with cinema. That was a visually beautiful movie. The Social Network merely gets the job done. Except for some neat montages, there's nothing really spectacular about the visuals of the film. Fincher shoots every scene in the easiest and most predictable way possible, as if he's anxious to wrap things up and move on to Stieg Larsson's adaptation, which hopefully will look like a proper Fincher movie.<br/><br/>Trent Reznor's awful electronic music doesn't do the movie any favors either. Every time I had to endure more noise from Reznor's ugly synthesizers I remembered the lovely version of Radiohead's 'Creep' played in the trailer. It's not good when trailer music is more exciting than a film score. But that's sadly becoming a trend.<br/><br/>All in all, The Social Network is a very watchable character drama about the destruction of a friendship disguised as a biopic. I say disguised because of all the liberties taken with the facts. That's probably for the best. How exciting could the truth about the invention of a social network be new anyway?"

"zofos","8","1","2","10 November 2010"," ""Every Creation Myth Needs A Devil""
","Firstly may I say that I am not, nor have I ever been a member of Facebook. And, after seeing the ruthless, cutthroat way the website was set up by Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), I have no inclination to join it at any time in the future (if only to stop job interviewers and the Taxman spying on me to see if I'm telling the truth.) <br/><br/>The above quote about every creation myth needing a Devil sums up the movie. You could argue that Zuckerberg is the Lucifer who wants to take over Eduardo Saverin's Heaven (played by Anthony Perkins lookalike Andrew Garfield), the difference being that it's God (Saverin) who gets cast out of the kingdom, not Zuckerberg. Enter Napster creator Shawn Fanning (Justin Timberlake) and the movie then becomes a retelling of the Faust legend with Zuckerberg being completely seduced by Fanning's promises of wealth and power but he must sacrifice friendship to achieve it. (If you ever wanted proof that Nice Guys Finish Last, just see Eduardo Saverin here.) Jesse Eisenberg has been typecast as nerds in his career so far (e.g. Zombieland), but he's never played one as well as he does here and such a complex one at that. I don't know the real Mark Zuckerberg, but he is portrayed here as an undoubtedly talented computer programmer/hacker (A genius? Who knows, maybe.) He certainly has a ferocious focus, confidence and drive for such a young man. He is also two-faced, arrogant and completely unreliable. Essentially, Zuckerberg's character boils down to him being a hyper-sensitive, vengeful nerd with a chip on his shoulder, endlessly trying to get one over on the people he views as superior to him, even if they want to help him.<br/><br/>I've never really understood the appeal of Justin Timberlake to women. I've always thought he was a rather plain-looking guy who tried too hard to act black and was really only famous for having once dated Britney Spears. But if he's half as devilishly charming in real life as he is in this movie, I can see why he's catnip to the ladies (his millions don't hurt either, right). Timberlake was a leftfield casting choice by director David Fincher that pays off brilliantly.<br/><br/>The women in the movie are treated like cattle, but then again so are the men who get stepped on by Zuckerberg and Fanning as they rise to power. (I had no idea that Asian women were such a commodity among the rich).<br/><br/>The script is by Aaron Sorkin, a writer who's been around for a long time. He wrote A Few Good Men as far back as 1992 and The West Wing, but this is far and away the best thing he's ever written and he's sure to get an Oscar nomination for his work, if not win the coveted statuette outright. The movie has parallels with Citizen Kane and Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (when the girl in the opening scenes accuses Zuckerberg of having OCD, the parallels with that other young American billionaire Howard Hughes are made clear).<br/><br/>It's hard to break new ground when you've been a movie director for 18 years, but David Fincher has managed to do that here. You can't compare it to anything he's done before. He could well be an Oscar contender too."
"Likes_Ninjas90","9","1","2","10 November 2010"," Unmissable cinema, best enjoyed through repeated viewings
","It takes two viewings to appreciate the subtly of David Fincher's work in The Social Network. Initially, the film may leave audiences cold because of how repelling Zuckerberg's arrogance and his treatment of other people becomes. A repeated viewing reveals the sophistication of Aaron Sorkin's screenplay, which was adapted from Ben Mezrich's book ""The Accidental Billionaires"". It raises the timeless moral question of whether one can steal an idea that is not fully tangible. The wittiness of the dialogue and the depth of the characterisation feel more apparent too. Zuckerberg's arrogance is not simply deplorable but painfully funny and ironic when we see how it leads to the demise of his only friendship. This is the heart of the film, the disintegration of his relationship with Eduardo. On a second viewing Zuckerberg's jealously through slight gazes, once easily missed, become more visible. This lends the film a tragic quality because we realise that Zuckerberg has foolishly sacrificed his real relations for acceptance that might be only temporary. Early on we see the juxtaposition between him insulting Erica online and then the inside of a Harvard club that he blindly believes will provide him with a better life. In this moment of ugliness drugs, alcohol and women are disposed of as quickly as they can be provided. There is a thoroughly unapologetic view of Harvard's social scene in this film. Fincher film's this sequence and many others with elegance though. His films are usually stylised by hyper kinetic visuals, he has a background in music videos after all, but here he returns to a more classical style of filmmaking that is beautiful in its simplicity. <br/><br/>The young ensemble cast here are all splendid and three of the main actors are near certainties for Oscar nominations. Jesse Eisenberg was underrated in The Squid and the Whale but as Zuckerberg he's unforgettable. To exude Zuckerberg's coldness, he deftly drops hurtful comments in a nonchalant manner, reflecting his character's utter lack of compassion. His delivery is faultless. We really do start to believe that Zuckerberg lives in his own virtual world. There is also a real nastiness that comes through the performance too, spiteful anger, particularly in dealing with the twins, again suggesting ideas of jealousy and the class divisions of Harvard too. Andrew Garfield leaves a lasting impression as the increasingly distressed Edwardo too. His character brings some sensibility to the madness. He's more skeptical and thoughtful than Zuckberg and regularly acts like his conscience, trying to talk sense into him. The climax of their friendship is a particular stirring finale. There is no shortage of charisma in Justin Timberlake's fine work either. He's wonderfully convincing as the shonky Sean Parker, so smooth and confident that there is little doubt about why Zuckerberg takes to him. The way that he is framed with a different woman in each scene reinforces the notion of many of these characters being after 'the next big thing', trusting only their impulses. <br/><br/>The Social Network is perhaps the most accomplished film of David Fincher's career. In just two hours it inspires timeless ideas relating to originality, conformity and because of our reliance on technology, the constant search for renewal in our lives. There is also a distinct human quality here too though and the film is rich in its visualisation of the breakdown of a friendship. A handful of class performances deliver their sometimes cruel but often funny dialogue with aplomb. Even for those who are not the least bit interested in the webpage Facebook this is unmissable cinema, best enjoyed through repeated viewings."
"ssahmed85","9","1","2","9 November 2010"," Mark-ing's on the Wall
","What do you call a film that evokes such a strong emotion about a real personality? A living, breathing personality. What do you do when for almost 115 minutes you have been lead to believe that what you are watching has probably happened? What do you do when you want to really act on your emotions? Is it still fiction? Is it naivety to believe in what you have just seen? I don't know, because all of the above are questions that I would like to get answers for.<br/><br/>As Mark Zuckerberg said. ""I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive"", he probably knew that once you see a film, it's easier to believe in it than when you read a book. Although The Accidental Billionaires was already written, it never created such an effect on people. The film is based on the book and even though the book's publicist admits it to be ""big juicy fun"", I dare say the film does more damage than what the author would have even hoped for with his book. Don't buy it? Read any book you have read about Adolf Hitler and Mahatma Gandhi and then see the films made on their lives. If Hitler had to watch Inglorious Basterds in his lifetime, he would have killed himself, oh wait, except he already did. To call Social Network a film would be an understatement, it is a chronicle. A chronicle of a man's journey into what he needs to do to become ""the man"". There is a word that can give a hint on this subject, which is repeated both in the beginning and the end. Asshole. A man needs to become an asshole to become ""the man"" and the only proof to all of the doubtful facts about Mr. Zuckerberg is that he has become ""the man"". Some people admit it, some don't. Take a leaf out of Steve Jobs' book Mark and you won't feel this ashamed of yourself, I promise. Hell, I'd take it as a compliment.<br/><br/>For about 115 minutes of the film I wanted to do one thing - go home and delete my Facebook profile. Then, in the last 5 minutes, as if Fincher wanted to let Zuckerberg off the hook, he made me think twice. I didn't want to be a part of the 500 million people whose privacy Zuckerberg has control over. I went home and just to give Facebook another shot I read a little. I found out that Google Trends shows that over the last year about 35 million people have been interested in pulling out. Now, I'm not saying this is because of the film, but this is because of Facebook. Some of us have discovered the follies. I have seen Fincher do this before (playing with my head in the last 5 minutes), he did this in Zodiac too. Just like Zodiac, Fincher makes you believe and that is the only word I'd like to use for this film - Believe.<br/><br/>Now on to the elements, boy this one's tough. Again, how does one distinguish the parts once you have believed the whole and forgotten everything else. The analogy of the four blind men comes to mind, except here there is a fifth one who can see and has seen the elephant and the elephant is a mighty beautiful animal. To say that the trunk was long and the ears were wide would be stating the obvious. All the parts do their job to the core and to the best of their abilities. Jesse Eisenberg captures the screen as the eccentric, megalomaniac, delusional and narcissistic Facebook ""founder"". Even after watching Jesse in a diametrically opposite role (Zombieland), I wanted to break his neck. I still love you Jesse. The Winklevoss Twins played by, well, played by one man, Armie Hammer, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake all do their jobs well, not a feather here or there. Yes, Justin Timberlake, he is not new to acting, watch Alpha Dog if you really want to be impressed. I might not listen to his songs, but I would pay to watch him act, anytime. Enough said. Coming down to the usual suspects - Cinematography and Editing. The film did not look beautiful, it did not capture my imagination, it did not make me look at the frame . And that's more than what I can say about any good film I have seen. The film feels real because the cinematography is real. No need for beauty here. Sometimes when you look at the beautiful frames you forget what you were watching. Unlike Zodiac, this film moved, I mean it really moved. The pace of the film is set from the opening scene itself. Just like its character, if you miss one minute, too much would have gone by. Again the editing never brought any attention to itself. The narrative which is woven in flashbacks and the present has been interestingly conceived, which I don't think can happen on the table. Nonetheless, effective, very effective.<br/><br/>Social Network is not a contemporary film (and thank god for that), it doesn't have any in/out zooms or jump/jerk cuts, its a classic film. This is why Fincher's film-making is not limited to any genre. If I have one complaint, there is only one, is that the end looks like it was all for the girl. I for one could not digest it. Who knows? It might have been. It could have also been for the elite final clubs. On second thoughts, I understand why Mark had to be Mark. When you really want to achieve something and you know you are capable, you might need to do a few things wrong. Not everyone can do it and hence, not everyone is a Mark Zuckerberg.<br/><br/>""You either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain"" I haven't deleted my Facebook account. Not yet."
"jonnyfendi","8","1","2","8 November 2010"," Controversy Makes Things Attractive
","""I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was alive"", Mark Zuckerberg has ever said so. But it is unbearable, they made it anyway. The next question will be who on earth is Mark Zuckerberg? The movie is based on the 2009s book by Ben Mezrich entitled ""The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal"". Yup, the movie is about people behind the birth of Facebook, the most massive social network in our generation. In the first half of the movie depicts how Zuckerberg fills his activities with blogging and programming. And finally ends up with launching The Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room. Someone told me, thiz movie is all about suing. Well, I think she was right. Substantively, the second half of the movie emphasizes who is the real creator of The Facebook through some legal processes. Anyone can sue anyone. The question is whether or not he would win. There are three important characters in thiz movie. First is Jesse Eisenberg who played as Zuckerberg, fully equipped with his slipper. Personally, I think Eisenberg sometimes talks too fast and delivers a stiff mien. His performance is just enough. The second is the pop star Justin Timberlake who brings a precise deep and dominant charisma into his character as Napster's founder, Sean Parker. The last but not the least, actually it is the best performance for overall, comes from our next Spider-Man (2012), Andrew Garfield. Garfield gives a complete emotional package for his character, a friend and new enemy as well, Edurado Saverin. Subjectively, the book ""Accidental Billionaires"" was advised by Eduardo Saverin himself, without any involvement from Zuckerberg's side. So the point of view is fittingly one-sided. The ending of the movie itself is stagnant and flat which I'm kind of surprised. Thiz movie comes from one of my favorite Directors, David Fincher. Almost half of Fincher's masterpieces have a smart and twist ending, just like what we have found in ""Se7en"" (1995), ""The Game"" (1997) and one of my favorite movies of all-time ""Fight Club"" (1999). But on second thought, I think it's already maximized anyway, considering thiz is a biography. In the end, if you ask me why Zuckerberg and his Facebook? Why not Bill Gates or anyone else? I think I can see something here. One vital element that they do not have and Zuckerberg has it. It is controversy. Controversy makes things more attractive. In these days of technology era, whoever has the ability to conquer the internet, it's simply being God himself.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"
"bennyhagen","10","1","2","8 November 2010"," Incredibly skillful and unique masterpiece
","I can really only talk in superlatives about what this crew of fine people managed to accomplish here. The key is not even in the sophistication of the separate parts, it's how everything comes together into coherence. Aaron Sorkin truly outdid himself with this script. I tend to dislike ""Snappy dialog"" but ""snappy"" here emerges from ""meaningless junk that can be applied to any crap to make it somewhat watchable"", creating a standalone art form. The absolutely genuine characters - each of them truly interesting and entertaining - are merely played to perfection by around everyone of the absolutely felicitous cast. Finchers unique and familiar skills place this movie on Fight Club territory equaling the artistic values of the classic but support the movie in a more subtle and refined way underlined by Trent Reznors discreet musical universe and the famous, dark cinematographic style of Jeff Cronenweth (7even, FC) which is so welcome considering other directors might have approached the theme as some sunshiny college movie. I'm not a big facebook user, but the fact that it's about one of the surprisingly most relevant and trendy mediums these days, something that touches most peoples lives in one or the other way, the fact that you can like REALLY, personally relate to the whole thing gives a very unique touch, something I never experienced to this degree in a movie before. I guess the timing for picking the subject was just about perfect but who would have thought that someone can pull a serious, artful movie out of a story about the founder of a website so to say. I have absolutely nothing bad to say here, all the fantastic artwork coming together makes The Social Network a high quality, genuine masterpiece that is really hard to forget. Must see for about everyone."
"MovieGeekBlog","7","1","2","8 November 2010"," West wing on facebook
","I know, this film has now been out for a while, but I've only just managed to catch it on the big screen and since I can tell this is one of those we are going to be talking about in the coming Awards season, I thought I should probably spend a couple of words discussing it. Easily the starting point has got to be the script. Aaron Sorkin is the real star of the film. The fast, sharp and witty dialogue, the same we all fell in love with on the West Wing is Sorkin's trade mark and is apparent on pretty much every single line in this film. At the end of the day it's what really makes it. David Fincher's direction this time seems pretty invisible to the untrained eye, but obviously to be able to make a bunch of nerds sitting by a computer interesting and compelling, as this film is, must have been not an easy task. The entire cast is faultless, lead by Jesse Eisenberg who is absolutely perfect in his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg. Even Justin Timberlake is very good as Sean Parker, the inventor of napster, as we learn from his first scene in the film. From the start the film quite clearly does not want to take sides and decides to avoid lawsuits by drawing its dialogue from the various transcripts from the various procedural meetings with the various sides' lawyer. And if there is a problem with the film, this is maybe it: there's a certain detachment throughout the film, from the way it's filmed (Ficher's direction is often quite cold and calculated), to the way it's written (typical of Sorkin), and edited (the constant cutting backwards and forwards from the procedural meetings to the real story), basically from the way its conceived right from the start. All of which prevents you from having a real emotional attachment to any of the character. You never really care about any of the any of them in particular. Each of the actors on screen does absolutely their best with what they are given, but clearly that's not enough. We almost want to feel bad for Andrew Garfield's character (who plays Zuckeberg's best friend Eduardo Saverin), but we are never given the chance to get too close to him, to fully care and really share his feeling of betrayal. In fact his character disappears half way through the film (he goes to New York) and when he comes back towards the end, are we supposed to reconnect straight away and feel for him? I don't think so. The film is so careful about not taking sides and sticking to the truth that it ends up being too clinical, cold and makes you feel really detached from it. I am sure that was probably the way all those people are in real life, but if you have to watch them for 2 hours you really need someone to care about. Towards the end (SPOILER ALERT but not really), we're almost given a glimpse of a moment where we are meant to feel sorry for Mark Zuckerberg (a person so incapable to connect with real people, just as he was so good in making them connect with the internet), but it's too little, too late. It's really not enough and actually, that's not how the film has been up until that point. I really wanted to love this movie, I wanted it to become my favourite film of the year and instead, I just thought it was all right.. but not more than that. And I am almost angry with myself for saying that! With all the will in the world, I don't think I can give it more than 7.5/10. Still a very good film, but not the masterpiece I was hoping.

"jzappa","8","1","2","4 November 2010"," Not Only a Spike on the 2010 Radar but a Refreshing Return to Razor-Sharp Filmmaking Precision
","We get the film version of every best seller, graphic novel, comic book series, war and topical phenomenon within reach. And too frequently, they're assessed on the strength of how committed they are to the source. Numerous critics haven't liked The Social Network because it doesn't follow the facts. The Guardian pondered whether a 26-year-old entrepreneur truly ought to have his name muddied in a foggy fact/fiction jumble for the movie-going public's common entertainment. Zuckerberg himself, the film's core subject and fascinating protagonist, said at a conference he really wished that nobody had made a movie about him, at least while he was alive.<br/><br/>I fully understand and sympathize with these points. Part of me feels it's unfair to not only fictionalize but hold up to public censure the short life of a twentysomething. But this is a useless attitude toward evaluating movies. What counts is whether a movie is high-quality and gratifying, not whether it's true to a novel, play, real-life figure. To be sure, countless films are magnificent for the reason that they interpret their initial sources into cinema vernacular. Gangs of New York's factually inaccurate, sure, but it's profoundly true to the import and reality of its depicted era and way of life. Hitchcock was painstakingly lucid with facts in The Wrong Man but at the expense of the spirit and power of its characters.<br/><br/>Fincher's known for dark, meticulous dramas that tap into contemporary society's anxieties and obsessions. This one dashes through two hours of magnetic dialogue. It makes an ironically incommunicable account lucid, captivating. Many might understandably think it hopeless to make a movie about a computer programmer, as programming's just writing in a language nobody in the audience understands. Still Fincher and Sorkin dramatize the Facebook phenomenon in language that carries the import of the social media revolution with the same degree of vibrance and wit that Network did.<br/><br/>To conjure up Facebook, Zuckerberg needed to be familiar with next to zilch about relationships or human nature, and this film's version of him isn't. What he needed was the capacity to perceive a way to engage the human race in the small world phenomenon. I maybe know 50 of my Facebook friends well, 100 I added just for going to the same high school at the same time, another 100 friends of friends. I can't recall the last time I received a Request from anyone with whom I didn't share at least one ""Mutual Friend."" The film begins with a date between Zuckerberg and Erica. He anxiously nurses a beer and speed-talks through an uncompromising cross-examination, almost vicious one-upmanship. Erica breaks it off, reprimands him, leaves. Erica (a storybound character) is correct, but at that instant she puts Zuckerberg in business. He goes home, begins hacking into the ""facebooks"" of Harvard dorms to accumulate campus girls' head shots. He programs a page where they can be ranked for their attractiveness. Chauvinistic and criminal, this proves so trendy, it crashes the campus servers. After it's harvested by a humdrum website called ""The Harvard Connection,"" Zuckerberg propagates it into Facebook.<br/><br/>Programming vernacular and methods are broadly recognized, but it's he who discerns how he can associate them with a networking site. Facebook's brilliance entails not mental keenness but its scheme of mingling self-image with social interface. Zuckerberg longs to hit back at all the Harvard prudes he wishes would like him, so he absorbs them in a surrounding substance that's even now on the rise. This is the very reason why I feel The Social Network deserves the Oscar win for Best Editing. It has an associational effect of overtonally aggregating the nature of time, various rhythms to energize the pace and intellectual shot-by-shot links to create an emotional version of the narrative rather than a plodding entrepreneurial dossier.<br/><br/>The depositions' testimony makes it clear there's a case to be made against Zuckerberg, many of them sins of omission. It's left to the final crawl to explain how they turned out. The point is to show an interaction of undergraduate chaos, enormous amounts of money and manic energy. Zuckerberg may have had the acument that produced Facebook, but he didn't do it single-handedly, and the movie gets a recounting by cutting between various lawsuit depositions. We gain understanding of the Harvard social structure, a campus where skill enlists affluence and relations as achievement factors. We meet the Winklevoss twins (both played by Armie Hammer), moneyed hunks who suppose Zuckerberg stole their idea. We meet Eduardo Saverin, played by a warmly relatable Andrew Garfield, Zuckerberg's closest (sole) friend, who was made CFO, lent the enterprise the money that it required to commence and was driven away. Most remarkably we meet Sean Parker, the founder of two renowned, momentous startups.<br/><br/>It's the capricious Parker, fresh out of work but stretched out in celebrity and past triumph, who seemed to be the only person to make Zuckerberg blink, much less haul him into the big time. He rationalized why Facebook needed to move to Silicon Valley. Why more money would come from venture capitalists than Eduardo would ever boost with his humble calls to flush New Yorkers.<br/><br/>The dialogue has the pace, spontaneity of Paddy Chayefsky or a Howard Hawks film. Eisenberg, who's concentrated on playing feeble or fastidious, is an infrared homing beacon hunting his own goals. Timberlake stunningly triumphs with the cunning task of playing Parker as both a strutting show-off and someone who takes on Zuckerberg as an academic match. We could see them as symbolic of the relationship between the real-life story and this film."

","And fascinating, this story of how the Facebook network was conceived, born and implemented by the work of a young Harvard student against winds and tides of all kind. We see how a small computer program turned quickly into a social network of friendship congregating now more than 1,000,000 members spread all over the world, composing a nation of more inhabitants than most countries. The movie is well directed and the cut is a very effective succession of short sequences whose conducting thread consists in the depositions in the lawsuits against Mark Zuckerberg the young student above mentioned, motivated by the several legal complications his activities provoked. These sequences contain a succession of flashbacks related to the questions and references that arose during those depositions in a very vivid rhythm in which the lively dialogues and the excellent acting of all the cast members play a no less important part. I didn't cast a higher vote to this movie only because for all that its theme is not as important as to allow it."

"phatdan","10","1","2","6 November 2010"," Style over Story
","The brilliance of this film rests more in its masterful, cinematic story telling than in the story. It is exceptionally well crafted. The editing, screenplay, and direction will most likely be winners at the Oscars.<br/><br/>As for the story, one can sum it up quite easily. A Harvard computer-application genius is rejected by his girl friend so he channels his sex drive by denouncing the female race through blogging and hacking Harvard's internet system. This generates 22,000 hits in just a few hours and he becomes famous, but is promptly put on academic probation. From there he uses the school's website as framework for Facebook in which he questionably violates numerous ethics, and eventually law itself. The legal inquiry is meshed throughout stunningly. In the end we see the youngest billionaire in the world sitting alone with a lap-top, sending a Facebook ""Friend Request"" to the girl he had revengefully humiliated in his internet blog at the beginning of the film. One can associate this to becoming a victim of one's own creation.<br/><br/>The film runs for two hours, but seems like 1 1/2. As suggested above, this is more likely because of style than story - except for the possibility that we all use, and are also likely victims of Facebook."

","When I first heard about The Social Network I was automatically interested. This was because being a teenager, I am an active user of Facebook and never really thought about how it came to be so popular. However, I was rather sceptical about how good of a film it could be no matter what the subject matter was.<br/><br/>I watched this film and it automatically drew me in due to it being character driven even in the first scene between Mark Zuckerberg and his ""almost"" girlfriend. With the non-linear narrative in place, it really engaged me as it switched between Zuckerburg having his best friend, and then it switched to the present day in which they were opposing clients. <br/><br/>As well as being incredibly dialogue and character driven, this film was really good for me due to the truth and reality of it. It shows how Facebook can rule and be dominant in teenagers' lives. Sayings such as ""facebook me"" and relationship status' are prominent throughout the film and it applies to life in the youth of today, where a relationship isn't official until it has been put on Facebook etc. <br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg shows his true potential as an actor in this film, giving the future movie industry much promise for great actors in the next 20 years. And as doubtful I was about Justin Timberlake being one of the main characters of the film, he didn't do a bad job and was convincing as the character he played, the founder of Napster, portraying arrogance etc.<br/><br/>The only thing about the film, which I was only slightly disappointed with was the ending in which you do not see any kind of resolution, you just see the depressing sap of Mark Zuckerberg refreshing the facebook page of his ex-girlfriend from the beginning of the film. As disappointed as I was initially, I look back and think there is no need for a clear resolution as before the credits it gives a quick review of how the characters' real life counter-parts are doing today...<br/><br/>Overall, worth the watch and if you think the subject matter is off putting, then you are being too narrow minded and should let yourself watch this film."

I also found it interesting to see that perhaps ⅔ of the audience were of a certain more elderly age.<br/><br/>You may not be on Facebook, but you'd be hard pressed be among the few that haven't at least heard of it. It is perhaps not important though, because as a film The Social Network manages to convey a fascinating story regardless of your user-ship of the involved site. David Fincher is an awesome talent and despite my reservations of this project when it first surfaced it is a very accomplished piece of work. Direction here is extremely tight, the story is straight forward and unfolds easily interspersed with moments from the legal proceedings. The way that the story unfolds is quite astonishing and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg comes across as a very clever man, brilliant with computers but also a general grasp of everything which makes him almost a little cold and calculated.<br/><br/>Casting is great, Jesse Eisenberg is great as Zuckerberg with his quick fire dialogue, but elsewhere there is talent although I must say I struggled with Justin Timberlake in this. Dialogue and the script shine throughout and that's important as the film really is a dialogue based one, but it never falters throughout. The fascination also remains through out, the escalation of the site's popularity and therefore the financial side of events are incredible and this behind the scenes format gives you a different understanding of Facebook itself. The contrast of friends mucking around with the internet and the onset of million dollar lawsuits which in turn destroys friendships is shocking. The scenes that portray the legal proceedings where friends have become enemies and Zuckerberg almost outsmarts everyone are brilliant and for me are the real highlights of the film, yet as a whole it's difficult not to be at least a little fascinated.<br/><br/>What is also remarkable is how Fincher has managed to make this story interesting, a quick look at this doesn't really provide a very thrilling story, but once you start watching, you can loathe Facebook or anything it stands for but still have a excellent film experience, the final outcomes and payouts are worth the journey alone, the outcome left me gob smacked. There is nothing like a good story and Facebook provides it.<br/><br/>More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com"
"jburtroald95","8","1","2","31 October 2010"," Love the enigmatic disjointed time sequence format by the way
","The advertising of David Fincher's latest film misleadingly introduces a nagging expository sermon on the interlinking worlds of business and cyberspace; however, the film itself heartily agrees with the audience that the aforementioned notions have been tiresomely overdone and instead leads gives them a rousing good time venturing into the thrillingly vibrant lives of several colourful characters. It satisfyingly turns down the obvious option of trying to be deeply moving and meaningful – a hapless endeavour that would inevitably produce another unbearable saccharine bore – in favour of using the opportunity to let us relish the scandalous immorality behind Facebook's creation while it remains safely on the other side of the screen.<br/><br/>Computer enthusiast Mark Zuckerberg (brilliantly portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg) is the clever audacious youth miles ahead of the rest who coolly weaves a hazardous tangled web of crafty manipulative feats throughout the film. With a razor-sharp tongue and an unwavering confidence that some may find overbearing, although others may think it justified given his intellectual superiority, he casually and entertainingly parades about the world wielding his remarkable capabilities in a very Holmes-like fashion.<br/><br/>Along the way, Mark has a brush with a pair of brawny hot-tempered male twins (both played by Armie Hammer) who at least provided the inspiration for creating the internet giant, and end up suing him for what they belief was the theft of their intellectual property. He also makes ill-fated dealings with fellow networking entrepreneur Sean Parker, (a surprisingly well-cast Justin Timberlake) who effortlessly influences Mark and the audience with his rebellious charm and exciting ideas to secure a share of the company. Sean too carries a sense of fun and upbeat charisma as a movie character harmless in our world of reality.<br/><br/>Superbly written by Aaron Sorkin, to whom we have a great many pricelessly witty dialogue pieces to thank for, The Social Network is mostly a slick, stylish, glamorous and highly entertaining medley of ambitious backstabbing teenagers who are also understandably human, but the incorporation of their emotions is kept to a very sensible minimum. The more depressing scenes towards the end and the characters of Mark's loyal friend Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), gentle ex-girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) and kindly lawyer Marilyn Delpy (Rashida Jones) manage to provide all of the sentimentality that is needed or wanted here."

","When I first heard about this project I was pessimistic since I refused to believe in a story about some website where people interact with each other. Then, David Fincher was announced to direct the movie and that news dazzled me because Fincher is known for his compact, complex storytelling so I was kind of biased on this project and still didn't cared about it that much. But then, months after that, the movie came out and an avalanche of positive reviews started. Right then I said ""I need to see this movie, what the hell was I thinking? It's Fincher for god sake!"". So, I grabbed a ticket and I went to see it. I must say I was completely satisfied with the movie, not only satisfied but impressed and in a way it touched me but I find it a little bit overrated. Aaron Sorkin deserves a nomination for best Screenplay since the narrative story and dialogue was perfect. No mistake and no cheesy lines, just smart content.<br/><br/>Fincher's excellent directing and storytelling is the ultimate weapon of audience-attraction a Facebook movie could have had. Each shot followed by next one shows a logical, smart and innovative progress through the Facebook creation. Not only that, but he succeeded to let the viewer acknowledge that's he's not watching just a Facebook movie but more a movie about society's goods and bads... Of course, the story is based on Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), the young Harvard student who ""by inspiration and chance"" became the youngest billionaire in the world. Through his moments of brightness he had an accomplice in Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) in creating the main social connector in the world. Many said, this movie is not based on the real deal behind the creators of Facebook, one of them being ""the"" Mark Zuckerberg but Fincher never suggested that this movie is about that but more about the social structure of today's world no matter if the society created it's virtual or not. Fincher analyzes all the possibilities, gives the best interpretation and shows us the naked truth behind the main goals of an adolescent. Mark Zuckerberg is the perfect example of that adolescent who can't integrate himself into a society because he doesn't have the required ""skills"" to make it there, to survive, and because of his personal frustrations he succeeds to create the one thing he couldn't be a part of: a society. Being a virtual society it doesn't really matter in these days when the differences between it and the real one (or the one that finds herself in reality) are close to none. But may I ask... which in fact is the real one? There's the point of this movie... And this intelligent and wonderful carousel of fights and agreements filled with lawyers and deceptions is the perfect way to sum that.<br/><br/>The cast of Jesse Eisenberg is not only because of the physical but also because of this guy's talent to portray such a simple but in fact deep character. But Jesse ain't the top notch as far as acting because the secondary roles held by Justin Timberlake who plays the founder/creator of Napster, Sean Parker and Andrew Garfield who plays Zuckerberg's partner, Eduardo Saverin, simply takeover the show. I honestly would like to see Andrew Garfield to be nominated in the Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the Academy since he managed to deliver such a great and powerful performance.<br/><br/>Another place where Fincher always succeeds is the cinematography and editing. This film was beautifully shot, every take has a meaning and no scene alone was boring or dragged too much. The music was also a big contributor to the atmosphere of the movie, it's not something the Academy would look after but it definitely delivered.<br/><br/>With all this, the ""Facebook movie"", The Social Network is this generation's movie because it reflects our current society and our current beliefs but I also consider it to be a little bit overrated, especially considering some critics had the guts to compare this with the Godfather or Citizen Kane. I must say this LOUD and clear: It ain't nowhere near Citizen Kane or Godfather. It's a very very good movie but it doesn't have that strong emotional impact like those movies. While I said it impressed me emotionally I am also saying that this doesn't mean it's an powerful emotional movie because it's not. It's like a story of a dark twisted fantasy of some poor loser in life which transcends to reality but that's it."

","Don't Get angry if you knew about the reality before this movie well i'll be honest i didn't know a lot of things but i knew that he had problems.The movie is great splendid enough to make you feel the presence on screen of the cast itself. Mark is really a bright fellow. OH the movie in itself presents what type of culture we are in. A guy comes up with an idea has the initials to do it and when he do it then there are people how are there to get him To pay them for nothing simple. This movie puts you in whole a lot of situations where you ask yourself a question yeah man i wanted to be the founder of facebook yeah i wanted some part of it but you do things out of things which had some impact on you but what really matters is how you take it. The movie soundtracks, music, direction, dialogues and say not acting too is awesome. This is a must see movie for everyone you don't have to be a user of facebook to see but a special must for facebook users.

"lekgolah","9","1","2","30 October 2010"," A great film that leaves you wanting more
","When The Social Network was first announced as ""a film about Facebook"" , I was skeptical about whether the film would be worth seeing or not. However once I saw the trailer, I could not wait to see the film and I am glad to say that it does not disappoint.<br/><br/>David Fincher is one of those directors whose style is in everything that he makes and while at first that may not seem appropriate for a film about Harvard students creating a social website, it somehow makes the film better. Were this in the hands of another director, I don't think the film would have been as well received. The choice in music, camera angles, editing, lighting and the cast is all brilliant.<br/><br/>What will immediately hook the audience in is the which, which is so sharp and witty. From the first five minutes, we quickly get to know who Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Isenberg) really is and what he is like around other people. While at first it may seem strange that someone like him would be best friends around the likable Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), who is caring and forgives Mark for some of his actions, their friendship it believable. This makes it a shame that we know that their friendship will never last.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is great and all of the cast fit their roles perfectly. Jesse Insenberg is fantastic to watch as is Andrew Garfield (who is an actor clearly worth watching), Rooney Mara despite a small role is good, Armie Hammer who plays both twins is excellent and Justin Timberlake shines in another role as the founder of Napster. <br/><br/>Despite how engaging the film is, I found myself wanting to see more as if the film had been edited down for commercial reasons. The film lasts 2 hours and within that running time it tells the story effortlessly thanks to David Fincher's direction but I wish more time was spent on the relationship between Mark and Eduardo as the film is constantly progressing forward.<br/><br/>The film is well worth watching and I will certainly be interested in watching it again. Fincher continues to impress and I look forward to seeing what comes next for him and the actors in this film."
"Floated2","10","1","2","29 October 2010"," Brilliantly written!
","The Social Network was a real fascinating and brilliant film. It isn't just about facebook but more on the founder- Mark Zuckerberg and how he created facebook and the process it went into. In my opinion, the critics got it right, this film is one of the best of 2010 and no doubt should be nominated at the Oscars for best picture, along with David Fincher for best director and Jesse Eisenberg for best lead actor. Right from the start of the film, it sets its tempo with the introduction scene. The film is 2 hours but really didn't feel that long (which is a good thing). The film was vastly entertaining and not boring. And the film is basically a drama about the creation of facebook which includes a lot of talking and the fact that it wasn't boring makes it even more remarkable. One thing that makes the film great is the dialogue. It was very well written and included clever and engaging dialogue.<br/><br/>Also, what a liked about the film is that the story is told in a non-linear fashion going back and forth to the start of Facebook and the lawsuits that followed. That really kept the film fresh and keeps the viewers extremely interested throughout. I just loved how Fincher did not warn the audience of the change in time. He lets you figure that out via the dialogue and actions of the characters. The editing was great and fit in well with the movie. Overall the film was brilliant and shouldn't get missed"
"sandgroper66","Null","1","2","29 October 2010"," Far from Fincher's best
","I have to agree with one of the other reviews here - if Facebook were not so popular, there would not be so much credit given to this film. Its far from Zodiac or Seven, Fincher's best films by far. This is competent film making from Fincher and no more. It is him going through the motions of what he's done before. He's not pushing or using his craft as he has done in the past. Also the dialogue, while clever, fast paced and self aware, means that all characters sound the same, its more about showing off with dialogue than being true to the characters or story. I was soooooo looking forward to this, and was really disappointed."
"Troy_Campbell","10","1","2","29 October 2010"," A compelling drama that deservedly joins the illustrious five-star club.
","I'm not sure where to start. The Social Network is littered with so many impressive qualities that on any given day I could write a whole review dedicated to just one of them. From the men behind the scenes – director David Fincher, scribe Aaron Sorkin – to the young cast in front of it – Eisenberg, Garfield, Timberlake, Hammer, Mara – there's no shortage of people to rave about. Then there's the brilliantly persuasive original music by Atticus Ross and Nine Inch Nails front man Trent Reznor as well. I suppose I'll just proceed in a natural order.<br/><br/>Adapted from Ben Mezrich's book The Accidental Billionaires, Sorkin's screenplay is simply scintillating. The West Wing creator is already known for his razor-sharp dialogue thanks to his hit TV political drama and here he delivers more of the witty, fast-sprouting conversations and breath-taking monologues that audiences have come to expect. I was never less than utterly enthralled in what was being said as Sorkin invests his writings with an intelligence that demands your undivided attention. Being swept away by the cunning force of the words isn't the only thing that Sorkin brings to the table though, he grafts multiple strands of plot over a non-linear timeline into one cohesive and entirely absorbing story. That the tale is loosely based – Sorkin openly declared to the New York Times that ""I don't want my fidelity to be to the truth, I want it to be to storytelling"" – on how the youngest self-made billionaire in the world, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, became exactly that is all the more intriguing.<br/><br/>Calling the shots on only his second film that isn't overtly dark and intense – after 2008's Benjamin Button – Fincher has unmistakably decided to test his own talent. There are the apparent filmmaking flourishes on display, the encompassing birds-eye shot of Zuckerberg running through the Harvard compound during the opening credits sequence and the mesmerizing rowing montage set to Edvard Grieg's famous Opus 23 In the Hall of the Mountains for instance, however Fincher offers more than what may be initially apparent. For example, many won't realise whilst viewing The Social Network that the Winklevoss brothers are actually played by Armie Hammer and, well, Armie Hammer. He's always been brash with his use of subtle special effects – the tremendously clever use of CGI in Zodiac still the pinnacle in his career – and his vision to allow Hammer to portray both brothers, and execute it flawlessly, is a technical wonder. The fact that no-one will notice this unless they've been clued in goes a long way to exemplify the sort of invaluable director Fincher is to modern cinema.<br/><br/>On the screen, Zombieland star Jesse Eisenberg inhabits the role of the socially inept and technologically forward-thinking Zuckerberg completely. Eisenberg injects his Harvard misfit with a conflicted personality: Zuckerberg is, despite being a genius in anyone's book, undeniably human in every way. British up-and-comer Andrew Garfield – who was mesmerizingly good in the hard-hitting Boy-A – may not have a character as openly flashy or interesting as the computer whiz-kid, but he instils Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's best friend who later sued him for half a billion dollars, with a wider and deeper emotional gamut than any of the other characters. In the climactic scene where he confronts his ex-pal in the Facebook offices, Garfield displays the sort of natural gravitas that is reserved for only the best thespians. In support, pop-star Justin Timberlake further argues his case as a serious actor with a suitably smarmy portrayal of Napster co-founder Sean Parker, Armie Hammer delivers an amazing double-act as the Winklevoss twins and we get a sneak peek at Rooney Mara, the actress who won the highly sought after role of Lisbeth Salander in Fincher's Girl With the Dragon Tattoo remake.<br/><br/>A compelling drama that deservedly joins the illustrious five-star club alongside Inception and Animal Kingdom thanks to all of the extraordinary players involved.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Fine, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)"

","If you were this columnist's webmaster, you won't be too happy to hear this confession. Instead of focusing on churning out a movie review, he would be switching between windows to check on the latest news feed on Facebook. How that affects work efficiency is one thing, the other aspect of this six year old social network service is how it has taken over our lives.<br/><br/>The last he checked (after writing the above paragraph, nonetheless), this single and January born (hunt down his Facebook account to verify these facts) columnist has 449 friends. Why the constant need to refresh the Facebook page? Mark Zuckerberg would understand – at least that's how the Mark Zuckerberg in David Fincher's movie is portrayed.<br/><br/>Adapted from Ben Mezrich's non fiction book The Accidental Billionaires, this drama chronicles the founding of the now famous social networking website. Some seven years ago, no one would have heard of Facebook until Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin and their team of technical experts came together to create this phenomenal online tool. The story also involves a certain Napster co founder Sean Parker and a pair of Harvard twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. The 121 minute movie tells the story of how friendships were formed, as well as how enemies were made in the founding of what may possibly be the most culturally and socially important networking website of our time.<br/><br/>Given the subject matter, it is difficult not to dwell on the actualities of what happened in real life, but Fincher (Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) knows too well that he is making a movie for the masses. Thus, the resultant work is a crisply intelligent and emotionally engaging movie that further marks his place in the industry as an acclaimed filmmaker.<br/><br/>While it is important to note that none of the Facebook staff or employees was involved in the making of this movie, you have to give credit to Aaron Sorkin's sharply written screenplay because it manages to keep the pace of the talky movie going. Highly celebrated musicians Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have also come together to compose a very hip electronica driven score to accompany the film. The effective cinematography and editing by Jeff Cronenweth, Kirk Baxtyer and Angus Wall also complement Fincher's clear cut filmmaking style. The flashbacks are well executed, and humour is evident in the characters' dialogues. Most importantly, there is emotional punch, as exemplified by the human connections and relationships which are built and torn apart in the story. Ultimately, it is a tale about how a man who manages to connect the world is a loner desperately trying to find his own connection.<br/><br/>Fincher's fresh cast of actors do a fine job of depicting their characters too. Jesse Eisenberg (Zombieland) brings out the nonchalant brilliance of Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Garfield (The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus) exudes the will power of Eduardo Saverin, and Justin Timberlake (Shrek Foerver After) personifies Sean Parker's slimy entrepreneurial spirit. They are supported by other fine actors like Brenda Song, Arnie Hammer, Max Minghella and Rooney Mara.<br/><br/>This is clearly an ambitious project, considering how worldwide viewers (the 500 million Facebook users included) will be anticipating the story of Facebook. Like the website itself, the movie is culturally and socially significant in contemporary cinema –be ready to see the movie acknowledged for a job well done during awards season.<br/><br/>While this columnist is still at it, he would recommend you to life MovieXclusive.com on Facebook, and if you must know, as he ends off this review, he has just added one more friend to his page, making his total number of friends to 450.<br/><br/>Now, it's time to upload those photos he took at the party last night.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"

Because let's reckon it, Mark Zuckerberg will enter history, if he as not already done it.

","The simple fact that you are reading this review now is a valid point that we feel strong connection to the main subjects included in ""The Social Network"". What are those subjects? Pursuit of fame, glory, money, recognition, and of course on-lining on a daily basic. I believe that, those are reasons that drove Mr.Zuckerberg(great break out role for Jessie Eisenberg), and his accomplices(also great Justin Timberlake among others) during they journey of making now famous social network system called face book. There are few quite amazing thinks about this film. First of all I must praise it for very good pacing.The whole thing runs for about 2hrs, and it is assembled from scenes of arguing, discussing things etc. yet you will not find any dull moment in the story. Also what I found worth pointing out is that even though this film is filled with high tech slang, you will always be interested in what is happening on screen, even if you are just mildly aware of the possibilities that your good old PC provides. So to sum it up, The Social Network is very timely, and at the same time very universal story about friendships,betrayals,youth and all stupidity that comes with it, and of course about face book...where as a matter of fact this slight review will be submitted."
"FilmRap","10","1","2","14 October 2010"," Get under the hood of a person who is changing the world as we know it
","Every aspect of this story and film is handled just about as well as it could be done. The subject matter has to be of interest to the 500 million people who are on Facebook or the millions who are not and are wondering how did all of this ever get started. The captivating story comes from a book titled Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich but the brilliant dialog comes from the screenplay of Aaron Sorkin who also wrote the great TV series West Wing. We get a very realistic trip back a few years to the Harvard campus where the very contemporary version of the great American dream is being hatched in a college dormitory. Mark Zuckerberg somewhat of a social misfit himself, is developing this idea for what will ironically become the greatest social networking concept of all time. He is played extremely well by Jesse Eisenberg whom we remember as the older son in The Squid and The Whale, plays Zuckerberg. The fascinating part of the story is that a bunch of other guys at Harvard also had some roles in stimulating and developing what was to become a world wide phenomena. While Zuckerberg clearly is the genius here, the Winklevoss brothers and Divya Naregra provided some of the nuclei of the ideas and Eduardo Saverin one of Zuckerberg's friends actually started off as the business manager and then CFO of the fledgling enterprise. Saverin initially invested the $1000 to start it and then another $18,000 before several the big venture capitalists found it. In contrast, this movie, about their story cost $50 million. But we digress here because the essence of the story, which will suck you in, is how all these Harvard students plus Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake), a Stanford dropout who himself invented Napster, became entangled ultimately in a multimillion lawsuit at the time that Facebook was worth billions of dollars. The film is directed by David Fincher, who knows how to transition episodes of time, having directed The Strange Case of Benjamin Button. He cleverly moves back in forth from the high stakes deposition of a law suit being waged about who owns Facebook and how much do they own, back to the events of their college days a few years previously. Zuckerberg is the center of attention here. This film is successful in giving us a good glimpse under the hood of this determined person who is one of those 21st century people who is changing the world as we know it. (2010) Filmrap.net"
"EUyeshima","8","1","2","14 October 2010"," Ironic Biopic of a Social Outcast Capturing the Zeitgeist of Online Social Connection
","This propulsive 2010 film is probably the most conspicuous case of product placement in recent Hollywood memory. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin prove to be a particularly effective team in bringing to vivid life the somewhat trite story of the betrayal behind a Web site that reshaped the chore of networking into the zeitgeist of the online community reaching 500 million participants. The irony is that the movie is not really about the Facebook phenomenon itself but its opaque creator, nineteen-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, a socially impervious Harvard-based hacker extraordinaire whom the creators would have you believe developed Facebook as a way to get back at the girl who dumps him and the elitists who reject him. However, Sorkin is far too shrewd to turn this into a simple revenge story. Instead, he uses these factors as catalysts in his inspiration to ignite the basic need we have to judge other people in the safe haven of a site populated by people who are otherwise socially disconnected.<br/><br/>The story's framing device centers around the detailed depositions given in two concurrent lawsuits against Zuckerberg - one filed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, identical twins and star members of Harvard's rowing team, along with their business partner Divya Narendra, and the other filed by Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's former best friend. The Winklevoss twins filed a suit claiming they originated the idea for Facebook when Zuckerberg agreed to help them build a Harvard-only community site. The second suit cuts deeper in that Saverin, a Facebook co-founder, finds his ownership in the company cut from a third to one-tenth of one percent. The decision is not without merit since Saverin's singular determination in eliciting advertisers to the site did nothing to help the site gain popularity. At the same time, it reflected Zuckerberg's socially inert nature – whether true or not - showing he is incapable of maintaining a deep friendship not out of malice or greed but because he has the unrelenting fortitude to recognize he has a better idea to code and implement despite the personal consequences. It's a fascinating conundrum that requires Fincher's emotionally precise direction to make it work effectively.<br/><br/>In a tough role, Jesse Eisenberg (""Adventureland"") plays Zuckerberg close to the vest by showing sparks of humanity with measured acuity. It's a well-observed performance that relies on keeping a clear distance from the viewer. Justin Timberlake does well in the showy supporting role of Napster co-founder Sean Parker, a savvy, paranoid poseur whose bona fide sleaziness provides the impetus Facebook needs to turn it into a global phenomenon. However, it's Andrew Garfield who gives the movie the little heart it has as Saverin simply because we feel his devastation in missing a once-in-anyone's-lifetime opportunity by trusting a friend whom he thought had his back. There are sharp, near-cameo turns by Douglas Urbanski (""Inside Job"") as Harvard president Larry Summers, contemptuously arrogant in his dismissal of the Winklevoss' plea for support in their case against Zuckerberg; Rooney Mara who makes her character's numbing rejection of Zuckerberg palpable; and Rashida Jones (""I Love You Man"") as a junior defense attorney who provides Zuckerberg the only honest summation of his legal chances to win. Fincher has made an intentionally cool, often detached film, compounded by a jarring Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross score, but the hope of making a real, honest connection always seem to be within reach."
"mistarkus","10","1","2","13 October 2010"," Computer guys the new Rock Stars
","There will probably be a surge in computer science majors as we witness youthful, tech savvy, nerdy types emerge as the new rock stars of the 21st century. Their computer ingenuity and creativity lead them to fame, fortune and even groupies. <br/><br/>A character study about someone who becomes a billionaire in his twenties is expertly blended with subject matter that is so relevant to our times results in one of the greatest movies of the past decade. The filmmakers and actors created such a believable Zuckerberg with such human emotions and motivations that we totally connect to this all too familiar, idiosyncratic, ""smuggy nerd"" who fascinatingly becomes one of the billionaire rock stars of the information age. He is mentored by fellow internet rock star, Napster founder played by Timberlake. The subject matter of the business and legal ramifications of conjuring an online site raises interesting philosophical questions. Questions such as, who is really deserving; someone that comes up with the idea or the creator themselves, and how deserving is a confounder who plays a small financial role at the onset but who was nothing to do with the creative drive. These are some of the questions that will make the audience think about these contemporary issues. <br/><br/>The dialogue written in a way where characters go tit for tat at unnaturally supersonic speeds was a throwback to Carey Grant classics, however, the modern edge and relevancy makes it engrossing, and ears will be fully opened to the intense verbiage.<br/><br/>Amusingly tells the story of facebook founder's development and initial success with the site. Much of what he did in the initial founding years created controversy amongst those somewhat connected to the site and those wanting a piece of the pie. Two major legal disputes ensue and the film is structured through depositions dealing with these disputers. The haughty and annoyed Zuckerberg is visibly put off by these minor encumbrances and is seething to get back to his passion and baby (facebook). We hear of new controversies during the depositions and we see the flashbacks to the college years where these controversies got started which is a major part of the saga of the spawning and growth of facebook. The tad Gothic and moody atmosphere with the highly sensationalized decadence gives an entertaining if a little over the top feel to the collegiate setting. <br/><br/>The movie opens and wraps up perfectly with a speculative, witty theme of the human component that creates the drive and motivation for these youthful internet entrepreneurs."

","In the post-postmodern era being fashioned by millennials, there are two ways to get rich: (1) connect large amounts of people together under a common communication platform via the Internet; or (2) hire a lawyer and become a parasite of someone who has connected large amounts of people together. While I enjoyed this film a great deal, I found it lacking in noble purpose as it castigates the inventor and glorifies the parasite.<br/><br/>The false premise of our ""feelings matter"" pop culture is that humans should be judged by the quality of their relationships rather than the degree of their contributions. This movie advances that meme by condemning Zuckerberg for being an anti-social schmuck whose single focus on the success of his fledgling enterprise kept him from the really important stuff like learning the appropriate way to interact with the people who clung to his fame because they lacked the capability or confidence to do anything remotely as great as Zuckerberg was doing.<br/><br/>What was Zuckerberg doing? He was making it possible for 500 million people around the world to connect with each other in a richer, more humanly way. He was making life better for hundreds of millions of people who desired to see a few more pictures of their grandchildren, or learn a bit more about their kids off at college, or ease into a relationship with a potential mate. That's a pretty big thing, and if he was paid a mere $15 billion for what he did, I'd say he was underpaid. <br/><br/>His reward? His best friend and financial angel stabs him in the back by closing out all the accounts he depended on to keep afloat in the early stages, then sues him. The best friend settles for an undisclosed sum, reported to be better than $1 billion, signing a non-disclosure statement in the bargain. Then the same ""friend"" goes to a writer and collaborates on a tell-all, tabloid-type piece of trash that violates the hell out of the non-disclosure statement, if not in fact then in spirit. And now the book has become a movie.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a good movie, very well made with snappy dialog and a few great performances.<br/><br/>But if the viewer comes away thinking that Zuckerberg is a schmuck who doesn't deserve his wealth, I'd ask him to think again."

","The brilliant, brilliant new film The Social Network (based on the book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" by Ben Mezrich) shows that sometimes it's best to resist temptation with all your might. It's an experience I won't soon forget, and one I hope to take again in the near future.<br/><br/>The film stars Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, the man who started it all, and as a result became the world's youngest billionaire. After a messy breakup with his girlfriend, Erica Albright (Played with effective comedic, and emotional timing by Rooney ""Scene-Stealer"" Mara), he goes on an all out blogging marathon, even launching a small site that within only a couple of hours, receives over 20'000 hits, and crashes the Harvard system. He is asked by the Winklevoss twins (Played by Armie Hammer and... Armie Hammer) to help create a new ""friending"" site for Harvard, but instead takes the idea, and ""Perfects"" it. Thus, Facebook is born. But as his list of friends grows, he slowly loses his only true friend, Eduardo Saverin (Played by Andrew Garfield). On top of nasty temptation from rather paranoid Napster founder, Sean Parker (Played by the surprisingly capable Justin Timberlake), he faces nasty lawsuits from not only the Winklevoss twins, but from his best friend as well.<br/><br/>Who knew that director David Fincher could extract such strong, and solid performances from a cast that could have missed the target with improper direction, like Eisenberg, Garfield, Timberlake, Hammer, Rooney Mara, Rashida Jones, and Brenda Song (whose screen time is relatively short, but one scene of hers is simply unforgettable)? Eisenberg gives a subtle, and authentic performance as Zuckerberg, making the character his own instead of an imitation. Making him intelligent, humorous, but not always likable, sometimes even dreadful. It will go down as one of the best performances of the year. But no one is quite as strong as the standout of the cast, Garfield. No actor can match his line delivery, no actor can out best his emotional display. I'll be quite disappointed if he doesn't get some major awards recognition.<br/><br/>David Fincher's direction is subtle, but strong and effective. It doesn't contain the same auteurial feel he's well known for, but it's still the best film he's directed. The tech crew he surrounds himself with is also great. Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall's editing and pacing is fantastic (It does feel slow at times, specifically in the second act, but I literally could have watched it all day), Jeff Cronenworth's cinematography adds to the movie's feel greatly, and the techno score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is a perfect match for the film.<br/><br/>But the movie REALLY belongs to screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, who has officially become a candidate for the Shakespeare of this modern age. I imagine fans of his will be more than just delighted by his script's drama, intelligent dialogue, hilarious moments of satire, strong emotional punches, and thought provoking questions it raises towards the state of mankind as a networking community, and the violent freedom of insulting someone on the internet (For all to see), from the safety of your own home. And they'll probably know better than anyone else how quickly they'll need to keep up. In a lot of scenes, characters use line delivery so rapid in succession, it would make a 1940's film noir look like a Terrence Malick film.<br/><br/>Still, such a thing is needed to establish the tone of the film, which is nailed right on the head, and delivers what is simply the year's finest film. If Sorkin wins a screen writing Academy Award, I'll be completely unshocked.<br/><br/>With an as of now completely obvious, and enthusiastic final rating of **** out of ****, I have nothing left to say except, ""Go see The Social Network... NOW!"""
"mageofodd2","8","1","2","10 October 2010"," The Social Network is socially important
","The Internet is a unique, metamorphic thing that we as a society are constantly building on, and adding to. I consider this film a prime example of how quickly this web we have made can become a creature. It evolves and grows at the rate it is fed information, and that is precisely why this film is so important. The relationships displayed here are in a constant state of flux, ever expanding and building on one another, and all the actors portray this fluid dynamic very well. The main storyline may deal with the creation of Facebook, but like Facebook itself, the movie really deals with perception.<br/><br/>Being one of the first films to deal directly with the "" Update and Text"" generation, it is the main characters own feeling of being left out that drives him to create a world in which he may choose the exclusions. I can imagine how that kind of power would cause one to lose touch with the more grounding social aspects of being included in anything other than his own per view. It draws you into its framework and gives you a way to better your social standing by simply asking a few people to ""friend"" you.<br/><br/>I liked the way the film seemed to stay sort of aloof. It didn't get bogged down in calling blame out or making any one party seem like the one bad egg in the bunch. For the most part, it is a film very much about a thing gone wild and taking those who created it on a ride to unknown waters. It shows both the unique vulnerability in the people and the way money and fame eventually turn those who aren't from a world of status and power, against one another in self interest.<br/><br/>I recommend everyone see this movie. Its possible, that one day Facebook will be so ingrained in our culture it will be like Television, or the internet itself. It will be the one thing no one knew they needed until they did, or someone told them they did. You may one day get your kids grades through Facebook, people have already been fired through it. People have died, committed suicide, and had entire relationships through Facebook. I would imagine it might be pertinent someday to see where it all came from. I highly recommend this movie to parents, teachers, and anyone who has a Facebook. It will be important someday. You might just update about it."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","2","10 October 2010"," It's About the Girl
","Ironically, Facebook is all about the girl. In the opening of Director David Fincher's ""The Social Network"", Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) gets dumped by his girlfriend BU student Erica Albright (strong and spirited Rooney Mara), and rightfully so. Erica tells Mark that he may rationalize that he is getting dumped, because he is a geek. No—""It'll be because you're an a—hole."" Outraged, Mark bashes Erica on his blog, and exacts his anger in the form of Facemash—where Harvard students get to rate the hotness of coeds. So the inception of Facebook was about Mark using his powers for evil, not good. Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing"") brilliantly tells the story of the rise of Facebook and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg based on Ben Mezrich's ""The Accidental Billionaires"". Granted his screenplay is part urban legend, and part real life drama about the social network Facebook which has 500 million members. Zuckerberg has altered the world.<br/><br/>In the eyes and ears of Fincher and Sorkin is the great paradox: The creator of The Social Network is an alienated genius, predominately by his own doing. Jesse Eisenberg deftly borders sympathetic misunderstood genius and world class a—hole. It may be safe to surmise that the real Zuckerberg lies somewhere between the extremes—or perhaps not. ""The Social Network"" is one the best movies of the year. Whether ""The Social Network"" defines a generation? Only time will tell. ""The Social Network"" plays like Internet tragedy. An ingenious idea captures the social consciousness, and culminates in a multimillion dollar lawsuit, pitting former friends against each other. At the catharsis, Mark's attorney Marylin Delphy (compassionate and smart Rashida Jones) tells him, ""You're not an a—hole. You just try so hard to be one."" Thomas Hardy said character is fate. Mark attained unimaginable wealth and success. No doubt he has an amazing life. In the final scene Fincher poignantly makes us wonder: Is Mark really happy and complete? Because Fincher and Sorkin make us care about this boy genius, who would be king.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is a warped rites of passage tale filled with deception and fascinating archetypes. Mark (Eisenberg) goes into business with his loyal roommate Eduardo Saverin (brilliant and earnest Andrew Garfield), who actually finances Mark's brain child. Mark's Facemash attracts the attention of the Winklevoss Twins, Cameron and Tyler (both played by Armie Hammer), who are blond, blue eyed, blue blood scholar athletes. Cameron and Tyler enlist Mark to develop their idea for a Harvard based on-line social network. Enter the seductive Sean Parker (amazing Justin Timberlake), co-founder of Napster and the dark force that discerns Facebook as the next big thing. Unlike Mark's other colleagues, Sean gets that what makes Facebook work is that it is cool. Timberlake is charismatic and dangerous—he is becoming a powerful actor. Sean wins over Mark with flash, money, and women. He tells Mark, ""This is our time!"" Friendships end and unholy alliances form, and in the end—betrayal.<br/><br/>So the world may have been a lot different if Mark actually apologized to Erica. Then again, character is fate. ""The Social Network"" is awesome and on some level very sad. Sometimes the very genius that triumphs may ultimately be a curse. ""The Social Network"" asks the poignant question: Was it worth it? On the surface this is a no brainer, and we all have to live with our choices and the aftermath."

","Like others before me when I initially heard about this project I wondered what could a director as talented as David Fincher see in a Facebook movie? (I thought this was just a project to keep him busy before his take on ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"".)<br/><br/>What Finch & writer Aaron Sorkin saw was an epic tale about human triumph & tragedy set in the digital age & pretty much encompassed in one man's soul. And now we see one of the very best films of the year. I rank it along with ""Se7en"" & ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" as one of Fincher's best films.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg is spectacular as FB founder Mark Zuckerberg in the most complex performance of the year. He is an unsympathetic underdog & yet I found myself siding with him. He is not an anti-hero. I often root for anti-heroes. This guy is something different altogether. Know what? There is no small amount of Lisbeth Salander in him or his portrayal here.<br/><br/>But other actors shine here too: Andrew Garfield & Justin Timberlake (yeah, that Timberlake) hit it out of the park as the burned partner & the Svangeli.<br/><br/>Sorkin's script is a marvel of fast-paced dialog & is funny as hell. I never thought I'd be laughing as much as I did here. This is, by far, Fincher's funniest film.<br/><br/>Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography carries on his father's legacy proudly. The score by Trent Reznor & co. is the most inventive since Hans Zimmer's & James Newton Howard's ""The Dark Knight""."
"aharmas","9","1","2","6 October 2010"," You'd better pay attention
","""The Social Network"" is a film full of special moments, moments where we are treated to footage that will become classic, and many will be studying and discussing in the near future, learning how to find ways to pay tribute and possibly imitate the artistry of some very talented people, particularly, Mr. Fincher, a man who has already given us plenty to discuss and keeps delivering some spectacular work.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" comes very close to being perfect, almost flawless, and with the exception of two key scenes where, ironically, the stylized language and an arguable casting choice become blemishes on an otherwise beautiful and stirring film. Earlier on, ""The Ghost Writer"" combined all the elements and deliver a film that showed the maturity and growth of one of the masters of cinema, and to be fair to Fincher, this is a vast improvement over ""Benjamin Button"" a film that appeared a bit detached at times, and that might have been much too gorgeous for its own good, forgetting to add the right amount of emotion in a film that need to be, if anything an explosion of passion and the celebration of love and life. There were plenty of sparks, but the climax failed to come. This is not the case here.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" has moments of devastating emotional power. It moves us because it gives exactly an opportunity to see how success happens, how the various elements must be in place, and how talent, passion, and the desire to eliminate the competition takes you all the way to the top. The main character lashes out at one attorney and makes it clear to him and us that it all depends on focused and driven you must be ""on what is really worth it"", and this makes all the difference.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" shows the best and worst of humanity, an expose of what supposedly happened when one of the biggest Internet enterprises was designed and set up. It is admirable to see how the different players are given an opportunity to present their perspectives. It's scary and heartbreaking at times, and there are moments when we shudder at the realization of what we can be capable of doing, of how far we are willing to push the boundaries to get what we want.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" has several spectacular performances, a joy to behold and admire given the young age of most of its cast. Their work is impressive because they are relative newcomers, and yet they seem to understand their characters and the material that inspired the film. In particular, Garfield's acting is nothing short of wondrous and perfect, not surprising since he had an spectacular turn early in his career in ""Boy A"", a film that shook your soul, mostly because of the way Garfield realized his character. In ""The Social Network"" it is reactive performance that highlights the essence of the tragic relationship, as he finally understands what he is dealing with. It is a classic moment of such powerful repressed surprise and fury, we can only gasp.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is not to be missed because much like ""The Ghost Writer"" earlier on, gives a rich and satisfying experience, not a bag of tricks where fx tend to overshadow brilliant ideas. Fincher explores once again the darkness of the soul, and this time his work is not as graphic and violent as he showed in ""Seven"" and ""The Fight Club"", true masterpieces on their own right, but it's the fresh and innocent look in the face of academia and what might be hiding there that shocks us because the film is not truly about business enterprises but about how one eventually has to make a choice between what is right and wrong, and I think, if only we paid attention..."
"bobbobwhite","8","1","2","4 October 2010"," Ah, the ironies
","Terrific hatchet-job story of Mark Zuckerberg, genius, oddball, killer-competitive greedfreak, and perhaps Asperger-afflicted founder of Facebook. Whether I agree about the value of Facebook is not relevant to the worth of this film, as it is one of the best high tech film stories of the new millennium and revolves around what is now just so critical to many millions of people around the world.....internet social networking(OMG!).<br/><br/>Even though his mother may have overdone it with endless ""be sure to close your mouth"" admonitions in his youth(you'll see), Jesse Eisenberg was fantastic as the mind-in-his-head, maybe-inventor of internet social networking(but probably not, as shown)Zuckerberg, as was Andrew Garfield playing Eduardo Saverin, his his best friend and co-founder, maybe not as brainy but way more emotionally healthy. The rest of the cast was equally good, even Justin Timberlake was terrific, but with his outsized ego in full speed mode I am not sure he was ""acting"" as Sean Parker, the cocky inventor of Napster and world-class devious manipulator. This story sadly but powerfully showed so well that youthful vigor, uber-creative ideas, killer-competitive juices, and premier business connections and execution will always be the best allies to selling out all previously held moral/ethical principles for the sake of humongous bucks and great fame.<br/><br/>But, that said, the massive in-your-face ironies of the story were what was most interesting by far. Zuckerberg, as shown, was not social at all but wanted desperately to create a ""social network"". He also initially didn't care a bit about being rich, but he is now America's youngest billionaire ever. He also didn't think advertising was ""cool"" on Facebook and was initially repulsed by it, but now his resistance ethics are well past totally sold-out and Facebook makes billions every year in advertising and rivals Google as the net's biggest ad bank. How many more personal ironies could the filmmaker have shown about Zuckerberg? And, can they all be that true?<br/><br/>Thus, the story candidly displayed how easily and quickly one's honorable intentions can get left far behind when big money and fame arrives on the doorstep in truckloads. It also showed that even lifelong best friends and business partners are not safe when big success comes calling in its mask of many faces.<br/><br/>See this perhaps best film of the year and learn some great net business startup savvy and pitfalls, but try not to get sucked into the money-making end of it. At least try for a minute or two to make your mom happy."
"jonnyhavey","9","1","2","1 October 2010"," News Feed: The Social Network—Like
","See it Now! My Critical Perspective: A- My Personal Perspective: B+<br/><br/>Is the film a one hundred percent factual history about the creation of Facebook? No it isn't, but that's not the point. The film is based on the book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" written about how Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and the controversies surrounding its creation. The basic plot of the film is about the proceedings that took place when Mark Zuckerberg was sued on two different fronts; by his best friend and co-founder, Eduardo Saverin and by the Winklevoss twins who thought he stole the Facebook idea from them. The story is told through a number of flashbacks revealing Mark Zuckerberg's programming background and how came up with the idea and developed over time what we all know as Facebook.<br/><br/>The Good: David Fincher is an amazing director and has not directed a bad movie yet. ""The Social Network"" is very different from his other ventures that include both Fight Club and Zodiac. However, the progression of his directing career is very visible in ""The Social Network"" which is by far his best directed film. Fincher always films his movies with a certain contrast of light and shadows in order to create the atmosphere that he wants his audience to feel. He does this once again in ""The Social Network"" by filming it in a shadowy light, which slowly lightens up by the end.<br/><br/>All of the actors in the film do an excellent job as well especially Jesse Eisenberg (Zombieland, Adventureland), Andrew Garfield (the new Spiderman), Armie Hammer and Justin Timberlake. Eisenberg has grown a lot throughout his different roles and has his best performance in this film with his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg that may even lead him towards an Oscar nomination this year. He creates an egotistical asshole persona with perfection and articulates his sentences so well he can insult someone without them even knowing what hit them. Andrew Garfield shows the audience through his character Eduardo Saverin (Mark's best friend) that he is a worthy Hollywood actor and may surprise us in the Spiderman reboot. Armie Hammer plays the Winklevoss twins who are shot extremely well by Fincher differentiating them enough to create their own two separate characters. Justin Timberlake also makes an appearance and has a very good performance with his character Sean Parker.<br/><br/>Despite the acting and directing the thing that stands out the most in this film is the time and effort Aaron Sorkin put into adapting the screenplay from the book ""The Accidental Billionaires."" The story and dialogues are so well put together and rattled off so fast and naturally by each of the actors that the film feels very real. There are also a plethora of one- liners and monologues that almost literally punch the character in the face whom they are directed towards along with the audience itself.<br/><br/>The Bad: The film creates a very bad image for women other than Rooney Mara's character (Erika Albright) and Rashida Jones's character (Marylin Delpy). All of the other women in the film are portrayed as drunk, greedy sluts. This may be very offensive to some people, and may be a reason not to see the film if you feel very strongly about it. Also, there are minor discontinuities throughout the film that may have been able to be a little clearer and a couple short scenes that don't seem necessary to the overall storyline of the film. <br/><br/>Final Thought: There's a difference between making a movie and creating a movie; when you make a movie you just go through the motions of preproduction, production and post production, however, when you create a movie this is taken to a whole other level. David Fincher takes it to a whole other level by creating the atmosphere and then lets loose. Who knew that a film about Facebook could grasp and keep your undivided attention and send you on a thrilling roller-coaster ride with wellcrafted dialogue and a very relevant soundtrack? Go See it Now and see what all of the hype is about."

"billybobwashere","10","2","8","1 October 2010"," The very definition of a modern masterpiece
","What I think is going to make The Social Network such a sensation is that it can be experienced in a number of different ways. On one hand, it's an extremely intriguing look at a fascinating 21st century event that people don't really know much about, moving at a pace that matches the wits of the film's brilliant protagonists. On another level, it's a movie that absolutely sums up the way the world has changed during the Digital Age; you don't have to be likable, persuasive, or forceful (like the Winklevoss twins who Zuckerberg duped) to succeed in an era where nerdy little college students can become billionaires from their computers. <br/><br/>If you aren't particularly interested in the founding of Facebook or the film's representation of the Digital Age, you can still view it in a totally different context. It's a movie about youth in the 21st century, people who think they're ""connected"" via Facebook and texting but really live in a state of disconnect. The film deals with a wide variety of main characters - most of whom are college-aged - and each of these characters is in some way ""deformed"" Zuckerberg cannot relate to others, Parker is morally corrupt, Eduardo cannot properly run his business, Eduardo's girlfriend is literally insane, and the Winklevi are almost inhumanly strong creatures yet somehow can't handle the scrawny kid who stole their idea. Viewed as nothing more than a study on America's current generation (which isn't nearly the focus of the film), The Social Network is already an incredible accomplishment. <br/><br/>And while each of these pieces plays a significant role in shaping this film into something great, what makes it for me an extraordinary film - a masterpiece, even - is a radically different aspect of the movie. Through the pen of Aaron Sorkin, the eye of David Fincher, and the performance of Jesse Eisenberg, the character of Mark Zuckerberg stands as one of the most tragic figures of loneliness in the history of film. Every single frame of the movie complements this notion. In the opening scene, Mark sits at a distance from his date, with her final words being ""It's because you're an as.shole"" before storming off. Mark runs home alone and essentially crafts Facebook out of his anger and seclusion; while other Harvard geniuses party, he works at his laptop. As the film progresses, the camera almost always catches him standing alone, sitting alone, away and apart from other people (often people with whom he is interacting). He can't even feel close to his friends. His hands are often contained within his sweater pockets, burying him within himself. Sorkin's harsh words and the blistering pace at which Eisenberg recites them frame him into somebody by whom we are fascinated but to whom we could never truly relate. Despite all that money and success, he isn't somebody we wish we were. <br/><br/>This portrait of desolation and heartache (which is often powerful enough to move one to tears), paired with an entertaining depiction of Facebook's creation (which is often hilarious enough to move one to tears), as well as an incredible ensemble cast, gorgeous cinematography, pitch-perfect musical work by Trent Reznor, impeccable editing, and a poignant ending that brings the themes of the story full circle, The Social Network is a film that makes conversations cool again (something that hasn't been true since Pulp Fiction ), a film that defines our generation and times in a way that a film hasn't done since possibly The Graduate, a film that can be enjoyed by virtually anybody above the age of 13, a film that I know I will watch a few more times in theaters, and an experience I (and soon to be you) won't forget for quite some time. In fact, it will probably resonate with us longer than will Facebook itself."

","When I first saw The Social Network in theaters, I was excited to see a new film from my favorite director, David Fincher. I was stunned by the outcome of the film, and was blown away at the talents displayed through the direction, writing, acting, editing, cinematography, just about everything that makes a great film. The Social Network is an example of why I love movies.<br/><br/>But the thing that really strikes me about the film is how it improves upon multiple viewings. Every time I watch it, I notice something new about the plot, and it's structure, that I missed before. But more interestingly, I see why people are calling it a generation-defining film. The movie never directly explore what our generation has shaped into. But what this movie does is portray it in the most realistic fashion I could ever imagine a film doing. It's almost as if I'm right there, experiencing 2003 all over again. <br/><br/>As I said earlier, the writing is brilliant. Not only in dialogue, but in structure of the story, and the study of its characters. Aaron Sorkin deserved his Oscar for the screenplay, and it was disappointing that Fincher didn't win for directing and handling this script with such grace and creativity. I also was thoroughly impressed by its cast of Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, and (surprise, surprise) Justin Timberlake. I look forward to seeing these three in future films, working with other directors.<br/><br/>Ever since I saw Fight Club, which is ranked highly among my all time favorites, I became and huge admirer of Fincher, and wanted to see his other works. The Social Network, like all of Fincher's film, is very similar to Fight Club in terms of dark lighting and how the camera focuses on characters. However, it manages to be such a different film in terms of editing, mood, and themes, it shows how Fincher can handle new ground, and becoming another masterpiece among his films."

","Eduardo Saverin: ""Sorry! My Prada's at the cleaners! Along with my hoodie and my 'fuck you' flip-flops, you pretentious douchebag!""<br/><br/>The Social Network is definitely the best movie of the year, about the substantial growth of the disreputable but well-off website, Facebook. Everything was magnificent, with the well-written screenplay of Sorkin and great direction of Fincher, its simply the best. People did give second opinions about this movie (being about facebook), but the Social Network is the complete opposite of what they thought.<br/><br/>This film is set in 2003, about a Harvard sophomore named Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), that comes up with an idea (while ""intoxicated""). And creates a website that allows you to rate the hotness of girl in Harvard dorms, which reaches 200,000 views and brings it's attention to the Winklevoss twins. They meet up with Mark and tell their idea of making a social network, using ""Harvard.edu"". Thinking that he can do better, he meets up with his friend, Edwardo Saverin, and decides that they will make the website instead (splitting the share 30/70). when Facebook gets around, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), creator of Napster, wants to get in with the project, and gets a warm welcome from everyone except Saverin.//<br/><br/>I don't want to tell you the whole movie (even though you probably already know), so I think I'll stop there. The Social Network was directed by the one and only, David Fincher (Zodiac, Fight Club, Se7en, and more), and is his absolute best work. The best acting would have to be tied with Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield, showing their best support for a movie. I wasn't surprised when I found out that Peter Travers (Rolling Stone) said that this was the best of the year, and it should of won the Grammy, instead of Kings Speech. But it did win the Grammy for best soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, for film editing by Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter, and for the adapted screenplay (of course) by Andy Sorkin.<br/><br/>In the two-disc collectors edition, it shows Fincher's distinctive technique in film making. Shooting the first scene for ninety-nine times, David's patient directing tries to make this movie be perfect as possible, and of course, is successful. Fincher and Cronenweth made a great choice using the best High Definition quality so far, by RED Digital Cinema. It interests me a lot that almost every known movie coming out recently, is being filmed in RED. I looked it up and most of the products they sell is well-over 20,000 dollars (must be really good). They're using it again while they reunite to work with a new remake of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", which I have high hopes for.<br/><br/>Andy Sorkin's adapted screenplay is one of the most intelligent and skilled I have seen so far. Nonetheless the screenplay being so complex, it must have been complicated for the editors (Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter). But by cutting all the camera angles and showing everybody have their spotlight, they succeed and win an Oscar for their tremendous support. The costume design was nothing special, but is will put into, wearing the same clothing that they would wear in real life.<br/><br/>You can never get enough of The Social Network, watching it the thousandth time still gives me the same satisfaction as the first time, if not more. You can't miss a second of this movie! if you love this film as much as me, buy the two-disc collectors edition, because who wouldn't love over two hours of special features. <br/><br/>Eduardo Saverin: ""You better lawyer up asshole, because I'm not coming back for 30%, I'm coming back for EVERYTHING.""<br/><br/>Well-known scenes:<br/><br/>-After Eduardo finds out that his facebook shares has been diluted, he storms out the doors to confront Mark Zuckerberg. Andrew Garfield's finest performance. <br/><br/>-When Zuckerberg and Sean Parker are at a club, Sean explains to Mark about Facebook's next step. Even with the loud music almost covering their voices, the amazing script compels us to pay complete attention to what they're saying.<br/><br/>Actors to watch out for: Andrew Garfield, Jesse Eisenberg, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Max Minghella, and of course, Josh Pence."

","The real-life Facebook saga, beginning and ending with Harvard University student Mark Zukerberg, a computer nerd permanently dressed-down in T-shirts and a sweat jacket, who turned one drunken night of blogging about his ex-girlfriend into the top networking site on the web. The success of Facebook, an internet phenomenon currently worth some 25 billion dollars, did not come to Zuckerberg easily, what with his best friend and CFO squeezed out early on; twin Harvard athletes and their business manager suing Mark for stealing their idea; and Napster co-founder Sean Parker appointing himself Zuckerberg's unofficial business manager. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, adapting Ben Mezrich's book ""The Accidental Billionaires"", keep the past-and-present action moving lickety-split; no corners are cut, though the duo speed so quickly at sharp angles that viewers could easily get lost in the shuffle if not paying rapt attention. No problem, as Jesse Eisenberg (as the curiously ever-complicated Zuckerberg) gives one of the finest performances of the decade. Supporting cast, including Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, and Armie Hammer (playing both Winklevoss brothers), are excellent as well. Films like ""The Social Network"", which are predominantly made up of conversations over action, run the risk of becoming bogged down in talk (or, worse, repeating themselves). Fincher is highly adept at creating inner-tension within his scenario--so that the picture is never boring--and substituting visual thrills with vicarious thrills. This is a smart, prescient, tightly-edited piece of work, one with the sting of defeat as well as the sting of success. Winner of three Oscars: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Film Editing. *** from ****"
"RyaZacShu","10","1","3","16 October 2011"," A Destined Classic
","When I had first heard of a project in the works which would cover the founding of Facebook, I was both slightly amused and annoyed. How could Hollywood allow such a movie to be made that tells such an uninteresting story about one of the biggest social networking sites of this decade? However, after seeing Fincher, director of a number of great movies including Fight Club and Seven, being named as it's director and Aaron Sorkin, writer of the West Wing, is assigned to write a screenplay based off the book The Accidental Billionaires, I was somewhat intrigued due to my respect of both of those individuals. And even after seeing the spectacular and alluring trailer which featured a beautiful rendition of the Radiohead's song Creep, this film was suddenly on my fall must-sees. After my first viewing, I was calling this the film of the year, and after more viewings, this film has become one of my personal favorites.<br/><br/>I believe that you can capture a film's mood and essence just in the first scene. So I'll start my review there. We are thrown into a conversation between two college students: Erica Albright and our supposed protagonist Mark Zuckerberg. Just by this conversation, I am presented with everything that is going to occur later on in the film: Acapella groups, rowing crew, a break-up, and a condescending, asshole genius that is set on joining a Final club just for achieving notoriety. Just by this conservation, I am introduced to the quick and insightful dialog that will follow throughout he rest of the film, along with the breakout performances from both Jesse Eisenberg and even Rooney Mara (who steals the only three scenes she's in). With this scene, I realize that this film is not about Facebook at all, but a film about how people in the modern world communicate and how money and greed can lead to betrayal and the spoiling of a friendship or business partnership.<br/><br/>As I said before, there is a break-up. Erica Albright (Rooney Mara), once realizing that her boyfriend, the computer genius Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), is a jerk, dumps him in a hazy bar, leaving him mortified. So Mark gets revenge in the only way America knows how to do now: by trashing her on the Internet! After this, Mark, with help from his fellow programmers, decides to create a site that compares girls at Harvard based on their hotness. This causes Harvard's server to crash in a night, attracting the attention of two future Olympians, Tyler and Cameron (both played by Armie Hammer) and their friend Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). Hence, they present Mark with an idea of a dating site in which girls are able to interact with Harvard guys, hoping that he will code it. Instead he takes this idea and comes up with a better one: a social networking site among college students that closely resembles Final clubs due to their exclusivity. After leading Nerendra and the Winklevoss twins on while he launches his site, he goes to his best friend, Eduardo Saverin, for some start up money in exchange for a guaranteed business partnership. But the story is told in nonlinear fashion, jumping between the Winklevoss law suit AND the law suit from Mark's former best friend Eduardo to Mark's rise to power through the creation of Facebook through a series of flashbacks and flash forwards. We are then left to wonder the origins of such law suits through what we are presented.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, the dialog and screenplay is perfect, award-winning stuff. Each scene carries some sort of significance, while each line serves some sort of purpose and insight. Sorkin really did a great job by tackling a somewhat questionable subject matter and turning it into a profound sense of writing. My hat first goes off to him. Secondly, I have to recognize the brilliance displayed by Fincher here for his use of camera-work. First and foremost, the lighting is a visual treat for me, perfectly capturing the cold darkness of a chilly October or the haziness of a college bar in the opening scene. Also, I have to mention the editing, which keeps the interest on screen with numerous shots, some even adding a sense of humor to the film which was unexpected for me, with the canoe race being a notable scene. But Fincher also played a hand in the acting, since this film is filled with young stars. Eisenberg has shifted from the whole Michael Cera-like comic nerd persona evident in Zombieland to a serious dramatic actor. Justin Timberlake, who portrays Napster founder Sean Parker, may be an even bigger surprise with his indulgent, but paranoid playboy. Andrew Garfield is also strong, along with other supporting acts like the amusing Armie Hammer and the scene-stealing Rooney Mara, which I now see why Fincher cast her for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Also, the score, by Nine Inch Nails Trent Reznor and AtticusRoss, is perfect for this film. Dark and eerie, and memorable during the opening credits with it's screeching violins and soft piano keys.<br/><br/>With all these thoughts in mind, I think that this film is a destined classic because it functions on all these levels so well. After multiple viewings, this film has become one of my favorites and will hopefully endure the difficult test of time."
"Nuz_Reviews","9","1","3","26 July 2011"," Insanely good. Way better than the actually Facebook online.
","I actually wrote this review right after I saw the movie in theaters. Maybe like the second or third day it was out. I never knew that a movie about Facebook could be so amazing. I had low expectations and they were in fact superseded times a hundred. Since this review I have seen the movie at least one more time in theaters and about four or five times on DVD with different people or by myself.<br/><br/>Here is the review:<br/><br/>Music. Besides film and sports, my favorite thing ever is music. Although I do not enjoy all types of music, I do try to respect them. Although, nowadays it's hard to. Music is constantly changing with the people. Unknown to me, two musical composers, one from England (Atticus Ross) and another America (Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails), teamed up to create The Social Network's soundtrack; its kind of a post- industrial, experimental, ambient sound. I must say that it's amazing. I downloaded it the night I came back from seeing Social Network. It's hard to find such a solid soundtrack these days. Always using the mainstream music. That was nice to hear.<br/><br/>Also, the whole story of The Social Network is so intriguing and awe- spelling. How Facebook came to be is such an interesting process and story told. It's also one that only Mark Zuckerberg can understand, played by Jesse Eisenberg, whom is great per usual. He really knows how to play that nerd well.<br/><br/>The writing is so smart, quick, and witty too. The screenplay was done by Aaron Sorkin , he also did the popular television show entitled The West Wing. I'm definitely going to have to see this movie several more times to not even come close to comprehending it all. The general gist is there, but I feel like something will always be missing. The whole idea of the internet leading to all this social networking is changing our world as we know it and how we live, hopefully its for the better and not worse. As a marketing major, it was also interesting to see this movie from that perspective. Its making our advertising much more integrated in the social experience.<br/><br/>We also got to see the new Spiderman in this movie, Andrew Garfield. I thought him and the majority of the cast did a job well done. Everything in this movie was superb. I can't wait to see it again.<br/><br/>""Insanely good. Way better than the actually Facebook online."" ~The Nuz Journal<br/><br/>9/10 Stars."

","I truly do not understand why people like this film. Yes, the actors look good. So what? Yes, the performances are credible. So what? Were the characters worth learning about? No. They were all jerks, who I would just as soon have seen pummeled to death. Was there a story here worth watching? No. Did the movie illuminate something important about the human condition? Not a chance. Yes, the internet is important, including Facebook. But that doesn't mean that it's at all interesting or important for us to see how it was done. The film is technically proficient (which is why I gave it a 4), but it isn't good story telling. There's no story here worth the telling."
"theoryneutral","4","1","3","25 January 2011"," Low-Budget Feel
","This film doesn't have the advantages of a documentary because it isn't factual and it does not have the advantages of an entertaining drama because it is directed with all the excitement of a low-budget documentary. The film would be enjoyed just as thoroughly as an audio file. No visuals. Because there is nothing to see.<br/><br/>If the subject matter were not centered on an institution everyone cares so much about, this movie would never have made it to a second showing on the big screen.<br/><br/>This is one of those few times one wishes there were no minimal word requirement to these reviews. Some films are simply not worth the energy."

","The film that you should watch if you have nothing else to do. No story, no cinematography. That is it. One of millions of mediocre films that should deserve no attention at all. But as the name of website that wastes peoples' times, force them into false relationships andcheating stands behinds it then understandable to why it draws GoldenGlobe's and others attention. Don't be surprised if it gets Academy Award too. It is really a shame for Dave to come up with something like this, certainly not to be compared with some of his masterpiece films. I wonder when directors will stop thinking about money and fame (at least after getting enough of them) and try to create their own style and think about the people."
"thekyles99","4","1","3","17 January 2011"," Another movie favoured by everyone...except me!
","Sadly enough yet another movie that everyone is going to love and i will be when asked if i saw ""the face book movie?"" question going "" meh it was alright!"" So many movies that people rave and rave about that i have seen myself, it actually makes me wonder sometimes if its just me or does anyone know what a good movie actually is? Sure i'm a Facebook fan and have a profile in fact that's how i type out all these reviews i do for flixster. The story itself is a remarkable one about one man's luck and the battle for corporate greed that ensues. A solid cast, i'm getting more impressed with Justin Timberlake the more i see him as he seems to be upping his game as well as Jessie Eisenberg who portrays Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in this film. It pretty much swept last night's golden globes and from what i hear they are a prelude of whats to come for the big night at the Oscars. I personally am rooting for The Fighter myself as i enjoyed it way more than this. Maybe 'im too old fashioned...who knows?"
"themoviewatcher97","10","1","3","8 January 2011"," One of the only films that is perfect in every way
","Yes,''Inception'' may be an outstanding film, but it had its flaws. Despite some flaws, it could have still been, in my opinion, the best film of this year, but one Friday night I dragged my friends off to see ''The Social Network'', not really knowing if I was going to see a dark buddy comedy or a boring narrative. Regardless, I hoped it would be a night of me cracking jokes with my friends at everything I found funny in the film. Instead, from the rapid-fire witty dialogue at the very beginning, I said nothing for the whole two hours. From the funny but intelligent break-up scene to the sadly moving ending, ''The Social Network'' is a director and a screenwriter at the top of their talent. David Fincher's notoriously perfectionist direction ensures that every frame of the film is beautiful and emotionally full, and Aaron Sorkin's witty but never pretentious script is, like the movie itself, without a single flaw. Jesse Eisenberg succeeds at making a character you feel guilty for sympathizing for, a true jerk who betrayed friends to create what may be one of the most significant inventions of recent memory: Facebook. Andrew Garfield adds depth to your usual clueless friend, who ends up throwing a sad, dark rage when he is back-stabbed once Justin Timberlake steps in as the radical Napster creator who helps Eisenberg's undergrad genius take the site to a new level. The score, made by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, is absolutely fitting with the film, as it is quiet, modern and sometimes very intense. ''Social Network'' embodies what has become of our society: ambitious, but in the process, alienating and maddeningly ironic. The style and substance of the film are each top-notch and glowingly real, creating what is a rare occurrence in Hollywood: a masterpiece that is, in all sense of the word, perfect from its sleek surface to its depressingly emotional core. Definitely deserving of the Best Picture Oscar and a place in every moviegoer's mind."

"FilmFanatic03","6","1","3","28 October 2010"," Great visual style and acting.....but why make it so dirty and immoral!
","First off i want to say that the look of this film was very sophisticated, it was very stylised in looking fresh and stunning. Also Jesse Eisenberg was beyond amazing as Mark Zukerberg. He really played the role of a person with a lack of social skills with intelligence very well and he stole the show, without him this film would not have worked. Justin Timerlake was really good as well, his character i am not a fan of but still, he acted really well in this film. The rest of the acting was good as well. Andrew Garfield acted OK in this film, not to be praised as much as Jesse but still a good performance. But why did he have to be the one who blasphemed throughout the whole movie! I think i have stated the positives of the film, but what really ruined it for me was the immorality found on this film. There were lots of party scenes where lesbian kissing took place, provocative dancing, drinking of alcohol, explicit use of drugs, swearing, some rude scenes. This really tainted the film and you could have done without it. It should have had a 15 rating, it's a 12A so even a 8 year old could watch all that filth...that is a disturbing thought. A thing to note is that it felt that the film had no narrative structure, this is not necessarily a criticism but it felt that it was hard to see where the film was going to end up. Yes there were flashbacks and it was a bout a court case, but it felt the film was all on one level. It felt like going on a journey with the characters which was interesting. the film had great style and acting but it was tainted by the filth in this film."
"markgorman","10","1","3","17 October 2010"," The morality tale for the 21st century we've all been waiting for.
","It's not hard to imagine that a biopic of the creation of facebook - a project that isn't even complete as its rise to world domination continues unabated - could be monumentally bad. For a start all of the characters in the movie are real, alive and known litigation junkies. In fact the structure of the film is built around litigation.<br/><br/>What's more, it's set in geek land, and it's populated by America's landed money generation; a class of kids who are not exactly imbued with likability. Add to that the layer of egotism of successful entrepreneurs, that has to be applied if this is going to be a true reflection of the situation. And early on the movie dwell on a scene where the two key characters get off on the creation of an algorithm in a Harvard dorm and we're in a place that has to be bad; does it not? Well actually, no it doesn't, in fact I can't recall a biopic with such historical realism that betters this magnificent creation.<br/><br/>David Fincher is a director of some impact. Fight Club and se7en, to name but two of his grisliest creations, typically hit you hard from the off and keep on hitting. Not the sort of director you'd expect to be behind a successful exploration of coding in the Ivy League's finest Halls of residence. But what Fincher does is dial back the excess and zone in on a cast of young people that somehow creates a magnificent and fully fleshed ensemble whilst giving Jesse Eissenberg the star vehicle that at its core it has to be. His portrayal of Mark Zuckenberg has to be seen to be believed. And believe me you'll believe it. This is direction and acting of the highest calibre.<br/><br/>The establishing scene of Eissenberg in a College Union bar being dumped by his lifetime love Erica Albright (played gently and beautifully by Rooney Mara) is jaw-droppingly good for three reasons; the camera work (subtle and gorgeous throughout especially the tilt shift effect later in the movie in England's Henley), the dialogue (well what did you expect, Aaron Sorkin wrote the script) and the acting. And that's it. We're off and running for nearly two hours where the action never stops for a second and yet,; not a swear word is heard, no fights, no sex, no nudity, no special effects - so how can this be an action movie? And yet it is, it's hilarious (but there are no gags, no slapstick) and it makes you think from start to finish. Because what Fincher and Sorkin have achieved is a morality tale for our time; not with the big crass in-your-faceness that Wall Street revels in, but in the intellectual ethics of IP. Wherever you look in the movie you're challenged to think who was right and who was wrong.<br/><br/>IP changes hands and evolves at such a dizzying speed that one wonders was it the germ of the idea or its evolution that created Facebook's value? Was Napster creator and serial entrepreneur Sean Parker (slyly played by Justin Trousersnake) a bandwagon-jumping opportunist or the real creator of Zuckerberg's ultimate wealth? Was Zuckerberg an impressionable but lovable innocent or a self-centred traitor to his only friend Eduardo Severin (also played sympathetically and at times the axis of the movie by Andrew Garfeild)? Was Severin a philanthropist or a pariah and were the Winklevosses (I lied there are special effects in this movie) real? I particularly liked the fact that Sorkin and Fincher avoided the temptation to rip into these ridiculous stereotypes , and in so doing, and gave them at least a shred of dignity by the film's end.<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention the stunning soundtrack by Trent Reznor (NIN)? Well, if I didn't I should have because I'm going to buy the CD as soon as I've finished this review.<br/><br/>This is a very good film indeed. It most certainly justifies a ten rating and I urge you to see it."
"chuck-reilly","9","1","3","13 October 2010"," ""The Social Network"" gives Nerds a bad name
","Balzac said that ""Behind every great fortune is a properly executed crime."" According to David Fincher's film, ""The Social Network,"" that statement fits his story all too well. In the first ten minutes of the movie, he firmly establishes that the lead character (Harvard sophomore Mark Zuckerberg played effectively by Jesse Eisenberg) is an unlikable, back-stabbing egomaniac nerd. His girlfriend breaks up with him in a noisy campus bar for being an (expletive needed) and his idea for revenge is to dash back to his dorm room and write a blog about her flat chest. In the middle of this nonsense, Zuckerberg decides to create a website for rating Harvard women. The project proves so popular (22,000 hits in a few hours) that Harvard's network crashes. He becomes a temporary college hero for his efforts and is soon enlisted by some of the school's elites (a twin pair of clueless WASPs from the rowing team) to finish the development of a ""Harvard Connection"" type of website for campus-use only. As Zuckerberg later tells his lawyers, ""The came to me with a good idea, AND I HAD A BETTER ONE.""<br/><br/>What transpires after that initial meeting with the WASP twins is unsettling and a chain reaction of events leads to a myriad of law suits and permanent bad blood. Zuckerberg destroys the relationship with his only friend and roommate (a Brazilian rich kid named Eduardo played by Andrew Garfield) who unwittingly funds the project. Eduardo has no idea that Zuckerberg's big ""IDEA"" is not his own and remains in the dark for most of the proceedings. He also evolves into the only main character in this sordid story who deserves the audience's sympathy. The clueless WASPs (played by Arnie Hammer with some trick camera work) finally end up suing Zuckerberg as does Eduardo when they all reach the boiling point. One of the best scenes in the movie is when the twins arrange a meeting with Harvard president Larry Summers and ask for his help and guidance in the on-going dispute. There is none forthcoming and Summers is portrayed as the ""bureaucrat from hell"" and more under-handed than Zuckerberg, if that's possible. In the middle of all this is Justin Timberlake as Napster founder Sean Parker. He's the worst one of the entire bunch and nearly makes Zuckerberg look semi-good. He wants to get in on the action with the now-renamed ""Facebook"" and ends up owning 5% of it for virtually doing nothing other than stabbing some people in the back and handing out some free cocaine. <br/><br/>As the final reel clicks in, Zuckerberg is sternly advised by his lawyers to write a lot of checks to everyone involved and settle out of court---which he reluctantly agrees to do. According to all reliable reports, he signed over a few billion dollars to the plaintiffs, but he retained the lion's share ($25 Billion). Besides making Zuckerberg look like a total bastard, director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin have nothing good to say about Harvard's elitist system and pecking order which reserves all the privileges for the wealthy and well-connected. They emphasize that much of Zuckerberg's misguided passion and revenge in creating Facebook is due to his frustration of being an outsider and for his total lack of any social skills. In other words, the greatest invention in history for on-line Social Networking was developed by a friendless nerd. It's kind of funny and ironic when you think about it. The end result is a great film about some very disagreeable persons with the exception of Garfield's character. The movie should garner some Oscar nominations including Best Picture. Highly recommended."

","I've been hearing the phrase ""It's only a movie"" probably before I even began watching movies. When I was younger it was to make sure a film didn't scare the sh*t out of me before going to bed. Now more so in reference to fact checking, especially if the film is based off a true story. ""The Social Network"" is one of those films where I had to tell myself ""its only a movie"" before going in, having some prior knowledge of the true events.<br/><br/>In knowing this ""The Social Network"" being based on a true events, embellishes and manufactures certain aspects of the plot and changes character traits/motivations in order to achieve the best cinematic experience possible. It's a good study on how a film can take a basic, somewhat mundane story and tweak it until it's a perfectly structured, neat little package. The movie, partially-based on the book, ""The Accidental Billionaires"" by Ben Mezrich, is supposedly itself part fabrication because Mezrich never interviewed the film's protagonist and founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, as well as most of the book being debunked by other Facebook insiders. The film's Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, is a brilliant but angry, egotistical, arrogant asshole who comes off as knowing he would be a billionaire even before writing the first line of code for Facebook.<br/><br/>Anyone who knows the real Mark Zuckerberg says he's actually a nice guy who rarely gets angry. David Kirkpatrick, author of ""The Facebook Effect"", said ""Zuckerberg is one of the least-angry people I've ever met."" This might be the most glaring disparity between the film's story and the actual one. And although it is an obvious Hollywoodizing device, using it was a wise choice, considering how well this movie performs under the skewed, yet perfectly executed screenplay. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin never met with Mark Zuckerberg either — purposefully. He knew transforming him into a cruel and unrelentingly ambitious prick was the unapologetic direction needed to fuel the plot. Sorkin said, ""I don't want my fidelity to be to the truth; I want it to be to storytelling."" And even in the script he admits every ""creation myths need a devil"". So with that in mind, Sorkin's Zuckerberg became an ambivalent anti-hero - an emotionless machine only driven by success. <br/><br/>Machine being the operative word, and most obvious and cliché parallel; Sorkin and director David Fincher make it clear that Zuckerberg is so talented on his machine because he thinks and acts like one. There were a couple of times where I couldn't help but compare Zuckerberg to Bill Gates, not only because there is a direct reference to him in the film, but if you've seen ""The Pirates of Silicon Valley"" there are more than a couple similarities between the two, especially in their cutthroat methods in empire building. But I suppose this is true for any genius/inventor who knows when it's there time to strike the iron. Thomas Edison, one of the most cutthroat inventors of them all said it best: ""Success is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration."" The real Zuckerberg might have done it cleaner than the rest, but it doesn't mean he can escape being dragged through the dirt for it"

Unless you've been living on a deserted island for the past few months, I'm pretty sure you've heard of this movie. It focuses on the founding of and legal battles over the social networking juggernaut Facebook.com.<br/><br/>If you have been following the hype surrounding this film, you might believe this is the greatest story put to film since Citizen Kane. The honest truth is, it might be. The film has a lot of talent behind it, starting with director David Fincher, in a fine return to form after the saccharine Benjamin Button. Right there with him is noted screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who ably adapts the book The Accidental Billionaires that chronicled the rise of Facebook. Fincher assembles a great cast of young actors, led by Jesse Eisenberg as Facebook creator and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Joining him are Andrew Garfield (the new Peter Parker) as co-founder Eduardo Saverin, Justin Timberlake as Napster co-founder and early Facebook acolyte Sean Parker, Armie Hammer in the dual role of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who had a similar idea to Facebook that they approached Zuckerberg about, and Rooney Mara as Zuckerberg's ex-girlfriend, Erica Albright.<br/><br/>The actors are uniformly good, with Eisenberg and Garfield standing out amongst the others. They handle Sorkin's trademark rapid-fire dialogue with ease and are very convincing as these real-life people. Eisenberg as Zuckerberg eschews the Michael Cera-esquire persona he's developed in films like Zombieland and Adventureland. Here, he creates a man conflicted by his desire for recognition and his ruthless drive to achieve that recognition. Garfield makes Saverin an immensely likable and sympathetic character, Zuckerberg's best friend and partner who sees his vision of the company get destroyed as outside parties move in.<br/><br/>While Eisenberg and Garfield stand out the most, perhaps the most impressive was Justin Timberlake. He plays Parker as an manipulative opportunist, a man who has already tasted success and wants more. He's introduced to us waking up in the bed of a girl he barely knows and who doesn't know him at all. For Zuckerberg, Parker is everything he wants to be, attractive, funny, charming. The best scene for Timberlake occurs in a San Francisco nightclub where Zuckerberg and Parker discuss the future and potential of Facebook. Parker becomes an almost Faustian character, planting the seeds of discord that will eventually lead to the demise of Zuckerberg and Saverin's partnership and friendship. It's a seduction scene and it's done brilliantly.<br/><br/>At its heart, The Social Network is a story about two friends who go into business together and how that business destroys their relationship. Fincher breaks up the story a bit, moving back and forth between the early days of Facebook and meetings with lawyers that came later. You can see the pain and heartbreak on both actor's faces as the square off against each other, flanked by their respective lawyers. Watching their friendship slowly fall apart, you can't help but feel for both, as they perfectly complemented each other. Saverin is the more approachable, social comfortable half, the one that can deal with the public. Zuckerberg is the anti-social introvert, obsessed with pushing his creation.<br/><br/>Another element of the film added a lot to building the tension needed for movie's emotional payload to be delivered. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross create a great score that works brilliantly at underscore just what is happening in the movie. While it does become a bit obvious at certain points, for the most part Reznor and Ross's score is subdued, breaking out at certain points to enhance a certain emotional beat. It's a key component in the film.<br/><br/>As the first in what looks like a rather promising line up of fall films, ones that will be vying for awards season accolades later on, The Social Network is a substantial effort. It hits just the right note and is a fairly accurate reflection of the times we live in and how communication and interaction, the various social networks we engage in, are evolving at an ever-accelerating rate. The Social Network doesn't serve as a warning about this, nor did I really see it as a cautionary tale. It's a fascinating story, told impeccably well. http://tinyurl.com/2ddrf8j"

I realized that a lot of people disliked the film because it did not fully ring true to the real life events, however, people who feel this way are missing the point. While the people depicted are real people and the main events are routed in truth, TSN is its own film and therefore should be treated independent of the real story.<br/><br/>This is easily, whether you hated the movie more than death or whether you loved it more than your own mother, among the top 10 greatest written films in the history of cinema. Every line of dialogue cracks and sizzles with a creative and brilliant fervor. It is smart, quick, witty, and more importantly, it moves the story along through all of its brilliance. Some people thought that the dialogue was convoluted and more pulp than anything, but I am of the conviction that anyone who criticizes the writing lacks the intelligence to see its merit. This review is only on the writing, because if I was to cover every great thing about this film I would never stop writing."

","All I can say about The Social Network: talented but wasted actors (Garfield and Eisenberg) and director, no plot at all, a full of clichés about the youth of nowadays, bad politic and judicial approach. Such a beautiful soundtrack made by a musical genius that this movie really don't deserve: another wasted element in a piece that have nothing to say, just a common story with common speech. I think that The Social Network reveals a not innovative way of marketing and divulgation of Facebook, belittling what CINEMA really means. It's just a ""movie"" for facebookaholics, with some curiosities about how to make profits with no scruples."
"seaview1","10","1","4","25 February 2011"," The Phenom of THE SOCIAL NETWORK
","As a chronicle of events leading to the creation of the social networking site Facebook, touching nearly every computer user in the world, The Social Network is a fascinating take on Mark Zuckerberg, a maverick, whose brilliant mind is matched by his arrogance. Directed by David Fincher (Se7en, The Fight Club) from an excellent screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men, The West Wing) and based on the book, The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, this is a fascinating study of a success story complete with intrigue and subterfuge. In this case, the incidents play on a very human level. You would think this would make an excellent made for television HBO movie, but Sorkin and Fincher have created a remarkable, cinematic vision of an inventor, albeit a troubled one.<br/><br/>In the fall of 2003, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is portrayed as a computer genius at Harvard University with few social graces. What we know now as Facebook had its modest beginnings as a response to a failed relationship with a girl. Needing to vent some anger, Mark modifies a campus website and with the help of his buddy, Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), a concept is born for socializing on the internet. When web traffic to the site spikes to record numbers, people begin to take notice, and a phenomenon is born. A group of Harvard students enlist Mark to develop his site with their financial backing, but when they discover that he is working on his venture without them, they become incensed and contemplate legal action. Mark and Eduardo become popular 'rock stars' on campus as the new Facebook spreads like an epidemic to other college campuses like Yale, Columbia, and Stanford. Soon, the company approaches critical mass and the milestone of being able to monetize the site and turn a profit. Napster creator, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), reaches out to the growing network because he understands its vast potential. Mark becomes enamored and captivated by Sean's leadership and vision and is drawn to Silicon Valley much to Eduardo's consternation. But with Sean's guidance comes his lavish, illicit lifestyle which has potential consequences for all. As the company expands to the whole country and becomes a global presence, it seeks more capital, and the ensuing growing pains will test friendships and lead to betrayals and litigation. By the end, everyone is suing to get a piece of the action. We're not talking millions of dollars at stake but staggering numbers that far exceed normal comprehension.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg (Adventureland, Zombieland) is perfectly cast as Mark Zuckerberg, a high energy geek running around a snowy campus in his shorts and flip flops and is quick to respond to his critics with venomous sarcasm. Making us fascinated with such an unsavory character is testament to his performance. Justin Timberlake is excellent as the charismatic entrepreneur Sean, who is portrayed as a narcissistic, lecherous Svengali and mentor to Mark. Andrew Garfield lends very strong support as Eduardo, Mark's roommate.<br/><br/>The film's pace is rapid and driven, not a slow spot at all. Its structure incorporates flashbacks and flash forwards in a masterful display of film editing. The story works as a kind of techie mystery especially from the point of view of a legal deposition that frames the events of the past. Every major player gets a scripted point of view Rashomon style. All through the narrative, you keep wondering if Mark knows more than he lets on. Is he naïve or is he a schemer or both? Was the betrayal of Eduardo orchestrated by Mark or was it the machinations of Sean? It is never truly clear as to Mark's culpability. This is success, but at what price? There's very little to gripe about in this film. A short scene with Eduardo's psychotic girlfriend is shocking but ultimately pointless. Were the filmmakers trying to show his poor judge of character? Also, I noticed a scene where the actors talk in the supposed cold with digital condensation coming from their mouths; so how come the extras don't have any? A major subplot showing Eduardo's initiation to the elite Phoenix Club never makes clear whether Mark had a hand in his acceptance.<br/><br/>With its fascinating subject matter, the script begs your attention and participation. Sorkin has done a marvelous job of bringing a book to life and complemented with Fincher's acumen. The dialogue is stunning in its blatant display of Zuckerberg's intelligence and rebellious streak. The result is a chronicle of a techie generation with not one false note and a thoroughly engrossing screenplay that has Oscar written all over it. Fincher is proving himself to be a great director when given superior material, and his branching out from thrillers to more mainstream fare has been remarkable (as in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button). One can only wonder the goodies that await movie audiences as he explores further."
"JoshuaDysart","6","1","4","25 October 2010"," Dishonest to the last frame.
","This film is so desperate to sex up the life of a code-nerd with Asperger syndrome and ram home its banal theme (the man who created Facebook has no friends) that the truth, complexity, and to my mind, fascinating aspects of the real story gets thrown under the onrushing bus of one dimensional fiction. It's a hit job on a pack of real human beings and their motivations. Tonally, thematically and factually dishonest to the last frame. Good music though, and Eisenberg deserves the praise he's getting.<br/><br/>The very source of this film is suspect. The book it's taken from was solely the revenge creation of Eduardo Saverin who approached the author after Saverin felt he had been jilted by Zuckerberg. The book was a revenge hit that left out facts, defamed people and made no attempt to interview any other parties involved in the matter. It was considered a joke and was never taken seriously by either the tech-crowd or the press. Now the movie hits and has Saverin being the good guy and Sean Parker - who actually helped Facebook grow into what it is today and is still a behind the scenes consultant, not to mention one of the most influential coders of our time - as the bad guy. <br/><br/>I don't think Sorkin or Fincher have any clue about the code-monkeys who have changed their world forever, and if they do... they certainly don't seem to care enough to make real, complicated, ambitious art about them."
"jboothmillard","8","2","13","18 October 2010"," The Social Network
","Being a member of Facebook myself, it was right that I should see the film about the creation of it, from Oscar winning writer Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing) and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated director David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button). Basically on an Autumn night in 2003, nineteen year old Harvard student and computer genius Mark Zuckerberg (Zombieland's Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jesse Eisenberg) spends most of his time in the virtual world. He invented a little website in his school called ""Facemash"" where people are given a choice of two faces to vote which of the two is the hottest, and this rapidly has thousands of hits. The school authorities have a word with Mark about it, but his high hitting website gets the attention of Silicon Valley's Winklevoss twins Tyler and Cameron (both Armie Hammer) who want his help in creating a new big website. Mark is initially up for the idea, but this meeting with the twins only fuels his ideas for his own big website, a social networking website for the school called ""The Facebook"" to make friends, add personal information (including relationship status), exchange messages, spread your opinions and much more. With the funding of Eduardo Saverin (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Andrew Garfield, who I knew was replacing Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man), the website is officially put online in 2004, and very quickly it becomes a big talking point in the school. With the high hits Mark and Eduardo decide to pass the website to a few other schools, and the attention increases more than anyone would have thought, even getting the attention of Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). Sean is offering to make ""The Facebook"", shortened to ""Facebook"", even bigger, turning it into an official worldwide social network earning not just profiles, but big money. Of course the financial success of Facebook has a problem in the form of the Winklevoss twins, who are campaigning with the law against Mark, claiming that he stole their idea, with emails and phone calls as evidence. Eduardo also filed a lawsuit for reducing his share in the company, in the end, Eduardo does get a good settlement and the credit he deserves as co-creator of Facebook, and the twins didn't get what they want, and Zuckerberg continues his success. Also starring Joseph Mazzello as Dustin Moskovitz, Rooney Mara as Erica Albright, Rashida Jones as Marylin Delpy, Brenda Song as Christy Lee, Max Minghella as Divya Narendra, Patrick Mapel as Chris Hughes and John Getz as Sy. Since the creation in 2003 and official launch in 2004, Mark Zuckerberg has become the youngest billionaire in history, and deservedly so, it is nice to be seeing a film about really recent and global news, and about a phenomena that has changed the world of knowledge and socialising. Eisenberg plays the young Zuckerberg really well, the supporting cast, especially Garfield and Timberlake are great as well, the direction is really focused, and the script is fantastically crafted with dazzling wordplay and interesting subjects of loyalty and greed. I could just about follow the legal lawsuit stuff, and for me it was most interesting to see how Facebook and all its components were created and became a technological advancement, first time I watched this I admit I thought it perhaps overrated, but having seen it properly it is indeed a defining film for it era, a terrific biographical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Editing, Best Music for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Cinematography and Best Sound Mixing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture. Very good!"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","14","11 January 2011"," Fincher Doing Facebook? He Makes It Work
","Social Network, The (2010) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Terrific look at Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), the man who would become the youngest billionaire due to him coming up with the idea for Facebook. The film follows the creation of the website all the way up to the litigation's of two lawsuits from people claiming Zuckerberg either ripped off their idea or ripped them from money rightfully belonging to them. I'll admit that I'm not on Facebook and I knew very little of its ""history"" when going into the film. I'll also admit that I found it strange when I first heard someone like Fincher would be doing a movie about a website but after viewing THE SOCIAL NETWORK is becomes so clear why the director would be interested in the material: Zuckerberg is a terrific scumbag and one brilliant villain. Perhaps not knowing the story of the people involved helped but I believe even if you do know the story then you'll still be blown away by this movie simply because of how masterfully directed it is and how brilliant Fincher tells the story and gets his words across with such simple ease. The closing shots, which I won't ruin, say so much about the Zuckerberg and one could argue that these closing shots say more than anything leading up to the shots and I'm sure these shots are more damning than anything you could read in a two-thousand page biography. Fincher has the ability to jump back and forth from various aspects of the story but the main focus is on how the website came to be and how Zuckerberg had assistance from his best friend, Eduardo (Andrew Garfield) who would eventually sue him. Seeing how brilliant their minds were would make some think that the story would lose you but instead the screenplay by Aaron Sorkin perfectly lays out everything that went into creating it and everything that could possibly cause it to crumble. When you think about it it's really hard to come up with an interesting movie about a computer programmer but Fincher pulls it off because he structures it like a thriller and one can't help but feel as if they're being pulled into a dirty game with the villain willing to cut throats for his own ego. Eisenberg is downright brilliant as the Facebook creator and what amazed me is that I'm fairly certain the actor really isn't as smart or brilliant as the man he's playing yet he's still able to pull it off. There wasn't a single frame in the film where I didn't believe he was this young genius but what impressed me most is how cold he could be with that stone face of his. Buster Keaton was considered the great stone face of his era but I'm sure he'd even be impressed with what Eisenberg could do with the way he'd simply look at another person. Garfield is perfect as the ""other"" guy and Justin Timberlake continues to impress. His performance as the seedy Sean is perfectly brought to life by the actor and no matter what you feel about his ""pop"" reputation you have to give him credit here. The music score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross seems like something you'd here in a horror film but it perfectly sets the mood and atmosphere here. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth perfectly puts you in the film and the editing is exceptional as well. THE SOCIAL NETWORK is winning a lot of awards and it's certainly easy to see why. I think the majority of people were scratching their heads when they heard Fincher was doing a movie on Facebook because it just seemed unfilmable and uninteresting. What he's done with the film is something extremely special and I'm sure many decades from now people will be looking at this film to see the time capsule, which was this social networking days."

","I'm not a movie expert but I know a bad film when I see one. Me and a friend decided we would go and see it in the cinema, and eventually we left, even having paid an unworthy amount to see it. I was struggling to keep my eyes open.<br/><br/>Even though it was deftly made, and it had a good storyline (based on a true story, and interesting for those who like that sort of thing), there was some mediocre acting. And the score, even though it was... different; in my opinion, it did not deserve the Oscar compared to some of the scores nominated that year. Albeit very interesting,I thought it was somehow repetitive and slightly boring.<br/><br/>Personally I cannot see how in the world this film has been so critically well claimed when masterpieces such as the Shawshank Redemption have scores as low as 50 on Metacritic, whilst this has no less than 95.

"ElMaruecan82","10","1","5","7 May 2011"," You don't get to the greatest idea of the century, without having a great film made of it ...
","After his disappointing ""Benjamin Button"", Fincher handles another subject, no less risky ... Indeed, I thought a movie dealing with algorithms and a courtroom case would be anything but entertaining ... how wrong I was!<br/><br/>The film actually depressed me  because THE idea of the century has already been done. There won't be any other great and creative idea for about 50 years, and the guy who got it, is from my generation  hell, I'm even older than him. Sorry for that burst of ego, but I guess the purpose of a review is to be sincere  <br/><br/>Intelligence? Creativity? Luck? Maybe all these factors combined can fulfill a vision, but not one worth billions of dollars, I don't believe in that. Mark Zuckenberg, played by a remarkable actor with a rhyming name, Jesse Eisenberg, was a genius, and his paternity of Facebook is undeniable. As he dryly shouts to the Winklevoss twins, played by the two, no wait, the one Arnie Hammer: ""If you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you'd have invented Facebook"" Implacably and impeccably logical. Mark is not just the hero of the film, he's MY hero, and whether I approve the concept of Facebook or not, is pointless. He's got a successful idea, that changed the face of the world, more than ever. He won, and I applaud.<br/><br/>Now, why did I use the word genius? Because it takes a three-dimensional intelligence to have such an idea. Mark felt an even greater potential in Internet, not exploited yet. Internet was the key. He knew people loved social networking, they needed to exist, to be somebodies. Internet puts you in a map, literally. ""I click therefore I exist"" this is the Cogito of the 2000's. Mark got that. That's from the past, from the present, he understood the natural tendencies we all have to reach popularity. ""Existence precedes popularity"" Popularity as the modern essence of human beings, this is the existentialism of the 2000's. Finally, he knew, that in the future, users will want to know about stuff happening to people they know, with an almost voyeuristic approach. There's no real philosophy to describe this, but this is what Mark predicted. We'll never know if someone would have come with the same idea  well, maybe the Winklevoss twins, but they were destined to inspire Mark, with the Harvard network idea The twins were number two, translation: nothing.<br/><br/>Past, present, future combined in one hell of a visionary concept named ""The Facebook"", Mark's friend, Eduardo (Andrew Garfield) financed it, and the creator of Napster, Sean Parker, Justin Timberlake in a scene-stealing performance, was the mentor, the adviser, whose greatest contribution was to suggest to remove the ""the"". The rest is a whole success story told in flashback from the hearings opposing Mark, the twins, and Eduardo, whom he personally fired through an unfriendly move. Nothing personal, strictly business. The movie is not here to judge Mark. The tag-line summarizes it best, anyway: ""You don't get to 500 millions friends without making a few enemies"", probably the most memorable tag-line of 2010, so iconic it's the only one to be featured in the poster in such big characters.<br/><br/>It's all about self-confidence and capability to take painful decisions. Mark is irreverent, eccentric but he does have one quality: he respects people on the basis of their own accomplishments. He mocks the courtroom because no one is capable to produce something in the same vein than Facebook, but he respects Sean Parker for what he created. Tell me what you did, and I will respect you, or at least have the humility not to judge me. This notion of respect is crucial because this is what will drive his creative process, the ability to listen, and to translate any idea into a concept. When a wimpy student comes to ask him if one girl is single or not, Mark realizes that ""Facebook"" concept is so big, it's like a goldmine for new ideas and improvements. It's such a great success story that he even learns from case that failed, or worse, that succeeded after the creator sold the rights, like the 'Victoria Secret' story.<br/><br/>This film proves how ruthless is today's world, how we can make it big if we think big. We're indeed in an animal farm, with insects, sheep, and outside, foxes, predators. Some people just want to be successful businessmen, some other just to live, others to be accepted. Some use their strength, others their brains, and other their looks, like girls, or chicks whose sexist portrayal didn't bother me  I studied in a campus, in the same time as Mark, a big business school with hot girls and guys so sinister they were already masturbating over working in some big companies, and I know they got now the girls they fantasized about, but they're still obedient agents of a system that prefer to handle sheep rather than foxes. I had enough intelligence to understand this modern Social Darwinism, like many other free-spirited nobodies, but Mark had the idea AND the competence.<br/><br/>Yes, Mark got the point, but again, it wasn't enough, please stop with all that 'luck' bullshit. I'm not a genius, I'm not Mark, but I know that I'm no computer pro, so even if I had the chance to think of the concept, I wouldn't have enough knowledge to apply what I wanted. Would I get the Nobel Prize of Medicine just because I thought it would be cool to find a cure for AIDS? Mark was practical, pragmatic, and had enough intelligence to build a strong competence in Internet. <br/><br/>It might be a drama for some, a biopic, for me it's a great story driven by a creative script, and a true inspiration ..."

"meeza","10","1","5","7 October 2010"," My friends, this is the best movie of 2010!
","Please do not ignore my following movie review of the grand masterpiece ""The Social Network"". Yes, I will confirm that there will be plenty of corny puns ""like"" in my other movie reviews; but you don't get to 500 million puns without making a few enemies. ""The Social Network"" is Director David Fincher's captivating tale of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's creation of the infamous social network and it has my affirmation as the best movie of the year. Fincher's precise direction first connects with Zuckerberg as a Harvard University student in 2003 when he develops ""Facemash"", the ""who is the hotter Harvard gal from the two"" site that dismayed many of the Harvard fems, but was a major hit with so many hits on campus. Zuckerberg got facemashed out of angst of being dumped by his girlfriend one Fall evening in 2003. ""Facemash"" also proved that Zuckerberg had no problems hacking away in the Harvard network. Facemash was the genesis of what turned out to be the social networking book of all, Facebook. Zuckerberg partnered with his only friend on campus, economics major Eduardo Saverin, to develop Facebook- a social network website where (you know what it is! Hello!) The rest of ""The Social Network"" logs on to the rise of Facebook, and the legal depositions that sucked in Zuckerberg by those who claimed that the Facebook idea was theirs; including the Harvard rowers Winklevoss twins and their diva pal Divya Narendra, and even Saverin himself takes a swing at Zuckerberg in this Boston Sue Party. The opportunistic Napster founder Sean Parker also gets in the picture not as an angry plaintiff towards Zuckerberg, but as one that makes his mark on Mark by seizing opportunities to put Facebook on the profit map. If you are still reading this and are not a napster falling asleep on me, Facebook me! God Bless you for putting up with the puns. Speaking of which, I am running out of puns so its time to hit the Punbook. OK, I am back on ""The Social Network"" serious (sort of speak) review state. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay of the movie is an ingenious film libretto that delivers in not only characterization but also in authenticity of today's social taxonomy in and out of the net. Moreover, Sorkin's script highlights the thin line between friendship and ownership. Sorkin is in for a Best Screenplay Oscar nom. Director David Fincher takes Sorkin's words into the vision of the narrative that makes it a tour-de-force triumph that will also place Oscar nomination status for King David. The thespian network of ""The Social Network"" were not lagging on to mediocrity, they were exemplary. Andrew Garfield was terrific as the gullible Saverin; Armie Hammer & Josh Pence sure hammered it down in playing both Winklevoss twins in two parts, head and body; Rooney Mara was all marvel & bright as Mark's ex-girlfriend Erica Albright; Justin Timberlake was bringing his fine acting back by delightfully loading down another commendable performance in portraying Sean Parker; and Rashida Jones's work as legal assistant Marilyn Delpy was all legally not-wrong in my book. But it was Jesse's world! Jesse Eisenberg's starring performance as Mark Zuckerberg is by far one that should be posted by the Academy as the one to beat in the Best Actor Oscar race. Eisenberg portrayed Zuckerberg with such an authentic multilayered mode that its thespian algorithms formulated Jesse in the elite club of today's best young actors. There is a lot more to ""like"" of ""The Social Network"" that could be depicted in my review. But it seems that I have received a request to end my review, which I will do. ""The Social Network"" is a cinematic magnum opus that will connect to many members of the movie-going industry and many members of the movie award industry. It is the movie event of the year that should be attended by all! ***** Excellent"
"ilovespecialbrownies","10","1","6","3 October 2010"," As good as it's hyped!
","As the summary says, The Social Network is just as good as it is hyped up to be! The acting is brilliant, as well as the screenplay and David Fincher's usual genius as a director. Now for starters, Jessie Eisenberg. Eisenberg gives his best performance since The Squid and the Whale, and it could quite possibly pass that to be his best performance ever, though at the beginning of the movie I found his character difficult to like because of how socially awkward he was but the character of Zuckerberg grew on me as the movie went on. This movie has been receiving quite a bit of Oscar buzz lately, and one of the categories it has been receiving much of is best supporting actor for Justin Timberlake, and rightfully so... He was simply wonderful, for me his performance really put the movie over the top from a pretty good movie to a great movie. Of course though the movie is not perfect by any means, despite the fact that it is about the youngest self made billionaire and how it's about facebook, the story is your typical rise and fall film. It's not all that original. <br/><br/>Oscar Buzz: This movie will certainly be nominated for a few Oscars. Here's the list of what I think it will be nominated for...<br/><br/>Best Actor- Jesse Eisenberg Best Supporting Actor- Justin Timberlake Best Director- David Fincher Best Adapted Screenplay- Aaron Sorkin Best Film Editing Best Sound Editing Best Sound Mixing Best Cinematography Best Picture Total: 9 nominations Of these 9 nominations, I believe it will win two. I believe Aaron Sorkin will win for best adapted screenplay, and Justin Timberlake will win for Best Supporting Actor... As for all the best director/picture/actor buzz... I think we all have forgotten about this little movie called Inception ;) which is my pick to take home all the big awards this year considering it's fantastic reviews and dominating box office performance, as well as the fact that the whole reason there are ten nominations for best picture is because The Dark Knight wasn't nominated for best picture, and Nolan wasn't nominated for director. The academy does have the tendency to hand out sorry we didn't give you this last time awards, which will probably happen with Inception because of how robbed Nolan was at the 2009 awards."

At first i was crossed. Fincher making a movie about facebook? Sounds a little gay if you ask me. Then i heard that Justin Timberlake was now on board. Then i really started to question Mr. Finchers true motives. But as time rolled on, i read more of the details about the production, and the fact that Trent Reznor had now signed on to conduct the musical score made the views i had of this film change drastically. I am truly in limbo with this movie, it could honestly go either way.<br/><br/>Did you ever see the Oliver Stone movie ""W.""? You know, the one about George Bush? Well even though the movie wasn't spectacular, i thought that it did i fine job of focusing on the material, rather than looking to point fingers. And that is exactly what this movie accomplished. Rather than wield a hatchet and accuse people of being a bunch of cry babies, all it does is observe everything with a microscope....and it does it in the grandest fashion. Attention to detail is no new thing to David Fincher. He has already proved his worth with ""Zodiac"", probably the most detailed and accurate serial killer movie ever made, so it's really no surprise for him to repeat the same process with this movie.<br/><br/>Once you get past the incredibly fast paced dialog and computer phrases that i have never even heard of, you slowly get sucked into the story. And it's kind of hard not to. I mean, almost everyone we know does Facebook, so in a strange little way, we can all relate to it and we are intrigued by how it all started. But this film doesn't rely on that. In fact, i totally forgot that it was even a facebook movie at times.<br/><br/>The story is very fast paced, and doesn't have one scene that makes you shift in your seat due to boredom. And to me, there are two reasons why this movie was pulled off......First, the script is pure genius. It's smart, it's funny, it's serious, and still maintains this constant intelligence. It would be a major shocker if this wasn't nominated for best adapted screenplay, let alone with the category. And second, is the acting. To me, Jesse Eisenberg was always that guy who try too hard to be like Michael Cera......but i kid you not when i say that he has probably put on the best performance i have seen so far this year. As of right now, he is my front runner for best actor of the year. Secondly, i would like to extend my apologies for ever doubting Justin Timberlake's ability. Yes, i thought he did a great job in ""Alpha Dog"", but i still had some doubts, but i now regret ever thinking them. He really went above and beyond in this.<br/><br/>Bottom Line....yep, the movie is damn good. I wouldn't say it's the best movie i have seen so far this year. But it certainly deserves to be in the top 5. But even if you somehow find this movie to be a bit dull.....you should still go, just so you have something to compare other movies to at the Oscars.....because this movie will probably be getting a ton of nominations."
"jgregg42","8","1","8","1 October 2010"," Jason Gregg Likes ""The Social Network""
","I know it is pretentious of me to place my name in the title of my review. But, after leaving David Fincher's film ""The Social Network,"" I could only feel arrogant and overly confident. The movie has a strong, young cast of characters who play their roles with enormous confidence that radiates off of the screen.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook, with such unwarranted cockiness I wanted to punch him in his smug little face in the first 10 minutes. The film brings us closer to see more than the hyper-intelligent boy genius and by the end, I wanted to add him as a friend on Facebook or at least ""like"" him.<br/><br/>David Fincher (the director of ""Fight Club,"" ""Seven"") and his screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (screenwriter for ""The West Wing,"" ""Charlie Wilson's War"") based the movie on the book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" by Ben Mezrich. Facebook and the actual Mark Zuckerberg wanted nothing to do with the film.<br/><br/>The story begins in 2003 at a bar where Mark is being dumped by his girlfriend, Erica Albright (played by Rooney Mara). This one opening scene sets the over-analytical persona of Mark for the entire film. Is he arrogant? A bit. Is he too smart for his own good? Definitely. Does he understand that his intelligence can make others feel inferior? Only after he sees what he has done does he feel any type of remorse or regret.<br/><br/>After being dumped, a hurt Mark goes back to his dorm, has a few drinks and starts blogging about how much he despises his new ex-girlfriend. All in one night he develops a Web site where Harvard classmates can rate the attractiveness of other students and the site crashes Harvard's computer network. Not bad for a night's work.<br/><br/>Through his actions, Mark garners the attention of a set of twins, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer), who are starting their own Web site similar to MySpace and Friendster. They hire Mark to help develop the site and grow it into something that they could never do on their own. And here's where the trouble begins. Mark begins to play both sides of the field to borrow startup money from his best friend, Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield), and at the same time he takes the Winklevoss' initial idea to develop his own site.<br/><br/>Since Mark Zuckerberg (the actual guy) and Facebook have distanced themselves from the film, it has intrigued many people to want to know more. That is going to be the driving force behind the box office sales. To better illustrate this point, there is a scene in the film where Zuckerberg and Eduardo meet with the founder of Napster, Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake. Added sidebar: I think it is great that Fincher had someone from the music industry play the guy who was responsible for ripping off that same industry). In this scene, the trio is discussing how to market Facebook. Eduardo wants to get advertisers on board ASAP while Mark and Sean wants to let Facebook grow before they start trying to make money off the deal. Let the users determine the growth of the product. Fincher and Sorkin did the exact same thing with the promotion of this film. If Facebook said yes to the film then it would look like a Pro-Facebook campaign. Start a conflict, let people think that this is Facebook's dirty little secret on how it all started and the rest will take care of itself.<br/><br/>About halfway through, you start realizing that this film is no longer about Facebook, in fact it could be a story about any product or service on the market today. Fincher doesn't spend much time focusing on the actual Web site. He focuses on Mark's two legal depositions that are happening simultaneously and the human and financial wreckage caused by his actions. This film is simply about greed and the want for more. Not necessarily more money, that wasn't Zuckerberg's intention when he started his site. He wanted to fit in with the rest of us. He couldn't find an opening to the exclusive clubs on Harvard's prestigious campus so he stared his own club.<br/><br/>Should you see this movie? Yes. But, not because you have a Facebook profile that you like to update every hour. This film is not about Facebook. This is a captivating lesson in human relationships. It is a window to the deep, dark soul of capitalism. It's about living with past regrets."

","I must confess I'm not a fan of Facebook . I have a registered account featuring some photos of my travels and previous work place and that's about it . I don't have any friends on my page and have no interest in adding anyone and I'm totally perplexed why so many sane intelligent people spend so much time treating it as some sort of yardstick for real life success as in "" Oh I've got 439 friends on Facebook therefore my life is much better than someone with less friends "" while at the same time feeling bitter towards people with more "" friends ! FFS get a life . Have I mentioned I'm not a fan of Facebook ? This film based on Ben Mezrich's book on the founding of the website and the personal and legal ramifications that came with it shouldn't in theory hold much appeal to me as a potentially hostile audience member but I gave it a chance <br/><br/>For the most part it is an engaging and involving drama , perhaps more so than I expected . Mark Zuckerberg sets up a website called The Facebook featuring illumine at his University and the more the network expands the more he finds himself becoming more unpopular with erstwhile friends . It should be remembered that most of what the film entails is nothing more than rich American students taking the huff with one another but director David Fincher keeps everything vaguely compelling . Much is this is down to the score by Trent Raznor and the soundtrack did remind of Clint Mansell's music for REQUIM OF A DREAM , one of my favourite soundtracks . Where the film is less successful is the rather overwrought manner in what is at stake . Again let's be honest it's not like the fate of the Universe is one the line and despite what many people might think it's not like Zuckerberg has genuinely changed the world . As it stands THE SOCIAL NETWORK is a well made drama but not much more than that"

"filipemanuelneto","5","0","2","2 June 2020"," An average film that was blown by publicity and some criticism.
","Well, this review is going to be hard to do, at least for me. Of course, like anyone who was young in the past decade, I also succumbed to Facebook's hypnosis and I still have an account on this social network, but I confess that I haven't been there in months and I haven't spent much time there. This spell that Facebook, and all other social networks, could have on me has long since lost its effect. Today, and I will be very honest in what I am going to say, I see no reason to spend hours stuck to a social network, putting likes on posts, commenting or talking to other people. Now, let's talk about the film itself.<br/><br/>The film is not bad, but it is far from being something I want to see again. The plot addresses the process of creating and developing Facebook and the legal struggles that Mark Zuckerberg faced after that. Directed by David Fincher, it is quite weak in its task because, as it happens a lot with films based on real facts, it creates a new fictional story over real people. I know this is cinema, creative freedom is part of cinematographic art but, as I said in a lot of other reviews, there are logical limits to that freedom when dealing with real people and, worse, people who is still quite... alive.<br/><br/>The cast has a lot of easily recognizable names and most have made a very positive effort. However, not everything went well. The way the characters were thought was what most irritated me. If some are stupid teenagers, others are opportunists, and there are still a lot of smart assholes. There is virtually no character we can like and that blocked my interest in what I was seeing. Thus, we have Jesse Eisenberg in the shoes of Zuckerberg, but in such a negative way and with so bad material that the character is inedible. He is a complete jerk, unable to capture the audience's sympathy. Dakota Johnson, Max Minghella, Rooney Mara and Joseph Mazzello try to help, however they have little to do, once the film is delivered to Eisenberg. On the positive side, we have the good performances of Andrew Garfield, who gave life to Facebook's first CFO, as well as Justin Timberlake, who was very good in his role too. Armie Hammer surprises by giving life to twin brothers in an impressive and realistic way.<br/><br/>Winner of three Oscars (Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Original Song), it is technically a capable and decent film but not impressive. It has regular cinematography, sets and costumes and, despite the prizes, the soundtrack did not impress or attract my attention.<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't even understand the visibility given to this film. I don't think it justifies it, and maybe it was very stimulated by advertising and the media (convenient for the social network portrayed, isn't it?)."
"schizoidnightmares","3","0","2","26 May 2020"," Fiction masquerading as a true story
","Yes, Mark Zuckerberg is a real person. Yes, he is one of the founders of Facebook. Yes, he went to Harvard. Yes, he did actually create a site that had people rank university students on their level of perceived attractiveness. No, it had nothing to do with getting revenge on any girl. In fact, the site also included pictures of male students, who were also subject to ratings. The site was up for only a weekend. Mark accepted responsibility and apologized fully.<br/><br/>This film depicts him as a promiscuous man, at times showing him to ogle his interns. This is total fiction. Mark began dating student Priscilla Chan at Harvard, who is far from a groupie (there was never any groupies)... She is a pediatrician and has a medical degree. They married back in 2012 (two years after this film was made) and have two kids together. The depicted personality of Mark in the film is fictional to the point of absurdity.<br/><br/>Mark did not ""steal"" Facebook from the Winklevoss brothers. The idea of online social networking already existed. Mark did not deprive them of anything. He simply lost interest in their conception of a social networking site, and focused on a better one. As I am not familiar with these brothers, I cannot say if how they are portrayed in the film is accurate or not. Most probably not.<br/><br/>A year after this film was released, co-founder Eduardo Saverin fled to Singapore after renouncing his American citizenship in order to avoid paying hundreds of millions in taxes back to the society he had profited so much from. He is a multi-billionaire today, worth an estimated $11.3 billion. Mark had decided to push Saverin out of the company due to his apparent lack of cooperation with Zuckerberg, although the exact details are protected by non-disclosure agreements.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is well-acted, directed, but it's not a biography, and would be better suited for maybe satire, or alternate history. And a pretty nonsensical one at that."
"hemantamaity-74337","3","0","1","2 May 2020"," RIVIEW OF THE SOCIAL NETWORK
","Guilty or innocent? You decide. Yes, that's the USP of David Fincher's compelling biopic which paints an intensely human picture of the entrepreneur who ended up facing messy law suits which showcased him as a mean, me-centric, Machiavellian man of questionable morals. Yet, he remains a hero-figure you can't end up hating, despite his flawed personality and his ambivalent ethics. And that's the hallmark of all great story-telling. For, when it comes to human drama, there aren't any unadulterated bad guys and good guys. Only flawed-and-fine guys. Remember Shakespeare?
There are so many interesting nuggets in the film. From Zuckergberg's first attempts at creating an interactive site as an act of vengeance against his girlfriend, Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) to his encounter with Napster's knight in shining armour, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the drama hurtles across with breakneck speed. You can almost feel the energy pulsating through the untidy dormitory -- or the crummy house in Palo Alto -- where a hoodied Zuckerberg hobnobs with his handful of friends to juggle with codes and numbers to create the next big thing after Google. And all through the amorphous wonderland, our hero waltzes like a wide-eyed Peter Pan, lacking all the social graces that define the Harvard pack. All he cares about is creating the 'coolest' site that is 'freakishly addictive', without giving a dime about money and the moneyed life. He never does give up his hoodies and his flip flops and remains awkward with girls till the very end, preferring to spend his evenings wired up in solitary splendour. Or in desperate loneliness, wondering if he should send a friend request to the girl who dumped him on his first date....
The high point of The Social Network is its super screenplay (Aaron Sorkin) where every dialogue becomes a quotable quote. The exchange between the lead characters is witty and vibrant, carrying forth the drama with a throbbing intensity. And the performances are simply splendid. Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg is absolutely riveting. For the actor treads the fine line between good and evil with supreme balance and he never does trip, not even for a minute. Andrew Garfield's Eduardo is adorable, adding flesh and blood to the best buddy syndrome, while Justin Timberlake's Sean Parker proves that the singer needs to urgently shift focus from the stage to the screen. He's mercurial, magical and deliciously mean"
"insidenetwork5","8","0","1","24 April 2020"," Surprisingly good
","A seemingly boring fact (""computernerd designs popular website"") becomes in the hands of a master director a dazzling and energetic drama with fantastic renditions of the entire cast. This seemingly physical role also made me aware of Jesse Eisenberg for the first time, and every time I see him in a later (or earlier made) film, I still have to think about this role for a moment. Compliments also for Justin Timberlake as the slick Sean Parker, but as said, all the actors are great. The complex narrative structure doesn't stand in the way of the clarity of the plot at all and keeps the film captivating at all times, cleverly exposing all points of view. Those who ignore The social network ""because they don't have Facebook after all"" miss out on something, if only because the film is not only about Facebook but also about friendship, social status, the problems surrounding intellectual property and the temptations of corporate business."

","Over the years, I have fallen in love with David Fincher's creations. The taut storylines, unconventional characters and above all the unexpected twists, had characterised Fincher's films for me. 'The Social Network ', on the other hand, seems to be a deviation from his usual genre of films. The movie is again, about the background story of one of our beloved websites or applications. Naturally, this unusual combination was quite intriguing. The screenplay, at first, is quite difficult to follow. It makes the viewers keep on guessing about the track that the movie is going to follow. Few minutes into the movie, the non -linear screenplay gradually starts making sense and at the end of two hours it presents us with one of the best 'storylines'(or it can be said interchangeably as 'screenplay') in the recent times. It tells brilliantly the thought process and actions that had gone behind in establishing one of the successful organisations today, which though brilliant and ground-breaking, is sordid and ruthless in equal parts. It is very hard to describe who has put forward the best performance in the film. The acting, the minimal background music and all other associated acts offer such a continuum of experience, it sucks the audience inside and make them feel as a participant of the events that had taken place."

As we know there was a privacy rule, right. I suppose with this film it just broken. And i think maybe this was Mark's apology. Yes the apology that has David Fincher sign on it. But don't you think that Facebook deserved it? I simply think it deserved. We are talking about the site that changed all of our social behavours, relationships and links. Yes today in 2020 facebook is not the most popular thing among young people but the idea of it identified our life style. I wanna support my idea with a scene from the social network.

","This movie is pretty much about the first years of Facebook, when it was pretty much a cleaner version of Myspace and more open to free speech. While it was well-made, it was made much too early. Facebook a few years after this movie got made has pretty much gone down the dumps. Whether it's left-wing political bullying by friends, utterly uninformed right-wingers spreading misinformation, moderators punishing users with up to 30-day bans, it's a site with one foot in the grave. I really don't understand Facebook's rationale for who gets banned and who doesn't, I know some crazy people who never get banned while I get banned for speaking my mind about community issues.<br/><br/>The Zuckerberg in this movie would have been horrified at what is going on now. If he did this at the beginning, Facebook wouldn't have taken off. It would have gone down. Now they are a giant enterprise and can basically run anyone out of the business. There is no competition. No one will go use the competition. It's a sad state of affairs. I haven't used or participated in social media for years. It was nice while it lasted but I can see that people are tired of it and it's a fad that has passed.<br/><br/>I don't know how well Facebook is doing. I still get asked to friend people on the site but I keep telling them I don't use it anymore. Kids in high school still use it, although kids at some schools claim they don't. Some of these kids do nothing but post fights and violent stuff on there, but while I get banned for sharing what I observe everyday at work, no wacky, controversial opinions, they are free to do this with few repercussions.<br/><br/>The site is garbage. When it has to shut down, I will throw a party. If a sequel is made, it will have to detail how Zuckerberg let power get to his head and ruin a good thing."

","When there was news that David Fincher (Director of Fight Club and Se7en) was in production of a biopic of Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg, it certainly peaked a lot of interest and curiosity. Focusing on the creation of Facebook by Zuckerberg in his early years (played here by Jesse Eisenberg) and the rise and fall of his collaboration with friend Eduardo (Andrew Garfield) it's a really gripping and engaging thesis on morality and the importance of true human interaction in which the dramatisation of this story depicts very thoughtfully. After watching I was intrigued on what Zuckerberg actually thought of this biopic as it doesn't paint him in a particularly bright light. I see it as more of a dramatisation than an actual account of real events whether they were or not and its themes are explored masterfully. It made a star out of writer Aaron Sorkin who previously had written A Few Good Men, went on the direct Molly's Game and write the equally brilliant biopic Steve Jobs! The quickfire dialogue instantly draws you in from the beginning in which you have to really pay attention to what the characters are saying but the flow becomes second nature once you're engrossed in the story. Beautifully scored by Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) and Atticus Ross who have worked on Fincher's works ever since, it's a really powerful soundtrack that is at times darkly groovy (try the track A Familiar Taste) experimentally fun (their version of In The Hall Of The Mountain King) and incredibly tense (Gentle Hum Of Anxiety). Performance wise Eisenberg and Garfield are great; Jesse particularly shines in a lawsuit scene where Mark is losing patience with everyone around him. Garfield's performance is measured perfectly and builds up to breaking point towards the end where his character finally says what he needs to say. It's directed with a non-fussy and straight to the point eye; stylish but unpretentious. Fincher has a very distinctive almost gothic look to his films while remaining very natural. A career highlight for many of the filmmakers involved"

This is unanswerable question i understand he was creative but What would the other path would lead? if it wasn't this way, i find biographical movies interesting so we need to take a look at this section because they always end up with a message for you, highly recommended if you want to experience others, 8/10⭐"

","The Social Network isn't just my favourite David Fincher film, it's one of my favourite films of all time. It's not quite in my top twenty, but it's just outside of it. In fact, I have watched this film many more times than some of the films that are inside my top twenty.<br/><br/>On paper, a film about the creation of Facebook shouldn't be one that I find myself revisiting all that often, but it all lies in the remarkable direction from Fincher and the incredible screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. The interactions between all of the characters are engaging, and I couldn't get enough of the storyline.<br/><br/>I don't know how accurate this film is to the real events, and some have even suggested that it isn't all that factual, but that doesn't bother me. I was still completely wrapped up in the journey of these characters, both in the present with the lawsuit and the past with the actual invention of Facebook.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield turn in one of the best performances of their career, and everyone else does a remarkable job in their roles. Fincher always manages to bring out the best with the talent that he has, and The Social Network is no different.<br/><br/>I absolutely love everything about this film, and it would have been my front runner to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards that year, if it wasn't for the fact that Toy Story 3 came out in the same year as this. I can't promise that everyone will love The Social Network on the same level as me, but I strongly recommend you at least give it a shot.<br/><br/>SCORE: 100%"
"LauraAnnG","Null","0","1","23 February 2020"," Fascinating even if it is only partly factual
","""The Social Network"" is now ten years old. It's already ancient history in tech years. Anyway, it was enjoyable. I watched it via Comcast On Demand and I could not fast forward thru the endless, repetitive, commercials, which became oppressive.<br/><br/>It is an interesting movie. I haven't paid that much attention to Zuckerberg, or really how Facebook was created. So I found it fascinating. I'm not surprised I suppose that Zuckerberg is portrayed as a monster, at least in some ways. It comes with the territory. I knew a man who was a developer during the dot com boom, and there's a lot of craziness going on here that I recognized -- that I lived through, in a way. Those were strange times. They were strange people. It was weird and bizarre. There will likely never be anything quite like that again.<br/><br/>And the whole connection with Sean Parker (Napster) was news to me. Like I said, strange times. Also -- it was funny: the actor playing Parker looked oddly familiar. Hah! It is (of all people) Jusin Timberlake. Who is quite good. So is Andrew Garfield. Eisenberg is just wonderful and I think did a great job in the role.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic. It's an ensemble cast that shines. The music is wonderful. I have nothing bad to say about the movie. It was worth watching, even while being tortured by commercials every ten or fifteen minutes.<br/><br/>Here is it ten years after the movie was made and Facebook -- well.... it has over 1.5 billion members."
"Dello_","8","0","1","23 February 2020"," An entertaining ride about the creation of the social network that changed the world
","I found ""The social network"" a very engaging movie about the personal life of Mark Zuckerberg during the period in which he created Facebook. The rhythm is fast, the dialogues are mostly quick and there's some dry humor too. All this fresh taste and the fun experience come at the expenses of telling the real story because I think that the plot has a lot of fictional elements in order to be more entertaining. Clearly the main events surrounding the creation of Facebook are real but the details and the general way in which they are told is ""freely inspired"". But it's ok because its purpose isn't to be a documentary but a fun movie and it surely is the case. There's also a bit of exploration about the themes of friendship, loyalty and the fight for power and richness. Suggested."

","The Social Network is a generation defining film, one that only comes around so often, telling a mostly true story about something that has effected a multitude of people from every varying demographic. I can't go on to say if this is David Fincher's best movie to date, but it's easily his most poignant and relative, even almost a decade later The Social Network is even more provocative and relevent than it was in 2010. Through the power of film David Fincher gives us an important history lesson, while being wildly entertaining, funny, and intense, focusing on and mastering his craft, solidifying his aesthetic for future projects to come. The performances are intense, intricate, and spot on, each one specifically written with their own agenda, there's nothing sloppy about Aaron Sorkin's writing, it's fast, it's exciting and it's just plain great. David Fincher has been pushing boundaries through his filmography, but The Social Network is where he fully breaks through. Creating his dense atmosphere with beautiful, stylish cinematography, with a masterfully perfect, ethereal score from two masters of the music industry. The Social Network not only stands the test of time, but proves that it only makes this film more important while the age of technology is ever growing.
I give The Social Network 5 stars out of 5."

","Based on a novel telling the story of a guy who just became a phenomenon 3-4 years prior to the movie. I would suggest that they should have waited a mere ten years more just to include more dramatic law suits. What I'm trying to say is; yes the acting is amazing (I would definitely praise Andrew Garfield to no end), visuals are striking with a densely green/yellow pallet and even the music by Trent Reznor is extraordinary. The problem is the source material or the way it's told. It's just not very intriguing. The first hour was not able to keep me in line or interested enough and only in the second half the movie started to increase the pace (which is a major problem for a 2h movie if you ask me). I don't know how he is in real life (and I'm thinking he is probably pretty similar) but in here, Mark is a repulsive guy that is speaking fast and monotone hence we assume he is a misunderstood genius. Nope, what Erica said at the beginning was correct. However at the end of the movie, we as the viewer also get the same treatment and guided that he is ""not an prick, just trying too hard to be one"" which actually makes him more difficult to sympathize. And if someone says ""you were not supposed to sympathize with this Mark here"" then I would ask, why are we watching the life of a fast speaking, bickering and back stabbing prick who has no redeeming qualities, with the lack of an interesting plot. Not David Fincher's finest and definitely not worth the rating"

The dynamic duo of filmmaking that is screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher is a perfect collaboration that blends gifted nonfiction storytelling with artistic direction to give excitement and creativity in every scene. Fincher uses dark lighting, slick editing, and a beautiful musical score to deliver a brilliant story from the keyboard of Aaron Sorkin. Jesse Eisenberg (an actor I can't stand) gives a brilliant performance as Zuckberberg, nailing his smart-slick attitude with his entrepreneur behavior to give one of the most authentic biographical performances ever.

","At some point in the movie I smiled and thought I wasn't going to hate The Social Network. At that moment I had the rating at 7 stars. It's down to 6 because I found the manipulative herding by the movie annoying. As things got more mundane and people got richer, the story was about making Sean Parker the bad guy and Mark Zuckerberg not a good guy, but someone trying hard to be an a-hole. Rashida Jones' character tells us what to take away from the movie and that's not cool.<br/><br/>In the beginning I thought being exposed to Zuckerberg's mouthpiece and seeing the inner workings of Harvard was going to be intimidating. Zuckerberg seems to disappear from his own movie after some time. The power politics of Harvard were glossed over. For the success story of the youngest billionaire currently, there was not much debauchery on show. Now I'm not someone who watches movies for the sex scenes - I think not one sex scene looks credible, hot, or believable in films - but not one aspect of the film is focused on. The blame for this lies firmly at the director's door. Give me something to remember the movie, to make it stand out from other, sometimes better ones. Where's the guy who directed Se7en?<br/><br/>Now I don't use facebook. I'm intimidated by the games online and I'm disappointed by the interface whenever I happen to view a facebook home page. I didn't know who the founder of the company was before this film came out. The film's best asset was trying to make things ambiguous. It's a vehicular product that does not inspire me to write a good review of it. You know what, having rethought about what I've seen, I'll just downgrade the rating to a 5.

","The movies depicts the story of Mark Zuckerberg just before he invented his beloved social networking site, Facebook. It has some interesting anecdotes like how Mark Zuckerberg comes up with the idea for a relationship status and how inspiration finds him in the most unusual ways. The scene of the guest lecture, featuring Bill Gates, could be mistaken for a cameo appearance by the geeky billionaire but is NOT! Indeed, it turns out that Bill Gates is played by a look alike by the name of Steve Sires. The plot thickens later on in the movie when the company starts becoming successful and greed gets the better of our main characters.

"Aaron_West","8","0","1","16 June 2014"," An ostensibly perfect but unaffecting biopic that is both timely and possibly immoral.
","David Fincher's completely 21st century biopic turned investigation into society turned crime thriller. <br/><br/>Everything about The Social Network is seemingly, or at least, ostensibly perfect; Jesse Eisenberg is an astounding piece of casting, the acting is consistently believable, the direction and editing is solid bordering on great, the cinematography is grungy and dynamic, the score is tense, racing and sombre, the sound is precise, and the writing is witty, rapid and dense. <br/><br/>Yet, even with all this, it is not enjoyable or even impactful. All the characters are frustrating; Mark Zuckerberg is self-entitled and pretentious, the Winklevoss twins are elitist and enviable, all women are played to be less capable than the men and completely objectified and Sean Parker is opportunistic and manipulative. Even Eduardo Saverin, the only character the audience is capable of rooting for, is incapable of seeing the forthcoming chaos. David Fincher possibly did this on purpose, but that makes The Social Network successful rather than enjoyable or wondrous - resulting in a film that is little more than a particularly well constructed drama. <br/><br/>The overriding feeling when watching The Social Network is not wonderment, inspiration or awe, but instead resentment, anger and even jealousy. The society presented in The Social Network goes from an elitist and torturous fraternity, full of sexism and hierarchy, to a big-business talk filled silicon valley, to a cringe-worthy British rowing society, to a back-stabbing, hoody-wearing ""too cool for school"" pretentious world-playing international corporation - all of which perfectly eloquate an America that stands for everything I find deplorable. <br/><br/>Overall, if you are a member of the ""young hip"" society portrayed, or at least don't find it immoral, then you should find that The Social Network is a near-perfectly constructed astute drama. <br/><br/>But for me, I find the film merely respectable in craft, even if I physically hate watching it - few-to-no films have ever gotten under my skin and angered me so much. <br/><br/>It's social pertinence and timely delivery has lead some to compare it wrongly to Citizen Kane, when truly the only similarity is in premise. <br/><br/>As with Martin Scorsese, I find David Fincher to be more of a ""film-maker"" than an artist, and The Social Network is no greater example of that perfect in craft, unaffecting in execution."

Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher's best films, and that's from a director whose filmography is littered with gems. This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success, defeat, lies and deceit, and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past.<br/><br/>The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world's most popular websites. It's bam, bam, bam, with barely time to breathe, let alone get bored. Good performances are given across the board, particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield, two actors I'm normally disposed to dislike, both of whom are excellent.

We are adequately exposed in parts of this movie the genius Zuckerberg bears; one can specially not forget the scene in which the Harvard Professor asks his question to the entire class to which Mark walks away, spluttering the answer all the way and the Professor just has to say, ""that is correct.""<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is loaded with fine performances, delightful narration with crisp dialogues, well-timed sequences, and a genius script. The movie is breathtakingly fast and one has to constantly keep his concentration focused at the film in order to keep the pace, which is one of the best aspects of the movie. The film has sufficient supply of good acting, with Jesse Eisenberg as the leading man. He does his job - playing and portraying Mark Zuckerberg - and he does it with utmost zeal, doing full justice to the role assigned to him. It is no surprise to the audience why he won the Oscar nomination; rather it is surprising why he did not get it. Andrew Garfield plays the role of Mark Zuckerberg's best friend-turned-foe-and-then-friends-again-at-the-end-of-the-day Eduardo Staverin, and perhaps David Fincher could never have found a role better for him. The role fits him and he fits the role perfectly. The ""technically broke"" ""zillionaire"" founder of Napster, Sean Parker, is played by Justin Timberlake. Timberlake is good with the role, and he delivers it effortlessly. (Remember the scene in which he instructs Eisenberg to say, ""Sean Parker says, 'F**k you!'""?)<br/><br/>The sequences of the movie grasp you from the commencement of the movie when Mark gets a break-up from his girlfriend till the end in which the non-disclosure agreements are signed and the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, is sending a Friend Request to her on Facebook and is constantly refreshing the page to see if she's accepted it. In between, there is a lot of drama and thrill and you just can't miss this one. It is one of the best movies ever made in Hollywood, arguably. Flawless and pleasing.

"xxxloroxxxx","10","0","2","4 October 2013"," The trees won't let you see the forest!
","The comments of some people here remind me of the old saying that goes ""the trees didn't let him see the forest"". It appears many posters are looking for a deeper insight about life in general or for more human emotion in the characters at large. And these are not what The Social Network is about. This is a movie about business opportunity and entrepreneurship, not a personal drama. A movie doesn't need to be psychologically profound or dig deep into human nature to be exciting, refreshing and entertaining. And The Social Network is all of the above. This film is magnificent because it teaches us three very important lessons and does so while being fun to watch. <br/><br/>The first one is that, if you're smart and willing to work hard, there's no limit to how much financial success you can have regardless of how young you may be, specially if you live in the USA or any economically developed nation. There is a land where dreams can come true after all.<br/><br/>The second one is that there's usually a price to pay for such success, like the loss of trust and friendships for instance. It should be noted that the main reason most business ventures involving more than one owner go awry is because of the greed of the partners once the big bucks arrive. Before a company makes any real money the founders have nothing to fight each other for. This is a lesson no one who watches this picture will ever forget. And there's value in that.<br/><br/>The third valuable lesson is that you always have to watch your back no matter who you're working with. If you're too naive to protect your interests there will always be an opportunist, like Sean Parker or even your ""best friend"", around to take advantage. That's another didactic point that can help all of us in the future.<br/><br/>Besides the above, this movie is very well directed and even better acted. It has a very nice flow to it despite the constant cutoffs between the story (completely told in flashbacks) and the attorney's office squabbles. There's one more very important aspect to The Social Network: it's historic value. We usually only attribute such description to films that depict events that happened long ago. Right now since the movie just came out recently and deals with issues that have transpired in the last decade only, we fail to see that it, in fact, depicts history in the making. Many years from now people who watch it will understand how a completely new era in human communication came to be.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is also a reason for hope. If you notice no one ends up a big loser. Everyone gets something: even the supposedly wronged Winklevoss twins end up with a ""paltry"" $62 M settlement, money they didn't even really need in the first place anyway.<br/><br/>You don't have to like the characters in this movie, in fact I believe they were written to be despised by most of us. Mark Zuckerberg was not necessarily such a bad person but the reason of his success does not lie in his being the nicest guy in the world. There's truth to the fact that successful businessmen have to be driven, ruthless and yes, greedy. Whether we can forgive them or not for those shortcomings is a whole different story. Eduardo Savarin was too innocent, trusting and distracted in his pursuit of creating a global company. Sean Parker is a shark that sees the opportunity to make up for his previous business failures at the expense of Eduardo and others. So what's new? That's just life! But having little or no sympathy for the characters should have no bearing on how you rate this film. They're simply human beings with their flaws and weaknesses, as we all are. Tony Montana epitomizes what an extremely depraved and despicable individual looks like, but most of us still loved Scarface despite that fact. <br/><br/>Of course, every movie can always be improved but I sincerely believe the subject matter of this one is creativity, wizardry and entrepreneurship and not human emotion or innate goodness. From this perspective dwelling deeper into the characters' idiosyncrasies would probably have detracted from the point it tries to make. The Social Network is a fabulous flick and I consider it a must-see, specially for those looking for inspiration to get their business (computer related or not) off the ground."

When I compare his prosperity and his friend's relationship, I do not think his life is totally success story. Everyone wants to success in their life.

","THE SOCIAL NETWORK is very well-filmed, and though the dialogue is sometimes a little TOO ultra-witty, its fine acting helps to bring about an immediate realism. It focuses mainly on the legal complications and conundrums, i.e., lawsuits by Zuckerberg's fellow students at Harvard who played big roles in spawning and developing the whole idea of Facebook. I never would have dreamed it possible that someone could make a legal drama set mostly in depositions rather than trials work so well, but this film accomplishes just that--the fact that it's a true story certainly helps. It gives a well-rounded and convincing picture of the various entanglements Facebook went through in its early stages, also effectively showing how just about any large corporation-to-be experiences similar issues. While Zuckerberg is portrayed as less-than-likable, his precocity is hard to ignore, and THE SOCIAL NETWORK gives a very non-editorialized portrayal of him and all the other players here. There's also a lot of Ivy League-level girl-chasing, partying, and so forth, which, again, is shown so realistically that it's quite engrossing."

The acting was very good and helped with telling the story. The way the movie was structured kept the audience engaged and showed that to become an overnight success you need to sacrifice a lot to pull it off.

"paul2001sw-1","7","0","1","26 August 2013"," From bedroom to boardroom
","Steve Jobs didn't invent the graphical user interface. But he did produce the first implementation of one in which enough of the details were right for it to be popular. And Bill Gates (who makes a cameo appearance in this film) did not necessarily produce the world's best computer operating system. But his system became the first standard, and the advantages of using a standard system meant that once Microsoft was big, it was destined to become huge. Both of these factors (technical refinement and network effects) help explain the story of Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook. And while it's interesting to observe the fine lines that makes one person a billionaire whereas another goes bankrupt, it also perhaps tells us that the detailed biographies of those who happen to end up on top are maybe not that interesting or important. One might make an exception for Jobs who showed an uncanny knack throughout his career for shaping sector-defining products. But is Zuckerberg, whose social networking software happened to win out over the competition, really worth the attention? This movie, describing the story of Facebook's foundation, is perhaps most interesting because its participants, most of whom are presented badly here, are still alive (and indeed, young): I don't quite know how the script was steered around the lawyers, or how true it is. It's certainly quite fun to watch a tale of almost-schoolboy capitalists, hopelessly out of their depth when their business venture turns out to be worth billions (although this part of the story would probably work as well without the crazy numbers); and when the concept is so nebulous, the business so fluid, it's easy to understand the lawsuits which led to many people claiming that they really owned the company: in some senses, the business made itself. What does grate is the sense of self-assurance, and self-entitlement shown by the class of Harvard, all of whom are depicted as both arrogant and brilliant, when their most obvious merits are merely their own well-connectedness. Again, this may be true to life, but you won't find any socialistic moralising here. Instead, there's a snappy (though glib) script and a surprisingly breathless journey from the bedroom to the boardroom. It's a fun film if you like this sort of thing, but less insightful than it thinks."
"wangdichaoyang","9","0","1","28 July 2013"," It makes me feel deeply.
","This is the second time I see this film and it is better than the first time,(maybe because I understood more script lines this time). I applied for college last December and I didn't even tried to apply for Harvard. But like any other kid I wanted to be in that one school. So every scene of the first half of the movie is so beautiful and a little harmful for me, (which feeling I will again feel at the end of the 2 hours.) Like the Aaron I knew from The Newsroom, the screenplay gave a high speed climax at the beginning which is exactly what I thought a Harvard life would be like. All that time-showing and simultaneous stuff are so brilliant. But the second half of the movie just makes people's hearts break. All the cuteness and eye-contact of Andrew in the front are plotted to make the audience feel deeper for Eduardo in the latter half. And that is cruel. Also, like a classic story for kids, there is this bad guy presented by Justin Timberlake. All these characters and the extraordinary music from Trent Reznor(whose music was in another David Fincher movie The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the first part of which series I wish the director can continue making) make this film haunt me to come back and watch it again. I never knew Jesse before Social Network and I like his performance. I will go to the theatre and check out the Now You See Me if it ever gets past through the government of my country. And I definitely like the performance of Andrew or I should say Eduardo. I like Andrew in this film much better than him in the new Spiderman films. Right now I am going through with some terrible stuff in my family. And this movie took my mind off things, made me feel like I am a student of Harvard(a dream come true in the movies), and made me sympathize so much at the last scene when Mark kept refreshing the facebook page and the subtitle about him being the youngest billionaire(Actually I didn't realize he was sending a request to his ex-girlfriend the first time). At last, whoever were responsible for Mark's clothing and cast the Winclevoss brothers, good job! Some time after you finished watching this movie and think about Eduardo in a Caribbean hat, dancing to get close to Mark step by step with a smile on his mouth..."
"advaitkamat","10","0","1","5 July 2013"," Fincher's best work yet.
","I was skeptical about ""The Social Network"" when I first heard about it. I didn't know what to expect from a film that's about the birth of a social networking site because I couldn't see why that was such an interesting subject. But when the plaque reads Aaron Sorkin as the screenwriter and David Fincher as the director, we can only expect a cinematic experience that will have us talking about it for years. ""The Social Network"" is a turbulent piece of cinema so near-perfect that it's overwhelming. In the film's 120 minutes runtime, Fincher and Sorkin scrutinize the facts and lore that went into making the new century's greatest phenomenon and the analysis is narrated with such skill that it hardly seems relevant if they got the facts right.<br/><br/>In the opening sequence, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) drives his peevish girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) crazy by his self-obsessed talk about his future plans and SATs score. When he ends up ridiculing her qualifications, she dumps him. An incensed and inebriated Zuckerberg returns to his dorm room and creates a website, Facemash, wherein he rates female students based on their attractiveness. The website soon goes viral and crashes the same night, but not before giving Zuckerberg the idea of Facebook. The popularity and ensuing outrage over Facemash gets him the attention of the twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Armie Hammer) and Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). Soon after, they hire him to create a dating website for them, but instead he goes to his wealthy best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) with the idea of Facebook. <br/><br/>Saverin agrees to get the funds to build the website, and they release it live on the Harvard University campus in 2003. Though the Winklevoss twins express their anger over Zuckerberg 'stealing their idea', he gets Napster co-founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) on board to get the website advertised and get in touch with investors. The rest of the story focuses on the subsequent lawsuits filed against Facebook and their outcome.<br/><br/>Fincher has always been dexterous at handling stories about the psyche of a recluse or an introvert. Therefore, it's no surprise that the way he handles the primary character, who is both, is with such finesse. The interpretation of Zuckerberg is fascinating to watch - sly and deceitful, though, at times, altruistic. He directs brilliantly, tuning the finer nuances to perfection while keeping an eye out for the little details. Though a compelling drama about greed and loyalty, it plays out like a fire-breathing thriller with its ferocious intensity and whirlwind narrative. One of the finest sequences in the film has no dialog, and it's a boat race, marvelously executed and drifting dreamily on the magical, haunting soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Jeff Cronenweth's striking camera-work effectively captures the urgency even in slow-mo, and Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall's remarkable editing keeps it crisp. That's the case with the rest of the film too, for it is built with sequences shot adeptly while keeping the zing factor at surface.<br/><br/>Though ""The Social Network"" has a lot to like, the writing of the film stands out as its best characteristic. The characters carry out supremely witty conversations, and a quip acts as the best weapon in a film in which the plot is constructed entirely out of ego conflicts. The dialog is intelligent and darkly funny, and Sorkin, who excels in that department, has served up his finest work. ""The Social Network"" will certainly be remembered for its consummate script years later, if not for anything else.<br/><br/>The cast, peopled by a bunch of young actors, is terrific. Eisenberg, who usually plays wimpish characters, is a revelation. He brings a quiet confidence and maturity to the character of Zuckerberg, ratting off the best quips in the film with such flair that it's impossible to imagine anyone playing the character any better. Garfield, who lost out on a deserving Oscar nomination, is excellent. He performs exceedingly well in his scenes with Eisenberg, and it's easy to sympathize with his character. Timberlake, in a supporting role decision that could've transmuted as a fatal mistake, is a major discovery. His acting chops have never shone so overtly, and he's charmingly odious as the film's only antagonist.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" is the best film I've seen in ages, a film which examines and questions its characters and their actions rather than the story behind them. The brisk and perceptive peek into the website that affected a generation is a film that merits high praise, and it certainly ranks as a masterwork of a filmmaker who seems to know how to use this medium better than most others."

","When I heard about the film The Social Network, I was a bit confused. I wondered how David Fincher, director of films like Fight Club and Se7en, was going to pull off a movie about Mark Zuckerberg and his triumph up the social hierarchy towards his fame and stardom through Facebook. After I saw this film I was absolutely amazed by how the director of such gritty crime thrillers, could direct an amazing biography drama of a Harvard student creating Facebook. Fincher takes up-and-coming star Jesse Eisenberg, and turned him into to an Oscar nominee for best performance by an actor in a leading role. This movie offers much more than just a kid making a web page, but how through the process, what he must give up, and what he must gain to make it work. If you are looking for a great movie, with an intriguing story line, excellent acting and articulate dialogue, then watch The Social Network."

We can even say that it reflects the nature of humanity, since under the storm of fast-moving lives, is the loneliness of the individuals and the tragedy of the whole society. Why the distance between people gets increasing when the world actually gets smaller? Why do people feel tired all the time, and find that life is just filled with the things that they are not willing to do at all? Mark, Edward, Shawn, or Brother Winklevoss , There are no good guys or bad guys in the film because we are all doing what we are supposed to do in this sick world.

"maximkong","5","0","1","18 November 2012"," Too bad for a flawed script
","The reason why such a great movie can only deserve a mere 5 star is because of a MAJOR flaw -- scriptwriting.<br/><br/>Knowing a little bit about Mark Zuckerberg and as an engineering student who had spent time with geeks and hardcore programmer back in university days, I can say for sure that this movie just showed how much lack of understanding it has towards the true nature of Zuckerberg.<br/><br/>His character portrayal is totally wrong -- it is not wrong to have a strong enthusiasm and confidence/or arrogance behaviour, but it is not right that the movie portrayed him in such a way like everything he did or would do in the future is fueled not purely out of passion, but more like of a vengeful nature. Programmers, no matter how arrogant they are, do not behave like that. His face shows anger all the time, even Eduardo look more like the geek.<br/><br/>These are not just my own opinions. Please read the REAL Mark Zuckerberg's own opinions about this movie -- he just summarized all the aforementioned -- and if the original, still living billionaire was that unhappy on a film about him, that's enough for a low rating from me. and what is with the addition of a break-up with girlfriend (who is not real) & that rubbish ending just for the sake of adding some Hollywood flavour? For a script that is ADAPTED from a book...come on is that all it can do?

"tpeterson1955","10","0","1","24 May 2012"," Even after 20 viewings I'm still not sick of this film yet!! A modern masterpiece most definitely!!
","I've already seen this film 20 times now and I think it's one of the best written American films in years. The last film from America that so impressed me with its screenplay, dialog and acting was Robert Redford's sadly under-rated film QUIZ SHOW.<br/><br/>Frankly, I'm really surprised at how much I like this film, because I wasn't expecting to like it at all, as I am not a great fan of Facebook. It's a generation thing I think. However, I overcame my initial prejudices and let the film happen to me and I was well-rewarded on many levels.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg's performance was spot on and he underplayed his performance brilliantly. In the film, Jesse is either manic (as in the clever rapid-fire dialog opening scene) or sullen and distracted in the ""court room"" interrogation scenes. He was so good it took me awhile to realize that this was acting on a new level.<br/><br/>That he missed out on an Oscar to Colin Firth's hammy turn in THE KING'S SPEECH, is absolutely criminal, but with Colin's performance (enjoyable though it is I suppose), you are always aware that Colin is ""acting"", but with Jesse, he totally makes you believe that he's the character he's playing. What a good actor he is. He has plenty of time to get an Oscar I suppose, but it still would have been good to see him at least be rewarded for his work here.<br/><br/>Having seen the film so many times now, I am really being made aware of its brilliance. Just listening to the duologue is priceless. I don't mind a lot of talk in films as long as the actors have something interesting to say and say it in an interesting way, which they all do in this film.<br/><br/>A read of Ben Mezrich's original work, THE ACCIDENTAL BILLIONAIRES is a good help to understanding the film as well.<br/><br/>But according to a recent story in Brazillian money magazine there's hardly a shred of truth in this film, but, do you know what? I don't really care. It's such a good story as presented with believable characters and riveting dialog that this semi-fictionalized version suits me just fine! we will probably never know the real truth as to who really created Facebook anyway. More than one person was directly and indirectly involved for sure.<br/><br/>No man is an island. Zuckerberg certainly seems to need his friend Eduardo's help with algorithms in the beginning of the story, so maybe he's not that brilliant a computer programmer. He also seems to rely totally on Dustin, his own programmer (played by the always dependable actor, Joseph Mazello in another great scene-stealing performance).<br/><br/>Zuckerberg is supposed to be writing thousands of lines of programing, but we hardly ever see him doing any programming. And it's Dustin who gives him the reason that Facebook needs to be around when he quizzes Mark about the relationship status of one of the girls in Mark's Art Hitory class.<br/><br/>So Mark doesn't do everything alone, even though he's a loner, he still needs people around him to help get Facebook off the ground and onto people's computers.<br/><br/>And the ending of the film pretty much sums any problems you might have regarding who the true inventor of Facebook is: there is still some doubt about who started Facebook if Zuckerberg had to pay millions of dollar out-of-court settlements to people like Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra. They wouldn't be paid anything if they hadn't contributed anything to Facebook one way or another would they? The website they started sounds remarkably similar to Mark's Facebook site. Did he borrow it and use his own code and Eduado's algorithms? We'll never know.<br/><br/>THE SOCIAL NETWORK is a marvelous, savvy film of its time, and it's a pity that it didn't pick up the Best Film Oscar, as well as some acting Oscars for Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake.<br/><br/>But we know by now how reluctant the Oscar voters are to give awards to truly deserving winners.<br/><br/>But at least the film won awards for its fantastic screenplay, sublime and technically brilliant Film Editing and its pulsating and unusual Music Score. We have to be thankful to the academy for that at least.<br/><br/>This film is a great experience. Perhaps if you didn't like or understand it, you need to watch it a few times as the three different versions of what happened (plus your own theories of what might have happened) take a while to digest and hit home as each new piece of evidence and hearsay make themselves known as the film progresses.<br/><br/>And I'm going to keep watching this film as many times as I can.<br/><br/>Even after 20 viewings I'm still not sick of it yet!! A modern masterpiece most definitely."

","I had to go into this with a grain of salt. The Facebook phenomenon is quite amazing and has made changes to our society that we will be dealing with for decades. That said, I don't put Zuckerberg in the same room with Thomas Edison. The fact is that if Facebook had never been created, the world would have gone on just fine. Perhaps it would be a better, more humane world. One where people don't spend their lives producing tons of personal garbage that is really of no interest. The word ""friend"" has taken on a whole new meaning. It sounds then that because of personal bias, I wouldn't like the movie. I did. It's intriguing to watch this twerp hit all the right notes and put into action the phenomenon that has taken place. I really felt like I was in the room with these guys; that I participated in their discoveries and plans. Jesse Eisenberg is so believable that whenever I see Zuckerberg on television, I think, ""Wow, he looks a lot like Jesse Eisenberg!"" I can't buy the criticism that this movie is exploitative. If this story was going to be told, it had to be told now because the events are as fleeting as that computer you bought last week. It helped me to understand what went on. I recently saw Mark Zuckerberg bemoaning the failures of our schools. I think that he and his ilk are as much responsible as any poor teacher or principal. The numbing of America (or world) isn't helping much. But this film allows us to have a view of it's potential undoing."

Then someone told me about David Fincher directing it. That immediately sparked up my interest. He's a favorite of mines, with film classics such as Fight Club.. But, again, a movie about a website? I've never heard the story beforehand, and at first glance, it could be done so boring. My fears were obvious.. Then I saw the trailer. It looked fantastic, albeit the fact it was about a social networking site. I really couldn't picture David Fincher directing this, but it seriously did intrigue me...<br/><br/>It blew all my expectations AWAY!<br/><br/>The thing I liked was how narratively brilliant it was. David Fincher made it easy to follow, with clever twist and turns to make it entertaining to see. That was another fear of mine; it would be boring as ever. But David Fincher can't do that.. The acting was simply some of the best acting I've ever seen. Jesse Eisenberg was genius. His awkward, fast-talking character was perfected. He has this thing where he fits into a character without getting into himself. The one that surprised me was Andrew Garfield, which this was my first film with him in it. He plays his character as good as Jesse Eisenberg, if not, better.. The screenplay was some of my favorite parts. With the character of Jesse alongside his sarcastic behavior, you are sure to laugh. And it's not like laugh-out-loud funny, it was clever funny. The one where you'll secretly smile at it's secretive snide remarks. The score deserves it's recognition. When you first hear it, you're going to be like ""this is like a horror film score"" and you're rightly so. It fit the film in the strangest way, and made it seem way different then it could've been. I loved it.. And the directing (the combination of all these things: THE FILM) was just brilliant. This is a David Fincher masterpiece, and is surely a favorite of his. The film might not compete with the greatest films of all time, but it deserves to be recognized as one of the best of the decade...<br/><br/>I recommend for anybody who saw it, and thought as I had. It blew away my expectations, and I'm 95% sure it will blow yours away too. With the near-perfected directing, acting, score, and overall atmosphere makes this a near-masterpiece!<br/><br/>10/10."

","The Social Network is truly phenomenal. It went beyond all my expectations, and i feel it right to say that its really hard to do that, i am usually disappointed if i expect something from anything.<br/><br/>That being said, i have to point out why this movie was good. I first thought i would be watching something about Facebook-which i am by the way not on, because i just don't care- but i have actually watched something about its founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. What is so good about this movie, is the irony. You can see this movie, and you can understand this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing and brilliant. I was blown away by Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg. I actually saw Zombieland, and thought he was really good in it, but its not a dramatic movie. The Social Network is a dramatic movie, and Jesse Eisenberg, aside the fact from being gorgeously beautiful in a geeky way that i personally love, was brilliant and amazing, and fitted so well with the character as we could have imagined it. No smile, quick and amazing when delivering the lines, he was just astonishing. I also loved Andrew Garfield and Armie Hammer, and even Justin Timberlake was not that bad.<br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliant, one of the greatest i have been given to witness. The whole movie is actually based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, and has been remastered to fit with two other versions of the whole Facebook founding from what i heard. Aaron Sorkin-that is the guy who wrote the screenplay-is a genius. The lines are just perfectly perfect, especially Zuckerberg's witty comebacks. And the screenplay is even more important because it is a movie based on excellent writing.<br/><br/>A quality movie indeed, and I gave it a 9 out of 10."
"charles-jones-326-238116","9","0","1","27 March 2012"," Great insight into Facebook
","Would anyone have thought that a movie about the founding of Facebook and its creator Mark Zuckerberg would be so engaging with witty dialogue sprinkled throughout the film. Drawing reference to the geeky nature of Zuckerberg's mind, the film has catered for an intellectual fast-paced treatment that is worthy of a Harvard computer programmer. The language at play here is indirectly complex, jargon-filled and is always full of hidden underlying meanings, insults and sarcasm.<br/><br/>Like how Zuckerberg is always constantly at work to improve and move ahead of others, the astonishing intensity of the dialogues suggests how one has to pay full attention to digest and keep up with the story development before risking getting lost and left behind.<br/><br/>Though a little demanding, but it is rewarding at the end of Zuckerberg's talkative journey.<br/><br/>Already a public-listed quality, Fincher's direction is exquisitely powerful with the sensational screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. Answering the call to achieve technical excellence is the beautiful lowlight imagery and the amazing play of DOF (depth of field) by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and his RED ONE camera with the latest Mysterium-X sensor that improves low- light capabilities, rendering great details. These are highly reflected in the dim night club scenes as well as the rowing competition in UK.<br/><br/>Ensemble cast plays a huge contribution to the film's credibility and emotions drawn from its audience, especially of Eisenberg as Zuckerberg and Timberlake as Napster founder Parker. They were spot on choices for their respective roles and were responsible for leading the show with superb multi-dimensional character portrayal."

","David Fincher's take on the men behind a social networking juggernaut is an ensnaring riff on adolescent genius, intellectual property, misplaced loyalty and the blurred line between inspiration and plagiarism. Jesse Eisenberg is magnetic as the quick-lipped, scorned, socially acidic orchestrator Mark Zuckerberg; armed with both a fiery stockade of dialog and a vibrant crew of supporting actors to fire it at, he never wants for the right words, nor the perfect target, for an occasion. Eisenberg is especially effective in the dry, serious legal hearings he's subjected to throughout the plot, where he's most at liberty to cut to the quick with a pointed jape or toy with the formulaic arguments of a prosecutor. Sufficiently technical without flooding the plot with IT-speak, it's as sharp and engaging as Good Will Hunting, if not as touchy-feely and redeeming. When it was all said and done, I was left with the same impression of Zuckerberg as I was of Steve Jobs after finishing his biography: the guy's a scumbag, but he found his sweet spot in this world and made the most of it, for both himself and society at large."

","OK so we have a movie on face book, or should I say, on how face book was found. Initially I had no interest in it at all but later when I read some reviews I thought I should watch it. Needless to say, much of the story is made up. If you want to know the made up parts of the movie read the trivia section as I don't want to give any spoilers. The writing is brilliant, especially the dialogs. The movie moves at a good pace. The characters are great: silly, spontaneous, talented twenty-something year olds. David Fincher's direction is excellent. He is known for his thrillers and serial killer movies but he has done a stupendous job here in a completely different genre. There is never a dull moment. The score is fantastic. Cinematography and editing are top notch too. The performances are superb. Jesse Eisenberg gets into the skin of the character and proves his brilliance as an actor. Andrew Garfield is also great as his best friend. You do feel bad for him at the end of the movie. Justin Timberlake comes as a surprise package. He is brilliant as the antagonist. The others are also good. Armie Hammer also did a good job. Watch it!!!! (9/10)"

","B+<br/><br/>Despite avoiding the direct title, this film will forever be known as the 'Facebook movie'. In the same fashion as Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"", this film's focus is on the greed for money and thirst for power that drives people. I hear people constantly go on about how the film was shot, and yes, I acknowledge that it does look rather fantastic, with a fine polished look to the images.<br/><br/>And the performances do surprise you. I'm not familiar with Andrew Garfield, but he did quite well. Brenda Song of Disney channel stars, who I thought would anger me, actually serves up a nice performance. Armie Hammer I must definitely give kudos to and Timberlake, another popular pop icon, does very nicely. And then we come to Jesse Eisenburg, the perpetual Gordon Gekko of the movie. Now the problem is, I don't care what any critic says, Eisenburg literally kept the same facial expression during the ENTIRE movie. His talent lay in several smart-aleck quips he delivers thru out the run time, culminating in his eventual hollow victory. At least it's portrayed as hollow, seeing as he sits there refreshing a Facebook page belonging to a girl he humiliated. Speaking of which, because I assume the character was an ex, I had no idea today's college students, with all our texting, e-mails, and whatnot, actually passed notes in classrooms, but I digress.<br/><br/>The tactic is clear, to tell a story about the abandoned morality of the business man, fueled by a contemporary techno-like score I didn't care much for, leaving us with a climax where a substantial profit is made, some profit more than others, and man ya character feel cheated and no one appears truly happy. IT's charming to look at but like Eisenburg's character it feels hollow. Director Fincher definitely knows how to tell a story, and how to say mouthfuls about his characters (some of them), but the story everyone praise seems off to me. I'm not a guy who roots for the hero; after all, I find Michael Douglass' portrayal of Wall Street tycoon Gordon Gekko to be one of my favorite roles of all time. I deeply enjoyed the character, but the ones here I repeat, just come off as hollow."

","'The Social Network"" (2010) is a film based off of the story of how the social networking site, Facebook, was created. The film stars Jesse Eisenburg as founder Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Garfield as co-founder Eduardo Saverin, and Justin Timberlake as Napster founder Sean Parker. The movie depicts the development of the social networking site, as well as the obstacles Mark faces with lawsuits dealing with him stealing the idea of Facebook, and diluting Eduardo's shares once the company grew.<br/><br/>The theme of ""The Social Network"" deals with inspiration, betrayal, and the cost of success. Mark is inspired by his own idea of Facemash which was a website used to rate female students on attractiveness. After being invited by Camerson and Tyler Winklevoss to be a part of the creation of their social site called The Harvord Connection, Mark decided to expand his idea of Facemash into Facebook. Mark and co-founder Eduardo, work to get Facebook launched and running, and expand to other schools very quickly. I believe the instant success was too much for Mark to handle, as he proves in the movie he is easily influenced by Sean Parker. This causes Mark to betray Eduardo, when he is convinced to reduce Eduardo's shares of the company to nearly nothing.<br/><br/>The lighting throughout the film is very low key. I believe this gave the feeling of realness as well as seriousness. While Mark is hard at work creating the website in his apartment, the lights are low, which also shows him concentrating. The cuts that transitioned from the story of the creation of Facebook, to the current day lawsuit hearings, was done very clearly and smoothly. The film, as well as the cuts, were easy to follow and very well written. The actors did a great job of portraying the actual people and made the viewer believe.<br/><br/>Although the film has been criticized for not being completely accurate, the directors and writers did a great job of keeping a neutral point of view throughout, as well as illustrating many different points of view, including Mark, Eduardo, and the Winklevoss twins. I very much enjoyed the film, just as I suspected I would. I found it to be very interesting, and as a Facebook user myself, it made the meaning of it even more personal."
"guyer01","9","0","1","11 December 2011"," The Story of Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook
","The Social Network film tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg (Played by Jesse Eisenberg) and his journey through the creation of Facebook.com, a multi-billion dollar company. Written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher, the film takes a deep look into how the site was created, and all of the controversy and legal action that Zuckerberg faced throughout creating, launching, and building the website and company. Zuckerberg's business partner and CFO Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield) who is involved initially because of his friendship with Zuckerberg, ends up suing after his shares are dissolved out of the company. In addition another three men from Harvard, brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (played by Armie Hammer) and their business partner Divya Narendra (Max Minghella), claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea for Facebook.<br/><br/>The Social Network tells a story that begins with friendship and loyalty, then mixes with business and money, and turns into greed and backstabbing. It may not be the most factually accurate film to portray a real-life story; but Sorkin and Fincher did a great job working together and Eisenberg did an amazing job at capturing the true character and personality of Mark Zuckerberg. As any basic genius to ace his SAT and walk through Harvard University as if it were a community college, Zuckerberg often felt superior to others and it came out in his personality and showed his social inadequacy. To capture his personality and how his unique brain works his dialogue had to be written in such a way that it was difficult for common people to fully comprehend what he was saying; often negating claims of lawyers in just a couple short sentences and talking down to people as if they were inferior because of his knowledge. It would turn out that his personality would cause him to lose the relationship with his girlfriend, and best friend/CFO. The film also shows Zuckerberg's weakness in that he trusted a failed businessman and Napster creator Sean Parker (Played by Justin Timberlake), who did help expand the business but also destroyed the relationship between the two partners.<br/><br/>The story is told from the point of view of the two separate litigation hearings versus Zuckerberg involving Saverin and the Winklevoss's. The attorneys and lawyers representing Zuckerberg and of the two opposing sides are conducting their interviews during the hearing; they will ask a question and there will be a response, then the film will flashback in time and show the actual scenes of when the instances happened. In order to do this the editing and writing had to work together, often flipping back and forth between the two different hearings, and showing both Zuckerberg's side of the story as well as his opposition. The film also quickly transitioned between quiet and impactful scenes to louder and emotional scenes.<br/><br/>The characters were all built up well and the individualism really came through. Mark's genius mentality and know-it-all attitude really showed in his dialogue, as well as his inability to really socialize with people or hold a steady relationship; then Eduardo's personable and businessman mentality came through and it showed the difference between the pair. As Sean Parker's character begins to get thrown into the mix, who is a loud and flashy man who comes off as over confident and knowing everything about business, the jealousy factor comes into play and begins to tear the partnership apart. On the other side there are the Winklevoss brothers who are world class athletes and have pretty much gotten what they've wanted their entire life. The script really brought out the personalities of these individuals, as well as the actors portraying the people with accurate mannerisms and behavior.<br/><br/>The film really shows how the idea of Facebook was brought up between a couple friends, and then once it became the phenomenon that it is, friendship became second in priority to expanding the business. It showed the unique personality of a man who became the youngest billionaire in the world. It's hard to tell exactly how accurate the film is because all of the facts still aren't disclosed, but the film is very well written and intriguing. I would recommend this to other viewers, I waited a long time to see it because I don't think very highly of Facebook, however I am glad I watched this film. I really connected with the people involved and felt emotions toward them, so that alone tells me it was well written and directed."

","I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I have seen David Fincher's work before like Se7en and Fight Club and had high expectations. He not only met my expectations but he exceeded them with this movie. He took what to some may seem like a stupid website and brought it to life for all people.<br/><br/>I really knew nothing about Facebook when setting out to watch this movie. The only experience I had with Facebook was as a user until watching this movie. The film has a very interesting take on this film and shows how it sets in the lawsuits and jumps back and forth through the time line of Facebook history. Facebook began as some of the elite universities dating connection site.<br/><br/>The actors in this film are great Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg and I don't think he could have played him any better. The way Eisenberg talks or talks over individuals has an uncanny experience. Justin Timberlake does a wonderful job as the Sean Parker character and the trouble that he gets himself into. Mara does a wonderful job on shutting Zuckerberg out of her life. It makes you wonder if anything was embellished when creating this film.<br/><br/>From the opening shot of Albright and Zuckerberg in the bar to the closing shot as Eisenberg requesting friendship of Albright you know all of this history is because of a girl. Not a typical love story movie but there are still aspects in the movie that spars a love story.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of the best movies of 2010. It was also worth the Oscar's it received and was nominated for."

","Once upon a time a bright but apparently very socially inept young man named Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) became the youngest billionaire in the world pretty much by accident when he created Facebook, now the most popular & widely used social networking site available - and royally angered and/or back-stabbed a few people along the way. Among them were the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer with a body double), who hired him to help design a social network site for their school, his best friend Eduardo Savarin (Andrew Garfield) and Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the founder of Napster whose personal & professional career was a series of spectacular highs and lows.<br/><br/>Like any film based on a true story you have to wonder just how much of the dramatization on screen is true and how much of it is just that - drama. It's a compelling film to a point, but after a while I grew tired of the film's ""brilliant irony"" that the founder of Facebook is - or may be - a hopelessly anti-social person, cruel and condescending to those who sees as intellectually inferior but unable to truly connect with anyone emotionally, and that will also depend on how well you can tolerate Jesse Eisenberg, one of many actors who probably won't transition well to leading man roles once it's clear he's too old for the 'more than a boy but not quite a man' niche, as the film's anti-heroic interpretation of Mark Zuckerberg. By the end of the film I found myself rooting for the Winklevoss twins to ""gut the little nerd"", as they put it, even though they weren't that much better than Mark.<br/><br/>As a trivia note, Zuckerberg actually had a steady girlfriend during the rise of Facebook so that alone may cause to question how accurate the film's depiction of him really is."

The story was incredibly interesting, and the relevancy it brings to almost every viewer is just short of amazing. I can't rave enough about this film. <br/><br/>The directing leads the way in my grading system. To sell a drama about ""Social Media"" you would think no big deal. Just get some good acting and the actors will sell this film for you. After all, it is primarily just dialog, right? In this case, the director sells the film foremost, and the excellent acting is just a huge bonus. The director paced this movie quick and snappy throughout. It was edgy and sharp. And, to keep the engagement pulse as high and constant as this director did, was just pure mastery.<br/><br/>The cast of this film was just a delight to watch. The chemistry, the energy, believability, and talent was just plain excellent. Kudos to the complete cast. Every actor just added a gold star to their body of work. Bravo!<br/><br/>I also must bring up the music in this film. Coupled with top directing and good timing, background music played a huge role all by itself. Well-chosen music loops and proper volume behind the scene forced the mood of every important moment and gave it depth and a much bigger presence. <br/><br/>Along with the main elements of any film, this drama also brought something else BIG to the table... This was as contemporary as you can get. Most people can relate to this film because of the huge success of Facebook. However, this was not JUST a story about Facebook and its creators dealing with the turmoil of their creation. It was also a story of people. The story of people behind the scenes of Facebook to be sure, but also the story of us. We as our kind cannot resist checking in on our neighbors and ourselves. We want to know, and we want to know right now. We contributed everything to this film via our addiction to social media. WE made it relevant; Facebook was the wall to write it on.<br/><br/>Now, tie all these elements together and you have a film that pulls you in. This is one good drama! Even if you don't want to have anything to do with the Facebook, this film stands on its own just by the story itself and the exceptional directing and acting.<br/><br/>If you use Facebook, you should see this movie.

","Usually when characters have their faces illuminated, whilst shot in tight close up, from a light source located just below that of their chin, it is to bring about a certain ghoulish; uncanny; border-line evil sense to proceedings. There is a nightclub-set scene in David Fincher's The Social Network in which two male characters dominate the conversational proceedings between themselves, in doing so, shallow chit-chat with their write-off girlfriends, whom happened to be in the right place at the right time, plays out on occasion. Their faces, filling the frame, are periodically lit up by that of several shades of primary colours located beneath the glass of the tables at which they sit – the acute angle of their positioning causes great flourishes of light which are shed all over their facial features, but done so in a fashion rendering them somewhat frightening. The characters are, of course, shady and approaching despicable – even ghoulish; people about to make a lot of money off a world of young and vulnerable people living in a day and age in which modernity has gone mad; technological advancements are implemented unto us as ""must have"" accessories, in spite of whether one requires them, and folk are exposed to computerised services allowing them to forge online identities which has, on occasion, led to what people have defined as a sickness.<br/><br/>Welcome to the film about the person, or people, whom helped invent this item and their struggle to cash in on the riches that come with it. They call it Facebook; an online service allowing people to create their own web-pages of personal information, post recent happenings in life and put up all manner of content, complimentary or otherwise - that age-old idea of young people better off being seen and not heard has long since departed. The film is a near-perfect telling of a four-or-so month law suit which reared up over the winter of 2003 and briefly crossed over into 2004; an indelible balancing of several people on two sides of a particular fence in overall reference as to whom began the aforementioned website which took the online world by storm and as to how much in the way of riches either person is entitled to. It is remarkably written, beautifully played and wondrously directed; Fincher chopping back and forth from strand to strand, from equilibrium to equilibrium in the manner that tells us it is a director at the top of his game.<br/><br/>For starters, the pleasure one derives from a film such as The Social Network bears little to the items simmering away at the core of it; one needs to know of Facebook, or indeed possess a Facebook account, in about as much-a capacity as one needs to know an awful lot about agricultural science in order to enjoy Tony Gilroy's 2007 film Michael Clayton: a good thriller is a good thriller, regardless of its subject matter. Jesse Eisenberg plays American Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, a talkative; frizzy haired kid in his early twenties with a room on campus and a tight circle of friends and girlfriends. Eisenberg nails the role with a steely glare and an affecting robot-like demeanour, delivering long passages of cutthroat speech in a cold and precise manner - he reminds us of another coldly blank antagonist, although only really an antagonist supporting proceedings in a world of ever-decaying social-strata, from Fincher's past work; that of Kevin Spacey's John Doe. In terms of framework, we liken him to Gyllenhaal's character from Fincher's 2007 film Zodiac - a lead whom happens upon a coded item, proceeds with it and then gets in deeper than he should have done.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg, on account of being too frank and talkative with a girlfriend one night at a university bar, breaks up with her and lumbers back to his halls, alone, on a dreary Autumn evening. The glumness of his marital situation is encapsulated in the foreboding music motivating proceedings, but brief squirts of pleasant piano keys in amidst it reiterate the germ of a good idea trying to break through out of the scuzzy situation. His superiority, at least over other students of his age; ethnicity and sexuality, is enforced when, inter-cut with his devising of a social networking formulae, we observe numerous other students simultaneously drink; fool around and stand on coffee tables in their underwear - such are the things one gets up to at university.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield plays Eduardo Saverin, a friend and roommate but a later rival for the claim of the benefit payouts; two brothers, these fantastic physical specimens whom row and maintain their build like Zuckerberg is able to think along mathematical lines, are named Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, although are both played by Armie Hammer in an instance of flawless duel-acting on the man's behalf. The plot takes care of itself, suffice to say the film cuts back and forth to the ongoing battle over what amount should be paid to whom and how they all came to reach this situation. The film splices between either strand effortlessly, the reality of the fact we are aware of what the situation on the past strand will eventually lead to in no way detrimental to the overall intensity of the drama unfolding overall. The film's indelible manoeuvring of these characters around a chess board of sorts, as loyalties to one and then the other and differing factions are born out of events; what look like betrayals and distrust, is the real joy – the film a mesmerising drama rocketing Fincher away from the spasmodic, pseudo-teary The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and back to a recurring forefront of men wading through decrepit sociological surroundings; battling with themselves as well as the other men of distorted opposites they appear to have more in common with than would like, whom occupy that space with them."

","The subject matter really isn't as interesting as the film makes it out to be - the story of Facebook is a pretty standard one in the world of internet entrepreneurship, and in the long run, I suspect, will not be more than a historical footnote, which is of course the risk you take when making a movie about current or recent events. The film itself, though, is masterfully done, extremely fast-paced without ever losing the audience's attention, and skillfully avoids dozens of very expected clichés, making it, to all purposes, the first solid mainstream work from David Fincher. We may have lost Fincher the angsty bad boy forever, but we may have a new Spielberg on our hands."

","The AMC theater in Times Square offered the perfect atmosphere to watch Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake star in The Social Network, a drama about the popular networking site Facebook.<br/><br/>""He's wired in,"" is a common line quoted by characters in the fictional film The Social Network directed by David Fincher. After viewing this movie opening weekend, I realized the term ""wired in"" is the perfect way to describe how captivated I was by the film.<br/><br/>The Social Network, created in 2010, follows the formation of Facebook by its founder Mark Zuckerberg. The film creatively flashes back between the time line of its deceptive creation and simultaneous lawsuits against Zuckerberg by his former best friend Eduardo Saverin and three classmates.<br/><br/>The plot follows Zuckerberg and Saverin as they spontaneously create the Facebook site while studying at Harvard University. Convinced the idea for Facebook was originally theirs, twins Caermon and Tyler WInklevoss sue Zuckerberg for the rights to the site. As the plot evolves, Napster co-founder Sean Parker enters the scene and corrupts the mind of Zuckerberg, eventually leading to his betrayal of Saverin.<br/><br/>Viewing the film at AMC in Times Square definitely made the experience very different than it would have been if I watched the film alone. It was unique to learn about Facebook in a theater with my two friends, but also with a handful of strangers. I remember thinking how awesome it was that almost everyone watching the movie with me also had their very own Facebook account. The intense focus from the audience was evident as no one spoke or made comments throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>As far as the atmosphere, AMC theater is a very familiar and comfortable theater for me. The ticket price was more expensive at $13, yet these are not surprising for New York City prices. Despite it being opening weekend, I was surprised at how quickly lines moved and how friendly the employees were.<br/><br/>Once inside the theater, my seat was comfortable and I anxiously awaited the start of the film. Before the film began, I was happy to discover there were not any commercials and instead there was the perfect amount of trailers. As trailers are my favorite part of a movie experience, my friends and I loved critiquing the future films together.<br/><br/>Though some may argue the movie is not a clear indication of the history of Facebook, I think Fincher did an amazing job of translating the story with an air of suspense. I thought the characters casted portrayed the types of personalities respectively and believably. Timberlake, for instance, did a fantastic job of straying away from the typical romantic comedy character he usually plays. Instead, he managed to pull off the deceptive, pretty boy personality of Parker convincingly and successfully.<br/><br/>The script was well-written and filled with intelligent lines that sold the seriousness of the story to the viewers. With the two lawsuits intertwined with the past narrative, the clever combination of scenes definitely kept me as a viewer on the edge of my seat."

","The Social Network is a movie that tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire in the world. This movie has a great theme which shows the rise and social fall of the ironically claimed ""Social King."" Themes in this movie include: Friendship, Betrayal, Success, Jealousy, and Power. The main characters in this movie include Jesse Eisenberg who plays Mark Zuckerberg, Rooney Mara who plays Zuckerberg's heart strings as Erica Albright, Justin Timberlake who plays Sean Parker, the man made famous for being the creator of Napster, Andrew Garfield who plays Zuckerberg's closest friend throughout the movie as Eduardo Saverin, and lastly Armie Hammer and Josh Pierce who play Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss the angry twin brothers who accuse Zuckerberg of stealing their idea. The movie uses a flash back type of theme throughout the movie showing the history between the characters as well as the success of the social media site called Facebook. The main character, Mark Zuckerberg is shown immediately as a very smart, socially awkward, computer wizard. The beginning scene of the movie shows Zuckerberg and his friend of which he is romantically interested in, Erica Albright talking at a bar. Through this scene it is very obvious that Zuckerberg is not a very good communicator as Erica shows how she is annoyed at his back and forth talking of random things. Throughout the movie you get a sense that Zuckerberg, who knows he is intelligently blessed, is always skeptical of people that want to socialize with him. In most scenes of this movie whenever someone wants to talk to him he responds with ""What would you like me to do for you"" and he is always showing signs of skepticism. Throughout the movie he meets Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, a set of wealthy twins that are athletes with Harvard University. They are interested in using Zuckerberg's computer skills to create a social networking website for the men of Harvard University to meet women. Throughout the movie Zuckerberg along with his close friend Eduardo decide to make a complete social networking website for everyone to use. The twins get word of this and decide to sue Mark for stealing their ideas. Throughout the movie it seemed as if motivation for Mark was to do something to be socially accepted in life. One common theme throughout the movie was that Mark kept trying to reach out to Erica as if he was just trying to find a way to have a connection with her. While on his journey, Mark ends up connecting with the creator of Napster, Sean Parker. Sean is an outgoing ""do things now, not later"" type of guy that ends up helping face book take off through big investors, while Mark's friend Eduardo does not have the same type of luck in New York trying to get investors. With his charismatic charm, yet untrusting characteristics, Sean ends up working his way into the company and gains the trust of Mark while secretly putting Eduardo into a bad business decision which ultimately gets him out of the company. During the movie the director used many different styles of filming. One of the common features was using camera angles to show multiple characters and their responses at the same time. During the time when Eduardo found out that he was being let go from Facebook the director was able to show the body language of Mark, Eduardo, Sean, as well as the other background characters in this scene. This helped to show multiple things: The surprise on the face of Mark, the smirks of Sean, the betrayal felt by Eduardo, as well as the surprise and fear in the co-workers faces. Another style of filming I noticed was the use of lighting and shades during scenes. During times in the movie when ""shady"" things were going on such as characters doing drugs, bad business deals, and the introduction of untrusting characters, the scenes tend to go into a darker setting in which the viewer gets the feeling that something is not right. The faces of the actors also tend to be darker, where as in other scenes such as the competition for a new intern, the room was dark but all of the characters were well lit. In the end of the movie Mark ends up settling with the Twins and Eduardo and pays them a substantial amount of money. One of the most powerful scenes in this movie was at the very end in which Mark sent Erica a friend request. Sitting a dark room the movie ends with Zuckerberg hitting the refresh button multiple times to see if she accepts. This goes to show that the intention of Zuckerberg was just to try and be accepted in a way that will allow him to create a social connection. This movie as far as the way it is directed with a flash back type of style reminds me of the movie Inception in which they use this method to show the former life of the main character in the movie. In inception this method goes to show how the character has ended up in the position that they are currently in a lot like the movie ""The Social Network"" did. This movie overall was a good movie that showed the life to success and how power and success can ruin friendships."

"AGDimsdale","Null","0","1","23 August 2011"," You don't get 500 million friends without making a few enemies
","David Fincher, the director who bought you such critically acclaimed films as Fight Club and Se7en has worked with Aaron Sorkin, the writer of West Wing to create the eagerly anticipated Social Network; a film adaptation of the Ben Mezrich's book The Accidental Billionaire: The Founding of Facebook, A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal. The result is a fantastically crafted big-budget movie with an all star cast that seems to have generated massive hype and glowing praise. If it was not for the movie's glaring hypocrisy, product placement and severe mischaracterisation this would be the perfect movie. So what is the story behind the world's most frequently visited site and its creator Mark Zuckerberg: the world's youngest billionaire? It starts at Harvard in 2003, where Zuckerberg, the hero of the film, begins to drunkenly hack Harvard's computer system to raid them of all their photos after breaking up with his girlfriend. With the names and photos he creates a website called FaceMash where students can choose the more attractiveness of two people who are compared side by side on screen. This receives twenty-two thousand hits in less than two hours and crashes the University computer system and leads to a disciplinary hearing that results in six months of academic probation. However, this also draws Zuckerberg to the attention of Winklevoss twins who are trying to set up 'The Harvard Connect', a dating site for Harvard students, After initially expressing interest, Zuckerberg never actually contributes and instead goes onto create 'TheFacebook' a social networking system for Harvard students which then, as you all know becomes very popular, very quickly. The Winklevoss twins feel they deserve a slice of the action and much drama, betrayal, greed and lawsuits pursue. The acting throughout the movie is flawless with special mention to Andrew Garfield (who will play Peter Parker in the next Spider Man movie) who delivers a very good performance as Edwardo Saverin the character and friend of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) who 'co- founded', or rather initially funded, Facebook. Justin Timberlake (yes, from the Mickey Mouse club) continues to build up a respectable film resume following decent performances in Alpha Dog and Black Snake Moan with his very likable character Sean Parker; the founder of Napster, Parker is the guy who persuades Mark to take Facebook to California, Silicon Valley So surprisingly a film about Facebook, (that ultimate procrastination tool) seems to be a hit. It is however flawed. It is dramatised history and it is easy to forget that the film has had absolutely no input from Zuckerberg himself and as Andrew Clark of 'The Guardian' stated: 'I'm not sure whether Mark Zuckerberg is a punk, a genius or both. But I won't be seeing the Social Network to find out.' It is obvious that much of the movie is made up of presumptions, exaggerations and straight up fiction. In order for the screenplay to be good it needs heroes and villains and again this is something that has been fictionalised in order to make up a good story. This however can become dangerous when it is dressed up to all be true with real people surrounding real events. It is one thing to create dramatised history with past events such as Elizabeth - The Golden Age or Shakespeare in Love however when it comes to making up events, conversations and actions of living people then there is potential to really tarnish people's names or give praise where it is undeserved. This is perhaps why Zuckerberg expressed regret that there would be a movie made about him during his lifetime. As well as the numerous presumptions, exaggerations and fictional events 'The Social Network' is also awash with product placement. A reoccurring theme in the movie is Mark Zuckerberg's belief that advertising has no place on Facebook, he points out that Facebook is cool and that the users will be stop using Facebook if they believe that it is a marketing tool. This makes it fairly hypocritical that the movie places special attention to brands including Mountain Dew, Polaroid and Sony VAIO computers (perhaps due to Sony Studio's contribution to the production of the movie). The movie also paints a negative picture of the prestigious Harvard University drawing attention to elitist clubs and emotionally bankrupt students. This film is definitely worth watching, not just because everyone will be talking about it, but because it has a great plot with fantastic cinematography and a wonderful score by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. As the film draws to a close, you can't help thinking that aged only twenty-six, Mark Zuckerberg: The youngest billionaire on the planet has a story is far from over."

Mark also co founded the site with Eduardo played by Andrew Garfield. Justin Timberlake also shows up as Sean Parker the inventor of the website Napster. Now some performances here are solid like Eisenberg and Garfield is also strong. This is a great screenplay that won an Oscar for Aaron Sorkin and the Score is great as well.

Timberlake made me take notice too. The music (Best Original Score) is a big reason why people enjoyed this movie and its not hard to see why Trent Reznor is so popular among those who care.<br/><br/>Now as the audience, the only things that got me interested in the movie before seeing it, was Facebook and the masterful David Fincher. Like in most of his films, he wants us to open our eyes to stuff we wouldn't usually even think of (Se7en, Fight Club). Before watching The Social Network, we know we love Facebook and we just want to know more about its creator, Mark Zuckerberg. And we find out stuff we wouldn't know otherwise about Mark, his girlfriend, his best friend Eduardo and others his Facebook venture touched. We are thoroughly entertained and pass this news to our friends, mostly through Facebook.<br/><br/>But in the end, we're compelled to ask ourselves a doubt (unlike in Se7en or Fight Club): ""Was Mark really an a**hole?"""

","Just watched this movie on Netflix with my mom. While I don't think this was one of the best movies of last year (True Grit and The King's Speech were more worthy to me), The Social Network was certainly quite an attention-grabber what with the speedy dialogue from Aaron Sorkin, David Fincher's going back and forth from the depositions to the actual-if a little fabricated-events that lead to those court scenes and the performances of Jesse Eisenberg as the co-founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg and Justin Timberlake as that Napster founder who charms his way into being one of the investors. Another compelling performance was that of Andrew Garfield as the embittered co-founder of Facebook who ends up suing Zuckerberg because of the latter's betrayal. So on that note, The Social Network is well worth the viewing."
"a_2","Null","0","1","1 June 2011"," The new pulp fiction!
","Across the history of cinema, some of the most impactful and cult movies have had a few things in common. Their stories have surrounded a real world phenomena and the direction captured the essence of the story better than reality. The Social Network by all means is the cult classic of this generation.<br/><br/>What happens when you put the combination of a story writer who has the expertise to convert real world stories into a even more powerful screenplay (Charlie Wilson's War, Few Good Men), and a director with the most astute skills of story telling (Fight Club, Seven, The Game) on a single project? The social network is nothing short of an explosive ride the pace of which will keep you on your toes and the dialogues will make you applaud consistently as it all unfolds. There is no suspense, no killer in the end or no treasure to be found yet it will keep you engrossed and remind you of the world around us. Its true that Aaron Sorkin had more than plenty for the story from the book, but it takes someone like him to make the movie look better than the book! And for David Fincher, he made fight club look casual with this. Every scene including the background music, locations, costumes and the look of the characters is nailed to perfection and it gets better than a courtroom drama without a court or the setting. The characters are the heart and execute the roles with solid punch and timing.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg can take lessons from Jesse Eisenberg on how to be Mark Zuckerberg in case he gets too busy and forgets what he was like! Jesse Eisenberg was born with this voice and speed of talk for this movie as he single handedly runs with the show through out the movie. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake put in solid performances and even the Winklevoss twins are better than the real ones. Every bit of detail has been meticulous worked including the setting of Harvard and code that you see vaguely on the computer screens. Above all the dialogues of this drama are the most memorable and will continue to hit on you even with repeated watches.<br/><br/>Nothing in this movie is extraordinary yet everything about it is a treat to watch! Cut to the chase....this is the new pulp fiction!"
"holtinator","7","0","1","25 May 2011"," Worth watching, even if a touch longer than necessary
","How far can one girl drive a guy to go? That question is at the core of ""The Social Network."" The movie follows Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) through all of the twists and turns of developing his now- famous Facebook web site. The social scene of America's elite universities - portrayed as elitist, filled with peer pressure, and driven towards getting what you want – provides the backdrop for the legal battles between both Mark and his friend Eduardo, as well as a group of students from one of the most prestigious clubs on campus. The money involved, however, is always secondary to the more important issues of status and social standing, and the contrast of that pressure with developing actual friendships. It is also, of course, about that one girl – Erica, a BU student who we first meet in a bar with Mark, whose occasional appearances remind us of what gets Mark started in the first place.<br/><br/>The movie's story is definitely compelling, giving us flashback insights into the process by which Facebook became a social phenomenon. Though most of us know how successful the site ends up being (I even got into this site through Facebook), we are still left intrigued by the complicated process which drives the site forward from its humble beginnings in a Harvard dorm room. The college social scene that is at the heart of the movie is also skillfully articulated, with Trent Reznor's musical influence providing a tremendous soundtrack that highlights its darker undertones. The film also raises a number of great questions about what it means to be social in the 21st century – how are our relationships shaped by technology, and in reverse, how has technology developed in response to the way our relationships have already changed. How we can develop a whole ""social network"" - and lose all our real friends in the process – creates the powerful but disturbing narrative behind this film.<br/><br/>There are a few weaknesses in the movie. The story does not seem to fill the entire 120 minutes, with lulls where the plot is moving a bit slowly and the characters do not provide enough of an emotional connection to keep things interesting. Cutting 15-20 minutes and/or further developing some of the secondary characters may have helped the story feel more consistently strong. The rest of the movie's strengths, however, more than make up for these weaknesses, and make this film well worth watching – and then, perhaps, posting a note about on Facebook."
"mattoo-sahil","5","0","1","19 May 2011"," Hard to say that this is a Fincher's Film
","It often happens that idea lures filmmakers and infatuation becomes infection, first they fall in love and then they stumble at the Box Office.<br/><br/>Unlike of the above fact, this movie was big time money spinner of 2010<br/><br/>Seriousness becomes troublesome if we become serious for something which was never intended to be taken as serious. This movie depicts the same problem of having a perfect body yet deprived of soul.<br/><br/>I remember the moments that i cherished watching Game, Fight Club and Seven and then I had Social Network. It's not a bad cinema; its just i never expected this from Fincher. May be the treatment is too realistic that i couldn't find the detailed character build up which is like a must for Docu-Drama genre.<br/><br/>I am amazed as Ficher goes for a Bio-Pic and yet i completely miss out the lead character and not only the protagonist; the support cast of this ensemble cast is just too average. Conviction is to far to be expected, its like a masterpiece of an amateur. I am afraid but yes for me Fincher had simply burnt his hand. <br/><br/>Yes its possible, probably quite genuine to portray this generation to be shallow, selfish, immoral and stupid but i guess keeping it up with celluloid actually creates nonsense. Its hard to get convince the two faced Zuckerberg's character, who is a modern day Gates and yet doesn't know how to give his due to Buffet and Steve Ballmer.<br/><br/>He is intelligent, he is a sinister, he is Business men, no he is a Modern day entrepreneur... if I am not mistaken he is a Graduate and is in the making to be a Post Graduate... but he is smart, Geek, a nerd, a fashion victim who is a Master mind probably i should address him as a Visionary OR should I call him as a Jackass who F@#Ks his own ass by letting everyone knows about his glorious past in a most indecent way.<br/><br/>After watching Anti Trust, like Six years back i still have vivid memories of it. I don't want to compare these two or i would never say that why to have Social Network because we had Anti Trust; film maker will always make TrainSpotting or Requiem of a Dream. We will still have Sin City though we had Pulp Fiction and L A Confidential ..... but what least can be expected is newness, a Different treatment or a new vision .....<br/><br/>Okay if in something to condemn in everything then there is something to accept.<br/><br/>The Thriller treatment to this Docu-drama is a treat to watch, protagonist is not a sham, he looks like a graduate. Screenplay is intriguing; the only saving grace and may be the key factor that this can still be call as a movie. This movie too has its moments, the comparison and online ratting of girls, can't get more nasty than this if one is in a college. The apt of aping cool Google work ethic at workplace is again a nice one and yes court room drama is simply what flaunts Fincher's expertise in his field. Finally I guess its like an Old Wine in a new bottle, with a skimpy packaging and a Labeled as Contemporary. <br/><br/>I will go with 5 out of 10 for this not so great average flick."
"MalcolmJTaylor","10","0","1","17 April 2011"," The Machiavellian Network!?
","Machiavelli stated that it would be best to be both loved and feared. But since the two rarely come together, anyone compelled to choose will find greater security in being feared than in being loved. [17] In much of Machiavelli's work, it seems that the ruler must adopt unsavoury policies for the sake of the continuance of his regime. -- from popular on-line encyclopedia.<br/><br/>This is no revelation. And certainly it's shock value in the Social Network stems from this behaviour being practised by youths barely in their 20's. What sort of life is to come for these youngsters and indeed the world of tomorrow when such ruthlessness, entirely devoid of compassion, seems to be the hippest trend of the day? This is the most frightening element of David Fincher's latest masterpiece and perhaps the greatest through line in his films: somewhere embedded is always a great primal fear.<br/><br/>Here is the true core of the American Dream pursued to the extreme, the get rich or die-trying motif. Makes sense that it is terrifying. No longer is this dream some warm-toned primary colour saturated immigrant's goal pasted over with a smile. It's a ruthless business played by sharks. Are you game? What if you're not smart enough, savvy enough, young enough? Well perhaps then you'd be better off dead, like the poor sap who only made $5,000,000 on Victoria Secrets which went on to be a half-a-billion dollar company. He found his salvation jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.<br/><br/>This is the success of Nazism. To be swept away by emotion to the extent of being severed from logic. The greatest tool used by those who seek to be feared the most. Here it's our greed for world domination through face book at all costs that pumps through our sinews as we become swept away with Jesse Eisenberg's exceptional portrayal of Zuckerberg and the very accomplished film that surrounds him. Perhaps we fear David Fincher for his consistent adeptness in stirring these deep fears within us. <br/><br/>I want the same brilliance and tenacity that Zuckerberg wields, the unchecked arrogance that suffers no fools. But I don't possess his single-minded ruthlessness. What am I to do then? Reject him out of hand like his jilted girlfriend does by the end? Or should I seek to emulate him? The film doesn't give me a clear answer. But if I had to guess I'd say it wants me to emulate him. After all, face book is very much alive today and perhaps as vital as the internet itself. Should none of this been created? Could it have been created without ruthlessness? <br/><br/>This is a gripping film, and well deserves the Oscar accolades it has garnered and perhaps even ones it didn't. It is so well written, so well cast, so well acted, brilliantly edited and directed and gorgeously shot, and delivers one of the most compelling soundtracks at the hands of another frightening individual, Trent Reznor. <br/><br/>The film's only trite note for me, unfortunately, comes in the execution of the ending. I found the whole party scene: caught white-handed-with-cocaine and the underage-scared-of-the-cops scenario to be quite weak. This is not the behaviour of people seeking to be feared. They would not fear authority in the shell of a police uniform.<br/><br/>As well, Zuckerberg's disappointment in Parker's (Justin Timberlake) celebrations, sure to cause scandal, is out of proportion. Parker's been set up as a party animal. How is it a surprise that he's partying it up with, ooh ""underage"" girls; appropriately merited, I might add, only after they've hit a milestone of 1,000,000 members. I'd say that deserves a little celebration.<br/><br/>Equally irksome is the final moment of Zuckerberg sitting at his laptop repeatedly refreshing his friend request to his ex-girlfriend, as the credits update us on how things stand today. So world domination is empty then? Is that the point? He still doesn't have the girlfriend he had in the beginning. And if he had her now, would he then be fulfilled? He wasn't before when social climbing was his main priority. But now that that's all over, thanks to being the youngest billionaire in the history of the world, he wants his girl back? Yeah, sure I guess. It's just not very consistent with the ruthless individual he's been practising at. More frightening would be if he couldn't conscience her being with anyone else and took steps to remedy that. But then therein lies the limitation of true-to-life biopics. Artistic license only extends so far."
"DKosty123","8","0","1","29 March 2011"," Zuckerberg - The Hero, The Legend
","This film is a very emotionless look at how Mark Zuckerberg used ideas and circumstances around him to create Facebook and become a Billionaire. The film opens with Erica Albright on Zuckerbergs only depicted date in the movie getting frustrated with his nonsensical ranting and dumping him calling him the appropriate name. The rest of the movie (spoiler) tells us how he lives up to that name. This simple plot is then encased into a lot of other subplots.<br/><br/>This movie presents the high IQ main character as a genius who seems to outsmart not only other nerds & geeks, but even the business types he deals with throughout the film. In effect it is making Zuckerberg into a modern legend and a real tough as nails type who is not effected by anyone around him, feasting like a fighting fish on everyone else. How much of the story is actually true is a subject of conjecture as the disclaimer at the end of the movie states that scenes were done to change the story for ""dramatic effect"".<br/><br/>The film closes with a lone Zuckerberg sitting at a laptop sending a friend request to the long lost Erica on Facebook. That is the closest thing to real emotion that is in the movie. There is anger from the other folks who seem to get taken advantage of.<br/><br/>There is a scene that depicts Bill Gates speaking to an audience at Harvard. Gates is a man who has used money, computers, and the media to make himself into a legend. This scene is right on for this movie as this testament of Zuckerberg pretty much makes him a legend. Both he and Gates have made themselves into legends using the same technology. This film covers Zuckerberg as the next generation Gates.<br/><br/>Is this a good movie? Yes as it does break a lot of molds and does not appear to make up too much. The direction and production and sound track are very good. The cast does a fine job acting, but suffer from a lack of script as far as being able to show a lot of range in their roles. That's because this spin of a legend lacks reality and the lack of depth of the characters proves that.<br/><br/>I won't knock the film for that. It is a fine film, but in real life is Zuckerberg really this much of a dead fish? If he really is, this movie shows that having brains and taking of advantage of others will win for you in life as long as your self-absorbed."

This movie is ambitious in that it is trying to comment ""on the fly"" as it were. While it's attempt to be topical is admirable, a movie is still a movie. It needs a protagonist and we are certainly not sympathetic to Eisenberg's Zuckerberg. Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield) is truly the one character the audience can relate to and sympathize with.

","In the very first 5 minutes of ""The Social Network"", we get to see Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara, the future Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) do nothing but talk, talk and talk in a bar. He speaks a lot of nonsense, she speaks a lot of truth, clarity and disadvantage. When he disrespects her, she strikes him back and calls him an ""A- hole"". This strikes him to make disrespectful comments about her on his blog and create a website, which will become the most legendary web site ever. It all started when Zuckerberg and his friends including Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield, the future Spider-Man) created a website called ""Facemash"", a website that ultimately becomes a crash site for the all the Harvard students to see which girl is hot or not. This catches the attention of the Winklevoss twins Cameron and Tyler (Armie Hammer, with body-doubling by Josh Pence) and their friend Divya (Max Minghella), who wants Mark to create a website in order to check their basic status. With that, Zuckerberg and Saverin created ""Facebook"", the ultimate website. This causes controversy for the twins, but causes a big success with the help of Napster creator Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake, bravura of a performance) and ultimately, causes a lot of disparagement by both Saverin and Zuckerberg. If you got 2 hours (120 minutes) to spare and you have an ear for dialogue, then ""The Social Network"" is that kind of movie. Sure, Zuckerberg can be an A-hole, but at least he is the youngest billionaire in the world. You can hate him or you can like him, but that is the point. The Oscar-winning screenplay by Aaron Sorkin is truly pure and original dialogue at its best. The direction of David Fincher and the use of digital cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is brilliant. Everything has to be perfect, this is why the film itself is a big hit. Be sure to listen to the Oscar-winning score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross and listen very carefully. The cast including Eisenberg, Garfield, Timberlake, Hammer, Brenda Song and Mara are perfect. I may not be a user of ""Facebook"" (my mom uses it), but I think this movie itself is already like the new ""Facebook"". But be careful, this is from the A-hole guy who invented it and basically created a whole new aspect about it. As Marylin Delpy (Rashida Jones) puts it to him: ""You're not an asshole, Mark. You're just trying so hard to be."" It's funny, outrageous, powerful, gut-wrenching, a punch-you-in-the-jaw kind of film that is, without a doubt, the best film ever made. Truly the best film ever made. Period."

But you need to have a mood for this because I was watching the movie in 3 days. Only the 3rd day I began valuing it and enjoying it. My first reaction was to quit facebook because the owner is an a.h. but they made him so for a movie, that's annoying."
"TheGonzoJoint","9","0","1","2 March 2011"," Possibly the best of 2010; ""The Social Network"" is a directorial knock-out as well as a spectacularly written masterpiece. I loved it.
","**** out of ****<br/><br/>I knew that David Fincher was a talented director, but this is unexpected. ""The Social Network"" is David Fincher's finest film; a movie that it both bright and surprising. Who would have known that out of all the people to do it, David Fincher would be the only one to make ""the Facebook movie"", as some are calling this film. And thanks to flawless direction from Mr. Fincher, ""The Social Network"" is even more interesting than its premise makes it out to be. This is a beautiful, flawlessly crafted film, and it is one of the best, if not the best, film of the year. Now, I know what you're probably wondering, and let me put it out there that I understand all-too-much where you're coming from. You're probably wondering how the hell a movie about the founding of Facebook can be perfect and critically acclaimed. Luckily, I've got an answer for this one, and it can be said in but one word. That word is effort; a little thing that very few directors would have put into a movie like this. What could have easily been another great premise down the drain turns out to be one of the best great-premise-executions in recent memory. I mean, this is the best you can get with a Facebook movie. A flawlessly crafted film simply cannot be beat. And to make things even better, I feel smarter upon watching the movie. I thought not only about what was going on in the film, but also about what these fine intellectual characters were talking about. In that sense, ""The Social Network"" a very, very interesting movie. Hell, it might as well be the most interesting movie I've seen since ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". That's how good it is. It's not only thought provoking, but it's more complicated than it seems. It's easy to follow given how flawless it is, although there are complications underneath the straight-forward yet brilliant story that this film tells. Long story short: I loved this movie. It felt good to be watching a film so intelligent; so unique in its telling. It's so good that half of the story seems to come from the production of the thing, and what a story it must be. The filmmakers did something that's relatively hard to do: Have fun without having fun. Perhaps it's not too easy to tell, but the filmmakers worked well with the actors. I don't imagine that it was but a simple ""Hello, we're going to film this movie"" and ""Goodbye, I forgot about you 6.8 hours ago"". I think that both Fincher and lead star Jesse Eisenberg will cherish this as their finest film respectively. This is, without a doubt, the best film I have seen in cinemas this year. It is by all means a good contender for Best Picture, and I hope that it wins it. Because no matter how many awesome movies come out in the course of one year, there's always got to be a film that one could call their ""personal favorite""; the masterpiece to end all masterpieces for the particular time that it is popular. Well...this is that film. It breaks the mold; it puts the icing on the cake which is its premise. And it's a powerful, effective experience. I still haven't got over it. I never will. All I can say is that if you haven't already seen it, then see it. I found there to be no problems with this film, and it was fun to watch; in that quirky, highly intellectual sort of way. Never has watching someone be an asshole been this amusing."

","I really enjoyed this movie. It was shot well and the score by Reznor and Ross fit the contemporary attitude of the film as a whole.<br/><br/>While I liked the film, two aspects really annoyed me. First and most obviously is the one-sided nature of the movie. I don't know anything about Zuckerberg, but obviously he had no say in this film because it was based on a book in which he did contribute information. Jesse Eisenberg plays the part of a genius-douchebag extremely well, but is Zuckerberg really like that? I felt more confused at the end of this movie then at the beginning simply because there was only one side presented.<br/><br/>The second aspect of the film I didn't like was the fact it was about Facebook. I realize it's an interesting story and one that needed to be told, but why now? Why couldn't the filmmakers give Facebook a few more years to age? The story would still be there in a couple of years.<br/><br/>Great movie. I really think anyone will like it because of the betrayal. We'll just never know how it REALLY went down. This is the only story we have about what happened with the creation of Facebook, and it is the only one we will have unless Zuckerberg writes a book. Even then, I'm sure he'll build himself up as the victim. Maybe he'll even make a movie about it."

","In my opinion The Social Network is a best surprise of 2010. It just blew me away. I could never guess what this was all about. The writing, direction, acting, editing, original score, editing and cinematography were brilliant.<br/><br/>Fincher has proved his versatility. Every time new genre, but awesome stuff I deeply respect him. He is one of the few directors who have made all of their movies up to the mark. All of the content in the movie are compelling.. the story being true isn't the strongest (which certainly is OK considering reality) but the way story has been told is mind blowing.<br/><br/>I can see why all the critics are raving about it. I personally liked it very much and didn't see any negative point. I'd rather say its near perfect considering all the situations that its recent, its true and its not what every one would like to hear about. But when seen as a movie The Social Network is probably the best picture of 2010.<br/><br/>9.5/10."

","It's strive for perfection is as poetically determined in the very image of Jesse Eisenberg's methodical performance as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, making this film one of Fincher's greatest works of art. The director of memorable classics like ""Fight Club"", ""Seven"", and my personal favorite ""Zodiac"" has done it once more. Today Facebook's expansion has long exceeded that of its 1 million member rate, and into a 500 million member rate, entailing both the financial, and critical success of Zuckerberg's many risks and sacrifices. Eisenberg's portrayal of the renowned computer genius brings questionable aspects to the very motives of Zuckerberg's actions towards this project. From the moment the film starts, and the very second we hear Zuckerberg talking a mile a minute, moments before and during the creation of Facemash.com, we see not only a bright genius with a superiority complex, but we see someone who has high aspirations of his potential. He is portrayed as a person incapable of intentionally hurting others, despite the negative effect his own actions towards his aspiration of creating a network that has influenced such widespread social activity. His goal towards the development, as well as the very enhancement of Facebook had its rewards in the many investors, as well the representative corporate offices, as a result of his associations with the slick witted, but notorious opportunist Sean Parker (Timberlake), the co founder of Napster. However like all rewards, there is always a price, or a difficult decision to be made in order for those rewards to be fully realized. In Mark's case, despite the friendship, and more than financially loyal cooperation of the Facebook co founder Eduardo Saverin, Mark's own bitterness, as well as his ideals towards the very potential of Facebook drive him to strip all of his friend's efforts of truly calling his contributions to this project memorable, and worth 34.4% of entitlement. Director David Fincher has tackled a very popular, but seemingly complicated issue. Today, Facebook among its many users is an addictive sensation of internet socialization. It is a website allowing each individual to create their own profile, as well as giving them the freedom to meet up and converse with not only their friends, but with people they've never even met, and probably will never come face to face with. When approached with the ideological concept of such a site, at the request of the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron (both Hammer), it was to be exclusive, and only accessible to the students of Harvard University. Their trust, as well their overall lack of involvement in the development of Facebook angered them into suing the declared nerd, just because they gave him the idea, when clearly it was his own efforts and general disgust for exclusivity that generated the overall popularity and constant expansion. Eduardo's reason for legal action against a former friend seemed more rational, and less selfish. The critical point of ""The Social Network"" that Fincher hopes to reveal to viewers is the very true aspect of the development of one of America's most popular social sites had on its creator. Zuckerberg's initial goal of launching Facebook may have brought him great wealth, as well as a great sense of substantial recognition for his work, which he obviously expressed a want for in the beginning of the film, but it also created this obsession so detrimental to him that in the end his own nature to remain intellectually superior cost him a good friend, while bringing forth more and more enemies to the subject. Many Facebook users will no doubt enjoy the film, mainly because it brings them to the roots of one of society's most popular websites, but they will also enjoy the surprising authenticity of Eisenberg's portrayal of the gifted Harvard dropout. Seriously, the dialogue, the interpretations he makes, and even several of his physical mannerisms remind all of us viewers of that very image of the typical super nerd. They talk like robots, using a professional manner of speaking, and using their own intelligence as part of their condescension. ""The Social Network"" focuses on the concept of obsession and even addiction, which of course is the critical factor most Facebook users have when Facebooking one another in most cases. In Zuckerberg's case, his obsession was generated into the very development of the site itself rather than the actual experience most members adore, and constantly browse. I can say this film is mostly accurate, considering the fact that Fincher used additional fictional inspiration for the creation of Facebook, other than Marks general desire to expand the social capabilities most people enjoy expressing. When watching a film as organized, cryptic, and arranged in a shifting pattern of direction, from the current legal battles and back to the development of the site, I think to myself how interesting it would be to fully explore issues that may seem simple and enjoyable to others, but in reality they contain their own complications, and their own seemingly dark aspects of its ending result. Once again David Fincher, has given audiences a deep look into a world where the characters he brings to the table show every positive, negative, and relatable qualities possible. ""The Social Network"" is a network of theatrical success."
"joshua-halstead","7","0","1","19 February 2011"," At least interesting....
","Can a film souly focused on the creation of a site be one of the best films of 2010? The answer is yes. David Fincher definitely brought a lot to the table for this film. Because of David Fincher's supreme directing, the film was pieced together perfectly for this movie. The acting was great, and the mood of the film stayed the same throughout which a fair amount of films these days lack. The plot keeps you waiting for more...although the movie did drag out slightly to long. I was disappointed with the content of the film mainly. It had an extreme amount of language. It has 2 ""f"" words and multiple s words, d words, h words, and b words. It also had multiple inappropriate slang terms for body parts, and sex. Also it had a lot of sexual material such as implied sex multiple times, women passionately making out, and almost naked girls doing sensual movements. It was a great film however the inappropriate content was both unnecessary and pervasive."

","I am not sure where the Hollywood is heading. I pray and hope this film though already nominated for Oscar shouldn't win, if Oscar judges give this film the best film award then GOD bless Hollywood they cant go anything lower than this in worst Hollywood cinema.They already start heading down south in making movies. I wont believe when it won the golden globe and I bet this movie won because it was lobbied like our senates. First of all 2003 showed in the movie like 1940's, so If any sane person and those who are raving about this movie giving some 8 stars and above, I request them to go and watch Beautiful Mind. Even that movie was not brilliant due to the fact that the events were manipulated but at least it was story about noble price winner mathematician not some crappy cheat guy. But this is a movie about a douchebag and of course director got undisclosed amount of money from facebook founder douchebag Mark. He almost made us to believe that he was a good guy but in reality he was the biggest douchebag and looser who did not invent anything except steal the idea and modify with his own crap and put it for the world and pass it like he is the inventor. Not only that he betrayed his only and real good friend, he ditch everyone around him. The director showed that video piracy, audio piracy, illegal download of music, stealing ideas and everything is fine. I guess how would he feels if this films watch on pirated DVD's and he has to bear the loses:) This is the high time Hollywood should wake up and start looking for real Cinema, there was the biggest conspiracy for Inception because it was brilliant movie but since its against the very own set of rules of Oscar judges and it wasn't made by or about any body like Mark so they don't give Inception enough credit or put Leonardo DiCaprio for best actor for this movie. What make them give Jesse Eisenberg a best actor nomination I don't understand what all he did in the movie was looking like nerd by wearing dirty hoodies and blank face no emotions and nothing to act about. I don't think a real Harvard dress like that. I guess people should start watching real cinema of 50's and 60's to get to know the quality of work Hollywood used to produce and compare with today's crap they are making to know the difference."

","When I first saw the trailer to this in theater, I thought it was ridiculous and stupid. Like they are really running out of ideas, but to some degree it beat my expectation. I personally didn't think it was a masterpiece like some critics claim, but David Fincher did a very good job with what he had. The plot is basically about college students at each others throat for a idea a site that is worth billions. Now Jesse Eisenberg has been getting a lot of credit for his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg and for the most part he did a pretty good job, but I didn't find it outstanding or anything like that. I mean he played his role very well but didn't think it was anything special or anything like that, his character just had one note. But besides that he did nail the character very well. Andrew Garfield did a really good job as well with his character and showed a lot of emotional depth. In fact the acting and dialogue of this movie is almost flawless. Now there maybe many viewers that may not enjoy this movie as much, I personally thought it was pretty good though, with the bickering, backstabbing, betrayal, and greed that lead to making facebook. And shockingly Justin Timberlake put on a great performance. Who knew that guy could actually act. But he was probably just playing himself. Just not a amazing awesome movie that some critics claim it to be, I mostly liked the visual style of it all. Again the best part about this movie is the performance and the sharp dialogue. And I know this movie is about how facebook came about, but it wouldn't have hurt to dove into the mind of Zuckerberg more and more development. The film just didn't grab my interest, it didn't really have a good start but got my attention a bit during the middle and started to lose it when it got near the end. This really isn't a bad film, it has good camera techniques to go with some of the positive aspect of the film I named. But the topic at hand just isn't interesting, and didn't feel all that compelling.<br/><br/>7.4/10"

","Well just finished watching this film and didn't really click with it that well. It could have been a lot more fascinating than it was. The casting was good (but not great), the scripting was, as you would expect with mentions of web programming terminology, server hardware and general geeky use of language, but I guess I just wasn't in the right mood for it. It only really picked up when Timberlake's character steps in. The comedy aspect of the film was pretty average and the lead character did come across as a little too 2 dimensional for my liking. All in all not in my top 5 or top 10. It won't make me want to watch a film about the founders of twitter or my space, if anyone writes a script for them too. But in fairness, it wasn't the worst film I've ever seen. It just didn't keep me that interested. Maybe it's a grower."

","Having not been too familiar with David Fincher's work (I KNOW, FIGHT CLUB WAS AMAZING I LATER FOUND OUT)I was skeptical at to how this film would turn out. After reading that the role of ""Mark Zuckerberg"" had gone to Jesse Eisenberg (the geeky kid from Adventureland and Zombieland) i was even more of a skeptic, and the source material.... A movie about Facebook, honestly?<br/><br/>BOY WAS I WRONG!! After reading a few reviews praising the film, i decided to head to the local cinema and spend the cash on the ticket. In retrospect it was my best investment of 2010 behind my 3D TV. The opening scene between Eisenberg and (soon to be Dragon tattoo star) Rooney Mara is by far one of the greatest achievements in recent scriptwriting history! Kudo's to Aaron Sorkin (West Wing script writer), it was awe inspiring and I'm sure will be studied in many an English class to come for decades. It really set up the character of ""MARK"" out of the gates and was incredibly important in setting the tone for what was to come. The story roles quickly from there, introducing an impressive cast of characters, whom are throughout all given their own side stories and are very impressively presented with skill and believability. The standout of this film for me was Andrew Garfield, playing ""Zuckerberg's"" betrayed best friend Eduardo Saverin. I was pleasantly surprised at his acting chops in both Drama and a few of the more comedic scenes (Quote: ""we have groupies"")after ""The Facebook"" starts to hit it big time. I now quietly wait in confidence for his turn as Peter Parker in Sony's SPIDERMAN reboot. Justin Timberlake fits his role well as the no holds barred entrepreneur and creator of Napster Sean Parker. Firstly presenting himself as a confident and established business-man before taking a very dramatic turn into some dark scenes involving drugs and under-age women(maybe drawing from experience?). Armie Hammer also deserved a giant nod for his role('s) as the Winkolvoss twins. A portrayal that will no doubt lead to him being cast in some rather large roles within the next few years for sure. Whoever cast Jesse Eisenberg over Michael Cera for the lead role needs a giant medal. Maybe even a shrine that we pray to for more brilliant casting decisions further in the future. He is nervous, sharp, witty, incredibly arrogant yet increasingly likable throughout.You believe him to be this bidding genius, whom has, in reality, changed the way we communicate forever.<br/><br/>By far my pick for best actor @ the Oscars this year. I have never been one for Drama, but this has changed my entire outlook on movies as a whole and is easily in my TOP 5 OF ALL TIME! I have since seen it multiple times (much to the dismay of the money hungry distributors and their love of 3D at the moment) and it has been an absolute pleasure every time. Throughout you may have noticed my use of """" during the use of the names within the movie. The reason being that even though the movie is loosely based on actual events, the characters represented by the actors only share the namesake of their counterparts and therefore are not real world representations of said people. Ending on a high note. The sound track, the acting, the camera work, lighting, script,casting, everything in this movie is spot on. If this does not win best picture i will have lost all faith in the ACADEMY AWARDS. Best movie for the last 3 Years. Do yourself a favor, save $3 and see The Social Network over the 3D trash like TRON:LEGACY."
"Bunuel1976","8","0","4","22 January 2011"," THE SOCIAL NETWORK (David Fincher, 2010) ***1/2
","When I first heard of this, I was wary of both the subject matter (the creation of the Internet fad that is ""Facebook"") and the fact that a director of Fincher's status would lend his services to such an intrinsically 'geeky' venture. Since it has been sweeping the boards all through the current awards season, I had to take notice and opted to check it out prior to Oscar night (having passed the film by during its initial theatrical run locally).<br/><br/>To be honest, it took me some time to warm up to the film given its essentially intractable nature (similar to PI [1998] and PRIMER [2004]); in this regard, it is best approached as a conspiracy thriller – with the intricacies of the dual lawsuit raised against Mark Zuckerberg proving undeniably gripping. The film is clearly dialogue-driven (with some key scenes irritatingly taking place in noisy surroundings), but the script emerges a surprisingly witty one; besides, it is most effectively scored (in part by Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor) – being appropriately capped by The Beatles' ""Baby You're A Rich Man"".<br/><br/>I have one quibble, though: I doubt young Americans today ever really bother mentioning the likes of Teddy Roosevelt, Irving Berlin or Cole Porter in their daily conversation, or that the hotshot behind the ""Napster"" application cared where THE TOWERING INFERNO (1974) was shot!; incidentally, it was odd for pop star Justin Timberlake to play someone who has had such a ruinous effect on the music industry! Moreover, I do not agree with those who feel Zuckerberg was a scoundrel: the way he is played by Jesse Eisenberg, he seems more gullible than opportunistic – and, especially powerful as a character-defining moment for him, is the poignant finale. By the way, the fact that one (especially somebody so young) can amass billions simply for having brought the world closer together, as it were, imparts Capitalist/Divine implications that are profoundly disturbing (and which, perhaps, one sensibly ought not to ponder too much on!)."

","After the watching the ridiculous golden globes and being heartbroken after the phenomenal film Inception lost to this film I sough this film on blu-ray and saw for myself apparently the film that was better in inception. Firstly lets start with the obvious The Social Network is overrated by everyone! I thought this film would be about how facebook is bad and it might be a statement to the current state of our society. This is not that film. Its ironic that a film about facebook doesn't really delve onto the core issues. Be clear about this film, its about mark zuckerberg and his associates during the creation of facebook.<br/><br/>Firstly ill discuss the performances. Jesse Eisenberg is very good as Mark Zuckerberg however he is not a revelation he underplays his role and distills a certain amount of disgust as well as a little sympathy for his character. Justin Timberlake plays the ultimate sleazeball and does it quite well, surprisingly. Armie Hammer, Brenda Song, Rashida Jones, and Max Minghella all perform their roles quite well. The true revelation among the cast is Andrew Garfield. He plays his role brilliantly and is the true emotional catalyst of this film. He most definitely deserves an Oscar.<br/><br/>Next up is the score, one that won a golden globe. The score is above average at best. It is quiet and subtle but occasionally incorporates sounds that are very out of place. The screenplay another golden globe winner is often excellent but hindered by boring technical dialogue. The dialogue for the most part is natural and engaging however it is not emotionally involving leaving you with a cold feeling. The cinematography is good; no frames struck me as horrendous or amazing. David Fincher has always been a very good director. He gets very good performances out of his actors but I felt this film was just extremely cold. One scene that was very powerful was the very ending scene which communicated a strong emotional message. However after two hours after a heartless film it was a little too late. The Social Network as whole is very good drama but certainly not on the level of inception. Still it is a good idea to see this film."

No worries about health care here.<br/><br/>But, curiosity got the better of me, and I finally broke down largely because of David Fincher whose storytelling abilities i admire, his films being favorites--Seven, Benjamin Button, Zodiac. Facebook does not quite fit the list. Although I hated the movie, largely because of its a-hole protagonist--I admired the filmmaking--the cinematography, musical score, and narrative flow were sublime. <br/><br/>I hated the West Wing cadence of the dialogue and wonder if the actors had to be trained to talk that way. The only writer & filmmaker who can do that superbly in my view is David Mamet. Here--really, all the West Wing cast kept swimming before my eyes. <br/><br/>The other problem with this movie for me--nobody likes an a-hole kid protagonist.

","Spellbindingly fast paced conversation between a college couple...<br/><br/>At the end of it - ""I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that ... you're an asshole!""(silenced by the Indian censors) asserts the girlfriend, Jessica Albright (Rooney Mara) and ditches the guy. He's angry & confused but doesn't know how to react. Returns to his hostel room, gets drunk, bitches about her bra size & family name in his blog and finally designs a site, Facemash.com to rate ""hotness"" of girls from different colleges. The site gets around 22,000 clicks in around 2 hours which crashes his (Harvard) college network & gets him a 6 months academic probation. This hurt & confused Computer-nerd-genius is Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg, outstandingly self-restrained), the youngest billionaire & founder of Facebook.<br/><br/>I'd read that a film was being made based on a book on the Facebook founder but I knew about the director being David Fincher only after it released. I was more than excited for a Fincher film and these initial 10 minutes proved my enthusiasm right. Then on, it kept me right on edge. The story is effectively narrated through the progression of two simultaneous lawsuits: First one by the Winklevoss twins (both played cleverly by Armie Hammer, thanks to digital trickery) on Mark & Eduardo Savarin (Andrew Garfield) & the Second one by Eduardo on Mark. Another highlight of this movie was Justin Timberlake playing celebrity Sean Parker who brought a great impact on the music industry by starting sites such as Napster, Plaxo & also seemingly inspired Mark to grow Facebook. The characters have a definitive nature of their own & the cast of actors comfortably fill their shoes.<br/><br/>Based on the book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" by Ben Mezrich, the screenplay (Aaron Sorkin) is carefully filled witty & humorous monologues, twists & turns as well as heavy-handed fast paced dialogues which keep the viewer engaged throughout the 2 hour runtime and works on many different layers. This being a movie about the designing of a website, there was a great danger of it going bonkers. Surprisingly, it is filled with computer details which it carefully skims over (just like Syriana, A Beautiful Mind) and saves the layman, the trouble of grasping technical details. As for the ending, it left me satisfied in a way, it winded it's way upto there.<br/><br/>Director Fincher (of Fight Club fame) has a unique kick-ass style of his own (like all great directors) with respect to his narration and the way he brings about the end without compromising on the detailing and story-line. Collaborating with his regular Cinematographer (Jeff Cronenweth) & Editors (Baxter & Wall) seems to have been a good decision as the technical detailing of the film was brilliant. The melodious soundtracks blended into the scenes and completed the ""feel"" of the movie. I managed to catch up with an interview where Zuckerberg himself gave a nod to the casting, costumes, acting and other details, although he didn't agree to certain cinematic liberties taken. (He said he didn't start Facebook due to a failed relationship but agreed that those were the exact same shirts he used to wear!)<br/><br/>This movie could easily have been the run of the year at the Academy. But against Inception, this one should hopefully end up with more than a few nominations. I hope it at least bags an Oscar for an adapted screenplay (and squeeze in for Best Director too, please!).<br/><br/>9 / 10<br/><br/>(minus one, because my 10/10 belongs to Fincher's Fight Club)"
"katie-sirles","10","0","1","26 December 2010"," Three cheers for The Social Network
","Love, jealousy, money, and greed. These are four of the most powerful driving forces in the world and they are also the primary driving forces behind The Social Network. I absolutely loved this movie. Director David Fincher did not waste anytime getting us right into the plot.<br/><br/>A young Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) opens the movie by dazzling us with his somewhat careless yet brilliant tech skills. He moves quickly and does not falter. He is incredibly intelligent but has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth all too often. He's also neurotic and two-faced. One of his only friends in the world, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) blazes through the internet with Zuckerberg as they explore the world of dot-coms.<br/><br/>Due to a prank of epic proportions pulled by Zuckerberg, he starts to get press and is suddenly under fire having to defend his actions.<br/><br/>The movie moves right along with occasional laughs and we are able to witness the creation of the website that has become the most popular dot-com of our generation. We also get to see the controversy over who thought of it first. Is it really a stolen idea? Is Mark Zuckerberg and evil genius? Everyone in this film gives a superb performance. And I mean everyone. There is not one role that I can think of that was just O.K. Jesse Eisenberg was - as everyone has already said - incredible. I'm a little tardy to the party on this one, but I completely agree with the general consensus that this is surely going to get a few Oscar nods. I wasn't so sure about it before today, but I left the theater in a daze. Not many movies do that to me anymore.<br/><br/>While I am sure that the most buzz was that which surrounded Michael Cera wannabe Jesse Eisenberg in a role that completely shattered that image, I was seriously wowed by Andrew Garfield who played Eduardo Saverin. If this movie is at all accurate as far as Zuckerberg's personality - and who knows if it is - being Mark's best friend was trying and most of the time emotionally exhausting. Watching the roller coaster of emotion that Eduardo experienced was difficult. Zuckerberg played the ""come here, go away"" game for much of the film leaving Eduardo at the end of his rope.<br/><br/>Brenda Song broke away from her squeaky clean Disney Channel persona to play Eduardo's crazy girlfriend. The Winklevoss boys played by Armie Hammer provided much-needed comedic relief in some of the tense parts of the film and also provided serious eye candy. Am I right, ladies? Justin Timberlake as Napster founder Sean Parker started off weak, but as the film progressed I saw that N'Sync glow fade away and he became someone completely different.<br/><br/>The movie was excellent and a must see. While I don't think this will win best picture, I do see a possible best actor award for Jesse Eisenberg and I have a strong feeling that Andrew Garfield could take home best supporting actor.<br/><br/>One of the most memorable scenes for me was the very last scene of the film. Of course I won't say what the last scene is, but it reaffirmed everything I thought I knew the whole time.<br/><br/>See it if you haven't and watch it again if you have. It's fantastic and entertaining and embodies all of the necessary components of a great dramedy.<br/><br/>Also, Vega Choir did a marvelous cover of Creep by Radiohead for the trailer of the film.<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>(Check out my other reviews and much more at www.mssilverscreen.wordpress.com)"
"yaizapez","9","0","1","26 December 2010"," A classic.
","In these days of special effects and parallel realities, this movie shines like a rare jewel. No fantasy worlds, no bullets, no explosions, just old-fashioned feelings. Human beings facing life, making choices and coping with the consequences. And facebook? Oh, it's a minor detail. The mcguffin, as Hitchock would call it. This movie is not about facebook, strictly speaking. It's about self identity, friendship, values. Sounds weary? But of course, this story has been told so many times! That's why this movie is great: It's so good to see that some people out there still believe that what counts is not the story but how you tell it! It's a fact: there is no new story. No matter how much make up you put on it -blue like in Avatar, or dreamy like in Inception-, every story is an old one. So you better get an amazing script to tell yours, and you might want to have some solid acting too, and of course a serious editor, and some cool music. And there you go: you have a classic."
"lasttimeisaw","9","0","1","26 December 2010"," The Social Network: 9/10
","Definitely one of the best films of 2010 and currently is my No.3 of the year (slightly behind INCEPTION and THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, but No.1 on my 2010 Top 10 director list). David Fincher's last film THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008) is a major disappointment for me (though he has remained one of my favorite directors since 1999's FIGHT CLUB). I feel exulted to see he will finally get his overdue Oscar for BEST DIRECTOR next year!<br/><br/>For me, at first I was rather pessimistic towards this project, the biographic story of Mark Zuckerberg is surely not Fincher's cup of tea (considering SE7VEN, FIGHT CLUB and ZODIAC), without a dark premise, it could turn out to be another case like TCCOBB, bland and tasteless. Unexpectedly the opening scene between soon-to-be-dumped Mark and his still-present- girlfriend Erica is mesmerizing and the conversation is sagacious and witty (I did watch the scene twice), which immediately drew me into a status of devotion, especially under of foil of Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails)'s arresting music score. <br/><br/>The acting is outstanding by a rather young cast, Jesse interprets a complicated role with his cool-headedness and subtlety, at the time being, he is my No. 1 in the leading actor race. However Andrew Garfield's performance is much more heartfelt for me (as I have seen BOY A, I am not surprised to witness how much potential he has under his charming appearance, plus he is the new Spider Man, I think he could beat Toby Maguire by a mile, as far as Oscar speaking). The unexpected novae are Rooney Mara and Armie Hammer, the former will soon appear in the US version of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (directed by Fincher as well) next year as the protagonist, she will be rocket-boosting like Noomi Rapace this year; the latter manifests himself to be a perfect candidate as the new superman. Shadowed by the others, Justin Timberlake is just okay, as least not too annoying (and sadly to find out he is aging too).<br/><br/>Almost everything in the film is flawless, the cinematography, the editing, the tempo, the cast, I am really appreciated this film to create a meaningful bitter-taste of becoming rich and famous at a young age, its practical significance could benefit many audience. Anyway I feel placid to see this film sweep in the coming Oscar, bravo Fincher!"
"jusco15","9","0","1","24 December 2010"," jusco's review: The Social Network
","Many would probably agree with me that upon hearing David Fincher was directing a Facebook film, there were two general reactions: 1) a Facebook film?? are you kidding me?? 2) David Fincher and Facebook?? shouldn't it be David Fincher and provoking thrillers, like Seven or Fight Club or Zodiac??<br/><br/>Well, Mr. Fincher, you have officially and successfully pulled it off, and we're more than willing to shut up now.<br/><br/>This is a film based on the founding of the Internet social networking phenomenon site, Facebook, which I highly doubt needs an explanation (unless you're one of the rare few not in the overwhelming 500 million who has an account). But please be aware, this is far from factual. If you're looking for a faithful documentary or biographical film that portrays the humble beginnings of the website and the eventual lawsuits over the disputes about who actually owned the shares, you're looking in the wrong place. But if you're looking for a film that is intelligent and witty, you're in the right place.<br/><br/>I emphasise again that this is a smart film. In fact, probably much smarter than what most people are used to, but the genius of the film is how it is able to effectively bring us along with the fast paced turn of events without confusing the audience. It contains brilliant dialogue that must be attributed to Aaron Sorkin, the scriptwriter. From the first scene, you are already thrown into a world of highly astute and quick-witted conversations. But then again, this is Harvard; can you expect otherwise?<br/><br/>Apparently, Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg was far from accurate; the real-life Mark Zuckerberg is known to be quiet and reserved. But this can be easily overlooked for Jesse Eisenberg's execution is in perfect style: quick thinking, witty and though at times irritating, eventually wins the audience over to symphathise with him. Andrew Garfield had a relatively easy character to play, Eduardo Saverin, the rich businessman who supports Mark but eventually sues him. But Justin Timberlake – I had no idea he could act so well – was the standout. His character, Sean Parker (the founder of Napster), is so charming to the point of annoying, and he played his role very cleverly.<br/><br/>This film does make you think about the constantly evolving world of technology that is currently dominating our lives. It causes you to question the issue of privacy, the issue of morality and the issue of Virtual vs Reality. How many profiles portrayed on Facebook are similar to the person in reality? How different? How can this type of social networking site benefit us, or even harm us? Is our society too reliant on said site or is it a perfectly harmless way to interact and socialise, to make new friends and acquaintances? Just a few questions to think about.<br/><br/>The Social Network has been described as a cinematic masterpiece. That it is."
"scardface","9","0","1","23 December 2010"," Thank You to David Fincher
","When I initially heard that a movie was going to be made of Facebook, i became instantly sceptical that it was too soon and that a studio was trying desperately to bank off of the social networking phenom, during times of tough box office sales. When I later found out that Fincher was pushing the vehicle of this massive potential for a motion picture, I took a sigh of relief and began looking forward to the release date. Having seen the movie twice now, I am certain that Fincher did us all a great big favor by providing us with a great analysis of the history behind the man and the movement of Facebook. Mr. Eisenberg is cut to perfection in this film and with the great direction of Aaron Sorkin's fast paced and edgy script, the formula is set for a perfect dynamic. The quick paced dialogue allows us a perception into Zuckerberg brain; an overwhelming, high adrenaline, hard to keep up with mind. THe 'edginess' to his character, compounded with the back and forth motion of the past and present scene sequence is great in showing how quickly things moved and how fast everything was going for these kids. It's really a great film to see, whether or not one is a fan of facebook.<br/><br/>For those who have seen pirates of silicon valley, a story of the developments of Mac and PC and the rivaling feud of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates when computers were slowly rising as personal desktops, the social network is somewhat reminiscent of that film in the way that young bright college minds push on an idea, are completely smitten with the business and corporate world and become instant rock stars of their time. It's great seeing the roots being planted of an idea that is capable of changing the whole online and social networking world. Fan or not of facebook, i highly recommend watching this Fincher flick!!!"

By the way, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake are so cool in this film. <br/><br/>Mark is Jewish boy with curly hair. He has superior smart in computer and obsessive enthusiastic in coding. <br/><br/>Why he invented Facebook? Just because he was dumped by his girlfriend. Why he is sued by the twin brothers? Just because he has a better idea than Harvard Network. Why Eduardo no longer be his friend? Just because he did a little revenge to make him get nothing. Finnally , he settled out of the court.

","I hadn't been too interested in seeing this but after all the press and positive comments I realized I had to give it a go. Glad I did. My wife and I enjoyed this film very much and since we are both Facebook members it was interesting, as well. However, we had a lot of trouble understanding the dialog during many of the scenes where the characters were in a noisy location; i.e., bar, dance club, etc. Having been big fans of ""The West Wing"" over the years we were expecting some great dialog from Sorkin but I'm afraid we missed quite a lot of it due to the strong background music playing through many scenes. I'm wondering if others experienced the same thing - either in the theater or on a DVD screener or was it just my TV sound settings. Guess we'll have to watch it again with sub-titles."
"EijnarAmadeus","9","0","1","22 December 2010"," Shadows are falling, and he's been there all day.
","THE SOCIAL NETWORK, the new film about Mark Zuckenberg and his co-founders of Facebook, has amounted great reviews and been hailed by many as the film of 2010, and even I, as a skeptic from the start, have to say that it is a brilliant movie. This not only out of its mastery of film craft such as use of music, editing, cinematography, acting, story and dialog - but also because of its timing. It's released at a time when everybody everywhere knows exactly what it's about; people watching the film are those in reality involved in the film's plot. The screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin is great, and this albeit it revolves around a story that would be fairly difficult if it hadn't been so entertainingly and intelligently written. As a viewer one watches a computer-programmer work out his mind to become the number one internet phenomena of this century, and as fore-mentioned writer Sorkin moves fast, and one has to stay focused throughout to get the entire momentum. The film feels cold, cynical and detached, much like Zuckenberg acts (greatly by Jesse Eisenberg), but it's singularly about something that gathers, interests and matters - Facebook. So there is naturally something very emotional and very human about the entire personification of numbers, codes and data as it has our name, picture and bio in it. The irony of the story is bleak and sad; it opens with Zuckerberg seated in a crowded university bar chatting intensely (to say the least) with a girl, and ends with him alone, almost blankly introspective, tapping nocturnally on the page he created - it's the man who owns the world, but sold his soul."

"saadgkhan","10","0","1","19 December 2010"," Its David Fincher's smart direction, Aaron Sorkin's sharp screenplay & Brilliant performances by the ensemble young cast which made the movie what it has become today!
","THE SOCIAL NETWORK – CATCH IT ( A+ ) Undoubtedly, ""The Social Network"" is the most fascinating movie of 2010. In the beginning it was hard for me to get grip of the movie as the dialogues are really fast, smart & clever between Jesse Eisenberg (Mark) & Rooney Mara (Erika) and then there was three things happened simultaneously, A Harvard College life & two case proceedings. Once I got the grip of the movie after 15minutes then I actually started to enjoy it plus I realize how smart the writing, direction and editing have been done. Every scene, dialogue & actor comes on screen are captivating. Its David Fincher's smart direction, Aaron Sorkin's sharp screenplay & Brilliant performances by the ensemble young cast which made the movie what it has become today! Now let's talk about wonderful performances by talented young cast.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg (Mark Zuckerberg): I've always found Jesse one note of an actor, who plays geek or dorky and always acts the same in every movie ever since Cursed (Horror), Adventurland (coming of age comedy) or Zombieland (Thriller/Comedy) but this is the first time he plays genius, evil, jealous, liar & manipulative geek with utmost perfection. I think it was a huge huge jump from his previous performances. In every scene, he was so convincing in whatever he says & does that you actually believe that he is the ultimate evil genius. I truly wish he gets the Oscar nod because he justly deserves it. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield (Eduardo Saverin): When I heard Andrew Garfield signed on to play ""Spider Man"" I've got my hands on his previous notable works and I saw ""Boy A"" he was superb in the movie. I loved his performance so much that I started watching his other movies like ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" & ""Red Riding: In the Year of Our Lord 1974"". In all his previous movies he was Brilliant. Now in The Social Network, he again proved that he is superbly talented & the ultimate British talented lad in Hollywood. His performance is so brilliant in the movie that, I was actually rotting for him the entire time and hated Jesse Eisenberg (Mark Zuckerberg). Andrew Garfield will defiantly get an Oscar nod for his honest portrayal. <br/><br/>Armie Hemmer (Cameron Winklevoss/Tyler Winklevoss) & Josh Pence (Tyler Winklevoss): Armie Hemmer got me do WOW every single time he was on screen, he was par excellence. I remember Armie Hemmer through his stint on Gossip Girl, at that time I found him very mature for his age and the reason was his strong voice and looks. Now after watching The Social Network, I have realized how good actually his voice is and that it actually made the ""Winklevoss Twins"" so strong, believable & 6.5 foot tall. I think Armie Hemmer should get big rewards for his performance as both Twins. Josh Pence was the ""Blonde Winklevoss body"" but later on digitally they put Armie's face on his body. Still I am mentioning him here because he deserved to be mentioned. <br/><br/>Justin Timberlake (Sean Parker): Justin Timberlake was great, in 5 seconds you completely forget that he is JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE & he becomes Sean Parker only. I loved how confidently he acted as Sean parker, who is fast, mean & cunning. No wonder he is been getting so many accolades for his portrayal.<br/><br/>Max Minghella (Divya Narendra): Max has relatively small part as compare to all other actors but still he was significant part of the whole story. He was natural as always. <br/><br/>Rooney Mara (Erica Albright): Rooney Mara was Amazing, strong and Sharp. She was in the first Break-up scene and then came for two more scenes only and still she leaves a strong impact. I loved her expressions where she finds out Mark has written awful things about her on his blog. She was flawless, can't wait to see her as Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"".<br/><br/>Brenda Song (Christy Lee): Brenda Song was hot, adorable & nothing like London Tipton of ""The Suite Life on Deck"". I pleasantly surprise to see her in such adult role & defiantly want to see her more. Loved her!<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson (Amelia Ritter), Malese Jow (Alice Cantwel), Rashida Jones (Marylin Delpy), Joseph Mazzello (Dustin Moskovitz), Patrick Mapel (Chris Hughes), and Trevor Wright (Josh Thompson): They were young & Hot simple as that! <br/><br/>Overall, a fascinating true story told in a fascinating & captivating way. A must see by everyone who is addicted to Facebook or not! A sure Oscar contender & Winner. (Inception & Black Swan can have a hard time)."

","Wow. Where to begin? OK, The Social Network is a definite for the best picture nominees, and only due to the buzz and not just the ""ten-nominees, let's get viewers"" best pic award recent change.<br/><br/>Do I agree with that? Well, yes and no. Yes, because we have to fill 10 slots and 2010 was a horrid year for movies. No, because, sadly, it might win.<br/><br/>By all means, it wasn't a bad film; it was a very good film, indeed. But, it was not Best Picture caliber. And if they allow it to win, it can only mean: they're trying an outreach to the ""younger"" crowds. Quite frankly, despite the cast, premise and target audience, this is NOT geared to the college kids. In fact, anyone who lived in the era this is pertaining to is in my age group: mid 30s.<br/><br/>Anyways, I digress The Social Network show the BIRTH and (almost) downfall of the latest (and in my opinion, better) version of MySpace. It's enormously face-pacedand generally, that's a good thing. Here, you just better keep upbecause, it rarely slows down.<br/><br/>The main character is one Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) who's a nerd, a FAST talker and an arrogant asswipe who uses all around to amuse himself. In this case, he develops the now-popular Facebook, springing from judging women and his boredom. Lucky himit's proved quite profitable.<br/><br/>And that's the other part of the movie: the disposition of 2 lawsuits involving the frontrunners to the social site and their greed for their ""rightful"" cut.<br/><br/>Is the world ready for the background story of Facebook? Do we all need to know how the site we (well, 99.5% of the world) log in daily, if not hourly, came to be? Time will tell on those stories, but call me ignorantbut I could care less. I'm an American, just give it to me, make sure it works and I'm happy.<br/><br/>As for the movie, it does have good acting (I can surely see Eisenberg nominate, and not upset if he wins), good dialogue and again, the pace is as fast as the internet connection to keep Facebook a fun and social activity.<br/><br/>Is the movie great? No. It's moody enough to catch people's attention. Thanks (Director) Fincher, who rarely lets us down. I would recommend, but it's not something I would jump to see again. As I said, it's barely interesting enough to see the birth (and almost downfall) of Facebook.but not enough to rush to see how it came to be, again.<br/><br/>Just make sure it works, you I.T. nerds (no offenseI used to date one of you) and I will be happy."

Next Rooney Mara, well I have to say they casted the right person, and also the best friend Eduardo was played perfectly. The main character was good, played by Jesse Eisenberg was OK. He did a really well played character when talking too fast and describing, but other than that he bored me. The movie itself was pretty good. When I came out, I hated the movie, but when I thought about it, I thought it wasn't that bad, and over time I figured it was good. Yet, too overrated.

","""The Social Network"" is a great film and it does deserve all the credit it's getting. The key is in how Sorkin crafted the story and the characters and then how the actors ably portrayed those characters.<br/><br/>This isn't about Facebook, but more the guys, or guy, who invented it. And the way Sorkin presented these characters was perfect. I was never very sure about exactly what Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) was like but I could quickly get a handle on everybody around him: Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer) and Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). They represented Harvard students, and they represented them accurately.<br/><br/>I was particularly impressed with Garfield. He was the slightly awkward loner, the caring friend, the ambitious businessman, and the revengeful scorned friend, but most importantly by the end he was the one who I had to see through to get to the real Mark Zuckerberg. Originally I had said that Mark Ruffalo was my vote for Best Supporting Actor, but I might have to retract that statement. It's now Garfield. And of course Aaron Sorkin for Best Adapted Screenplay. This film wouldn't have been much without the incredible and interesting dynamics that Sorkin created.<br/><br/>Upon it's initial release, I was quite put off because they basically marketed it as: A movie about Facebook, starring Michael Cera, and brought to you by the director of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. What about that statement would make me want to see this film? They should have tried something like ""A film not about Facebook, but the face of the guys behind the book. Written by Aaron Sorkin."" There, Columbia Pictures, 18 free words for you.<br/><br/>I want to say The Social Network is the best college film ever made, but that is such a negative genre, and I don't mean to insult the film that way."

","Note: The original text is in Portuguese. I use the Google Translator to translate. I revised the text and I think there are no problems.<br/><br/>The Social Network reveals the behind the creation of Facebook, a site created by Mark Zuckerberg, who, ironically, despite having become the youngest billionaire in the world creating the largest Internet social network, was unable to keep his only true friend.<br/><br/>The screenplay, written by Aaron Sorkin and adapted from the book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" is very well structured, interspersing the story of the creation of Facebook and lawsuits over Zuckerberg, one by the Winkelvoss twins (Armie Hammer) together to their partner Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) and another by his former best friend, the Brazilian Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). The editing, by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall, together the extremely fast dialogs become efficient in making an analogy with the speed of information on the Internet today.<br/><br/>Played by Jesse Eissenberg (Zumbiland), very talented young actor, Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed as a very complex person. A cold, expressionless guy, who we never know for sure his true personality. And working on it, Donald Graham Burt (production designer who worked with Fincher on Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) creates a dark universe, lifeless, that portrays the indifference and lack of importance that the protagonist has with the world around him. Also in this context, David Fincher, brilliantly chooses a direction with a small depth of field, focusing only on what is important from the standpoint of Zuckerberg. Thus, when it comes to following the henley sequence, in which nothing has any connection with the life of Zuckerberg, strong colors, intense lighting and a almost completely blur take care of the sequence.<br/><br/>Moreover, the depth of field turns out to be the only outstanding device in Fincher's direction for The Social Network, which performs a moderate direction in relation to his other movies. But even restrained, Fincher shows excellence in portraying visually the obscure personality of Zuckerberg on the sequence in which Sean, the creator of Napster (played by Justin Timberlake), is arrested. Sean phones Zuckerberg and while he explains the situation, the plan below is a closeup of the face of Zuckerberg and a light being extinguished in the background, a simple detail that would mean nothing if later, Zuckerberg was not questioned for being himself the responsible for Sean's arresting.<br/><br/>Anti) Hero? Villain? The film leaves the viewer to consider it. But with all that has been exposed, I could not help but agree with the sentence said to Zuckerberg by one of his legal advisers: ""You're not an asshole, Mark. You're just trying so hard to be. ""<br/><br/>Thus, The Social Network - even if not surpassing Zodiac, the director's masterpiece - it's a gem in the filmography of Fincher and may be considered one of the best biopics ever made."

","Mark Zuckerberg  And His Lessons For Entrepreneurs<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg is a genius who used the power of his mind to see the invisible needs of visible human beings. Something that management guru C K Prahlad called as ""Strategic Intent"" many decades back. Mark also saw what he had in him and how to use it; what he didn't have and where or who to get it from.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg is also a shark who used the power of his mind to bite the lesser species – Homo Sapiens v1.0 ..Homo Sapiens v1.9 - in every weak spot at every opportunity. For example, in a court scene, when the jury begs for attention, Mark says his mind is on something so different that his opponents don't even have the intellectual ability to think of but will claim to be theirs! But the script would have demanded that!<br/><br/>As to how Mark says the many things he says, one should only see the movie to experience it! Standing tall and heard the loudest was his line <br/><br/>""If you were the inventors of Facebook, you would have invented Facebook!"".<br/><br/>All other actors are better than the best I have seen in my life – but nowhere near Mark!<br/><br/>In the way I experienced it, the movie is a lesson on how entrepreneurs can sow a seed called 'idea', see them germinate to become a plant and how the plant needs to be watered so that the buds can blossom. And all this has to happen at the speed of light! <br/><br/>It also highlights the importance of acknowledging the role of mentors and having the right mentors to make the unimaginable become real.<br/><br/>Is There Anything Immoral Or Unethical About Mark?<br/><br/>Businesses thrive and flourish on the greed of its founders. However, this greed should be directed at the competition and not on the Co- Founders – in letter and spirit. A fact acknowledged by the court when Eduardo won his case.<br/><br/>With the money he now has, he can buy the world – but if ever he goes bankrupt in his lifetime again, he can never get the spirit of Eduardo Saverin to be with him.<br/><br/>At no stage of the movie does the viewer get an impression that Mark Zuckerberg is ""An Accidental Billionaire"". It this technology age, it always looked like 'a windfall that was waiting to happen'.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the way, if the Mark Zuckerbergs can be a bit more fair, moral and ethical to the Eduardo Saverins of the world – who, as buddies, extend every possible help in the embryonic stages of the business - on money matters and not short change them, the world will be a better place for entrepreneurs and the people whose families depend on them for livelihood.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the Zuckerbergs suck and no wonder Mark is a Harvard drop out because there was one thing Harvard would have tried to teach him – ethical and moral obligations - and he would never learn!"

","The Social Network...""A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? A billion dollars!""<br/><br/>Alright, put it this way; you wake up on a good morning and you say I'm gonna make a movie about something 500 million people use, like and spend time on every day. How do you think this movie is going to do? The answer is really one of three options; one, it earns loads of money and tops everyone's expectations. Two, it becomes as horrible as any twilight movie and just makes the money based on anticipation. Or three, it sinks in so bad, you regret waking up that morning. My fellow movie goers build your hopes up, it is option one.<br/><br/>As you may have seen, read or heard, this is the story behind the creation of one of our current time's most prominent inventions, Facebook. But, as interesting as it may sound, I thought it's quite scary; because such an idea is not one that gets a second a chance. If a movie is made about it, there isn't a big chance another one will be. The good news is, the minds behind making such a picture aren't of some average movie makers.<br/><br/>This is a tale of success and a parody of emotions, a blend of sophisticated intellect and willful deceit. The story goes around college life of Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg , a man who, as depicted on the poster, is a punk, a genius, a traitor and a billionaire. From a college nerd hacking into Harvard's network, to the world's youngest billionaire, the road isn't as bumpy as you may think, but as Mark manages to make 500 million friends, he gets himself some enemies.<br/><br/>On the movie making side, the genius bunch, behind the scenes, lead this project to a quite impressive outcome. Executive producer Kevin Spacy, Hollywood's infamous screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and Academy Award nominated director David Fincher of ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club"", all combine their efforts to take a few uprising acting talents and one of the coolest ideas for a movie this year, and make a blockbuster. <br/><br/>From the opening dialogue of the film you know you're in for a screen writing treat. But as it moves forward, chemistry arises between all sides, from acting to editing to screenplay and ultimately to directing. I recall 20 minutes into watching this, all I wanted to do is find out who's editing; the answer is Kirk Baxtor and Angus Wall, editors whose last project had been Fincher's ""The curious case of Benjamin Button"". The artistic mix and mash of scenes from the past and the present, and the clash of flashbacks and flash forwards in ""The Social Network"" depict the exceptional talent of the editing team and off course David Fincher himself. <br/><br/>In this film, upcoming youngster Jesse Eisenberg plays the lead role of the man behind Facebook; Mark Zukerberg. I remember a few weeks before the movie release I saw a picture of Eisenberg online captioned ""The next Michael Cera?!!"". I guess an opposite scenario would be Cera's best fit now because Jesse Eisenberg has just stepped his game up quite a few notches. We've seen Eisenberg before, the clumsily funny side of him in ""Zombieland"" side by side with mighty Woody Harelson, and the awkwardly confused teenager in ""Adventureland"" against the world champion of the awkwardly confused ""Kristen Stewart"". This time, however, Eisenberg takes it deeper into serious drama accepting the challenge of portraying a real life significant character that everyone can relate to. The way he did it makes me think he'd probably watched every video and heard every speech of Zuckerberg since he's made it to fortune and fame. A little award shower on Eissenberg's head wouldn't be much of a surprise in the next few months.<br/><br/>And how can I forget, our beloved Justin Timberlake who's probably finally found his perfect acting fit in the role of Sean Parker, creator of Napster, the other punk that inspired Zuckerberg's success. Eissenberg, Timberlake, together with Andrew Garfield who plays Zuckerberg's best friend Eduardo Saverin are about the 3 faces you'll be looking at all movie long. They'll do anything but bore you.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, even if ""The Social Network"" doesn't strike the liking of Mr 26 year old 6.9 billion dollar Mark Zuckerberg, it will serve the opposite to its viewers. Set your expectations on watching a realistic drama about the life of the planet's youngest self-made billionaire and his most controversial story in the business world today, and you won't be disappointed."

","¨You know what's cooler than a million dollars? A billion dollars.¨ <br/><br/>How in the world do you make a two hour film about the invention of facebook and make it an engaging thriller? The answer is pretty simple: get David Fincher to direct the film and Aaron Sorkin to write the screenplay. Fincher is one of the best modern day directors who seems to turn everything he touches into gold. I don't think I was alone in the opinion that making a movie about Facebook was a bad idea. I just thought it would be impossible to keep the viewers interested for two hours on a computer nerd; at most it would be decent material for a short film. But once I heard Fincher was involved with the project I totally bought into the idea. Fincher has proved himself with such great films as Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, and Benjamin Button; and with the Social Network he has created one of the best modern biopics I have seen. He will surely be nominated for best director, and the film will also garnish several other nominations, including best picture.<br/><br/>Sorkin (A Few Good Men, Charlie Wilson's War) should also be credited for the success of the film because his screenplay was perfect (it will also be nominated for best adapted screenplay, you can count on it). He creates such great characters that are far from being one-dimensional. You have Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg from Zombieland and Adventureland fame) who is sort of a jerk, incapable of being social, a real intelligent and arrogant guy, but who you end up routing for because let's face it he invented facebook one of our favorite vices on the internet. The guy may not have any social skills, but he is a genius and there is always something attractive about geniuses. We can forgive him because he is just so wicked smart, but I don't think any one of us would want to be his friends or much less stand anyone like that. His only friend, Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield, the soon to be Peter Parker in the new Spider Man franchise) is also a student in Harvard who seems to be the only person who stands Mark even though he is treated cruelly at times, but he is good at keeping his composure and hiding his emotions. Eduardo and Mark found the company Thefacebook.com together which begins exclusively for Harvard students but begins to spread to other schools. Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake) hears about the website and arranges a meeting with Mark and Eduardo foreseeing the potential the site has. Sean happens to be the inventor of Napster, and unlike Mark he is very social and expressive. The characters seem to complement each other, and it all works to perfection.<br/><br/>The film is non linear as we jump back and forth from Harvard to the law suits that Mark is going through once he has become a billionaire. He is being sued by his best friend Eduardo (which makes the viewer wonder what has gone wrong with their relationship) and on the other hand by the Winklevoss twin brothers who actually suggested the idea for an exclusive Harvard site and claim Mark stole it from them. Mark was always obsessed about getting into Final Clubs in College and when the twin brothers came to him with the idea about a Harvard exclusive site everything clicked for him. He could be the president of his own exclusive site. He was a visionary and everything paid off for him: ¨ We lived in farms, then we lived in cities, and now we're gonna live on the internet! ¨ <br/><br/>The Social Network is a modern day biopic full of thrills thanks to a great script and a good performance from the cast (especially by Andrew Garfield). The score is also great and contributes to the overall story, as well as the filming which is just brilliant. The rowing scenes were beautifully shot, but they weren't just there for artistic purposes. The entire rowing scenario with the twins was sort of a parable of how they were used to being first all the time. When they finally lose to the Dutch they realize that being second brings no reward. Zuckerberg beat them at coming up with the idea for Facebook, perhaps a little unethically on his part, but the difference between being first and second in the business world is gigantic no matter how tight the race is. Fincher has directed a great film and will probably get a lot of recognition during award season because he was able to transmit the importance of our modern day internet age. Fincher should be considering making a sequel to this film about the founders of Twitter; nah maybe that is a really bad idea. Anyway The Social Network is my favorite biopic this year and finally brought down The Runaways to second place. It's all about being first, that's what makes the difference.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","If I had to imagine the person who created Facebook, I would imagine the Mark Zuckerberg of the movie The Social Network. <br/><br/>Indeed, I would imagine an uncomfortable, social misfit eager for some kind of power--and especially the power to hurt people he can't own. A player whose favorite pastime with the girlfriend is one-upping the girlfriend, routing her in every conversation. A frustrated social climber ready and eager to play and exploit those with money and social standing. A user bright enough to create Facebook and schizophrenic enough to justify every security gaffe that leaves users exposed and vulnerable for exactly as long as it takes for Whomever to get whatever information it wants from Facebook.<br/><br/>I would imagine a creepy, power-hungry freak who didn't care about whom he exposed or exploited on the way to wherever he wanted to go. <br/><br/>Watching The Social Network on Sunday night, I did not imagine I was watching the biography of Mark Zuckerberg. I did not think for a moment there was a one-to-one correspondence between what was happening on the screen and what happened in the life of the Harvard students who created Facebook.<br/><br/>But I did see a creative exploration of the question, What kind of person created Facebook--and what kind of person thinks it's a good use of time? <br/><br/>Because I think Facebook is the antithesis of me, I was completely comfortable with the idea that Facebook's founder is an emotionally damaged social misfit--which is to say a greedy, selfish little bastard who doesn't care about whom he hurts or how badly. Nevertheless, I was glad the movie was over when it was because all that bad karma on a Sunday night is not a good thing.<br/><br/>The Social Network has Facebook growing out of a young man's desire to hurt a young woman who (sensibly) spurned him. Can good come of that? I don't think so. The movie also shows some avid Facebookers becoming obsessive and paranoid thanks to their living too closely to the pages they stalk. A good thing? When there's so much air to breathe out there in the real world, can it be?<br/><br/>The Social Network is a good movie that ended exactly when it should have. <br/><br/>My prediction? When the sixth edition of the DSM comes out, Facebook will be a diagnosis. May the Pill People offer up a cure for it."
"jnguyen46117","10","0","2","5 December 2010"," The Social Network: 10/10
","Interestingly enough, Hollywood had decided to make a movie about a boring subject, the making of Facebook. The story was supposed to be just a mess with lawsuits and betrayal of friends. But writer Aaron Sorkin turned the story into a must-see of the decade. He turned it into a witty, fast-paced, thrilling, and an Oscar-winning script. Luckily, The Social Network got David Fincher (Curious Case of Benjamin Button) as a director, which makes it even better. David Fincher's achievement in this film is going to score him another Oscar nod. (Fincher is directing The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, English version, my favourite book). The actual Facebook story is about Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a Harvard undergraduate (computer genius), who wrote the code for the Facebook website. Teaming up with him was him roommate Eduardo Saverin, whom later sued him for... well lots of **** Mark ran into playboy Sean Parker who convinced Mark to ""betray"" his partner (Eduardo), that's what lead to the law suit. Though people say Aaron Sorkin's script is an inaccurate portray of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who in real life is down to Earth and not an **** like in the story, I say he was just trying to make the story A LITTLE more interesting than it already is (sarcasm). Aaron Sorkin not only made the story more interesting, he made it smarter and more thrilling. Performance wise? I will have to admit that I think The Social Network will dominate the Oscars in the acting categories. Jesse Eisenberg gave one hell of a performance! Since he had been playing a loser-with-no-girlfriend kind of guy, this is really typical for him. His fast talking and annoying ass attitude really stole every scene that the camera sets on him. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake also gave fine, dramatic performances which MIGHT earn them an Oscar nod. But in terms of Jesse Eisenberg, he is guaranteed an Oscar nomination (he might even win considering there is no other good movies this time of year). Directing, writing, and acting all great in one movie is rare (to say the least). The Social Network succeeds in every assets that the film was trying to achieve."
"mbullvaster","9","0","1","4 December 2010"," Great from start to finish
","Sorkin grabs hold with the opening scene. Eisenberg's first lines of dialogue portray a dark, uncaring, almost sociopathic genius. His lack of caring for wealth or almost anything makes for a very interesting and gripping character. The directing is top-notch, but what else can anyone expect from David Fincher. After directing movie greats such as Brad Pitt, Edward Nortin, and Morgan Freeman in Fight Club and Seven it's a different feel seeing him working with a more upcoming and soon to be superstar of Hollywood in Eisenberg. Lets not forget about Justin Timberlake who is a perfect Sean Parker; smart, charismatic, and even a little paranoid. All in all this movie achieves levels of success in every category; directing, writing, and acting. Defiantly a must see for anyone who appreciates quality in the film industry."
"kalel41","10","0","2","29 November 2010"," A Perfect Movie!
","There is always one movie each year that manages to get everything right, and ""The Social Network"" is that film. well, it is a David Fincher film! From the script, to directing, the performances and even the music is perfect. The film has a great opening and keeps building momentum til the very end. The narrative jumps back and forth from Zuckerberg's case where he is being sued by his former buddies and class mates to all the events that led up to the trial. And not one bit of its confusing but its all entertaining. Jesse Eisenberg is pretty much Jesse Eisenberg in every role but this happens to be the perfect movie for Eisenberg. He pull off the nerdy genius guy with ease and adds depth unseen in his other films. I guess he finally got some great material to work with. Andrew Garfield's Eduardo is the heart of this film while Timberlake's Sean Parker is the film's douche bag. The Winklevoss twins offer up some great comedy and both are remarkably played by one actor, Armie Hammer. ""The Social Network"" (which makes it possible for me to write this review and share it with you all), is fun, intriguing and a genius piece of film making. It is the best movie I've seen this year so far and will definitely walk away with a few Oscars.

","Let me begin this review by saying, this film is NOT about Facebook. No, this film is about one Mark Zuckerberg and his tumultuous journey to success in becoming the youngest billionaire in the world.<br/><br/>Firstly, the performances. The entire cast was phenomenal. Each and every actor gave it their all, and not one of them came up short. Even Justin Timberlake gave a very strong performance. Brenda Song, though she didn't have a large role, was surprisingly solid as well. There is a lot of Oscar Buzz surrounding these young actors, and I truly hope both Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield receive nominations.<br/><br/>Next, the writing. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay is nothing short of ingenious. He should win an Oscar for conceiving the words 'Seanathon' and 'Winklevai' alone.<br/><br/>Let's not forget the score. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed a score that is beyond words. These two gentlement deserve nothing less than an Oscar.<br/><br/>A cinematic masterpiece, 'The Social Network' defines our generation and deserves every award it can get."
"dvc5159","9","0","1","28 November 2010"," A film which superbly defines our generation today while also telling a great origin story.
","Sometimes you can tell whether or not you're watching a good film by either looking at your watch and wondering whether or not the film is going to end soon. ""The Social Network"" is a brilliant film, because I didn't check my watch, not even once, nor did I ponder about when the film was going to end because it was so good I didn't want it to end.<br/><br/>Many people had doubts about this film before its release. A movie about the origins of Facebook, the social networking site. Eyes were rolled, undoubtedly. Then, as soon as acclaimed filmmaker David Fincher and equally acclaimed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin became attached to the project, suddenly the buzz was about. Needless to say, the film blew away my expectations.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that this has got to be the best acting ensemble I've see all year. Jesse Eisenberg is just astounding as Mark Zuckerberg, the arrogant, frank, calculative, and very sarcastic but non-the-less super- smart protagonist. The character is written in a way that it doesn't resemble the cliché Hollywood nerd hero - Zuckerberg in this movie is a cold, manipulative jerk in some moments of the film. But, like all humans, he is flawed - he has a personality, and Eisenberg portrays that flawed side of him with confidence and with a huge dose of wit to boot. Andrew Garfield also gives a nuanced performance as Zuckerberg's (ex) best friend Eduardo Saverin, whose performance ranges from cocky to quiet/calm and finally, outrage. The Winklevoss twins are played to cocky perfection by Armie Hammer, a feat considering it's one actor playing two characters, and he does a fantastic job at both of the characters' various degrees. The rest of the youthful cast all deserve praise - Justin Timberlake, Max Minghella, Brenda Song and Rooney Mara... Heck Eisenberg and Garfield should definitely get Oscar nominations at the very least for their performances, and the entire cast - among the finest of young acting talent today - deserves a Screen Actors Guild Award.<br/><br/>The screenplay - another aspect of the film which I love - is filled to the brim with fantastic dialog and with great coherence to boot. Every line feels natural, the actors that speak them breathe life and fresh air into them, and it pulls you even further into this story which is already being done justice by the acting. Sorkin gives solid footing and strength to the story, and the dialog just dances around naturally around the audience for them to savor every moment that is shown to them - similar to Quentin Tarantino movies. Sorkin deserves another Oscar nomination because he manages to turn a potentially uninteresting and boring premise into one of the most gripping, exhilarating and powerful screenplays of the last decade. I'm not joking. You are pulled into this breakneck world of Zuckerberg and you either enjoy or hate the ride that Sorkin has written out for us. Either way, it's a hell of an experience.<br/><br/>Which comes to the question - does David Fincher deserve another Oscar nomination for this film? Undeniably. It is under his superb direction that the actors bring their best to their roles and the screenplay given such life. Not once did the film feel contrived or clichéd - even though it's a true story and we expect it to be. We are curious to know what happens next - this is the beauty of Fincher's craft. Amidst the factors mentioned above as well as the glossy production design, the simple yet beautiful cinematography and the slick and very coherent editing, Fincher's direction brings this all together under his brilliant supervision. This is the work of a master film director at his best, and truly his best film since ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club"" more than a decade ago. That's saying something.<br/><br/>On an extra note the electronic music score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is just outstanding and brilliant; it perfectly suits the situations, atmosphere, and era of the film, and should hearken yet another Oscar nomination - the first of its kind.<br/><br/>Many of us are Facebook users. Fact. We use it for all kinds of social activities - making new friends, letting people know what you're up to, getting people to know you more, and so on. ""The Social Network"" is an outstanding film which explores the origins of this phenomenon, where our protagonist is not an easy character to like, moreover he is overcome with friendship, lies and betrayal just to get this site up and running. We all may had our drama, but mostly nothing compared to what Zuckerberg had to face during the entire ordeal. The film begins loudly, progresses at a breakneck pace, and ends quite solemnly, and we all feel for him. You'll never look at Facebook the same way again after watching this film. Since most of us are all obsessed with this social networking and blogging trend, it comes to no surprise that this is the film that defines our generation today, and it does so with gracefulness and power.<br/><br/>So far this is my pick for the best film of 2010. And ""Inception"" was damn good, too.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 94/100"
"LinJason","10","0","1","27 November 2010"," Where's the 'like' button of this film?
","Quick, ruthless and cunningly brilliant. This is two hours of rapid dialogue spells that draw your attention and energy away to leave you in a mesmerising dazzle. The Social Network strictly adheres itself to the traits of the computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg who created Facebook and shares his account through his eyes, prompting one to step into his shoes, enter the realm of geeky genius, and finally seeking the 'like' button of this film (if it exists).<br/><br/>It is true that this film, with its talented cast and crew, will achieve greatness like how Facebook achieved worldwide success. Seemingly uninspiring little ideas, when put together and conceived by a genius mind, gave rise to the Facebook social networking phenomenon that has integrated within our daily lives like oxygen to a brilliant mind.<br/><br/>David Fincher's film is no less different.<br/><br/>Who would have thought that a movie about the founding of Facebook and its creator Mark Zuckerberg will be so engaging with wits sprinkled across every dialogue exchanged. Drawing reference to the geeky nature of Zuckerberg's mind, the film has catered for an intellectual fast-paced treatment that is worthy of a Harvard computer programmer. The language at play here is indirectly complex, jargon-filled and is always full of hidden underlying meanings, insults and sarcasm.<br/><br/>Like how Zuckerberg is always constantly at work to improve and move ahead of others, the astonishing intensity of the dialogues suggests how one has to pay full attention to digest and keep up with the story development before risking getting lost and left behind.<br/><br/>Though a little demanding, but it is rewarding at the end of Zuckerberg's talkative journey.<br/><br/>Already a public-listed quality, Fincher's direction is exquisitely powerful with the sensational screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. Answering the call to achieve technical excellence is the beautiful lowlight imagery and the amazing play of DOF (depth of field) by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and his RED ONE camera with the latest Mysterium-X sensor that improves low- light capabilities, rendering great details. These are highly reflected in the dim night club scenes as well as the rowing competition in UK.<br/><br/>Ensemble cast plays a huge contribution to the film's credibility and emotions drawn from its audience, especially of Eisenberg as Zuckerberg and Timberlake as Napster founder Parker. They were spot on choices for their respective roles and were responsible for leading the show with superb multi-dimensional character portrayal.<br/><br/>Everything revolving Zuckerberg's inept social proficiency gave birth to the revolutionary digital social experience, one that he will be in control of and on top of. The social network dream is really based upon Zuckerberg's dreams of living as a high social butterfly, where monetary prospects of his creation is of secondary importance to him.<br/><br/>He is more concerned being labelled as an a**hole by his date over advertising revenues.<br/><br/>However, in the midst of achieving greatness for Facebook, Zuckerberg has gradually twisted his perception in his life and lives by questionable rules and beliefs. He turns delusional as he ousted his best friend Saverin out of Facebook due to visionary disagreement of Facebook's direction. The verbal virus worms from Parker drift them apart further.<br/><br/>The interesting notion about Zuckerberg is, he actually knows what he wants and what he is after right from the beginning. Despite being supposedly 'brainwashed' by Parker, he remains nonchalant against the evils that Parker is advocating, such as drugs and underage girls. Zuckerberg remains an unpredictable and hard to understand personality who works alone in his own unique manner.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg seems to be amazed by a tiny bubble that has appeared before him and he serves to protect the bubble at all cost upon seeing what the bubble might be capable of. As the bubble grows bigger, surrounding bystanders become jealous of his success and tries to sabotage and burst it. This forces Zuckerberg to be alone with his bubble and when it finally bursts, as all bubbles will eventually, he has to realise at the end of the day that what really matters is the beauty of the initial bubble forming that captivated him.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg is after all, not a genius by choice and yearns to live sociably well among others.<br/><br/>The Social Network has to be one of the greatest cinematic surprise that expands the boundaries of an auto-bibliographic genre. Apparently, many moments in the film will be possibly telling you how nothing is impossible.<br/><br/>The Social Network is impossibly good."

I don't waste time on it, and in my opinion putting all these personal details about your self anyone can just find you by name is just foolish.<br/><br/>I've been involved in some underground, and, or, otherwise start-up operations and this really captured the excitement and feeling of it. And also like the movie in one of those biz adventures I've gotten screwed (although minuscule in comparison). <br/><br/>The moral of the story is, always get stuff down on paper! The fact that so many businesses die before they even get started, starting things are so often so causal, etc. And then when money comes into play so do politics, greed, etc. If the Winklevoss brothers et al really thought they had something it seems to me if they would have Zuckerberg sign some sort of NDA first, or some kind of non-competition agreement, etc., they would be the 60% owners not Zuckerberg.<br/><br/>A good companion to this move is ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"" (look it up here on IMDb). See the parallel? It's like Mark Zuckerberg was the Bill Gates of the social networking world! In this case the Winklevoss team was Apple Computer. Ironically Gates was a speaker at Harvard in the movie."

In our countries and, within years in the world, practically no one and not in a life time but every year, every month, everyday. Some will say this film shows the worst side of capitalism. I will say this film shows the most realistic side of the spirit and fire of free enterprise and free enterprise, in a capitalist or socialist free market economy, is the engine of the economy and the development of a country, of a society, of masses of people and of each individual.<br/><br/>The film shows marvelously how it is not the rich who achieve the best things when they are young because when you are rich and using silver spoons for breakfast and golden spoons for tea you hire the services of those who are more intelligent than you to do what you have the money to do but not the intelligence.<br/><br/>It is the one who cannot put one thousand dollars on the table who has the best idea and the knowledge necessary to create vast adventures because he knows in our modern world that what is going to succeed has to be cool and cool means free, freewheeling, easy-going, with no controls and no cops, or cash desks everywhere. Everyone knows that you will not succeed in any communication enterprise if you want to cash straight away the profit you will cash in ten years but not from the simple subscribers, but from the users who use the social network you have created to pass around a commercial message wrapped up in a way that makes it palatable for the simple subscribers who hate spam and anyway do not read it. That's where the creator of Facebook and the creator of Napster were and are right.<br/><br/>To liberate that communication power, a power that is virtual and real at the same time, a simulacrum for conservatives and a big leap forward for normal people, to liberate that force is to multiply the power and the force of each individual who can widen his knowledge, stretch his interests, pile up his connections and friends, accumulate his messages and exchanges. All the anti-virtual-reality proponents like Jean Baudrillard and a few others are just bitter people who regret a past that has gone, that is gone, that will never come back ever.<br/><br/>Maybe those inventors are so many Lucifers but Lucifer is an angel of light and I am ready to sleep, bathe, eat, drink, work, dance, write, sing, and do many other things, with that angel of light. They are going to tell you that it makes many crimes possible or easier, and they are just from the pre-stone age of mental underdevelopment. The Internet did not invent those crimes. The Internet did not make man a criminal or a pervert. It is not because we were looking at the beautiful cherubs of the Renaissance that we became, all of us, rapists of children. And there would have been no cherubs, and the pedophiles of the past would have struck anyway and all the same.<br/><br/>The film shows another element that is difficult to take, to analyze, to understand. The few people who see beyond the present and who know the technical and scientific principles that are going to change the face of the world are in this world an elite that has to defend themselves constantly against those who will try to make them work with no profit at all for themselves, I mean for those who are working, who are made to work. That explains the attitude of these people: they are afraid, they are protecting themselves, they are locked up at times in a world that is not that of ordinary people and they seem unbearable, they even try to make themselves unbearable but they are not monsters, they just need to protect their integrity and any human society is always trying to break the integrity of the weak and intelligent in order to accumulate power and riches in the hands of those who are strong and have no principles.<br/><br/>This film is a must in our culture.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"

","Now there have been many movies in the past that have shown the back story of a famous phenomenon that affected an entire generation, and arguably Facebook is that phenomenon of this generation. But what sets 'The Social Network' apart is its complete indifference to the way it portrays the character of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. By not giving clear reasons for his sort-of villainous actions, the film leaves it to the viewer to decide and even as the end credits roll, even much after that actually, you are left with a seeming doubt in mind - Hero or Villain? For the movie seems to be trying hard to convince the viewer that Mark is both. The other major characters of Mark's only friend Edourdo(Andrew Garfield) and the Napster founder Sean Parker(Justin Timberlake) are written with clear cut white and dark shades respectively.<br/><br/>The story behind Facebook, as with all great things, is actually pretty elemental. A break-up sets off a turn of events in the life of young Mark(Jesse Eisenberg), as he sets about creating what would become the world's most famous social networking site. As the story proceeds, with flashbacks and current happenings, we discover the various betrayals and events that shaped Facebook as we know it(including how the 'The' got knocked off from Facebook.com) and what would have been a pretty average story is super enhanced by crackling,on-your-face dialogues that take time for you to register, as the film is littered with just so many of them. Not only that, but the fine, restrained performances by all the actors adds a depth to the movie that makes it very realistic. The movie may not appeal to some sections of the audience simple because the movie's progress is strictly verbal and there is nothing else to support the movie except for the dialogues and the acting. The music is the one other factor that adds onto all that is good in the movie.<br/><br/>The one sore point is the some-what abrupt ending, which shows Mark using his own creation to re-connect with the very 1st person he hurts in the movie. But overall 'The Social Network' leaves a lasting impact with its sharpness and is a very engaging film thanks to the writing department. I'd give it a 4/5.<br/><br/>Even if you're not on Facebook, watch it. If you are, you anyways will."

Neither a minute of boring in this fluent movie that consecrates Jesse Eisenberg as a striking actor (how he yet had demonstrated in ""The village"" and Fincher as one of the most capable contemporary directors, who was my favourite but after his two last movies I had found him in trouble: for me, this title is his redemption! Absolutely to see!"
"dharmendrasingh","8","0","1","18 November 2010"," A story of greed, envy and betrayal
","David Fincher's latest is a wonderful film regarding the founding of that modern phenomenon we call Facebook. It's about what happens to friends when ambition, solidarity and loyalty turn into greed, envy and betrayal. <br/><br/>Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg is an adept computer-programmer. After breaking up with his girlfriend, he revengefully hacks into confidential records to retrieve images of female students, which he uses to create a perverse online game where people can decide who is 'hot or not'. <br/><br/>This causes a furore, as singular dexterity was required to commit such an act. Zuckerberg's programming prowess duly attracts the attention of other Harvard students, who request his help to form a forerunner of Facebook. Zuckerberg accepts and before long is sued by them, and also by his best friend, for intellectual property theft. Much of the film takes place before a tribunal. <br/><br/>We learn that Zuckerberg's motivation is neither money or prestige. It's battling against an inferiority complex by obsessing in his vocation. Either that or he is what some people with power cannot avoid being: hubristic. <br/><br/>It's understandable why he did not want a film to be made about him while he was alive. His portrayal (by Jessie Eisenberg) is not a generous one: cold, supercilious, treacherous. Paradoxically, he was the one to realise what humans crave most is interaction with other humans. <br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin deserves standalone recognition for his peppery script. Unlikely though it may be, Justin Timberlake gives a suave performance as business brain Sean Parker. I didn't think I'd sympathise with the plight of the well-to-do youngsters; yet I did, thanks to the credible lead performances of Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield (soon to play Spider-Man) as Facebook co-creator Eduardo Saverin. <br/><br/>Oscar Wilde once said 'To disagree with three-fourths of the British public is one of the first requisites of sanity'. You could say a similar thing about the one in every 14th person who subscribes to Facebook. But this film isn't about the merits of the number one social network. Rather, it seeks to explain how such a phenomenon changed the very people who assumed they would stay together no matter what.<br/><br/>www.scottishreview.net"

","Do you think that Social Network main character Mark Zukerberg is a real asshole? <br/><br/>To call the person who created the ""greatest fun ever"" an asshole would mean that all its users are literally f..d up. Basically in the cinematic reality created by David Fincher we could find the number of eternal messages, which are wrapped in a beautifully shot movie. Social Network makes us laugh, hate and disguise. But over all we receive the old messages about what stay behind the greatest inventions. Fincher doesn't stop to look back, when 10 years ago he acclaimed his greatest success. Nevertheless no one would punch someone on face these days; it is easier to write an asshole on a Wall to relieve anger. <br/><br/>The story line is based on the origins of the creation the Social Network called Facebook. Young Mark Zukerberg pushed the idea of his fellow students so far, that it turns into the billions dollars worse on-line project. The web-site which managed to gather more than 100 million users and not going to stop its extension. Coming up from the film title ""Social Network"", it doesn't tell us about Facebook, no it's about what stays behind every great achievement. Without reliving the details of the plot we come through the certain judgment of what the main Character Mark Zukerberg did. Was it right or wrong? Is he a real jerk or he'd done what has to be done? <br/><br/>For somehow Fincher is afraid to ask what is Facebook? In a certain way he laughs from the ""blondes"" who get hysterical about the relationship status of their boyfriends. Nevertheless, he's not pointing finger that such ""a great thing"" Facebook, a magical feature, is mostly pointless in the hands of its users and they are just a bunch of the space monkeys who don't know what to do with themselves. <br/><br/>The great things are always based on ugly and miserable thoughts, like selfish revenge or youngster's teenage jealousy. We are all the sources of our own miseries. However, unconsciously during watching the Social Network I want to come back to the Fight Club. <br/><br/>Project Mayhem was created to free the human beings. But it is unreal and can survive only on the screen. Facebook is real, but does it have any purpose? Yes, in real life we can acclaim how it connected us, make closer to each other. However, excuse me, we've got internet for this. There was no conflict between Mark and his Creation. Fight Club leads us to the X-point of the screen reality. Tyler was doing his thing, considering it was totally crazy, to change the reality. Mark even doesn't care much about his creation, he's proud of it, but in the end of the day it leads him to another point of emptiness. Mark and his Social Network – the relationship which was missed by Fincher. Facebook is acclaimed as a tool, just a cool thing, like a party, an awesome one, the party which will never end; Fight Club was the reflection of ugly truth, a disease which is spread in a human society. But its fictional, Facebook is real. <br/><br/>David Fincher polished and improved his director's skills during the decade; the tension which movie brings is tremendous. The disappointment comes when it gets clear that we have seen it before, 10 years ago, when it was wrapped in a broken collarbones and pints of blood. Today it is modest, nice and clean, wrapped in blue paper with a white ribbon. <br/><br/>Thumbs up, when comments are not necessary."

About the lawsuit between them and another lawsuit with Cameron & Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg (playing Mark Zuckerberg) and Andrew Garfield (playing Eduardu Saverin) do a fantastic job making the lead characters believable in ever possible way. They complimented each other and the chemistry they oozed on the big screen was enjoyable to watch. Supporting cast in the form of Armie Hammer (playing Cameron Winklevoss / Tyler Winklevoss), Josh Pence (playing Tyler Winklevoss), Max Minghella (playing Divya Narendra), Justin Timberlake (playing Sean Parker) and the various lawyers were well written and performed faultlessly. Justin Timberlake once again proved that he can in fact act and the combination of Armie Hammer and Josh Pence playing the twins was like watching a tennis match between the same player even though it was technically played by the same actor. Very well done in my opinion.<br/><br/>When I first heard about the Facebook film, I was quite skeptical. But honestly, David Fincher (director) has done a fabulous job making this film entertaining and serious at the same time. The screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin might be slightly dramatic but brilliant in a clever sense of way as he has managed to add enough friction to the story to make it a true entertainer while staying true to the basic storyline based on the main characters real life experiences.<br/><br/>No one really knows how exaggerated the book originally was as Ben Mezrich was never able to speak to Mark Zuckerberg while writing the book. His main source of information was co-founder Eduardo Savrin and court documents released to him. So irrespective of how genuine the story is, it makes one good film, worthy a watch in the theater. The added fact that Facebook is in fact a real website, something I used to be addicted to gives the film that added edge making it further interesting to viewers like me."

","A nerdy Harvard student and his geeky mates play a misogynistic prank on their female peers, and end up creating a multi-billion dollar company known today as Facebook. From such everyday fare Fincher conjures up a tight, keenly observed movie encompassing Shakespearean levels of farce and tragedy.<br/><br/>Biopics are not history, and anyone wishing to know the true tale of friendships made and lost as vast fortunes arose from nothing is advised to go the the library. Sorkin's predictably verbose script from the kick-off unashamedly declares itself authentically Sorkin rather than authentically undergrad class of 2003. As a movie, Social Network details the egos and neuroses that unthread interpersonal relationships on the Harvard campus as young men find themselves ill-prepared to navigate the juggernaut they create.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg as charmless and dislikeable, but utterly compelling. His triumph is that you come away from the film pitying a character worth 26 billion dollars. Andrew Garfield proves more grounded and yet gullible as Eduardo Saverin, the partner who took a huge settlement to walk away. Very quickly accelerating to post-success Facebook and courtroom drama, the film plays mostly in flashback and tests us to figure out at what point exactly Zuckerberg sold his soul to the devil, and just who the devil is - Sean Parker? Lawyers? The saps who spend their lives on Facebook making it as huge as it is? Fincher's trademark silver and dark blue palette is used to great effect on the rain-soaked campus, as Harvard's asinine, snobby campus culture serves to pervert the minds of young men towards pettiness, elitism, and a contempt for women. When twin brothers suing Zuckerberg use their family connections to meet the President, the rot is shown to emanate from the core as he brutishly fails to see the nature of the problem before him.<br/><br/>This is a highly enjoyable, timeless tale of greed, myopia and the corrupting influence of power, slickly executed by one of the most accomplished filmmakers around."

","David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin come together for what could be this year's bet movie. David Fincher has steadily been making a name for himself as on of the the best modern day American directors. He has directed the likes of Fight Club, Seven and 2007's criminally underrated masterpiece Zodiac.<br/><br/>All his movies have been trying to make a commentary on society. I don't know whether its a conscious effort but somehow it happens in his movies because of the topic he chooses and the way in which he tries to tell his story. He does owe quite a lot to his writers like Andrew Kevin Walker, Chuck Palhaniuk and Aaron Sorkin with this movie. His movies are well made and there is never a boring moment or tired moment in them.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin has proved himself to be one of the best writers in the business and he has written or co written 66 of the 86 episodes of the West Wing. He has this flair for rapid fire, interesting dialogue Thai is always saying them. Sorkin uses a lot of words but never wastes them. He always gets the point across.<br/><br/>When two minds like this come together even the the biggest Facebook hater will be interested. What earlier was touted as a simply a Facebook movie came to be much more when it was given in the talented hands of these two.<br/><br/>The Social Network is about Mark Zuckerberg's rise to fame and what followed soon after. Zuckerberg is portrayed as a more disconnected person than a cold one. It is not that he hates people or his friends it is that he simply doesn't need them. He loves programming not because he wants to be famous or earn money but it is the only place in the world he finds comfortable where things make sense to him. Relationships, girlfriends are somehow absent from his life. Sometimes we do see him longing for the past when he had a girlfriend, when there was a little tenderness in his life. But they are few or far between. Zuckerberg isn't a terrible person he just seems to be very disconnected. Like Mersault's character in the Stranger. He is brilliantly played by Jesse Eisenberg who is coming in to his own as an actor. I thought he would become more like Cera but he has differentiated himself from Cera and the awkward guy role into something more menacing. But all the anger, frustration is wonderfully masked and lies just at the surface.<br/><br/>The Social Network is not being religious to detail, fact and accuracy. Sorking said as much is in his interview. While I do not agree with what he said I believe the movie is a very good one. It entertains the viewer, it informs him and it also encourages debate and discussion and that is what art should do. It observes facts and presents them in a fairly dramatized way but I guess they had to submit to the producers in that sort of way."

","This movie in my honest opinion is a little too long, its extremely boring at times with the tedium of litigation fought out in a 'boardroom' but nonetheless engrossing, engaging and interesting - and lets face it, who doesn't use Facebook nowadays? Imagine if they made a similar movie about Bill Gates and the creation of Microsoft! It is also interesting to note from here that David Fincher was the Director behind Benjamin Button, Fight Club and Seven, all good movies in their own right. This is also a very good movie, but as others have said, it is just that - good - trying too hard to be great.<br/><br/>I have got to say that the main character portrayed for creating Facebook in the movie is extremely annoying throughout. Very obnoxious and offensive and I felt sorry for the two guys who worked with him in the Facebook set up.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake steals the show to some extent as Napsters Sean Parker, impeccable acting, as an actor, he never fails to deliver.<br/><br/>I quite believe that the drift of the story in the film is accurate but there are clearly changes to create a drama. If the real lives story are followed, then there should be no drama for us to enjoy and it is the drama which makes the film for me, not the actual telling of the Facebook story which was thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>We can all watch this and think - wow, what if I had thought of that simple concept back in the Autumn of 2003, but then again, would I really want such a life changing experience which would jeopardise my relationship with family and friends.<br/><br/>The movie is flawed in a number of basic areas. I assume nobody gets into Harward without some academic and family qualifying criteria but this is never mentioned in the movie, unlikely the twins who are clearly guys from a family with money.<br/><br/>More than once, the point is made that the guy has become the youngest billionaire on earth and that he was ruthless in his determination to execute his plan and get Facebook online, to the cost of friends (and perhaps family) connections.<br/><br/>With this in mind, as others have said, the film should have objectively explained to us how the Facebook website could come to be so valued by such a high figure after such a short time. Certainly Sean Parker speculated during the movie but this was way short of figures being talked about in litigation.<br/><br/>This was a dangerous film to watch in some ways and yet worth watching a second time to 'comb the dialogue' which was constant throughout. Dangerous because we might be wrongly inspired by its message and perhaps even distrusting of the purpose of a social networking site.<br/><br/>I always enjoy 'insight' films and I enjoyed this one despite anything I say which may be construed as negative. The opening scene between the guy and the girlfriend was incredibly tedious and could have been considerably shortened but never mind that, maybe that is the screenplay writer trying to score early points for an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Not an Oscar movie for me but its a very credible movie overall"

","Only a few years ago no one had ever heard of Facebook for one reason, it didn't exist. Today 1 out of every 14 people in the world has a Facebook account. For those unaware, Facebook is a social networking technology that allows people to share their daily lives including photos and videos to friends all over the world. While it has changed the way people communicate with each other in fundamental ways, some decry the communication as superficial and issues of privacy have arisen. The company, led by its founder and CEO, 26-year old Mark Zuckerberg, however, has reached the plateau of having 500 million users, a phenomenal achievement in so short a period of time.<br/><br/>David Fincher's film The Social Network covers the early days of the founding of Facebook when Zuckerberg was a nineteen-year old student at Harvard. Written by Aaron Sorkin, it is an indictment of a young man's obsession with status and greed at the expense of loyalty to friends. What is implied by Sorkin, who admits that social media holds little fascination for him, is that ""cool"" sites such as Facebook offer no benefits to mankind. <br/><br/>The picture presented of Zuckerberg is of a friendless computer geek, incapable of having close relationships – an angry, obnoxious, and egotistical young man. In reality, Zuckerberg comes across as warm, articulate and highly sociable, a person that really cares about ""making the world open."" The film, based on the partly made-up book Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich is a blend of fact and fiction that has Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, inventing Facebook as a means of revenge against a girlfriend who rejected him and in order to raise his social status after he was refused entry into an elite all-male ""final club"" at Harvard. <br/><br/>In an opening scene that borders on the chaotic, with music pounding in the background the camera focuses on Mark and his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) sitting at a table in a bar, bantering at a rat-a-tat speed about him fearing he will be rejected if he applies for a Harvard ""final club"". Mark is trying to win over Erica but is depicted as so socially awkward that the conversation soon boils over into personal attacks and leads her to remark that, ""Dating you is like dating a Stairmaster (a line of exercise machines)"" (in reality, the supposed friendless Mark had a girlfriend in college, Priscilla Chan, and they are still together today).<br/><br/>His feelings deeply hurt and seeking revenge for the rejection, Mark insensitively concocts a website called ""Facemash"" where he hacks into various school sites to obtain and display pictures of various girls on campus, asking users to pick the ""hottest"", treating all girls as sex objects to be used for his entertainment. In a sad commentary on the blatant sexism on the campus, Facemash becomes so popular that it crashes the entire Harvard computer system. This event leads wealthy members of Harvard's crew team, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Armie Hammer) and their friend Divya (Max Minghella), to recruit Zuckerberg to help in developing a new website called ""The Harvard Connection"", one that will allow students to line up dates and communicate with each other using the campus server. While this might have seemed original to the twins, in fact a service called Club Nexus began operating at Stanford University two years earlier using that very approach.<br/><br/>Mark agrees to work with the twins but deliberately misleads them about his intentions, sending them e-mails about how busy he is, apparently to delay their own project which he worried might be potentially competitive. At the same time, he is working on a new project called ""The Facebook"" which he is designing along with his friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), one of the films few sympathetic characters. Events are shown in flashback as the film zeroes in on later hearings resulting from two depositions, one by Eduardo who claims that he was lied to and betrayed by Zuckerberg, and the other by the Winklevoss twins who sued Mark for supposedly stealing their idea and their code.<br/><br/>Launched in February, 2004, The Facebook enrolled a ton of Harvard students in the first month of its creation. Saverin contributes his own funds to aid in the startup and is made Chief Financial Officer. It is then discovered by the co-creator of Napster, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), an aggressive Web entrepreneur who thinks in terms of expansion not only to other college campuses in the U.S. but all over the world. As it continues to expand, the name is changed simply to Facebook, Mark drops out of Harvard and moves to Palo Alto, California. The final scenes show an increasingly lonely individual, almost a tragic hero, who may have ""gained the whole world but has lost his own soul"".<br/><br/>The Social Network is an entertaining and extremely well made and beautifully acted film that holds our interest for its full two hour run. Unfortunately all the creative geniuses are men while women are shown as little more than empty headed groupies and sex objects, eager to serve the boys. While much of the film is accurate in terms of the events portrayed and, except for the invented put-downs of the lawyers, the twins, and Saverin, much of the language is taken verbatim from legal transcripts. While Fincher makes some good points about what is really important in life, it seems that in order to be dramatic, Fincher had to show Zuckerberg in an extremely unflattering manner, almost to the point of destroying his character."

","The most brilliant thing about The Social Network is not its screenplay or editing (which are impressive enough to warrant a separate mention later) but its response to the question ""how does one make a film about Facebook?"" Is there any material as un-filmable and unexciting as a story about the founder of the popular social networking site? Golden Globe-nominated writer Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men, 1992; Charlie Wilson's War, 2007) and acclaimed director David Fincher (Zodiac, 2007; The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, 2008) team up to deliver one of the best pictures of the year, a solid ""biopic"" entry that has a reasonable chance of being nominated for a few major awards during Oscar season.<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg is his name, if you haven't known already. He is played by Jesse Eisenberg, who together with the excellent ensemble cast of Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, and Armie Hammer, gives a performance that is not only quick-witted, but scathingly razor-sharp as well.<br/><br/>The story follows the Harvard undergraduate as he gets rejected by his girlfriend. That spurs him to create Facemash, a controversial site that compares and rates the ""hotness"" of two randomly chosen female students. After this episode, he gets the idea for ""Facebook"" through meetings with collaborators, and starts his site on his own together with the help of financer and co-founder Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield).<br/><br/>What transforms The Social Network's seemingly dull premise about a socially-awkward geek with a laptop into something exciting is Sorkin's extraordinary screenplay. Nearly every minute of the film contains crossfire dialogue that are uttered with such great pace that it makes Ellen Page in Juno (2007) look like she is conversing like an old granny.<br/><br/>Sorkin intelligently brings in ideas of social interactionism, or the lack of, in our modern technological age. He portrays with scenarios the current generation of ""plug-ins"" and ""refreshers"", people whose focus and frame of mind is solely devoted to communicating online, and downplaying what goes on offline.<br/><br/>In the final scene, Zuckerberg continuously refreshes the page showing his ex-girlfriend Erica's Facebook profile after adding her in the hope that she would accept him. The film ends before we could know any answer, and that is essentially what Sorkin is trying to comment on – 21st century communication disregards or tends to ignore the emotional message that goes along with the actual message, resulting in the devaluation of interpersonal communication through mediated means.<br/><br/>The Social Network is made up of two narrative threads: (1) the legal tussle between Zuckerberg and Saverin over the rights to ownership of Facebook and the resulting compensation; and (2), the chronological flashback of the two friends and their development of Facebook during the early years.<br/><br/>Editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall remarkably bring these two threads together via the skillful act of quick cutting and cross-cutting, and this to the sound of a very expertly assembled array of songs that make up the film's soundtrack. The best sequence of the film, in my opinion, goes to the competitive canoeing sequence, which is edited to the electronic version of the famous whistling theme from Fritz Lang's M (1931).<br/><br/>The Social Network is an exceptional take on the traditional and often overused premise involving the theme of friendship and betrayal. At its core, it is a humanist film that explores the relations of people as they are faced with rejection, injustice, theft (in the intellectual property sense), and jealousy. The Zuckerberg as brought to the screen by Fincher and Sorkin, while inaccurately portrayed, is a fascinating character who epitomizes the ""plugged-in"" generation. A generation whose reality is reflected here in the most ironic of interfaces – through the screen that allows us to see this must-watch zeitgeist film.<br/><br/>SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","upon on hearing about this film i was very interested as i go on facebook a lot.The cast were perfect especially Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg when going to see the film i couldn't make my mind up of what genre it was then i realised (after the first 10 minutes) it was a drama with elements of comedy.<br/><br/>the story of mark zuckerberg was extremely entertaining and i left the cinema with my friends so interested and intrigued about this sites creator (who i know nothing about) and recommend this film to any. It will be more appreciated by those who go on facebook but let's face it who isn't? 9/10 for me hope you enjoy it"
"skittleagle","9","0","1","31 October 2010"," Really good movie
","I just recently saw this movie and I was hooked with it since the first scene. The story focuses around Mark Zuckerberg and the creation of Facebook but I believe that this movie centers around the tragedy through the triumph of his billion dollar company. The movie is certainly not a fact based documentary because Fincher and Sorkin try to make the movie a visual spectacle. If this was a documentary, it would mainly be a bunch of young programmers coding which as a computer science student, I can tell you is not that entertaining. The movie comes off as an entertaining courtroom drama. I also like the way Fincher and Sorkin manage to find many different elements such as a romantic angle with Zuckerberg and Erica Albright, although it was Erica might not be a real person, her character is an important one at the climax and you feel empathy for Zuckerberg at the end of the movie. There is also the fight against the Winklevoss brothers and Divya Narendra. This shows the dark side of the inception of Facebook when Zuckerberg looks like he just stole the idea. Another aspect of the movie that was good was the music by Trent Reznor, it captures the emotions really well. The casting was also brilliant. At first I was skeptical of Jesse Eisenberg as I had seen him in Zombieland and Charlie Banks and didn't seem to offer anything different. He seemed pretty bland to be honest but in this movie he came off really well. His performance was dynamic and exciting. So were Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake, they were really good in this movie. I recommend this movie for people of all ages, as we all use Facebook and it shows a quick glimpse of how it came to be."
"bobbyelliott","8","0","1","31 October 2010"," Difficult subject done exceptionally well
","The thought of a movie about Facebook sounded awful. But the movie is, actually, very good. Most movies about computers are terrible and it's a difficult subject to make a movie about. But Fincher manages it. There is a great deal of dialogue in this film so you have to pay attention. If you do, you will be rewarded with some interesting and intelligent dialogue. The acting is good by everyone involved but particularly the lead actor.<br/><br/>It's great to see a movie celebrating intelligence. It's as close as you can come to glamorising Computer Science.<br/><br/>Some of the other reviews, in my opinion, exaggerate how good this movie is. It's no classic. Just an intelligent, well directed, interesting movie about the cultural phenomenon that is Facebook. But American Beauty it ain't.<br/><br/>A smart movie for smart people. Recommended."
"FrangipaniMozzie","7","0","1","31 October 2010"," Inspirational story but imperfectly packaged.
","On seeing the trailer initially I thought 'who the hell thought about making a movie about Facebook'. Yet after discussing it with friends, I thought it was worth a try and seeing another trailer made me warm to the idea of going.<br/><br/>As someone with Asperger's as Zuckerberg is portrayed (without a name for the personality traits) in the movie, it is an inspiration tale of an Aspie doing something with their talents and also it's great to see him being so AS and yet not caring too much (college has brought me a lot of anxiety on that one, so it was therapeutic to see someone with more confidence in a movie). Aside for the therapeutic, happy tone of the movie for me, I find the film making does leave a bit to be desired. The long legal scenes are extremely tedious however I guess there wasn't any way to make the movie without emphasising that aspect of setting up Facebook. Thankfully the vignette technique made it more bearable and the dialogue in the college scenes made the characters really endearing and it was good to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're interested in tales of creativity and can put up with some tedious elements of the film then it's worthy cinema night choice, for someone who is interested in these kinds of stories. I don't know if it'll go down as a classic or not; for me it's brilliant, but only in some elements of it."
"hicflicksdotwordpressdotcom","8","0","1","29 October 2010"," A good look into the Facebook culture and its origins. This is more of a character study, so don't expect action or any special effects here. Definitely worth a watch!
","Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com !<br/><br/>I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this film, and it actually turned out to be quite a good and engaging watch. First off, this movie hardly has any action or special affects. Its more of a deep character study. So if you are more of the action loving or special affects seeking guy / gal then this may not interest you as much. Even without that, the story kept me quite engaged throughout the length of the film. The director of the film, viz. David Fincher is one of my fav directors, and it looks like in this movie he chose to concentrate more on the story rather than showing off his cinematic and camera skills.<br/><br/>Anyways, the story revolves around Facebook and its origins, and focuses on its now billionaire founder Mark Zuckerberg (who is also the youngest billionaire in the world). As expected by me, the origin of facebook and its concept was motivated by 'women'. Here is a guy (the founder) who found it difficult to get invited to ""cool"" parties in college and also found it hard to get girls and keep a relationship. And he managed to create a portal and attract guys (who could easily get girls otherwise) to get to sign up on. That in my mind is plain — brilliant! He first made facebook exclusive to only those students who had a 'harvard.edu' email id, under the notion that girls think high of guys from Harvard. Then he slowly made the service available in other prestigious colleges . and finally to the world.<br/><br/>Also, at the time facebook originated, there were similar services already available like MySpace and Friendster. Then why was it that Facebook did so ridiculously better. I don't want to give away too much, but after seeing the movie you will realize that they built the service by giving detailed thought to basic human behaviour and action. And yeah  a small thing like ""Relationship Status"" on facebook was one of those seemingly petty but at the same time crucial things.<br/><br/>Btw, the ending of the film is a classic example of the power & gritty addiction of facebook (which most people will not admit)."
"srinivasane-arav","10","0","1","28 October 2010"," What an a-hole!
","OK, ever since the talks began about making a film about the social network, Facebook, my expectations weren't really high. First i was like meh, a film about Facebook? Is Hollywood running out of ideas? Then it was announced Fincher was going it make it and my hopes went really high and until the film got released i didn't even think about it much. Once it came in, it got rave reviews and it was universally acclaimed i told myself i was going to watch this one. Finally I got a chance to watch it only yesterday and i should say i went in with a really open mind(I really didn't want the reviews i read to have any influence on my opinion about the film). <br/><br/>Coming to the film, this is one of those rare ones where you are only moments into it and you already know it is going to be awesome. The whole film is basically a courtroom drama that is beautifully plotted with flashback scenes. It starts with a flashback scene where Mark breaks up with Erica and thats where the intricate character study of the creator of Facebook starts. In this scene, Mark who just got a perfect SAT score patronizes his girlfriend(and does much more worse things) saying how intelligent he is and how she could go places if she were more supportive. It was like a mini class war only between two people in a different IQ range, and not really about money. And that scene was just about the kick start for the viewers to anticipate how far this Harvard undergrad will go to get fame and recognition(and boy did he go far?!). <br/><br/>The film is a must for essentially everyone who is totally into the Facebook phenomenon. Not one day goes(a few hours for that matter) without us logging into Facebook and checking friends' status updates, making our own, pictures of kitties and so on. And what this film does is, it gives us a glimpse of how this all came into existence. If it weren't for the jerk who did what he did, we wouldn't be able to 'facebook' with our friends. <br/><br/>The film is not just about Mark, it is also about the people he deserts on his way to success(a really lonely one). Every character has been etched really finely, from Eduardo to the Winklevosses to the Sapster guy, Sean. <br/><br/>That said, one must not forget the script by Sorkin. If it weren't for him and Fincher the film would have been half as good with the seemingly trivial story. The dialogs are very powerful and the unusually fast delivery of them actually adds to the mood(that we are among a bunch of nerds with ultra high IQ). <br/><br/>The final scene where the junior lawyer tells Mark that the jury may not be in his favor stating certain reasons such as his 'likability', it is a particularly important one in the film. That reveals some of the deplorable thing that Mark did(like, when she asks him why he wasn't there at Sean's party) that otherwise would have gone unrevealed. That totally was a punch in the face telling how far he could go(really!).<br/><br/>This film is a very sad one about what has made our generation and how selfish, deplorable monsters have gone on to become models for aspiring entrepreneurs and such. We live in a very strange epoch where there is absolutely no moral code. Though i am fully aware that some incidents in the film were added to actually dramatize the film and the whole film is not to be faithfully taken as what actually happened, even a small part of it to have happened would be too awful to be true!"
"MovieDude1893","10","0","1","28 October 2010"," Fincher and Sorkin in complete harmony
","Prior to its release, if one peg could be attached to David Fincher's The Social Network, it would be ""The Facebook Movie"". However, now that the finished product has seen the light of day, the only peg that applies is ""work of art"". That evolution from opportunism to genuinely fascinating artistic expression is a major part of what makes The Social Network work so well.<br/><br/>So how did this happen? Turns out, good, old-fashioned movie-making can take you as far as you're willing to go. Beginning at a script level, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has devised a narrative that touches eternal themes of friendship, betrayal, and class. It is also expertly put together by Fincher, who avoids his usual visual trickery-as in the adrenaline fueled, punch drunk photography in his Fight Club- in favor of a more sedate and clinical approach to the material.<br/><br/>The film begins on a chilly late fall evening in a college town dive bar. Wild noise crowds the soundtrack as the audience joins two voices (one male, the other female) in mid-conversation. The scene is a verbal high-wire act between Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and Erica Albright (Rooney Mara), who will break up with Mark by the scene's end. The two fire back witty exchanges of dialogue that force the audience to adjust to a much faster pace than they are accustomed to.<br/><br/>That is the method of this movie: moving at high intellectual speeds and expecting the audience to keep up. Sorkin's screenplay forgoes the tiresome process of explain how a website is created and instead focuses on strict character development. It doesn't matter if the audience doesn't know a single line of computer code because it is always so obvious that the main characters know what they're talking about. It is important to know how smart these character are and how passionate they are about what they're doing.<br/><br/>The Social Network is essentially a movie with a revolving point of view, shifting from Zuckerberg to Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and the Winkevoss twins (both played, in a feat of stunning special effects, by Armie Hammer). All claim to have a large share in the creation of Facebook, and their legal depositions provide the movie's flashback structure. The Social Network forces the audience to sit up and actively engage in what is happening on screen. This is a movie where allegiance will shift from character to character, and the truth always seems tenuous and uncertain.<br/><br/>Some have claimed that the vague nature of ""truth"" offered by Fincher and Sorkin discredits the entire picture. Nothing is further from the truth. A movie, even one based on a true story, can do what it wishes with the facts, so long as it remains compelling. Other articles have termed the film a hack-job against Facebook-founder Mark Zuckerberg. I would completely disagree with that notion. Both Fincher and Sorkin are notorious perfectionists in their given fields, and their empathy for Zuckerberg is what lingers with audience well after the closing credits. We may never like Zuckerberg, but Sorkin and Fincher let us in on trying to understand him. That is the true story of the movie. It's not 'The Facebook Movie"", it's a character study of the highest order."

","OK, just like an ordinary David Fincher fan or an ordinary Facebook user right after I heard he was gonna direct a movie about Facebook my initial response was not any different from anyone else, not at all.Do we really need a movie about Facebook ? That website already captivated basis of our social life (or even the crumbs of what is left of...), the website we check mornin-noon-night.Did he really accept that offer when rumours suggesting another film-noirs, sci-fi movies a movie centered on the most popular ""thing"" out there.I was wrong, dead wrong.<br/><br/>The Social Network is not a Facebook film as many of knew even before we saw it thanks to critics.Do you think it's a biopic of Zuckerberg & the Gang ? No.<br/><br/>David Fincher simply did what he did a decade ago he tells men and their problematic of existence, he told what was going wrong at the 90's (an aspect let's say).The Social Network is depicting again dead-ends of late 2000s and unfortunately the decade we are about the live.Nothing is ever-never enough...<br/><br/>Marck Zuckerberg dissed the movie cos the story was further from fact.Who cares ? That dude still feels this movie is about his path of success.It as about that generation when they reach the sky they can never fill the hole in their souls.<br/><br/>Film opens and closes in the same manner Mark having a conversation with the girl he loves but at the end she is not even there the billion worthy invention of his is standing right in the middle.He is just a dude keeps hitting that F5 like me.That modern world we call so just lies there.In between.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin's adaptation is flawless.David Fincher took a script with full of dialogs and told the way as fast as it can be which I suppose was not a piece of cake."
"blackfirepro","10","0","1","24 October 2010"," Today's answer to ""Citizen Kane""
","We all know the affect that Facebook has had on the world. Who knows whether for good or bad, but there has been an affect. People can connect with others like never before. It's a party online. Everyone is invited, but only the people who know how to use it right have a good time. If Facebook were to suddenly disappear off the face of the earth, then many, many people would be left sitting with nothing to do, wondering what hit them. If Facebook somehow left us, there would be an implosion in business, in social traffic, in personality, in life as we know it. Facebook is its own universe with its own physics and its own natural laws. The God of this universe and the creator of its natural order is young Mark Zuckerberg, who is currently the youngest billionaire in the world. His rise to fame and fortune is a sad parable about friendship and trust and ultimately, loss. The Social Network is a sharp and bitter movie made of bits and pieces of Facebook legend and historical fact. The very first scene of the film introduces Zuckerberg as an insanely intelligent, zealous, genius who is obsessed with himself and getting into the finals club. He is truly and utterly and a narcissistic jerk. His one and only motivation is to elevate his social status. When he cannot manage to get into the final clubs and his track record with women gets increasingly worse, he starts an exclusive network for Harvard undergrads called ""The Facebook"". Ultimately he succeeds in elevating his social status , but the question the film poses is whether it was worth screwing ten people (one of whom was your best friend) just to become ""popular"". Zuckerberg (at least as he's portrayed here) would say that is was certainly worth it.<br/><br/>Right from the start, we identify Zuckerberg as one who is out for his own interests. But is he willing to alienate everyone close to him in order to gain the applause of the world? Although the main character is completely detestable and despicable, we can identify with his ambitions. In some respects, Mark is admirable in that he will stop at nothing to achieve his goal; however his modus operandi is dark and disgusting. His ruthless determination leads him to two law suits, hatred by uncounted numbers of people, and most painfully the loss of his only true friends. By the end of the film he is no longer human, but rather the shell of one. Inside is an empty vacuum of emotion where Facebook is all that is left to keep him company. It doesn't matter if one knows the end of the film, so I'll give it away now. The final scene depicts Mark alone with his laptop in a conference room. On the screen is the Facebook that he started. All he can think of to do after the arduous journey he's just been on is to invite his former girlfriend to join his friend list on Facebook. She is the only person who he hasn't completely lost yet. As he sits there, he refreshes the site every few seconds to see if there is a response. Will she say ""yes"" or ""no""? Perhaps we'll never no. He may be still waiting.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin has crafted a masterful screenplay full of greed, revenge, and solitude. It's a fable about the dangers of worldwide recognition. Is it worth the toll on our humanity? Perhaps not. Like Lady Gaga's song ""LoveGame"" asks: Do you want love or do you want fame? It's a Sophie's Choice of a question and it has no real answer. Both are hard to get and easy to loose. One thing that is for sure is that we can't have them both. Zuckerman's fatal misconception is that love will come along once fame is achieved. Once he does find his fame, he is left wondering, ""Where is the love?"" The screenplay's strength is not only in its message and its structure, but also in the words spoken by its characters. The dialog is sharp and sarcastic, even witty at times. There is a constant banter between the humans in the movie. Zuckerberg is sharp-tongued and straightforward. If he doesn't like someone, he'll tell them so. Sometimes the manner in which he goes about it is laugh-out-loud hilarious. Still, even with the liberal doses of humor sprinkled without, at the film's heart is a deep and dark sense of loss. Mark Zuckerberg is Charles Foster Kane by the end of the film. He is a man who worked hard enough to gain everything, and in the process lost everything. Sad, to be sure, but true.<br/><br/>David Fincher has also left his mark on the film. The cinematography is dark and haunting, much like his previous film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Fincher has a distinctive style that is identifiably from the first shot. The film is underexposed to a certain degree, capturing the darkness of the subject matter perfectly. In essence, the look of the movie is somewhat of a portrait of Mark's soul by the end of the film. It's dark, mean, and subtle. You have the feeling that there is some demon lurking in the shadows of each shot. Despite the ominous nature of the film, it's a beautiful movie to look at, just like Benjamin Button, but ultimately more satisfying after it's all over and done with. Benjamin Button left me cold, and fortunately this left me thinking. Left me thinking about my own humanity, and how easy it would be to loose it. The Social Network will become a classic to be sure. I can't say that about many movies. In fifty years this will be remembered well. It's a modern day Citizen Kane; a parable about love on our own terms. Those are the only terms we ever know—our own.<br/><br/>www.colewebbharter.com"

","""The Social Network"" is one of those films that is rare in its ability to spark conversation. When the film ends, you can't help but turn to your friend or family member and instantly start talking about what you saw.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Mark Zuckerburg, the 24 year old who created Facebook, and is now a billionaire. Intertwined with the site's creation, are scenes showing Mark getting sued by his best friend, as well as other business partners.<br/><br/>The actors in this film aren't too well known (except, Justin Timberlake.) But, all actors do a phenomenal job. You are sucked into the story and forget you're seeing a film. You think you're seeing the actual events occur. Its that believable. Jesse Eisenberg, who plays Mark, really shines in his role. Justin Timberlake is good also.<br/><br/>The writing is particularly good. All characters are unique in voice. Dialog is quick, as it can be in real-life.<br/><br/>The film is directed by David Fincher, who gave us 'Fight Club.' Now, of course, 'The Social Network' doesn't have blood or strange twists. But, Mr. Fincher has seemed to recreate the visual style of 'Fight Club.' The most notable similarity is the film's musical score. While composed by different artists than 'Fight Club', it is a non-traditional score. The music is like a playlist for a college party, thus emulating the college atmosphere. <br/><br/>If you are a Facebook user, this film should be on your list to see. In the theaters. You will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>The film's last scene is genius, having a moral revealed to the audience, and is so relatable to many Facebook users.<br/><br/>The film's only downfall is its length. I found it to be a tad long. But, other than that, this film is top notch and will have you thinking and will cause your jaw to drop at the final cut to black."

","When I first found out that there was going to be a film about the founding of Facebook I wasn't really interested. But then I heard that it would be by David Fincher it immediately became something to keep an eye on. The film sounded really strange, a drama film about Facebooks creation. Well I didn't really know anything about that event but could a website be enough to make a film of, unless it was a documentary. Since David Fincher is one of my favourite directors and hasn't made a bad film since Alien 3 I kept hopeful that this still could be something worth watching.<br/><br/>When the rave reviews started coming in I was surprised but still held my expectations down. The trailer looked great but that has fooled me before.<br/><br/>The film turned out to exceed all my wildest hopes. One clearly sees why this is not called Facebok the movie, because it is not really about the website. It's a story about people, friendship, betrayal, money and much more. So even if not interested in Facebook this is a great movie. The story is great and brilliantly told, actually very deep emotionally. Aaron Sorkin is the master of razor-sharp dialogue. Not just is it gripping because the characters are real and the story is based on actual event. The acting is among the best I have seen in ages. Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, even Justin Timberlake are simply amazing. So there is much talking in the film, not like Fincher's usual kind of movies but no less brilliant. The camera work is superb just like always. It goes at a quick pace but it's never any problem to keep up. The music is great and perfectly chosen for the tone. It's funny and sad at the same time. I don't care much if it's accurate portrayal of what happened. They have succeeded great in not taking anyones side. It is left to you to decide who is most right. But it doesn't matter since it's one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. Never has 2h gone so by so quickly.<br/><br/>The Social Network is the best film of 2010 and maybe one of the biggest surprises ever, better than I ever dared to hope for. David Fincher's best film since Fight club. The material that they based it on turned out to be pretty good stuff but never did I even imagine that this could be so amazing execution. When it was over I just wanted to see it again and again. The Social Network is fantastic. The movie for a generation!"

","Facebook. We all use it, most of us love it, so it was a matter of time before someone made a movie out of it. Hailed to be on par with the invention of the telephone, Mark Zuckerberg's gargantuan internet phenomena has infected the world with a brand-spanking new form of communication. 500 million people worldwide have found themselves lost in a realm of friend requests, statuses, tagging, news feeds and all sorts of innovative little tid-bits. Bit of fun right? Well, I think we can afford to be a bit more profound. Facebook isn't just an exercise in escapist entertainment, it's trivialised the process of communication in its entirety, figure-heading an explosive online movement fixed on harmonising global liaison. Who'd have thought that such an immense, world-changing concept could have come from one geek messing around in his little university dorm. It's a remarkable story that ached for an effective big screen adaptation. Was this ache throbbing in vain? Definitely not. <br/><br/>But be aware folks, this isn't just a flat-out glorification of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg). Aaron Sorkin's witty script paints a genuine portrait of the cyber-magnate, revealing his stark flaws as he battles a potentially crippling law suit. Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg, in a role which grew to be more complex and multi-faceted than first thought. Being a relative newcomer and, in my opinion, emerging star, all eyes were on this young actor. Does he have the ability to hold such a biopic? Can he conjure the ultimate technological hero, or even anti hero? These were questions I had to ask beforehand, and God, did I feel stupid as I walked out. Eisenberg perfectly captures the essence of flawed genius, delivering Sorkin's portrayal of Zuckerberg with ruthless efficiency. Rather than shoving Zuckerberg's genius down our throats, the script leaves his likability wide open. On one end, he's obnoxious, irreverent, socially awkward and incredibly controlling. Whilst on the other, he's a misunderstood, brilliant aficionado, driven by mere passion, uninterested in monetary needs. Personally, I fell in love with Eisenberg's interpretation of Sorkin's script, he was mesmerisingly dry, punchy, and deeply absorbing. He's produced a character that will grow to become one of cinema's great flawed protagonists. <br/><br/>In terms of plot, The Social Network pulls the Facebook creation story out by the roots and examines each twine with cracking detail. It drags us back to a time before the site's global explosion, a world where Zuckerberg is only known by his blogging alias, 'Zukonit' and his cyber creation is in the mere faetal stage, being classed as a 'book of faces' or 'The Facebook'. This was only 6 or 7 years ago but it seems millennia has gone by! This little fallacy symbolises the extraordinary rapidity of the spread of Facebook's infection across the world, making this picture eagerly fascinating. Every day, all of us are drawn to check our Facebooks, we meet new people and it's become a custom to ask if they're on Facebook, ""Don't worry, I'll Facebook you"", ""You have that Facebook app?"", ""Can't believe you just fraped me"", are but just a few sentences drummed into the status quo. This site has become an impenetrable feature of our society and witnessing its fruition from the very beginning captivates beyond all recognition. <br/><br/>So with Aaron Sorkin's sharp script and Jesse Eisenberg's impressive performance, all the film needed was some solid direction, of the likes David Fincher was happy to oblige. Fincher truly is a strong director, helming such pictures as Zodiac (2007), Fight Club (1999), Seven (1995) and, just recently, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). Like Ron Howard, he doesn't overstate with his work, he possesses the maturity and discipline to direct a film that allows the story and characters to develop freely as the screenplay initially intended. He's the liberal middle-man rendering a script through the camera in a smooth, majestic manner. As much as I'd hate to use the word 'standard' here, Fincher's camera-work is standard in method yet far beyond standard in quality, it fits the script like a glove. <br/><br/>So, without further ado, let's knuckle down and discuss the Academy Awards. All of sudden we've drifted into awards season, the most exciting time of the cinematic year where the pains inflicted by the tripe blurted onto the summer screen are eased by a parade of fresh, top quality cinema. A new wave of technical scrutiny will hit viewers like a ton of bricks and The Social Network is one hell of an opener to this stimulating advent. To revert back to Eisenberg, he's sent ripples around cinema's critical forum, and rightfully so. He's pulled off a career-changing performance, emblematic of his blossoming into the great actor he'll very soon become. We'll expect to see him floating around the 'Best Leading Actor' category across the award ceremonies, but a win seems unlikely. As for Sorkin's expertly written script, it should expect top contention for 'Best Adapted Screenplay', and I can see a few supporting actors attracting recognition. The striking Achilles Heel for the film's promotion has been the inclusion of pop prince, Justin Timberlake in the cast. In the world of REAL cinema, his name falls under taboo. But, he's actually pretty bearable this time around, playing the super slick founder of 'Napster', Sean Parker. So try not to let that ghastly name impair your excitement! <br/><br/>If you're worried that The Social Network is just a lousy pop carnation programmed to juice the money out of the Facebook loving public, you couldn't be more wrong. David Fincher's picture is a magnetic analysis of troubled genius, personified by an exceptional Eisenberg performance. What a dose of post-summer refreshment!"

","Once again, Aaron Sorkin captivates his audience with his uncanny ability to create fascinating characters for the big screen. Regardless of your familiarity with Facebook or the Internet in general, you'll find yourself relating to these imperfect, very human individuals portrayed in The Social Network. While based on a true story, Sorkin doesn't shy away from taking liberty to extend his own interpretation of the main character, Mark Zuckerburg, in this classic tale of friendship and betrayal. My only disappointment in this film was the fact that I had super high expectations of seeing a Fincher-esquire film. Don't get me wrong, the film was shot beautifully. it just didn't have the David Fincher quality we all know from such classics as Fight Club and Panic Room."
"qwertyguy5192","Null","0","1","17 October 2010"," The Social Network
","One of the most prominent criticisms of The Social Network is that it is a complete dramatization, and isn't even close to what happened in real life. The reason for this is that what happened in real life was completely boring. Mark Zuckerburg and his friends were just a bunch of computer geeks sitting around a computer in their room writing line after line of computer code. If a movie accurately portrayed hacking in real life, it would be one of the most boring movies ever made. So, of course this movie is a complete dramatization. You don't go to the movies and expect it to be completely based off of fact.<br/><br/>The Social Network was a well written movie that takes the boring tale of the creation of facebook, and the drama that ensued, and turns it into a full-blown captivating story that will keep your attention throughout the entire length of the movie. It is based off of a book written by Ben Mezrich, a Harvard Magna Cum Laudi graduate. Which is probably the reason why it is such a thrilling script. I have never read the book, but the movie did a good job of following a storyline, even with so much to cover. The two lawsuits that the main plot of the story is based around makes a very good baseline, in which everything that the movie talks about ties back to. This keeps the movie on task, never trekking too far off topic, yet keeping the scenes flowing easily from one to the next.<br/><br/>My one complaint is that the movie was fairly over-dramatic. Every scene in the movie was either some really flashy, over-the-top, party scene, some stupid teenage stunt scene, or a scene in which people were consistently whining at each other. At a certain point in the movie, I just wanted everybody to get over their hormonal crying and do something. Punch someone! Sue them! Don't just sit there and complain about it. However, I am probably biased on this issue, as I am not a fan of useless and incompetent drama, which was what this movie was all about. If you are a fan of such drama, then you will probably enjoy The Social Network that much more.<br/><br/>The director of this movie was David Fincher. I want to briefly mention this, because Fincher has directed a couple of fairly decent movies in the past, such as Fight Club and Se7en. He continues his trend of decent movie making in this movie. However, the writing and story are what make this movie, Fincher only adds to the decency of the movie. <br/><br/>I am even less focused on the acting in any movie. Actors are just the face of a movie, they aren't what make it a good movie. Anyone, given enough makeup, practice, and enough times in front of the camera, can act well. It takes some amount of intelligence to write, direct, or even know when to invest in a good movie. If you have terrible actors, but good directing and writing, you can end up with a well thought out movie. Nonetheless, if you must have my opinion on the acting of this film, I guess they did a good job as well. The characters did seem to line up well with their actors.<br/><br/>There is one very important topic I do want to discuss. While watching this movie, I started to realize that it was created in such a way that it was impartial towards the characters. There were no blatant ""bad"" or ""good"" guys. It was just people doing what they do, and then suffering the consequences of their actions.<br/><br/>Is this a good thing? Should media be neutral? Well, may be. It depends on what the type of media is trying to do. Arguing a strict point can hinder intellectual pondering of the moral. If a movie portrays that this man is good and that man is bad, then you aren't going to think about why what this man is good or why that man is bad, because it's fairly obvious. You might question the legitimacy of the movie's claim, but if you're going to do that, then you probably already do that with most media, or at least the media that doesn't measure up to your personal political or moral beliefs. Most people will just watch and accept. So this is the way people use if the creator is trying to impose a strict moral through their medium. However, this can also alienate certain populations from enjoying certain movies. It is hard to like a movie when you don't agree with what it is trying to tell you. Machete would have been an awesome (note that I said awesome not good) movie if it wasn't so politically involved. On the other hand, if a movie is neutral, then it can be hard to portray any sort of meaning. Although, I don't find this to be an entirely bad thing. Like ancient Grecian or Shakespearian tragic plays, a person has to think about why Creon ended his life with nothing, or why Macbeth had it all and then lost it. I like to sit down to a movie and then leave thinking about what I just watched and why it ended the way it did, not just blindly accept that this person was right and that person was wrong.<br/><br/>Well, back to the movie. Should you go and see The Social Network? I say yes. It might not be the best movie of the year, but it was a well written, well developed movie. Even if you hate drama, don't have a facebook, or even know who Sean Parker is, you should still see this movie."

","You've all heard about it but now its here. The Social Network, the movie about a simple site that started a revolution is already wowing audiences across the globe. David Fincher (Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) directs this Facebook tale with a style all his own. His innovative cinematography captures a beautiful look and feel unique to this film. The young cast full of unknowns/rising stars delivers in their best work to date. Jesse Eisenberg plays a cold, calculated genius yet still provokes the audiences' sympathies. His counterpart, Andrew Garfield portrays a much more inviting character which only adds to the impact to the betrayal between the two. Despite this film's many achievements, the main phenomenon is the writer, Aaron Sorkin. From the interesting time line to the rapid fire dialogue, Sorkin shows his true genius. The writing is a true highlight of the film and will be remembered around Oscar season. After all is said and done, what remains the most surprising about this Facebook film is that it is barely about Facebook. It's about greed,friendship, and the power of ambition. This modern take on these classic themes adds to the monumental success of the film. All in all, The Social Network is arguably the best film this year."

","The Social Network is a good movie and definitely it is good enough to bother going and seeing at the theatre with your friends or even alone, it is that good you will have a good time just sitting and watching it. The only thing keeping it from being ""great"" is that some of the acting is not quite up to par. The lead is great and shows Zuckerburg is a real turd of a human being sometimes but also shows that he is a human being with frailties who deserves sympathy as well. The movie is good I know because the end of it came and I sat wondering ""was that really just two hours?"" because it did not feel long at all. The only real weak actor was no surprise Justin Timberlake, don't mind his music at all but his acting is just not that great, maybe he looks a lot like the guy or something but between this and Love Guru I won't be anxious to see him act again that's for sure."

The cinematography, soundtrack, casting, and script of the movie is pretty well done. It's a big step up from Fincher's previous film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, which was a disappointment to die-hard fans who consider Fight Club, Seven, Panic Room, and Zodiac as some of his finest work. The Social Network is more than just a movie about Facebook. It's about the young men and women who created a behemoth that exploded beyond their wildest dreams. It's great for people who are not even Facebook users. Highly recommended."

","From the director David FINCHER (The Curious case of Benjamin Button, Fight Club, Se7en), THE SOCIAL NETWORK is the story of the development and rise and rise of the world-wide Social Networking phenomena FACEBOOK.<br/><br/>Shortly after breaking up with his girlfriend, Harvard computer nurd Mark Zuckerberg (JESSE EISENBERG) sits down at his computer and ""blogs"" bad things about his now ex-girlfriend .. and, in an act of revenge decides to create a website where students can ""grade"" the girls within the university. News of the site goes around like wildfire and they get hundreds of students accessing it  and an idea was born  the power of the internet as a revolutionary new communication medium for social networking  <br/><br/>Many began to see the potential in the new social medium and attempt to jump on the bandwagon and get in at an early stage  with the hapless Winklevoss brothers claiming to have spawned the original idea of having a unique ""Harvard"" exclusive social site  many tried and many fail  but it is the Mark Zuckerberg's tenacity and clarity of focus with THE FACEBOOK site launched in Feb 2004, that forces it's way through the dead wood and grows and grows in popularity at a phenomenal speed  and pretty soon it has expanded to many of the other universities and schools  <br/><br/>As a computer genius come geek, Zuckerberg is himself a social misfit that finds human interaction and communication difficult, and he turns to his one true friend Eduardo Saverin (ably played by Andrew Garfield), for financial support in setting up the servers, routers and infrastructure required to cope with the every increasing demand for the Facebook site  Zuckerberg and Saverin decide to jointly split the company they create 70 / 30 (in favour of Zuckerberg).<br/><br/>Things progress well until Saverin decides there is a need for more investment and to get advertisers interested  a move which Zuckerberg opposes claiming that it would detract from the ""purity"" of the Facebook idea  <br/><br/>Meanwhile on the scene comes the another headlining entrepreneur way ahead of his time – Sean Parker (played excellently by Justin Timberlake) – the founder and genius behind NAPSTER and music downloading / sharing site. Fresh from a recent legal defeat against the Music industry (over Napster), Sean still believes he has won by changing the face of the music industry forever . And he is chomping at the bit for a new challenge – and sees THE FACEBOOK as the next big thing (he is actually the one who suggested renaming it to just FACEBOOK).<br/><br/>There follows a series on wide parties and roller-coaster wheeling and dealings and Sean Parker eventually engineers a situation where there is finally a breakdown in relationships between Zuckerberg and Saverin and they go their separate ways.<br/><br/>The film is primarily based around the legal dispute of over ownership of Facebook brand and intellectual copy write of the product – by the Winklevoss brothers and Eduardo Saverin against Zuckerberg with flashbacks to previous times elaborating on claims and counter-claims made during the case.<br/><br/>Launched in February 2004, Facebook was born, and a mere six years and 500 million friends later, making Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history ... but as the tagline for the film states – ""you don't get 500 Million friends without making some enemies "" <br/><br/>I must admit after seeing Jesse Eisenberg's awful performances in the truly woeful Zombieland and Adventureland movies – I really didn't hold out much hope for his acting career  but I was pleasantly surprised in this instance  as in the Social Network he is ""better"" (still not great) but he can actually act  <br/><br/>With no real ""heavy-weights"" in the acting cast – this was a film that had to stand up and fight with a decent story line – which I was quite impressed with (being a ""true"" and interesting story) <br/><br/>As a trivia side point, the director of this movie David Fincher will also be taking the reins to direct the ""Americanised"" version (God help us all ) of the remake of excellent THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO  along with Rooney Mara (who plays Erica Albright in the Social Network) taking on the leading role of Lisbeth Salander.<br/><br/>I imagine that this will be a popular movie as almost everyone I know has a facebook account – and I'll even be posting a link to this review onto my facebook page!"
"chewbabydoo","9","0","1","7 October 2010"," Facebook or something?
","I went to see The Social Network the day it came out in theaters. The reason is that its from my favorite director, David Fincher (Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Se7en, which are by the way probably my favorite movies). This movie being from my favorite director, I thought this movie would be good. But The Social Network went beyond all my expectations, and i feel it right to say that its really hard to do that, i am usually disappointed if i expect something from anything.<br/><br/>That being said, i have to point out why this movie was good. I first thought i would be watching something about Facebook-which i am by the way not on, because i just don't care- but i have actually watched something about its founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. What is so good about this movie, is the irony. You can see this movie, and you can understand this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing and brilliant. I was blown away by Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg. I actually saw Zombieland, and thought he was really good in it, but its not a dramatic movie. The Social Network is a dramatic movie, and Jesse Eisenberg, aside the fact from being gorgeously beautiful in a geeky way that i personally love, was brilliant and amazing, and fitted so well with the character as we could have imagined it. No smile, quick and amazing when delivering the lines, he was just astonishing. I also loved Andrew Garfield and Armie Hammer, and even Justin Timberlake was not that bad.<br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliant, one of the greatest i have been given to witness. The whole movie is actually based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, and has been remastered to fit with two other versions of the whole Facebook founding from what i heard. Aaron Sorkin-that is the guy who wrote the screenplay-is a genius. The lines are just perfectly perfect, especially Zuckerberg's witty comebacks. And the screenplay is even more important because it is a movie based on its dialogues.<br/><br/>The movie is obviously partially fictive, the actual Mark Zuckerberg said that the way he is described in no way reflects the truth. And its not surprising, as long as nobody who are charactered are behind the movie itself, though the script has been presented to Mark Zuckerberg for his approval. But can the movie's story be all fake? I don't think so.<br/><br/>You know all these things when you see the movie.<br/><br/>When you understand the movie, you realize that the movie is designed for you to not take a side, are you with the Winklewoss, Eduardo Saverin, or with Mark Zuckerberg. That's not the point of the movie. Even tough Mark Zuckerberg is described as this tech geek, harvard undergrad, 1600 SAT, the younger billionaire in the world, a general dick, you feel sorry for him. If not, maybe a little? And that is just genius. <br/><br/>Probably because there is the beginning of the movie, the movie, and the end of the movie. The beginning of the movie being connected with the end. Why? Probably because you see this tech geek, this brilliant minded asshole who has just been left by his girlfriend at the beginning of the movie, and that at the end, you see this same guy, who just got sued by his best and only friend for 600 million dollars, this asocial and misunderstood genius, this billionaire who created the most known and used social network worldwide, who is sitting there seeing that this same girl who had wished him good luck with his 30 billions worthing video game, seeing that this girl is on Facebook, and that this guy is waiting for her to add him in her friends, resetting the page, when behind there's the Beatles' Baby you're a rich man, that breaks your heart. Well for me it did, i know it didn't happen like this, but the movie is sad.<br/><br/>And that is why the movie is so good. And can you really hate on this guy? I mean, he thought the realization of this website was more important than friendship, can you blame him for that? All he wanted was to achieve this, even tough he gave reason to this girl at the beginning who told him he was an asshole, and that during the whole movie. All i am saying is that he is sort of correct.<br/><br/>All i am saying, is that this movie is Academy Award worthing for best adapted screenplay, best actor in a leading role, and best picture.<br/><br/>All i am saying, is that this movie is so relevant these days, this topic is relevant.<br/><br/>That's an amazing movie, end of story.<br/><br/>-chewbabydoo"

","This movie made me angry at Oliver Stone. I enjoyed ""Wall Street 2"" and went for his excuse that he didn't hang the bad guys up by their thumbs because (paraphrase) ""it's hard to made a compelling moving about CDO's, CDS's and synthetic derivatives."" So he turned in a treacly movie with a love story, and on the level of treacly Hollywood movies, it's good.<br/><br/>But ""The Social Network"" has an even harder task: to make computer coding somehow interesting, and just to handicap it, it's a true story. So you can't just make up a lot of crap, you have to follow certain real life plot points and still produce a compelling story. (And boy, does it.) It's true that there are no likable characters here (and how hard must it be to write a screenplay where there's no good guy - bad guy dynamic to bounce around?) but then there didn't have to be in Oliver Stone's film either. Heck, he could have made everybody purely evil (as the first Wall Street managed) and taken them down even while producing a financially successful film, but he didn't.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Aaron Sorkin writes dialogue that reverberates like a Gatling gun, all the better to showcase the brilliant but socially clueless Zuckerberg as he hurtles past, not through human relationships. The film doesn't have a car chase, an over-choreographed bar fight, or much more than a few seconds of implied sex, yet it's one of the most compelling movies I've seen this year.<br/><br/>There are times when you just want to agree with the first female in the film who tells Zuckerberg ""You are an asshole"", and you wait for redemption or payback which never comes. Yet you can't take your eyes off it.<br/><br/>""Wall Street 2"" was a candy confection next to ""The Social Network."" That's too bad, because Zuckerberg is only one jerk, and Wall Street has thousands of them. Would that they had gotten a more insistent whipping."

","A nerdy Harvard student blabbers on about numerous topics with his girlfriend whom he also chooses to ignore eye contact with while being inattentive to her reactions and responses. Understandably, she 'blocks' him while calling him an #@#hole. The dejected nerd blogs his agony out in distaste about his girlfriend and then creates a site for ranking girls from college, thereby creating the platform that would shape the future of everyone's communication. It was from that spark of social rejection that the 'Social Network' got ignited. <br/><br/>David Fincher's glorious record of captivating movies (Fight Club, Se7en and that curious case...) leaves fans with great anticipation from a bio-epic about Facebook. Based on Ben Mezrich's 'The Accidental Billionaires' and screen-written by Aaron Sorkin, The Social Network is a powerhouse of a movie with superlative performances and adroit direction, together providing an exhilarating experience. <br/><br/>From Adventureland comes this incredible actor Jesse Eisenberg who plays Mark Zuckerberg in his college days when the inception of Facebook occurred. The film revolves around Eisenberg portraying the nerdy entrepreneur whose intellect and creativity surpass his peers. Alienation in this form acts as a catalyst towards his goals and the whip-like dialogue delivery together with the portrayal of a focused persona make this a commendable act. Providing the emotional enrichment with his soulful performance is Andrew Garfield, playing Eduardo, Mark's best friend and Facebook's CFO whose wit and intuition are only undone by his vulnerability. Garfield is simply brilliant with his emotions and as a sufferer in this tale of greed, he is responsible for balancing the otherwise stone cold attitudes from others. While it is the duo's unyielding ambition that confronts the Winklevoss brothers who threatened to shut down the social network they couldn't invent, it was their innocence that Sean Parker seized to gain his leverage in facebook's exponential growth. Justin Timberlake is the phenomenon in this network. While playing the co-founder of Napster who convinces Zuckerberg to push Facebook across continents, he emphasizes that greed fuels growth and their combined intelligence would make them icons of tomorrow. The most explosive scenes are with him in the restaurant where they meet for the first time and then at the night club when he speaks to Mark over the blaring music. The dialogues are essentially the summation of what facebook eventually becomes. Justin's ease in carrying out this mesmerizing role has much to do with his showmanship in music videos and stage. The distinction in the principles of the three protagonists is striking and without any bloodshed, the movie delineates invisible scars wrought by money, zeal and betrayal upon them. <br/><br/>David Fincher had no cast of repute to work with. Instead, he did what his profile demanded of him. He directed the actors toward the brilliant screenplay, thus drawing closer the gaps between a docu-drama and a page turning bio-epic. With every new idea that crosses Zuckerberg's mind while he's still implementing the previous idea, while Parker urges him to think bigger and while the 'Winklevi' plot to overthrow Zuckerberg's reign over social networking, anxiety and curiosity abound as indeed, we all 'like' to know the origins of our current networking portal. The movie is a verbal ball-game with several intense confrontations between the actors that will make the DVD purchase worthwhile. Fincher and writer Sorkin, with their profound talents have delivered one of the best movies in recent years. The cinematography is outstanding with apt lighting and angles that convey everything without a word being said. The visual effects that enabled one actor to play the twins is also stunning while the background score enhanced every potent scene.<br/><br/>Behind the veil of being a 'facebook' movie, we have young ambition backed with business shrewdness that catapults to phenomenal success; only after betraying a best friend and partner. The apt ending of Zuckerberg sitting alone in an office in front of his laptop screen, awaiting a response from a friend request showcases the irony of ironies. <br/><br/>The Social Network might appeal more to the younger crowds, most of whom would be avid facebook users. This exemplary drama, flashed back during Zuckerberg's legal trial is so scintillating, real and engaging that its 'poke' will warrant a 'like' from you. <br/><br/><ul><li>8.893 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

I for one even though I enjoy the internet and info, I'm not to big of a fan of social networks like Facebook I say go to a club or read a book. Anyhow this film written just perfect by Aaron Sorkin and directed in a long drawn method by the brilliant David Fincher is an interesting and feel good look at how Facebook came about.<br/><br/>""The Social Network"" starting in 2003 at Harvard you have the brain and nerd geek boy Mark Zuckerberg(Jesse Eisenberg)and you guessed it he's lonely and desperate to score with his girl Erica(Rooney Mara)so instead of giving into the social pressures of clubs, and his other peers Mark gives into his anger and starts a fresh new ideal, which has Erica to dump him. So after returning to his dorm room he starts up a website of fresh faces mostly hot looking chicks that he would like to score with. Zuckerberg as he did with his girlfriend Erica starts to type and post nasty items and sexy sayings of which coed he thinks is hotter. It's strangely a thing that's a new tech social hit only to university officials Mark himself seems like a new convicted criminal, as much of the film is flashback of him being on trial in front of university officials.<br/><br/>This film mostly serious as it shows an intellect can be interesting and fun it transforms even deeper by showing how Zuckerberg's trip to the Silicon Valley put the final touches on Facebook and his connection with Napster founder Sean Parker(good supporting performance from Justin Timberlake)spices up and makes this picture sweet sugar as it shows the internet business as dirty which includes cocaine parties with hot young sexy chicks that wear sexy colored bras. As it's somewhat of an introduction of a party life for Mark before he becomes a very very rich man.<br/><br/>Overall ""The Social Network"" is a film that captures our times well as it's telling of a cultural and social creation like Facebook was interesting and educational. It's made even more watchable with it's intellect intrigue and drama proving that this social creation was motivated by greed and hormone driven lust, as this was a way for young men to score and meet hot women! Take it for what you want it's an interesting movie that fits our times well of social connection and greed lust driven technology."

Sorkin went over expectations and brings a three-way point of view story telling making it all into one and at the same time making it flow as very smoothly. This film can easily draw audiences in by presenting a simple plot that people are familiar with and showing one of the greatest events that there is in story making. And that is the rise to power. Eisenberg does a great job of showing his struggle with power, backstabbing, and moral obligation. It runs a very intelligent course and provides the audience to make its own decisions between right and wrong. ""The Facebook Movie"" has a deep perspective into this complex story and is perhaps one of the greatest accounts on a true event story of our time.

","The Social Network is a character piece about the man who created a website which more than 500 million people currently use, and the relationships destroyed along the way. Set through scenes paralleling two legal suits, the film follows the founding of Facebook, but more importantly person behind it. The film begins as Zuckerberg arrives to his dorm after his girlfriend breaks up with him. He sits down and writes the formula for facemash.com which ultimately shuts down Harvard's server and gets him recognized. After meeting with the Winklevoss Twins, he agrees to write a formula for a social network, which he sets aside while he creates Facebook. Jessie Eisenburg stars as Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard student, who lets success go to his head. Fueled by jealousy and greed, Zuckerberg is willing to destroy his relationship with Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) just to be known. The Social Network had a great sense of character which is fleshed out through an expertly crafted script. Arron Sorkin writes a film so in depth, understanding, and witty it truth is painful. An understanding is had that Zuckerbeg is also a kid who wants to be know. David Finchers notoriously meticulous direction gives nothing but the best performances from all the actors involved in the film. While providing standard Fincher elements (the camera goes through a railing and a window), the film also show Fincher at the top of his career (ex. the rowing scene). Jessie Eisenberg's performance is excellent, but the stand out actor is Andrew Garfiel playing Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerbergs college friend. Sporting an American accent Garfield plays his character so right and his chemistry with Eisenberg is all to real. That being said, this is the type of movie you watch for performances and every actor gives a noteworthy performance. The Social Network stresses that the decisions we make at a young age-fueled by jealousy, greed, rage- can have a monumental impact on our futures. From: http://filmwatchreviews.blogspot.com/"
