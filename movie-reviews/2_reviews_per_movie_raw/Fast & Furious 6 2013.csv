","Fast & Furious 6 (2013) is the best of the best Action film in the series franchise! It's Justin Lin's Masterpiece and I love it to death. Sorry but is not Fast Five and Furious 7 the best, but is Fast & Furious 6 the best one in the franchise! This my favorite best film of the franchise that I just love to death! The film has great cast and great action, great dialogue! It is the last time that Paul Walker starts in this film. In Furious 7 was his brother who was portraying Brian O'Conner with a fake CGI. In here Paul Walker is real, Justin Lin started a great franchise which ended in this film.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson reunite for this sixth installment in the 'Fast and Furious' action thriller franchise, directed by Justin Lin. After their lucrative Rio heist, and unable to return home, Dom (Vin Diesel) and the rest of his compatriots are forced to kill time lying low in different locations around the world. When DSS agent Hobbs offers Dom and his crew full pardons in return for taking down Owen Shaw (Luke Evans)'s gang of mercenary drivers, the offer seems too good to pass. But as the rivals head for a showdown on the streets of London, Dom learns that Shaw's second-in-command is none other than his presumed dead former lover, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez).<br/><br/>I love This film to death! This film is about rescuing Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and stopping a brilliant mastermind terrorist hijacker Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and his team of hijackers.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez lead a cast of returning all-stars as the global blockbuster franchise built on speed delivers the biggest adrenaline rush yet in this explosive Action Film. Hobbs (Johnson) has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled drivers, whose mastermind (Luke Evans) is aided by the love Dom (Diesel) thought was dead, Letty (Rodriguez). The only way to stop the criminal mercenaries from stealing a top secret weapon is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks for the help of Dom and his elite team. Payment for the ultimate chase? Full pardons for all of them and a chance to make their families whole again.<br/><br/>The ""Fast & Furious"" franchise has always been a personal favorite of mine. Sure, as a whole, they're fairly easy to pass off as mindless action films for film goers who want a good rush of big-budget Hollywood action, but I've mostly seen them as more of a chugging train of car movies that simply get better with each new installment, and that's no exception with ""Fast & Furious 6,"" which I'd probably say is the best addition to the series so far. I don't think I've been this thoroughly entertained by an action sequel in a while. The car chases and stunts are bigger, wilder, and more over-the-top than ever before, the characters' previously limited personalities continue to grow quite impressively, and the story manages to be both awesomely ridiculous and surprisingly engaging from start to finish (even though we all know which side is gonna come out victorious in the end). <br/><br/>The action is glorious while it lasts, but then the film goes back to figuring out how to keep its over sized vessel from taking on water. And that's more hard work than it's worth.<br/><br/>Still, the best thing about this flick is the character interaction, even with actors whose roles are this limited. Letty's amnesia adds an interesting soapy twist to the plot that forces Dom to constantly try to remind her why she loves him. Brian's fatherhood also lets Paul Walker do a bit of enjoyably self-serious acting of his own. Otherwise, Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges are left with the snappy comedic relief, while Gina Carano, Gal Gadot, and Elas Pataky merely get to look feisty and hot in their action scenes (but at least they do a great job at it). As for Dwayne Johnson, he gives an unusually deadpan performance this time around, with only just a few outrageous outbursts of manly banter here and there. Nonetheless, the cast here is consistently entertaining, with the screenplay letting everyone get a chance to shine, even if some of them aren't quite as memorable as others. The script delivered an action moments with high explosions on an airplane that are not forgettable. I love that fight between Gina Carano & Michelle Rodriguez which it was tremendous. <br/><br/>I love this film to death! I love this film to death, Fast & Furious 6 is the best! The battles on airplane are Epic! I consider it as Justin Lin's Masterpiece."

"Al_The_Strange","8","21","27","24 May 2013"," ""This is vehicular warfare.""
","I don't think many other franchises has been as turbulent and uneven as The Fast and the Furious films. Things started off pretty earnestly with Rob Cohen's first film, but quickly careened into odd directions, with the ever-cheesy 2 Fast 2 Furious taking off and running with one main character while leaving the other in the dust, and with Tokyo Drift drifting away with totally different characters altogether. Thankfully, Fast & Furious realigned the series with its roots. But it wasn't until Fast Five when I really began to give a darn about this series. Granted that all films have had their fun moments, the fifth film magically tied in every single strand from every single film, and made every single character relevant. Best of all, it did so with a great sense of fun: it had great pacing, amusing comedy, great action, and it made the characters stand out as a collectively outstanding cast.<br/><br/>So now Fast & Furious 6 has come out, reuniting the entire gang once more to take on bigger stakes. The spectacle in this film tries its best to be even bigger, more absurd, and more awesome than before: the film is effectively book-ended with two massive action setpieces. The first involves a decently destructive car chase in London, where the villain effectively uses his custom-built ride to launch other cars all over the place. The film's final act features a really crazy sequence in which a tank roars across a highway, crushing other cars and blowing up bridges. This all culminates with all the muscle cars banding together to bring down a massive cargo plane in a fiery blaze of glory. In between, the film slows down a bit, but there's frequent fist-fights and pursuits, a few scenes of witty comedy, and there's one decent car-racing scene.<br/><br/>Whether or not you really dig this film may depend on how well you dig the characters and all their dynamics. It definitely helps to watch and understand the events of the first five films, because at this point, they've all been through so much and changed so much; for a late-comer like me, who never was invested in the characters until the last film, it can be confusing to remember who was who and what their history was. Fortunately, the film does insert some flashbacks and reminders for the audience's benefit. If you are keeping up with things, then the film will reward you with a cast of endearing and heartfelt characters, and the film's plot generally revolves around their continuing struggles. As far as the actual plot goes, it's pretty brainless and absurd action-movie fodder, and there are plot holes to be found. However, the film does have the merit of presenting a cast of villains to directly oppose the cast of heroes, and the story pulls out a few surprising twists.<br/><br/>The film generally looks good, but many of the action scenes are hectically shot and edited, and it can be hard to tell what's going on in certain scenes. What you can see is awesome, but sometimes, it's just aggravating. Acting is generally fun and enjoyable from the whole cast. Writing gets the job done well enough. This production uses a plethora of quality sets, props, and costumes, with loads of flashy cars at its disposal, and some okay-looking special effects. This film uses some cool hip rap and techno music, while the music score is pretty cool (sounds a lot like Brian Tyler's work from Tokyo Drift, which was one of my favorite soundtracks).<br/><br/>Best recommended to fans of the series, especially if you've been following the last few movies.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)"
"pablo2896","8","22","31","24 May 2013"," A big movie and a fun time!
","Well, this was unexpected! Going into this film I found myself with no hype at all. I expected a good, fun and cheesy movie time and I came out of the theater happy and surprised. While this isn't a masterpiece of filmmaking it does achieve what it sets out to do. To entertain you. And it does this quite good and sometimes it goes further than this by showing us some amazing set pieces and action sequences. For example one car, tank chase sequence! This is achieved by the gigantic production value of the film. You can literally smell the money that comes out of these guys. The whole movie you have this sense of scale, and I mean BIG scale! The amazing sound mixing and design including the music pumps you up and puts you in the mood! While the acting isn't Oscar worthy it is very fluid and it doesn't always feel forced. The chemistry between the cast is very solid and credible. Diesel and ""The Rock"" where pretty solid along with the secondary characters, and the villain was surprisingly tolerable. Another thing that solidifies the movie are the effects. These are outstanding along with the camera-work! The things that brought the movie down for me a little bit where some of the stunts, and weirdly some of these I found pretty amazing but although I understand this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously there were some stunts that were just plain unbelievable, specially in the third act of the movie. And finally, the plot. While not groundbreaking it did have its interesting points but it doesn't drift away from the cheese factors. Overall I was quite surprised by what this movie did and how the director and producers exploited and used their huge production value. This is an example of a good quality action flick."

","I still can't believe I am giving a 9.0 to a film that is #6 in a brainless action franchise!<br/><br/>I am not aware of any other franchise (except maybe, strangely enough, f13) where #6 is the best of the series. Normally the energy, creativity are gone by then.<br/><br/>Not this time.<br/><br/>I simply cannot believe how much I enjoyed every single minute of this film!<br/><br/>There was even a decent plot!! (hey, for a film that is basically made up of fast cars, explosions and fight scenes, that says a lot!)<br/><br/>However, I won't go into the plot - because there are some REAL twists in it, and it is better to go in with a fresh mind.<br/><br/>It does help if you have seen the prior 5, but no sweat if you haven't. <br/><br/>What really pleasantly surprised me was how funny this film was!! I would say about 1/2 the film was gut splitting comedy. It is rare that most jokes work in a film. Usually some fall flat. Not in this one! every single joke worked. I laughed so hard that I know I missed some!<br/><br/>This is really meant to be seen on the big screen with a large crowd. I can't remember the last time so many people laughed, went 'WHOA!"" and ""yeah"" even clapping during a film!<br/><br/>The film starts off with a bang and ends with a post-ending that will make you grin from ear to ear.<br/><br/>The film deals with criminals who are obsessed with fast cars and like to create mayhem with their cars.<br/><br/>Wall to wall action, comedy with just the right amount of drama and love interest.<br/><br/>This could be ""the"" measurement for the brainless-feel-good-summer- action film.<br/><br/>The only reason I am not giving this a 10.0 is because 1) it was a little long.. the final scene was almost a movie in itself (but it was a hoot!), and 2) in general I don't think any film is perfect. In some scenes (thankfully only a few) there were too many close ups that made it a little hard to follow the action. But I am really nitpicking here, folks.<br/><br/>If you like action, fast cars, explosions, comedy....<br/><br/>run, don't walk to see F&F 6.<br/><br/>(and this from a guy who has the Seventh Seal and Alexander Nevsky in his DVD collection)"
"carl-walster","5","173","336","20 May 2013"," Did the director go on holiday for the last third of the film and hand his directing duties to a 12 year old kid?
","This will contain MAJOR spoilers, so readers beware. Fast and Furious 6 just went off its rails, scrap that - it completely flew off its rails. This film turned utterly ridiculous to the point where I am left thinking ""why?"" There was no need for the film to pan out how it did. The first part (and I should point out) main bulk of the film was enjoyable, trying to track down Letty whilst working alongside the very man trying to stop them previously (Hobbs) offered something new and interesting and it made for some interesting moments. This part of the film I felt was good, even if they did practically ignore the car side of things. It's like they tried to force some stuff in there about the cars but then they never even showed what the cars actually where, or anything about the flipper car which was actually quite interesting. The first car sequence in the film they all used BMW 5 series? (This is major spoilers from now on) Why, if Riley is Shaw's girlfriend would she be ordered practically to her death throughout the whole film? There was a whole massive fight scene with Letty and herself, surely if they was working together that fight just didn't need to happen since no one was even there but those two see it. So they just had a fight for no reason. Why would Riley chase Letty so vigilantly? She could have let her get away without getting herself thrown down some concrete stairs. They forced this twist in the film for some reason. Then for the main car chase in the film / action sequence, Shaw's team capture a ""convoy"" which is just a truck and two jeeps. I can't fathom how stupid this actually is because not only does this tiny convoy have a hugely powered tank inside, it also has the chip worth ""billions"" and is a danger to everyone etc. Yet this convoy, of MILITARY personnel is incapable of protecting this vital piece of equipment. Men trained in warfare are treated like pawns which the criminals just shrug off with ease. Did I mention the military was aware Shaw's team was there, Shaw's team notorious for their driving ability and capture of convoys and yet this tank and lorry are just casually driving along with what may as well be no protection at all? Why? Why didn't they make the convoy seem stronger and actually include some intelligent action here for the capture of the tank? Then they actually capture this tank and Shaw's team are now military experts who know exactly how to control this tank. They needlessly kill dozens of innocent people by crushing them to death and no one even seems fazed by it. Now if a tank was captured in this way, who would come in to stop it? Not Dom and Brian. The rest of military would. Utterly ridiculous but I accept that is how the film works so I don't hold that against the film too much - that is just your typical mindless action movie stuff. It would have been much more interesting if the military got involved alongside the team though. Then it happens. The corniest moment I have ever seen in any film ever. Letty is catapulted over the edge of a huge bridge; she is flying through the air to her certain death. But wait! Dom then catapults himself from the other side of the bridge (there is a gap in the middle) catches her in mid air and lands perfectly onto a car to break their fall. Why does this scene have to exist? It's awful, from this moment on the film goes rubbish. This moment, is where I think the director/producer/writer went on holiday and no longer cared.<br/><br/>They capture Shaw at this point and he then reveals his team have taken Mia hostage. Fair enough, that's a decent ending and seems like it has set up for the next film perfectly. But no, Hobbs pulls a gun out and tells everyone how they are going to put loads of other lives at risk to save one person (Mia) by giving Shaw his chip and letting him go. The film then moves onto what is quite possibly the most unrealistic action scene ever recorded in Hollywood. Shaw has casually organised a cargo plane to pick them up from this military base. Where the hell did this cargo plane come from, an unauthorised huge military cargo plane Shaw just happens to have ready, and also access to a military base runway. This scene is meant to be about Shaw getting away. I'm not too sure on the science here but, if I am driving at 150mph onto a plane moving at 140mph will my car nice and gently stop when I get on the planes ramp? Or will my car suddenly shoot forwards from momentum and smash into the insides of plane. Honestly I'm not too sure but anyway... They kill Gisele for seemingly no reason and no one even cares. They don't even rush back to find her, they just accept she is dead. Likely she is but if you are Han in this situation do you stand there and accept it? Shouldn't he be getting in a car and rushing to where she fell to find her... Not to mention this huge plane exploded right next to everyone and no one was even that bothered by it. Just everything about this last scene I disliked, probably because it was just so unnecessary to begin with. They should have just ended the film with Owen Shaw being captured, then have Ian Shaw (Statham) break him free at the start of the next film. Instead they plonked this last ridiculous action scene in there just because the producers felt like it needed it. It really didn't. Film started off good then just went off the rails. 5/10."

","I'm going to keep this short, simple and sweet because that is exactly what this film is. It's great summer fun for all ages that manages to succeed on the one thing I hate in horror movies; make an idiot of itself. It is where this stupidity in plot events comes from that gives the film its fuel to do nothing but provide brainless over-the-top popcorn fun. It is done so by having some of the best sound editing I have heard in a while with brilliantly paced action sequences, with one fight scene in particular that will surly be the best action scene of the year. I recommend Furious 6 if you're looking to have some fun, but whatever you do, do not walk in there expecting The King's Speech, because it is not what this movie is trying to be- which makes this film so admirable.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"dewetnmail","2","107","208","27 July 2013"," This is an opinion review
","I walked into the cinema expecting to write something about this being the must see film for the weekend, remembering the nostalgia of the original and the progressively worse but still kinda cool sequels (except for that abortion Tokyo Drift we'd all like to forget we saw) and the redeeming previous installment Fast Five that somehow redeemed and reinvented the franchise introducing 'The Rock' as a kick-ass anti-hero and started the franchise on a remarkably cool path with fast paced action that was grounded with a great balance of realism and ""plausible"" suspension of belief.<br/><br/>What I walked away with was having my mind raped by the worse script (CENSORED) It is near impossible to believe this is the same writer and director duo from Fast Five - but then they were also responsible for Tokyo Drift. <br/><br/>Firstly, for some reason they have dropped all of the iconic moments that we have come to love and expect. There is no action packed opening scene filled with car chases and metal carnage. Instead we are treated to being teased with a quick race where nothing happens and shown the aftermath of what must've been an incredible heist, and then, when we eventually do get to see some car chase scenes we quickly realize that they have also done away with those camera shots that weave in and out of the cars putting you in the center of the action.<br/><br/>Gone is the great balance of realism and ""plausible"" suspension of belief and instead Furious 6 was written with absolutely no regard to physics or common sense. It's one thing to have cars flipped over by driving head first into them with a ramp attached to the car, its another thing entirely to have bobbies keeping pace with a super fast custom F1 type of thing and almost overtaking it. But that's small compared to the crap they actually came up with for this movie. Think super fast chase scenes with a tank (oxymoronic) and people flying through the air superman style like neo catching a damsel in distress mid air after being flung from... I'm just gonna stop there. Have your eyes raped spoiler free but don't blame me for the loss of reasoning skills as you're trying to forget to think all together just so you can soak up the visual aspects of this redonculous spectacle.<br/><br/>It's actually infuriating to watch a movie with some cool bits while realizing the absurdity of what you are expected to swallow.<br/><br/>At one point there's this huge cargo plane landing on a runway but keeps cruising so it can take off again and this 20min action scene develops with cars driving into the cargo hold of the plane and fighting erupting everywhere, in the plane, around the plane and it never runs out of runway, for over 20 minutes. Now call me crazy but at some point everyone in the cinema turned to each other and said this is ridiculous, we all as a unit got up and refused to have our intelligence mocked while expecting to sit through this crap and we burned the place to the ground.<br/><br/>Here's some math: a typical airliner cruises at about 160mph for takeoff. 160 ÷ 60 x 20 = a 53.3 mile long runway.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie was the fighting between the female characters. That's probably because they cast MMA star Gina Carano opposite Michelle Rodriguez.<br/><br/>Will this be one of those movies you love to hate or is it simply too mind numbingly $#*&?"
"tony_pop_1","5","108","214","20 May 2013"," Disappointment even for the mildest F&F fan
","This movie started off really well, however, it was set off course after the action started. I have to warn those that watched the trailers on television, because they spoiled every exciting scene from the movie. I would not consider myself an avid fan, but I have followed the series ever since the first movie and I would be the first one to tell you that this movie is a major disappointment. After Tokyo drift, the director relied heavily on action and random fillers to please the audience while leaving the fans frustrated and confused. And since when did the acronym ""F&F"" turn from fast and furious to fast and fighting? This series has started it's roots from racing and formed into another predictable action movie.<br/><br/>Now, to the ridiculous part of the review. The last scene with the cargo jet is beyond unrealistic. This scene was around 15 minutes long and I would like to point out that the take-off speed of a vast jet like that is around 150-200 mph (not to mention they had to increase speed in order to take-off due to the added weight). The runway must been around 50 miles long because they were on there for literally 15 minutes traveling at an average speed of 150mph+. And don't even get me started with the whole Gisele dying scene. The director got rid of her faster than all those V-8 powered engines put together!<br/><br/>I pointed out a bit of information what the reviewer ""carl-walster"" missed. He did an amazing job to point out how really ridiculous the movie really was. I have a great imagination, but this movie was too difficult to comprehend. And how could some of these other reviewers say this was the best of fast and furious? That's blasphemous!"

","While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series. Once a franchise about car racing, ""Fast Five"" took an unexpected turn as a bank heist thriller in the vein of Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's 11,"" a welcomed change as seen by its huge box office earnings and critical success. Now, ""Furious 6"" is neither about car racing nor bank heists, but rather a terrorist threat with obvious inspirations from ""The Dark Knight."" Like ""Fast Five,"" the results are immensely satisfying and undeniably entertaining.<br/><br/>The key to the franchise's upward turn in quality is due to director Justin Lin. He is a skilled action director, and many filmmakers can learn a few things or two from him: The action sequences are impressive, engaging, comprehensible, and well-shot, with practical effects to boot. There is a sense of danger, verve, and life in these scenes rarely found in other films, despite how over-the-top and ridiculous they may be; and yes, they often drift into gratify-defying territory. While I usually don't react out loudly when watching a film, this film had me gasping, jaw dropping, laughing, and applauding, sometimes all at once!<br/><br/>Another ingredient to the film's success is the chemistry between the cast members. We have grown to love these characters over the course of the series that one cannot help but cheer on for them. In particular, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have such a terrific rapport with each other that they provide some of the film's biggest laughs and memorable one-liners. Additionally, Luke Evans is definitely a step up above the previous film's antagonist, and Gina Carano provides some great ass-kicking moments, although not much performance-wise. On another note, I want to mention how refreshing it is to see minority actors fill these roles. Certainly, the film's use of a diverse ensemble cast should be commended. As for the story, it's nothing special, but I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed; I did so more than I would like to admit.<br/><br/>If there's one thing to learn about this franchise, it's that some change can be a good thing. While the later sequels do focus away from the car racing, they still featured cars, which helped retain old fans while bringing in new ones. ""Furious 6"" is terrific entertainment, and judging by yet another dazzling cliffhanger and the audience's reaction, ""Fast & Furious 7"" will be an amazing finale for the series. Unfortunately, Justin Lin won't be back around for the last installment, but someone please get this man to direct every and all upcoming action flicks."
"buiredintime","8","63","121","14 May 2013"," In life Speed and Family are the two best things
","From the first frame of Fast and Furious 6 we realize that this is not really about a movie about heist and car chases (well okay it has this); no this is a movie about the depths you will go and the willingness to do whatever you can to protect family. Leaving off where Fast five left off, most of the characters are off on there, whether it be hanging in Tokyo, flying pretty ladies to manacu to making people feel low about there rough life to a new baby being born, the crew is in hiding and living the life abroad. It's at the point that the plot ramps up and we get a Dom Terretto going after a would be thief Owen Shaw ( a new type of villain) and trying to save the somehow resurrected Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who has joined Shaw in his wanting to take over the world. Bring most people back from the Fast Five and you got yourself a movie. This movie isn't what I call the most coherent, it has issues and Owen Shaw's character is kind of one note, but this isn't the type of movie that you need to worry about great story. It's the type of movie that you go to watch and have fun , and watch the unbelievable happen. Everyone In this movie looks like there comfortable being there and seem to be having fun. It's what I would call an audience movie, the type of movie that feels In sync enough that everyone's on board There are plenty of laughs thanks to Tyrese and plenty of drama thanks to Toretto and Brian's relationship and history in the series. They pull together to do the subject justice. I don't want to spoil anything but this movie does lead up to a point that all the films finally have a connecting tissue and what you thought you knew with the bonus scene at the end will lead into an interesting 7th film. Lets just hope James Wan doesn't ruin the good will this series has gained."

Fast and furious 6 is by far the best one, and i can't wait for number 7. There was so much going on and the ending was awesome. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out.

"moviexclusive","8","67","132","21 May 2013"," Bold imagination and beautiful execution of some of the most exhilarating car chases ever done on film make this the unequivocal franchise best thus far
","Really, how many franchises can claim to be at their best the sixth time round? But that is exactly where the 'Fast and Furious' team are at with this exercise in pure exhilaration. Just when we feared that it might be difficult to top the jaw-dropping finale in 'Fast Five', director Justin Lin proves that he has reserved his best one yet for what has been announced as his final outing at the helm after four consecutive runs.<br/><br/>Continuing what began as an invigorating transition from streetcar racing to heist film the last time round, resident scribe Chris Morgan ups the stakes by pitting our favourite anti-heroes against their most dangerous opponent yet. That man is Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), an ex-SAS officer turned mercenary who leads a nefarious gang of criminals bent on stealing the components capable of assembling a lethal weapon to be used by terrorists. As Tyrese Gibson's designated comic relief character Roman describes, Shaw's guys are pretty much the evil twins of Toretto's team, hence the return of other familiar supporting characters like Han (Sung Kang), Tej (Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges) and Gisele (Gal Gadot).<br/><br/>Even as Morgan evolves the franchise, he understands that the character dynamics have been one of the highlights of each film, and this sequel to 'Fast Five' preserves and builds on the relationships that its predecessor established. Besides the budding romance between Han and Gisele (in our opinion, exotic and very nicely played) and the deepening of familial ties between O'Conner and Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) with the birth of their child, there is sensibly the return of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), which through the last film, transformed from dogged adversary to unlikely ally.<br/><br/>It is Hobbs who reunites Toretto's team together to pursue Shaw - the strategic equivalent of ""fighting fire with fire"" - with no less than the promise of full pardon if they succeed. Amidst the crowded ensemble, Morgan picks up on a new angle set in motion from the concluding events of the last film. Once presumed dead, Toretto's former squeeze Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) has turned up as one of Shaw's known associates, a good part of the quieter moments of the film spent rekindling the romance between the ex-lovers.<br/><br/>Of course, this isn't a movie with many such moments - except for the occasional expositions about family - so you can forgive the lack of character development for new supporting additions Riley (MMA fighter and 'Haywire' star Gina Carano) and Jah ('The Raid's' Joe Taslim); the former Hobbs' new partner and the latter Shaw's kungfu-kicking henchman. Instead, both Carano and Taslim are there to add a different flavour of adrenaline in the form of close-combat fight scenes, and let's just say that they each get their own sequence to show off their respective moves.<br/><br/>But aside from an impressive bit of tag-team ass-kicking from Toretto and Hobbs against one of Shaw's equally hulk-sized crew (Kim Kold), the bulk of the action is meant to unfold against broad open canvases, as opposed to close quarters. Lin neatly - and we might add, beautifully - choreographs three elaborate chase sequences with loads of automobile destruction that the franchise has been known for, even more extraordinary for how he manages to top one after the next.<br/><br/>In chronological order, Lin begins with a grand introduction to Shaw and his gang with an intricately staged chase down the streets of London - although the fact that Shaw's military-styled vehicle looks like the Batmobile from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy might provide a hint where Lin could have gotten his inspiration. Yet any doubts about Lin's originality are quickly dispelled once we get to the second setpiece, a boldly imagined art of mass destruction matched equally in its stunning execution. As the trailer has amply teased, this one has Toretto and his crew behind the wheel in pursuit of Shaw and his men inside a tank on a Canaries highway.<br/><br/>The most breathtaking of all he leaves for last, which though utterly ludicrous, represents probably one of the most awesome stunt pieces you will see this year. Since no other film has dared to use cars to take down a Russian cargo plane about to take off, Lin does just that. Not only do Toretto's team face off with Shaw's mob in cars racing at near impossible speeds, they attach their vehicles to the wings of the plane with gleeful abandon to any thought of their own lives - though as a warning, not all will make it through to the already announced sequel next summer. If Lin intends to go out with a 'bang', let's just say he accomplishes it many times over.<br/><br/>The exquisitely staged vehicular mayhem is complemented by a firm sense of camaraderie amongst Toretto's group. Gibson's one-liners are snappy and more amusing than they were in 'Fast Five', and his banter with Kang and Ludicrous not only keep the film's momentum going while the plot pieces are put in place but also establish the kind of teamwork necessary for the subsequent action scenes. And not forgetting the brawny charisma of Diesel and Johnson, which enliven the film as much as they did in the last one.<br/><br/>If you ask us to judge this against then-franchise best 'Fast Five', we'd say that this more than tops the fun and excitement that it offered. There are two qualities which make or break a 'Fast and Furious' film - how enjoyable is it to hang out with Toretto and his crew and how thrilling are the car chases. On both counts, this sixth entry surpasses the heights established by its predecessor, setting an even higher bar for its successor. But if the coda before the end credits is anything to go by, there's plenty of reason to get excited for next summer's follow-up."

The mindless plot is there just to get to the car sequences and over the top special effects and stunts.<br/><br/>2.There are too many characters that we don't care about. Most of them, like the two black guys are there purely for the one liners although they do work sometimes.<br/><br/>3.A previously 'dead' character is actually ALIVE. OMFG i could never have thought of that. And his/her entire life memory is wiped. CLEVER!!<br/><br/>4.One of the guys has a wife and a kid and you could tell from the beginning that one of them will later on be kidnapped just to throw on us one more nauseous chase sequence.<br/><br/>5.One cop actually turns out to be a bad guy. How do they come up with this stuff!! <br/><br/>6.At one stage the cop hobbs (johnson) could shoot antagonist (luke evans) right in the face and spare us an hour or so but doesn't. ""See you at the chase while you'll be pancaking civilians with your stolen tank and firing a few regular missiles"".<br/><br/>7.In the end everything turns out right.I mean cmon thats genius. None of the 'important good guys' lose anything and get their records cleaned. Although the Asian guy loses his girlfriend because she is killed horribly but that does not stop everyone from enjoying beer and steaks in the end.<br/><br/>8.Dont even get me started on the runway.<br/><br/>However there was good stuff too.<br/><br/>1.Sceneries <br/><br/>2.Cars <br/><br/>Anyways, There is a final scene when a 'new bad guy' makes an appearance.

","We all know the Fast and Furious 6 franchise has become less and less about the cars over the series, so there is no point in moaning about that now. As an action packed film, and the occasional race which forcefully became relevant to the story, Fast and Furious 6 is great. However, the realism of this film was just dreadful, Star Wars was more believable when Yoda came back as a ghost. I noticed three loopholes in the story myself, that's while my friend sat next to me tapping me on the shoulder every 10 seconds to point out another cliché. If you have seen the other films in this series then you can pretty much work out for yourselves what is going to happen. Growing up with this series I really wanted to leave a good review, but I just can't. Overall, if you enjoyed the other films, just want an action packed film and can leave your brain at the door then this movie is great. But it will leave the more hardcore film fan laughing at how they could write and direct a better film in their sleep."

","Does any writer actually know what Interpol does? Really? None of them seem to. Most blockbuster hacks like the dribbling baboon that wrote this garbage seem to think it is literally the ""international police"", but all it takes is a 10 second search and a quick squiz of the wikipedia article to find out Interpol is a bunch of deskbound intelligence analysts and little more - certainly not the gun-tooting American clichés that are depicted in this film.<br/><br/>As a budding writer it astonishes me that stuff like this gets made. There are no literary devices. There is no character arc. No exposition. No personality. It is nothing more than a stunt reel of car chases (some of which, to my frustration, used CGI, the use of which spoils any real tension). There is not a brain cell in its entire two hour body. <br/><br/>Not a single shot to inspire or charm. Not a single moment of inspiration. There is nothing here. It is like ordering a hamburger and getting two slices of bread - where is the meat, and all the things that enhance its flavour? Who are these people on screen I am meant to care about? Why should I care? The movie never even tries to reel you in. It just tosses the net into the sea and hopes to get a catch. <br/><br/>Lack of ideas/authenticity/effort to one side, the story is nothing but a slap in the face to any intelligent adult. What do you do when you have an international crisis on your hands? Do you comb through government employees for savvy specialists, investigators and special forces operatives? Do you source police experts, seasoned FBI detectives and forensic criminalists? <br/><br/>OF COURSE NOT. IDIOT. You recruit a retired bunch of untrained, utterly unqualified, convicted car thieves and thugs to hunt down an international fugitive, because that is the most logical course of action. Makes complete sense. <br/><br/>Then again, in this world every country except America is completely inept at catching crooks and couldn't handcuff a bag snatcher unless Vin Diesel and the Rock were pinning him down. <br/><br/>Oh, and there's British crooks with easy access to automatic firearms in downtown London cooking off rounds like it's going out of fashion. And somehow a bunch of convicted criminals are allowed to carry guns in London without any training/qualifications and nobody bats an eyelid. Very authentic.<br/><br/>Makes Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters look like Gone with the Wind by comparison."

","I'm not to fond a franchises that don't when it's time to hang it up and let it's running time leave a good memory in our brains but for some reason, the studios want to keep this franchise going but I must say I'm glad they haven't because Fast and Furious 5 was pretty dope and now I can say Fast and Furious 6 is just as equally amazing. I was actually excited to see this movie and believe me when I say, I wasn't disappointed in the least. I'm an action movie junkie, and this film had plenty of it. I've been enjoying the F&F transformation from being a movie about illegal street racing and stealing car parts, to heists, drug lords, undercover agents, the cartel and now, even terrorism. <br/><br/>There was plenty of car chases, hand to hand combat, shoot outs and even a breathtaking ending scene hat involved an airport, a huge aircraft and a takeoff runway that was definitely awesome to watch. Doing six films would definitely bring the cast together, and you can see their chemistry on screen, especially between Tyrese, Ludicrous, the Asian dude and the south American beauty. There comedic banter was funny. I was pleasantly surprised with our antagonist, Luke Evans. I'm used to seeing him play the hero and aiding the good side, so seeing him as the bad guy was different but it worked. Not only is a beyond sexy with that shaved head but it totally worked. My favorite scene was with Riley (from Haywire) chasing Michelle Rodriguez through the subway and Tyrese and Asian dude's character chasing the other bad guy through the subway. <br/><br/>My only pet peeve was the dialogue. You would think that after six movies, the writers could come up with more realistic things for the cast to say instead writing all these cheesy one liners that we've been hearing in 90% of all action movies for the past twenty years. Some of the lines really made me cringe and I had to whisper to myself ""really Justin Lin?! That's the best you got?!"" But the cheesy one liners were overlooked by a few unpredictable plot twists that helped the story move along.<br/><br/>But overall I give this movie an 8 because it gives you everything an action movies is supposed to offer. Believable bad ass heroes and villains, car chases, big guns, explosions, shoot outs, hand to hand combat, sexy ass kicking women, beautiful cars, sexy men, funny moments, an unforgettable ending action sequence, and of course a post credits scene that makes you anxious for the seventh film. I would definitely recommend this film."

","The movie is faster than ever, it's a popcorn flick just like the previous one but that doesn't stop it from being great and being a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The movie gets pretty much straight to the point with ironing out the plot which was teased at the end of Fast Five. The team from Fast Five face there biggest challenge yet and Domonic (Vin Diesel) has to secure what he loves most while trying to look out for his friends and family.<br/><br/>The movie has some great action scenes with humor all the way through it, mainly from Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous and the odd one liners from Vin Diesel and Sung Kang. Despite very far fetched action which was crazily unrealistic at times it still didn't take away the fun, it just left you feeling, how the hell is that possible? That was my only real gripe with the movie but lets not forget, if these movies didn't have that sort of action that makes your jaw hit the floor in disbelief they'd be no where near as fun of enjoyable. I also was kind of let down by the bad guy in this film, maybe it's because I watched Star Trek Into Darkness and Benedict Cumberland was amazing as the villain, but really Luke Evan's was quite disappointing.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel is as awesome as ever, mainly due to him pulling off the super-human activities like they were nothing. Paul Walker didn't really do much for me though but the rest of the character really do put a great shift in. So really the cast were good for what they were in it for.<br/><br/>Overall I'd definitely go see this movie if you enjoyed any of the previous ones because this is on par with Fast Five, which for me was probably the best one. Enjoy this movie for what it is and don't go into the theater expecting to see Oscar worthy performances. <br/><br/>I'll give it an 8. It's great fun and really enjoyable, it will leave you wanting to ride your car through the streets as fast as you can."
"achyutaghosh","10","17","30","23 May 2013"," Thrill ride par excellence
","For motor-heads, the Fast and Furious franchise is pure sin, the sins getting bigger and badder with every sequel. But the franchise is more than just car flicks. They have established an instant connection with today's youth culture gorged in hip hop, street cred and video game violence, spanning continents. While many thought that the previous installment Fast Five was the very pinnacle the series could aim for, out comes Fast and Furious 6, breaking all previous boundaries, and shattering myths that a 6th installment cannot be creative, and is one too many. Before we talk of the movie though, let us take a moment to absorb the legend of the sullen hero- Vin Diesel.<br/><br/>""If you rearrange the letters in Vin Diesel it reveals his credo: ""I End Lives."" <br/><br/>""Vin Diesel invented black. In fact, he invented the entire spectrum of visible light. Except pink. Tom Cruise invented pink."" <br/><br/>""The eternal conundrum ""what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object"" was finally solved when Vin Diesel punched himself in the face.""<br/><br/>Part espionage thriller, and part testosterone fueled race track, the movie starts off in first gear though, with the gang dissipated across the world spending their 100 million heist that they had carried out in Fast Five in their own ways, though a mountain road race between Diesel and Walker portends of things to come. Things shift gears once federal agent Hobbs (The Rock) enlists the help of the Furious gang to bring down a terrorist (Luke Evans) who has skills to match the Furious. An old member of the gang previously presumed dead returns too. The motivations matter little, what matters is that they are loud, ooh-aha inducing and, with the addition of MMA fighter Gina Carano, extremely brutal. And if you thought that the highway mayhem with the tank that is featured in the trailer was the maximum director Justin Lin was attempting, you are so very wrong. He has in store a shattering climax which involves the Furious gang battling the villains in a cargo plane the size of an island, with a dozen supercharged sports cars with harpoons trying to stop it from taking off. What is customary though is the ball of fire in the end, and Diesel walking out of it, unscathed, smiling. Some more homage to the man, then- <br/><br/>""When Vin Diesel goes to donate blood, he declines the syringe, and instead requests a handgun and a bucket."" <br/><br/>""Vin Diesel played Russian Roulette with a fully loaded gun and won."" <br/><br/>""In an average living room there are 1,242 objects Vin Diesel could use to kill you, including the room itself.""<br/><br/>Director Justin Lin has conjured up a movie that makes you forget all other F and F ones. Never mind that there is a plot to boot, most of the films budget and time is aptly dedicated to high speed dueling, massive explosions, inspired stunt-work and creative property damage. The actors don't have too much to act about, but you would expect this to be a Diesel, Rock or a Paul Walker movie. But no, it is an out and out Romano (Tyrese Gibson) movie. Every Romano moment is a LOL moment, and he more than makes up for the forced seriousness of the other cast members. Luke Evans as the villain is a bad choice though- he has absolutely no personality in front of these towering hunks, but he does seem to have x-ray vision when he points at Diesel and says ""Look at his face. He is so angry""- meanwhile Diesel remains as impassive as ever. Can't have enough of him?<br/><br/>""The word ""lesbian"" derives from an old Latin phrase that roughly translates as ""She who has not yet been introduced to Vin Diesel.""<br/><br/>""There is no theory of evolution, just a list of creatures Vin Diesel allows to live."" <br/><br/>""Vin Diesel once ate the entire cake at a bachelor party before anyone could tell him there was a stripper in it.""<br/><br/>Love cars or hate cars, critics and reviews be damned, just go and watch Fast and Furious 6, popcorn in hand. This is a shamelessly entertaining, guffaw inducing, and awe-inspiring thrill ride. Wait till the end though, and we are introduced to what will come in part 7. Perhaps the only real competition in Hollywood to Diesel's racing skills. Any guesses? Or you would rather like to be transported somewhere.10/10"

","Fast & Furious over the last few installments has become all about action. And the latest outing takes it a step further. Almost 20% of the movie is comprised of action sequences. And at the expense of action, plot, writing, characters all take a backseat. But no one's complaining. Why ? Because the action makes up for all of it.<br/><br/>Do the above statements sound cliché ??? The movie's plot is full of such silly dialogs so its best ignored in the current context. What works is the action - Lin and his crew bring us some of the most ridiculously outrageous and boldly conceived action sequences. There's an intense chase through London in the initial reels and also a race later on. There's a whole plane take-off-crash sequence towards the end that you've probably got a glimpse of in the trailers. The girls are no slouches either and we see an intense hand-to-hand fight of sorts between Michelle Rodriguez's Letty and Gina Carano's Riley.<br/><br/>But the movie's best sequence is undoubtedly the 10 minute Tank chase across the freeway that involves most of the cast and culminates in a breathtaking ""catch"" (about which I'd not say any further). The camera cuts like crazy, music is pulsating and that single sequence is probably worth the price of the movie ticket.<br/><br/>Apart from action, Furious 6 doesn't have much going for it. Dialog is standard, at times even silly and predictable, characters are flat, performances are decent. The car chases and night scenes got me so involved, I actually felt a bit strange leaving the theater and coming out into the real world's broad daylight. And the post-credits scene is simply, a treat which makes the next installment in the series worth looking forward to. Suffice it to say that in the end, the movie drifts full circle.<br/><br/>Watch it for the action, and for the action alone. If you expect any sort of character development or family issues like the first installment had, you'll be disappointed. Else, you're in for one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>Score: 7 / 10"

","The Fast and Furious franchise has undergone a radical transformation since launching 12 years ago, with the changes following Justin Lin taking hold of directorial duties from Tokyo Drift (film three) onwards.<br/><br/>The series has made the transition from street races to include drugs, heists, and now terrorism, while lead characters Dom Toretto (Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Walker) have gone from petty thug and law enforcer to wanted fugitives.<br/><br/>With an opening sequence reminiscent of Quantum of Solace, Toretto and Brian screech around mountaintops as the latter readies himself to become a father, demonstrating how adult and family-minded they've become. Meanwhile, what follows is a nice refresher for those acquainted with the series and for newcomers alike, acting as a highlights reel to bring everyone up to speed of the events experienced in the previous five films.<br/><br/>The antagonist for Fast 6 is Mr Owen Shaw (Evans), a former special ops military man that uses his knowledge, contacts and fast cars to make robberies for the highest bidder. In this instance, it just so happens he has his eyes on a chip that would incite terrorism in the wrong hands, which prompts baby oil-loving federal agent Hobbs (Johnson) to round up Toretto and his crew for back-up, offering them full pardons in exchange for their services.<br/><br/>London is the main backdrop for the film, which, naturally, features a very corny cameo, though the the bright lights, black taxis and double-decker buses dotted around the city are infinitely more welcome.<br/><br/>For me, five was the best of all of the films, but six gives it a run for its money, taking the stunts to ridiculous new heights (literally). You could, of course, reprimand the film for its use of impossible feats, but that's the whole point of these films, right? To get bigger and more extreme, as demonstrated with the big and extreme – and always affable – introduction of Johnson in Fast Five.<br/><br/>For me, Johnson changed the game and breathed new life into a franchise that was beginning to get stale, and seeing Hobbs join forces with Toretto and co makes for brilliant viewing. The action is insane and the banter is electric, with the camaraderie between the cast obvious.<br/><br/>The only criticism of the film is its length. There was a particular moment that seemed as though the film had wrapped, though it continued for another half hour, and while what followed was laced with adrenaline and big bangs, the film could have done with a 20 minute tightening.<br/><br/>Shaw isn't an intimidating or imposing character, particularly when facing off against Hobbs and Toretto, but he is devious, ruthless and sharp, presenting an entirely new threat to the series.<br/><br/>Those in the know will be aware Tokyo Drift threw the timeline entirely out of sequence, but the game comes full circle at the end of the film, and you won't want to miss the credits sequence that follows <br/><br/>Originally posted at www.zentertainmentweekly.com<br/><br/>7/10"

","Although critics seem to be following all over themselves about this film, the sixth installment in the ""Fast and the Furious"" series plays like an engine stuck on idle. It goes nowhere and leaves the viewer with nothing but mind-numbing FX and CGI that makes little or no sense and gives new meaning to the term ""implausible."" Blame it on director Justin Lin, though, as he cannot seem to decide if he wants to continue the ""Fast & Furious"" lowbrow modus operandi or create a Rent-A-Center James Bond flick.<br/><br/>Ultimately, however, it all ends up as a demolition derby where classic automobiles are smashed and destroyed under the weight of tanks and aircraft as well as a stilted, pretentious script. And, to add to the confusion, it's not even titled ""Fast & Furious 6,"" but just ""Furious 6,"" which is certainly an apt description of the emotion one feels after shelling out their hard-earned bucks to view this tripe.<br/><br/>With a cast headed by Vin Diesel and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (appearing in his 50th film so far this year), along with hangers-on Paul Walker (whose career peaked at ""8 Below""), Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges, Michelle Rodriquez, Jordana Brewster and Luke Evans, among others, the acting is as ridiculous as the implausible (there's that word again) stunts which punctuate this effort every time the inane dialogue screeches it to a halt.<br/><br/>Alas, those stunts and car chases (and wrecks) which trademark the franchise, are so over-the-top stupefying and obviously fake - and the automobiles (which few of our readers as well as the author could never afford in two lifetimes) are smashed for no reason, whatsoever.<br/><br/>Not that the plot itself (the original F&F gang is reassembled by Federal Agent Hobbs - Johnson, fresh off his appearance in ""Pain & Gain"" - to stop British military traitor Owen Shaw, played by Evans, ""The Raven,"" from selling secrets to the highest bidder) is strong enough to draw anyone into the theater, either.<br/><br/>The cast seems to sleepwalk through the production with only the occasional chase or explosion or plane crash to jar the audience out of its stupor. And speaking of airplanes, the concluding sequence - which features a Russian cargo jet lumbering for takeoff with cars and the entire cast either hanging from it or chasing it - goes on so long the runway has to be at least 50 miles long.<br/><br/>Instead of concentrating on the action on screen or the razor-thin story, all I kept wondering was just where they found a runway that long in the first place.<br/><br/>That was the only defense mechanism I had during this nonsense, just think of something else and get it over with. And pay no heed to the critics who write that the movie does what its supposed to do and that's why many of them recommend it.<br/><br/>A dog answering the call of nature on the side of the road does what's supposed to do, too, but that doesn't mean I want to watch that on the big screen."
"whoa17","7","37","79","24 May 2013"," Fast and Furious 6 review
","The previous installments of this franchise (specifically 1,2, Tokyo Drift and 4) was all about racing, sure there's a plot but it wasn't really shown well, then part 5 happened and the franchise took a different turn, it now became a heist film instead of the usual racing. I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.<br/><br/>Story: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her ""resurrection"" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.<br/><br/>Acting: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.<br/><br/>Action: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.<br/><br/>Cinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.<br/><br/>Direction: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.<br/><br/>Overall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5<br/><br/>P.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7."
"andrewbrauer96","9","16","30","24 November 2013"," Fast & Furious 6 Movie Review By Andrew Brauer
","It's crazy to see that this franchise has gone to a sixth entry, but what is even more surprising is that it's actually been getting better. The first four Fast & The Furious were pretty cheesy action movies that would cater to a certain demography, but when Fast Five came out in 2011, I was very surprised at how much fun I had with it, and If I did review movies back in 2011, that would've been on my Top 10 of Best for the year. Now two years later we have Fast & Furious 6, which takes place where Fast Five finished, Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew are living large as millionaires but Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) shows up and needs Dom's help, as a new group of criminals led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) is after an important computer chip that could lead to a even bigger threat. But the big reason why Dom and his crew will help out, is because one of Shaw's right hand men is Dom's former lover Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who died in one of the previous films, but turns out to not be dead. Dom, Brian, Roman, Tej, and everyone else returns to rescue Letty, and clear they're names for good. Now for starters, does this film have the greatest writing or acting in the world, of course not, but it is insanely fun and without a doubt one of the most entertaining films this year. This film is extremely well directed with Justin Lin (Fast Five) at the helm, the action sequences look incredible and every time something big and exciting was about to happen, I was pumped up and was giggling with excitement. In fact, the final action sequence is one of the coolest action scenes I've witnessed in a long time. The pacing is also quick and hardly slows down, whereas for the story is simple and hardly focuses on it, unless it involves the overall message about family and togetherness. Fast & Furious 6 has what was missing out of Pacific Rim, which the problem with Pacific Rim was too much story, not enough action, Fast & Furious 6 is all action, little story, and it works so well. The acting is fine, everyone has been doing these movies for a while so they know what their doing and they do it well. The humor is great as several times I cracked up (most of it is from the comic relief of Tyrese Gibson's Roman), the soundtrack is great, and although the writing is pretty silly, it does serve for some truly perfect quotes. Problems are that logic is thrown out the window for this film, if you think more than you watch, you'll just hate watching this because hardly anything makes sense. And some scenes around the middle go on a little too long, especially the prison scene. But Fast & Furious 6 is comfortable with what kind of film it is, a silly, over the top, but extremely entertaining crowd pleaser. I haven't this much fun with a movie in a long time, all you need to know is fast cars, hot girls, explosions, and muscles. Just leave your brain at home and enjoy the ride."

","From the first Fast & Furious these films has been a great success. At first OK and good entertainment, and undeniably a good idea. The second two was a let down with too much sideways driving, but then things started happening again. The fifth outing Fast Five was surprisingly the best so far. It WAS fast & furious! The pace was excellent, the story was good and the driving was amazing. This sixth outing adds a lot to the last success, which made 630 million dollars in the cinemas only. The world's biggest car film franchise!<br/><br/>F&F6 which premiered in London a week before the rest, due to London being the base here, is ferociously faster and more furious than ever. The only thing that doesn't take off here, is the plane in the end! F&F6 is starring some of the most amazing sports cars classic car lovers adore. This time also European super-cars!<br/><br/>The amazing British handmade Jensen Interceptor, the ultra rare Dodge Charger Daytona made in only 300 ex (though here in a replica) and the sporting legend of a every day classic, the Ford Escort RS2000 are tangled in together with the well known Mustang and Corvette. You'll also find a Plymouth Barracuda, a 2011 Dodge Charger, A Nissan GTR, BMW M5, Alfa Romeo and Aston Martin is also present. Put into the mix the most classic tank driving since James Bond drowned his in Russia, sadly enough crushing a Mustang, and you got a driving focused classic which is even better than the Fast Five!<br/><br/>This is a continuation of Fast Five, and some kind of prequel to the first. Impressive action stunts, fast cars, sexy entertainment, well acted by the crew we've grown to like so much. Amazing driving action is the driving force of this film, containing a car chase on a long strip against a plane, and a long carcasses a city night. I love that Gina Carano is added to the crew. This is so right it can possible be. <br/><br/>This seems to be an unstoppable success story, which will continue to bring classic drivers cars out of oblivion, making new fast for the old classics which should be preserved for the future in a world where cars are looking like bars of soap.<br/><br/>As long as this franchise can keep up with the feel good action and showing the use of nasty cars and chic girls combined with an effective story which includes the classic car chases, this will deliver the thrills.<br/><br/>What will be the cars in the seventh outing? I bet for a Monteverdi, most certainly a Maserati and a nice TWR. I'd sure love to see more of the Jensen Interceptor, so may I suggest a four wheel drive FF-battle between Jensen FF racing against a Ferrari FF? I suggest the name FF7 - Fast & Furious Four Wheel Drive!<br/><br/>Don't leave the cinema too early. In an extra clip you'll get a little glimpse of what to expect in the next episode, and who's the obvious bad guy in this. Well, we just have to wait a year, because the seventh is on a year from now. Enjoy the rides! I sure did!"
"Ginnysababe","9","5","7","9 June 2013"," Fantastic movie from an almost died-out franchise
","We've all seen our favorite movies churn out those forgettable and often straight-to-video sequels; Death Race, Wrong Turn, Resident Evil. (Really, not Resident Evil???). And with The Fast and the Furious series, you were starting to see the decline after 2 and most definitely 3. So for Justin Lin to bring back this series from the dead, even to use the weird sequels as a part of the story in his new trilogy, is incredibly impressive.<br/><br/>As for Furious Six, I thought it was incredibly enjoyable. Few movies are actually this fun to watch. The action felt very well paced, never dragging on or repetitious in any way. The dialogue was humorous and the story was very interesting to see played out.<br/><br/>I feel like the only movie I could compare this to is Transformers 3. Coming from a series that I felt like was convoluted and ""missing the point"" of a fun action film, Transformers 3 and Furious Six alike really meet what they were striving for. An incredibly fun film.<br/><br/>This next part is mainly for people who have seen the movie already, though not a spoiler.<br/><br/>I've seen a few reviews that say that last action packed scene in the film's climax was too much and could have been cut. I could not disagree more. I feel like the filmmaker mislead everyone to think everything was fine and dandy, all wrapped up, but I could not help but feel that the action was over too abruptly, and I still needed to see more. And then there is that last, incredibly epic action scene. The filmmakers made me feel like I needed to see more, so that they could deliver that last scene specifically for me. Great filmmaking, great film. Very impressed."

","To say this is a guilty pleasure would be putting it mildly. Since the first time I saw 'The Fast and The Furious' 12 years ago, I knew I found my car/mayhem fix. Although I never thought it would last to see iteration #6, I was more eager this time around than for the first. No surprises, besides the unpredictable nature of Owen Shaw. The only real curveball was the substantiation of an Internet rumor that Jason Statham joined 'Fast 6'. Well, sorta -- end credits. After the audience ""ooooohh's"" at Statham's revealing, I couldn't wait, yet again, for the 7th! <br/><br/>Fun factoid: This movie marked the reuniting of 2 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' characters. Jason Statham (Bacon) and Stephen Marcus (Nick the Greek) playing the CCTV supervisor opposite Lucas Hobbs. :)"

But they definitely surprised me when i saw this movie yesterday they are more back to there roots like in the first 3 movies with a lot of racing and cars all over the movie! Than add lots of humor and great looking girls, locations, cars and weapons and a long with all the amazing actor's you get this astonishing movie!!<br/><br/>I Say GREAT Job to the maker of this movie and keep up the good combination of all elements and especially the racing part as this is the core of the movie and not shooting and fighting like there was a little to much on 4 and 5.<br/><br/>I cant wait until the new upcoming number 7 with Jason Statham!"
"tzmmalaysia","8","5","7","27 May 2013"," Kept me at the edge of my seat
","Although I'm not a hardcore fan of this franchise, I did watch all of its titles and frankly speaking this installment kept me at the edge of my seat for a good two hours of actions, except maybe for the somewhat lengthy and awkward but fortunately rare conversational scenes. I like the breath-taking and adrenaline rush of the 'unusual' car-chase scenes, which have already been revealed in the trailer, involving F1 cars, a tank and even a plane. As for the speed rush, you'll just have to watch it yourself. I also enjoyed the little bit of reminisce in classic scenes here and there, as well as some humorous scenes involving mostly Tyrese. Got to give it to him for the laughs.<br/><br/>I don't mind the fact that there's more of Dwayne Johnson but I'm actually quite disappointed with Paul Walker's underplayed role. Vin Diesel could also use a bit more facial and non-verbal expressions. <br/><br/>Overall I find it as one of the best installment of the franchise, and definitely a good watch if you're a typical action flick fan. 8 from me as it certainly tops my action movies list of the year, but pretty straight-forward and not quite yet to reach a 'legendary' status that movies like The Matrix and Rambo enjoys.<br/><br/>Oh and special credits to the production team for the bridge scene and the teaser for the next installment (remember to stay seated when the credit starts to roll!)"
"jaesqueda","8","5","7","26 May 2013"," Fast and Furious 6
","The cars are one of the basic elements for action movies nowadays and that's the reason for fast & furious's success. After Rio, Toretto's family: Dominic, O Conner, Mia are now at Europa, and Hobbs ask them for help because a Russian ex-military is planning traffic with a powerful weapon; one argue is convincing: Letty is alive. Spectacular sequences, big cars, London, and Spain Highways are the complement for this movie. When we think that the movie is ending, takes places a story change. One of the think that like me from the movie is that between lines they promote the value of the family, and one dialog from Toretto show this: ""Do not turn your back on your family even if they give it to you if"". A excellent sequence introduce a Jason Statham as a new villain for the next movie and explain how Han Lue dead."
"hypestyle","10","5","7","25 May 2013"," Action Franchise Isn't Out of Gas Yet
","Action Franchise Isn't Out of Gas Yet Fast & Furious 6, as the title implies, is the sixth installment in the long-running action film series. Viewers should put on their seat belts and get ready for over two hours worth of joyriding. Vehicular mayhem never looked this good—so good, in fact, the producers apparently felt compelled to tag a disclaimer on the reel before the credits begin to roll. The film series started out as a vehicle (pun intended) for then-burgeoning action actor Vin Diesel (an apropos surname given the film setting). Since the first film premiered in 2001, it has grown to encompass several more co-stars in its subsequent sequels, leading into its current incarnation as a multicultural ensemble of drag-racing avengers.<br/><br/>This time around, Diesel's Dominic Toretto and former adversary-turned-brother-in-law Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) are visited by globetrotting Interpol agent Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and presented with the proverbial offer they can't refuse: Letty (Michelle Hernandez), a heretofore deceased member of Toretto's crew, was recently seen helping out internationally-wanted criminal Shaw (Luke Evans). Shaw's team of outlaws use similar car-heavy tactics to pull off their heists, and so if Toretto's squad can beat them at their own game, a full pardon—and a reunion with Letty—is the reward. So the Fast & Furious team comes back again for one last job.<br/><br/>The object of Shaw's affection is the film's MacGuffin: a computer database that can disable military security systems. It's fair to say, however, that this is entirely irrelevant to the film, as this screen franchise has built its brand on wilder-than-impossible stunt sequences and the interplay between Toretto's team: chatterbox Roman (Tyrese Gibson), gizmo guru Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges), laid-back Han (Sung Kang) and tough-girl Gisele (Gal Gadot). Another tag-along this time is Hobb's right-hand agent Riley (Gina Carano), who gets to showcase her real-life UFC fighting skills in several confrontations.<br/><br/>This is one of the best comic-book films of the year that aren't based on a comic (screenplay credit goes to Chris Morgan). Despite the relatively threadbare plot (and settings that hip-hop from Moscow to Los Angeles to London and more), director Justin Lin keeps everything from being the flailing mess that it might otherwise be in lesser hands. Sweeping, wide-camera views of urban cityscapes and chasm-spanning bridges help add to the spectacle, and the climax is as exhilarating as it is shamelessly over-the-top. If the epilogue is any indicator, the close-ups of gear-shifting and revving engines definitely haven't ended.<br/><br/>Rating: A-"
"lucena-neto","8","5","7","25 May 2013"," What a great surprise!
","I'm a big fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, but since the last movie (Rio) i was like ""it's a good action movie, but it had lost its essence"". Now, after watching F&F 6, i've the feeling that one part of the original story is back. The cars have a bigger role (now they can be called secondary characters), but still isn't the same as F&F , F&F 2 and F&F Tokio. All the characters (specially Dom, Brian, Hobbs and Letty) were well created, respecting their origins and explaining some important details from the past movies. I've rated 8 for some reasons: 1) action sequences that goes against gravity in so many ways; 2) it's a little too long; 3) the cars and races still have a secondary role.<br/><br/>In general it's a great action movie, with a good plot, nice races, really funny (thanks Roman!) and exciting. If you're a big fan of F&F, why haven't you watched yet?? If you're not a fan, but like action movies, i strongly recommend it!<br/><br/>Hope this review helps!"

And yes it is.<br/><br/>Leave performances, Ludicrous got the cheesiest of lines and man I almost laughed my heart out. Paul Walker, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, Michelle Rodriguez and rest of the cast fits in perfectly.<br/><br/>The antagonist of the movie keeps up to our expectations of being a complete bad-ass. The movie has its fair shares of twists and turns and the car chases and chick fights really keeps you glued to your seats.<br/><br/>The post warning and before the credits roll out,the cut scene has a delightful surprise.

"andrarizvia","8","9","15","27 May 2013"," Well Packed Action-Comedy-Consistency
","Nice opening title by the way...<br/><br/>FF6 have everything that a summer movie should. Fast packed action, interlude comedy that makes us laugh, consistency, steady acting, and not that many plot holes that could ruin the movie.<br/><br/>First of all, after the movie started (about 10 minutes), my mind kept thinking about this movie should have a sequel. The action scenes of FF6 have a nice varieties and also an excellent climax graphic, cause its going up all the way along with the movie plot (seriously, i think the tank scene is great and after that it could be an anticlimax, but i was wrong because the plane scene is absolutely amazing). And of course besides the car showdown, there was this nice fighting scene all over the place. <br/><br/>For the comedy side, This movie have quite a nice jokes that serve their purpose (as an intermission between action scene), and classy one too. Take example at the skyline-charger joke, that's my favorite one (since FF1). Also, Roman Pierce's stupidity, and few other jokes that go well for the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>What makes FF6 even greater is the consistency factor, and not just to the scenes of this movie, but also to the prequel ones. Fast & Furious 6 shows that all of 5 movies before this one matters (yes, including FF Tokyo Drift). They don't dump away people and proves that they still exist in this saga's timeline (like Elena, and even Braga).<br/><br/>Plot holes... yea, this movie has some. A little this and a little that, but in my opinion, it doesn't matter. What did you expect should be a blowing mindless (sort of) action movie, and you got that while watching this movie. Sure it gets kinda boring in the middle, but i assure you that it'll all paid off once you get to the peak of this movie.<br/><br/>To sum up, Fast & Furious 6 proves me something. After i watched Fast5 (where the post credit scene shows the picture of letty) and there's a rumor that there'll be a sequel after this, part of me cannot help to thinking skeptical. How the hell are they gonna make a movie that gonna top this one (action-wise), and they just did. So, applause for this movie cause it makes me happy... 8 of 10.<br/><br/>*P.S. you might want to re-watch FF Tokyo Drift after watching this movie"
"brillig-2","3","21","42","29 May 2013"," Utterly Ridiculous
","I'm sorry, but suspension of disbelieve is not possible for me with this movie. There's only so far you can stretch a rubber band before it snaps, and with this movie, they stretched the rubber band about a hundred times past snapping point and expect the audience to believe it won't snap.<br/><br/>Take the scenes (yes, plural) involving the plane near the end of the movie. After it had achieved takeoff speed, it was still struggling to take off for the next, what, 15 minutes? Was that run strip really 50 miles long? Note I didn't time the sequence, so my numbers might be off, but that's just an example of the extent of the ridiculousness. I don't give it a spoiler, because part of this was in the trailer I saw.<br/><br/>Besides the ridiculous overly exaggerated action scenes, I thought the acting left much to be desired.<br/><br/>It would, though, make a good video game."

I don't know what the Rock, Dwayne Johnson is doing, but he is a beast in this movie. The scene between him and the huge white boy at the end made me think of the fight between godzilla and mothra. The fight scenes between Michelle Rodrigues character and the other lady were tough, and exciting. All the supporting cast did their parts well.

Guys have been trained to walk out of movies wanting to be like the hero of the movie. The box office of Furious 6 restored my faith in mankind. OK, it hasn't eclipsed 1.2B, but there's still time left."
"slicedbread117","9","8","13","29 August 2013"," Fast Five reignited this series, Fast & Furious 6 has taken it even further.
","The Fast & Furious series has seen some good times and not so good times. The series has been up and down since The Fast and the Furious released in 2001, and seems to have finally decided on a permanent name for the series. When 2011's Fast Five ushered in a new vision of the franchise, brought huge success and now Fast & Furious 6 has driven that success to heights I never thought I'd see in this series.<br/><br/>This series is really supposed to be about two things: fast cars and furious action (pun absolutely intended) and this movie provides both on a large scale. Though some of the action scenes are a bit unrealistic and clichéd, they are intense and exciting enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. High speed highway chases, big time shootouts, and some excellent hand-to-hand combat are all in full effect here and make for some very entertaining action sequences. A little more on the fisticuffs, they really were quite exciting and very well choreographed. The build up to the eventual showdown between two female characters and two juggernauts is fun and the clashes are great. The cars and other vehicles in the movie are fast paced and never leave a dull moment where something is dragged out (except for the end of the movie). So again, some of the action scenes are clichéd and predictable, but are overall a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Now the plot and the villain. The story again revolves around Dominic Toretto and his crew who accept one last job to ensure their freedom. Things go awry, and the crew is forced into a much larger conflict than originally expected. The story takes some unexpected turns and keeps you interested for the vast majority, but at times was a little too rushed and got confusing. It wasn't the best story in an action movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't the worst either. The movie's romantic sub plot involving Dominic and Letty was good. It never made you bored and added to the emotional side a little bit. The villain, Owen Shaw, is a good antagonist. At first, he doesn't seem to pose a huge threat and is sometimes boring to get into, but eventually really shows his dark side making up for his lack of character development in the early parts of the film. <br/><br/>The cast is great. Vin Disel (Toretto), Paul Walker (Brain O'Conner), Dwayne Johnson (Hobbs), and Luke Evans (Shaw) among many other do a great job of bringing the movie to life. Some of the supporting cast such as Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous bring a solid slate of humor to keep the film fresh while Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) and Gina Carano (Riley) provide strong female roles that aren't often seen in action films. A shout out as well to director Justin Lin, who has taken an almost dead series after Tokyo Drift and reinvented it into the fast-paced action- heavy movies we again know.<br/><br/>I love this series. The Fast and the Furious was a highly entertaining film while the next two movies were weak. Fast & Furious in 2009 was a step up and then again, Fast Five was a new and improved direction for the series which spanned F&F6 and the already announced Fast & Furious 7 slated for a July 2014 release. This movie may at times suffer from minor cases of clichés (and the longest runway in film history), but the top heavy action sequences, highlighted by terrific fight scenes and fast paced vehicular mayhem, plentiful and entertaining humor, great cast and acceptable story more than make up for those corny parts. <br/><br/>The Fast & Furious series (which is hopefully the name they're sticking to), is back on the map and at top form. An end credits scene connects the dots between Tokyo Drift and the since announced Fast & Furious 7, so stick around to build up even more hype for next summer's big blockbuster.<br/><br/>8.5/10 (my score is rounded to 9 on the website's rating)"

","I love this movie! Furious 6 is even bigger and more over-the-top than Fast Five, which I also loved! That vault-dragging scene was a blast but this new sequel is even more epic and maddeningly entertaining! This time, Hobbs and new sidekick Riley, played by Gina Carano, team with Dom, Brian, Han, Gisele, Roman, and Tej to take down Owen Shaw and his crew. If they succeed, Dom and Co. receive full pardons and the chance to make their family whole again as Letty is in fact alive and working with Owen Shaw.<br/><br/>This movie opens with a race along winding roads that ends at a hospital. Mia is giving birth and Brian's a mess. This movie is all about family and I definitely appreciate that though I think they said the word ""family"" about.... 1,675,894,035 times! I kid- The attention to continuity is admirable with an opening titles sequence highlighting super sweet moments from the previous five entries. There are a couple surprise character appearances that should make fans smile at least a little.<br/><br/>The Rock is still huge and awesome, always great to see Vin and Paul doing their thing (Paul does a better job here), and welcome back Tyrese, Ludicrous, Sung, and Gal! Michelle's Letty still has attitude, is tough, yet vulnerable. Seeing Letty and Dom together again just feels so right. Sorry, Elena! Gina isn't that great of an actress but she sure kicks butt! Luke Evans as the main villain does a swell job! Best villain so far! His flip car is wild! Though his death wasn't that epic...Speaking of deaths, one of the good guys doesn't make it to the end, my heart AHHH! Poor Han...<br/><br/>Furious 6 offers up a few twists, a ton of comedy (thanks mostly to Tyrese and Ludicrous), over-the-top car and tank and plane action, hand-to-hand combat (Jah vs. Roman and Han, Riley vs. Letty, The Rock/Dom vs. Klaus), shootouts, a wonderfully directed race between Dom and Letty, so much entertainment! You can tell that these guys and gals are having a blast and know just how ridiculous and fun this series is! I love how these characters end up back at the house from the first film! <br/><br/>If you're into crazy car stunts, fist fights, shootouts, beautiful women, hilarious one-liners, cheesy acting, melodrama, fun, then this movie is for you! <br/><br/>The scene during the credits will make you wish Fast & Furious 7 was coming out next weekend!"

May be a crack team of operatives trained in covert operations? Of course not, you get someone from an unknown department that looks like he has overdone the steroids and likes wearing tight t-shirts,(Wayne Johnson), to approach a crew of law breakers who can drive cars fast slamming them into the gears at the same time as hammering the throttle. Obvious really! They can chase the baddies at high speed through city centres including London ( some chance - I hope they paid the congestion charge or they will have broken the law even further), or stop him the bad guy when he is driving a tank along a Spanish highway by just using a bit of steel cable and an old 1970's Ford Escort. This was a truly dreadful film whose script must have been written on the back of a cereal packet using a crayon. The acting was as bad as the storyline. Diesel Van looked more like a man sent to clear your blocked toilet. Unfortunately he didn't do it with this pile of hokum. <br/><br/>I marked this review as containing spoilers but it's hard to imagine how a comment could spoil it any more.<br/><br/>The film also contained numerous product placements and ended with a barbecue where an obvious brand bottle of ketchup had it's name covered by a bit of red tape.

Why do they also think that changing gear immediately makes you faster?<br/><br/>Seriously, if you are a mindless sheep you will enjoy this film but if you were hoping for a proper fast and furious film you will be seriously disappointed."

","As great as the original Fast & Furious! High adrenaline and fast cars. Who would have guessed they would have put so much time into the storyline along with the time they put in these actor's appearances. It is a great movie for those adults & young adults who have grown up with these movies. Due to the fighting and drug cartel references not a great movie for kids. This is a movie you would want to leave the kiddos home with a babysitter as you enjoy it. Upbeat, high energy, and will leave you smiling! This is a great movie to watch with the full impact of the movie theater experience. An absolute must see! Never a dull moment!"
"Troy_Campbell","8","6","9","6 June 2013"," A guilty pleasure.
","Everyone has something they enjoy that they really shouldn't. Lance had drugs, Tiger had women who weren't his wife and I have the F&F franchise. Thankfully my guilty pleasure won't get me into trouble, just weird looks from those who know I have zero interest in cars in real life. But that's the joy of this series: it's a souped-up fantasy with no interest in being grounded. With physics, common sense and realism all gleefully thrown out of the window, returning director Justin Lin concocts an awesome array of ludicrous vehicular set-pieces and bone- crunching fights, accompanied with tongue-in-cheek humour and amusing references to past Fast flicks. The cast know they are on a good wicket with this seemingly invincible franchise and are clearly having a blast. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker lap up the opportunity to play their most popular roles once again, Michelle Rodriguez is back in the part that made her big, Gina Carano and Luke Evans get in on the fun, whilst Dwayne ""Samoan Thor"" Johnson again commands your undivided attention as law enforcer Hobbs. If these movies aren't your thing then this sixth instalment won't change that, but if you're already a fan then you'll be in a supercharged, nitrous-oxide-injected heaven."

","You would think that the plot for the Fast and Furies series would start to run out of gas and slowly die out,as all the characters ""retired"" after the job on Fast Five. But in Fast and Furious 6 We find Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and the rest of the gang, all of who have retired from active duty to live lives of sumptuous ease, being called back by law enforcers (Dwayne Johnson and Gina Carano) and put to straight work.<br/><br/>Their task is to take out the another ""gang"" this one run by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Toretto is particularly interested in this job as he find out his ex wife Letty(Michelle Rodriguez) who he thought was dead is part of this gang and still alive, and feels a desperate urge to find her and bring her back to the family. The film takes us through many set pieces and jaw dropping scenes and a few massive plot twists. One for example, is when Han (Sung Kang) is holding Gisele Yashar(Gal Gadot) hand as she clings for her life off a levitating car due to them trying to take out the engine, she lets go of his hand and open fires on one of Shaw's men standing behind Han, ready to kill him, if not for her sacrifice to save Han and fall to her death... rather than to see Han killed before her very eyes. The stunts performed were top notch, The acting, well that really surprised me i hadn't been too impressed with the acting in the previous Fast Five or other F&F films but this time round they nailed it, couldn't really fault them.<br/><br/>The ending leads us back to Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift where Han is killed in a car crash, but this time Ian Shaw (Owen Shaw's brother) played by Jason Statham exits a white car and makes a phone call saying "" Dominic Toretto, you don't know me, but you soon will."" So this makes lets us know that Fast and Furious 7 will have another big name actor- Jason Statham brought into the film series."

","After many years, won't the ""Fast and Furious"" makers give up the series. They have always wanted to keep their fans close and updated, by making more movies. The problem by making more movies to a series, is that they always have to bring something new to the movie. They get fewer new ideas, and end often by ""copying"" another movie from the series and make it a bit different. Those movies get hated and sells bad. But in the 6th movie of the ""Fast and Furious"" series, they give us something old and new, and it's exciting at the same time. In the 5th movie there were more action and a lack of street racing. In the 6th movie they've tried to go back to the street racing, and they succeeded! I felt like I was back in the first movies, the cars, the noises, hell yeah even the chicks were back! They even tried to combine both street racing and the action, WHICH was not a disappointment at all! The story is simple, stop the bad guys from doing something bad, but even if the story is that simple, it's pretty good told. There is always something that happens that will keep you focused. The effects are really great. There is nothing that is half done. Every actors and actresses play their roles excellent, especially hilarious Tyrese Gibson and the leading Vin Diesel.<br/><br/>In short, the movie is great! I will recommend it for everybody that loves a good action movie, and for those who are big fans to the ""Fast and Furious"" movies. This movie is something you definitely should see.<br/><br/>8/10"

However, when you see the end, you'll without-a-doubt conclude that a ""Fast 7"" is already in the works.<br/><br/>The villain in this film has many tentacles, and a family of His own that could lead to even more intrigue in a 7th film. Michelle Rodriguez was amazing in the reprisal her role as Letty, and her fight scene with Gina Carano would make even Chuck Norris smile.<br/><br/>Overall, it was Tyrese Gibson's character that added the most significant amount of laughs.

","You might think this series of films would get dull by now,no way,it's still brilliant over the top action. The main crux of this one is this is Dominic finds out Letty is still alive and working for a bunch of crimials. So Dominic teams up with the police to find her,he does so and she... Well i won't tell you,but it's all brilliantly played out,leaving the viewer wondering just what is going on in Letty's mind. So another fast and furious and the end leaves you with no doubt they'll be yet another. the fast and furious series just keeps getting better and better so far fast and furious six has to be the best film in the series."
"lewisfindley3","8","7","11","23 September 2013"," Looking Forward to The Sequel
","This film was very enjoyable. I was engrossed in it all the way through. One particular part I liked the most was how they were literally against themselves and how Hobbs and Dom had to work together - which at first seemed unthinkable but I think this added so much to the film.<br/><br/>One thing I like in films is how they bring back scenes or moments from the previous ones so that it adds more emotion to the film and allows you to get into the minds of the characters. This film provided a fine balance of them and I feel that this added more depth to the film as it highlights their past and what they are still living with emotionally. One example I liked the most was when Dom was given the picture of Letty at the start of the film.<br/><br/>I must single out Gibson's character as he was so funny and how his one-liners had me in hysterics. I did get sentimental when they reminded him how big his forehead was.<br/><br/>The action was intense at times and at some points hard to believe because of the creativity. One of my favourite parts was the scene where they raid the convoy and try to steal the tank that it is transporting. The locations were intriguing as they were in different cities. One city that I found the most interesting was London. Because the city is so notoriously bad to drive in they made it look so easy. Also the scenes in the subway that actually made me zone out because I was just so into it.<br/><br/>Now.. the bad guy. I loved him; He was so methodical and calculating and reminded me of an evil Sheldon (Big Bang Theory) mixed with a psychopath. <br/><br/>One big twist was when they decided to let Shaw go as he had Mia being held captive. Then he says are you ready to go to the crew there and I assumed he was talking to Letty and then Hobbs assistant goes and I was like oh my god oh my god. This film had so many surprises and I thought it was thoroughly enjoyable."

","What an amazing movie! I can't believe the next movie will have Jason Statham in it, and as a bad guy, nonetheless. There has been a rumor going around, that I would like to put to rest! People have been saying in Fast 7, one of the main protagonists, Brian or Dom, is going to die! This is untrue, although a good contributing character will be killed. Oh No!!! But this is one of the most amazingly spectacular movie series of all time, but that is just an opinion of a great fan! For whoever reads this review, I am sorry for the spoiler, but please enjoy the next movie!!! I hope that in the next movie, another new character will be added to the series, which I am sure will happen. Thanks to the knowing of the coming of Ian Shaw!!"
"mbh42498","8","7","11","15 June 2013"," Not as bad as you people think.
","I almost laugh at commenters who give this movie 1 Star. One person referred to people as ""morons"", one said that having a seemingly dead character dead wasn't original, and another didn't even see 3,4,5. Went to go see the movie last night and it seemed to be much better than 5 in my opinion.<br/><br/>Similar to Fast 5, The Team(Diesel, Walker, Luda, Gibson, Kang, Gadot, and Rock) is back, excluding the other two guys. While amnesia is not the most clever and original idea out there, it is not something seen in most films and gives writers a reason for Diesel to take the job. If it were any other criminal, Diesel would probably refuse. The amount of destruction, the customized drag racing cars, the fights, it just goes to show how much The Fast series has evolved.<br/><br/>Fast 5 did have the rest of the cast helping out in the mission, but it was just some small stuff. Undercover work, opening safe, helping during the chase. Really, the everyone else wasn't that significant to the mission. This time, EVERYONE has a major part in this. You have Gadot with gun, Kang and Gibson get their ***es whooped and help more during the tank chase, Rocky is seen beside Diesel, and then there's Ludicrous standing on the sidelines. The members of the team seem more important this time around.<br/><br/>What some people do complain about, and I understand, is that this movie is less about Fast Driving and more about fighting. I get it; its easy to feel this way. While very slightly sad about that, 6 seems to have much more comedy and humoric jokes. They might mostly revolve around Tyrese Gibson, but nonetheless the jokes are still funny. Taking snacks out of the vending machine, foul mouth during the tank scene, the grappling hook, BIG FOREHEAD. So while less about the fast street racing like in the original, it has added a few more jokes and fighting which isn't that much worse.<br/><br/>What does impress me most is the progression of the Fast Movies. First the main ant was an Asian gang with Uzi's and motorcycles. 2 was a white guy with 2 Spanish henchmen, 3 was a Japanese teenager, 4 was(I actually never fully saw 4. lol), 5 was a corrupt Spanish police force, and this time involved guys from the same breed. As mentioned, these are not cops, these are the best criminals in Europe; they are fast and deadly. They have their own set of custom cars that are faster to begin with and have ramps on their hood. They have advanced and modified weapons like the chips. Last importantly, ""They Got a Tank"". The series went from something as small and minor as guys on motorcycles to extreme drivers with a tank and drag cars.<br/><br/>I do honestly enjoy this movie much more than 5, though watching this in a theater did hurt my eyes from all of the explosions and bright lights. The engagement of supporting characters is a good feature for the first time also, along with the twist near end. Can't wait until this comes out on DVD"
"shraysharma85","8","7","11","25 May 2013"," Fast paced ride
","Initially i was a lil skeptical about watching this one. No matter how strong the cast of this is and especially all the previous racers and characters coming together, it was a SEQUEL and usually they are disappointing. But this one i bet is one of the best sequels ever.. Keeps up to the name it definitely is fast, almost throughout there is no dull moment and you just can't afford to even blink your eye! Justin lin has sketched each character so magnificently, that you just can't avoid it. Great storyline and full of past paced action, Lin keeps you guessing in this one. The action sequences look for real and impressive. Though all the previous stars are back in this one, every single one of them has an important role to play, and every single one of them looks good. But YET they all look ohh so fresh.. The background score keeps you alive, and execution spellbound. Especially the 1st introduction seen of Shaw and the car chase on Spanish highway.. But the showstopper is the finale, the climax on the military base. Every actor has looked impressive, Vin diesel is impressive love struck leader out to save his girl, Dwayne Johnson as high on muscle supercop (resembles the role of Roadblock from GI Joe), Tyrese impresses with his comic timing and paul walker is good.. Sung kang and Ludicrous are great too in the performances, but What impresses me most are Michelle Rodriguez and Luke evans as the ultimate antagonist. He looks stylish amazing and absolutely classy in his role. Probably the best he has looked so far. Overall, the movie keeps you stuck on the seat, and yes there is a bit of a surprise element by the end of this one and i am sure you would be waiting for the next installment after that.. So make sure you do watch till the closing numbers start!!! Fast was this and made surely someone else furious for 7!!"

","As the Fast & Furious franchise continues with it's simple enjoyments of fast cars, well oiled muscles and sexy ladies. This film does meet expectations, and is your typical faster and bigger sequel. <br/><br/>This time the story follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the gang. Who are this time not being chased but being recruited by Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). To bring down international criminal Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) who is aided by once thought of dead Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez).<br/><br/>What is good about the film is Director's, Justin Lin's decision to keep the film in a action-oriented direction. With a slight nods to it's street racing past. But focusing on 80's big muscle, big explosions nostalgia. Also the continuing use of practical effects over CGI backgrounds and locations. Make the film look all the more impressive. The action is over the top and a little silly but i did very much enjoy it. The only poor bit being a moment where Vin Diesel's character saves someone life taking the ridiculousness a bit to far. <br/><br/>With the ever expanding cast the writers i imagine do have their work cut out for them. But everyone in the film except Jordana Brewster who again is given the short shrift do get their moments. But some of the comedy does miss it's mark, and the return of Letty is given the thinnest and quite unoriginal of explanations for her return. Also because of the huge cast of good guys, there is a lack of development for the villains. Making it difficult for Luke Evans who is actually very good in his role, to make a strong impression and did not become the threat to the team as much as he should of. <br/><br/>This is a fun film, so just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride and be prepared for a very decent post credit sequence hopefully setting up a possibly very exciting Fast 7."
"justtrolling","1","26","55","31 May 2013"," ""Seems legit.""
","After the trailer brought down my expectations for this movie, I reminded myself that this was just an action flick. However, after watching, I concluded that it even failed at being that; a myriad of idiotic, cliché, maddeningly impossible scenes followed, ruining immersion and causing me to think to myself, ""SEEMS LEGIT"". Let's go over some improbable, immersion ruining scenes, shall we?<br/><br/>-An incompetent police force that conveniently leaves a small gap while surrounding the garage of a criminal they are trying to catch -A thin, metal cable that can immediately stop a semi going at 70 MPH, and doesn't tear out of the wall/cut the semi in half -A tank that drives at 70 MPH on a highway -Said tank, that after crushing dozens of civilian cars, for some reason doesn't crush the car of one of the protagonists -A character that can jump across bridges, catch another character, land on a car, and be fine -A 30 mile plane runway -People who get hit by cars multiple times and get up <br/><br/>To be honest, I didn't pay much attention to this movie after a couple of these moments, so maybe there were explanations for some of these, but I don't really care. These moments broke immersion and ruined an otherwise okay action flick."

","I think it's getting better and better after 'Fast Five', since the introduction of Dwayne Johnson into the franchise. After stylish 'Tokyo Drift' I loved very much this and one before it from the series. There were not many movie series that pulled the franchise from average to awesome like this one did so the credit goes to the writers and director as well as the actors.<br/><br/>As expected finally the action babe arrived, Gina Carano. After seeing her in 'Haywire' I thought she would be next Lara Croft. I mean the next big action lady, the one after Angelina Jolie but not as I expected role though okay. There was a death of one of a main character in the movie, I kinda doubt that because of surprise re-entry of Michelle Rodriguez into the series.<br/><br/>It was a well written script, engaging characters except one scene where Dwayne Johnson and another actor who make a British man go stripped. The movie missed having some nice action sequences from the Dwayne Johnson a little let down from that perspective. But the rest of the stunts were breathtaking. Who cares whether it is graphic are real I just enjoyed especially the final one with the aircraft which long lasts for over 20 minutes. I guess there won't be that long runway anywhere in the world :p. The movie will be more enjoyable by hardcore action movie fans so why don't you try if you have not seen yet.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","During the opening credits there are flashbacks to previous films to jog your memory. These are not intended to bring anyone up to speed. There is some minor character build up in spite of the fact we already know who they are.<br/><br/>In this film Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) becomes involved with a group of bad guys lead by Shaw (Luke Evans). They are described as the best in ""vehicular warfare"" something that appears to be almost unique to this film series. In order to catch them, our ""swagger-less"" cop Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) must employ the use of wanted fugitive Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his team in order to save Europe or something else immaterial. They are up against a group of criminal described as their ""evil twins"" because apparently we couldn't figure that out for ourselves.<br/><br/>The film uses all the fun things we have grown use to in the series: impossible car chases/races, fist fighting, eye candy, tough guy talk, and of course the humorous banter and a disdain for physics in a fantastic climax scene.<br/><br/>In addition to all the features that appeal to muscle heads, the film also works upon the theme of the modern extended family. Because of societies' mobility and separation, many people have incorporated friends as part of their ""family."" This film stretches the honor among thieves into the brotherhood of man, but doesn't make it too sappy. A great addition to the series, one that opens up to sequel possibilities. If you own 5 of them. Make it a 6 pack.<br/><br/>My only criticism is that I would have liked to have seen a script with a larger role for Jordana Brewster.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: 1-2 f-bombs.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","2","2","15 April 2017"," A whole new stratosphere of action, ""F&F6"" will start to separate the junkies from those who need substance
","Bigger, faster, crazier — that's the motto of the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise six films in. If you thought the action, scale and stunts were off the charts in ""Fast Five,"" prepare to have your mind blown by ""Fast & Furious 6."" <br/><br/>The previous films were an acceleration, and the series hit full throttle with ""Fast Five."" The road was open and endless for Universal, and returning writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin. What they opt to do in ""F&F6"" is bend the limits of reality to their will. From the initial London chase to a highway tank sequence to the grand finale, which involves a massive cargo plane, this is an action movie jacked up on steroids. In fact, there are a couple references to Marvel ""Avengers"" characters — a not-so-subliminal suggestion that Universal would like you to think of Dominic Toretto's crew/family as a team of superheroes.<br/><br/>The trouble is for every ""wow!"" moment there are twice the number of ""what?"" moments. The action is so ludicrous that you lose all sense of what's happening. They're like little blackout moments as you drink more and more of the movie's high-octane Kool-Aid.<br/><br/>Morgan pulls together a perfectly viable plot. Dom's (Vin Diesel) presumed deceased former lover, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) has been spotted in association with a criminal mastermind named Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) whose ex-military crew is essentially the shadow image of our heroes. Dobbs (Dwayne Johnson) presents this info to Dom in hopes that it'll persuade Dom into doing him favor in taking Shaw down. It naturally works, and the crew must put a hiatus on their quiet life spending all the cash they stole in the last film; when the patriarch of the family calls, you answer.<br/><br/>The movie doubles down on the notion of the crew as family. Shaw is supposed to be the antithesis. He doesn't care about allegiances but about precision and planning. He's cold and calculated, whereas the ""family"" is warm and spontaneous. It's cliché, but at least time is spent on the characters. There is only one newbie in former MMA fighter Gina Carano as Hobbs' new right hand, meaning the character time is invested in the existing characters, which is good, though the script doesn't pierce beyond the surface traits we're already familiar with.<br/><br/>It also bears mentioning that at one point the script reveals a twist that's solely for the purpose of a twist. This ""surprise"" makes no sense and has no actual bearing on what happens in the film. Morgan wanted a surprise moment to keep things interesting and it's a nice moment — but then you realize it's actually meaningless and changes nothing. Another example of how flash without substance is the M.O. of this series. You have to like flash for the sake of flash to be a big fan.<br/><br/>Of course any scene in which an engine of any kind is not running only matters so much in these films, but ""Fast & Furious 6"" will start to really separate out the pure action junkies who've been hooked on this series from those who prefer some plausibility and gravity —literally and figuratively — in their blockbusters. Lin's sensibilities would probably be of more use in a sci-fi or fantasy movie where he could break all laws of common sense and completely get away with it. In this movie, depending on your taste, it will either get you stoked or spoil the moment.<br/><br/>One could argue that this franchise has found a niche in larger-than-life action movies — that there's a viable space for films that maintain the trappings of the real world but play by the rules of a superhero movie. That's fair, but in many ways by blowing the ceiling off what's possible, they've created another ceiling. If anything is possible, at some point we will no longer be surprised by the impossible. The films would be better served by maintaining some thread of connection to the laws of physics, then when they broke them a little, it would have a bigger impact. ""Fast Five"" did this well and it's a shame this movie takes such a tremendous leap in believability.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there's an undeniable adrenaline rush that comes with Lin's style of direction and the size and stature of the stunts and action sequences. It's three-fold true in this entry. That's the kind of thrill that maintains a sufficient baseline for enjoying these moves.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"CinemaClown","Null","2","2","4 September 2015"," Builds Upon The Winning Blockbuster Formula Of Fast Five.
","The sixth instalment in The Fast and the Furious franchise, Fast & Furious 6 follows into the footsteps of its predecessor and continues the series' new-found mantra of departing from its original street racing theme to move further into the heist thriller sub-genre. And even if it's not as refreshing & impressive as Fast Five, it nonetheless succeeds as another thrilling, ridiculously entertaining & undeniably fun extravaganza.<br/><br/>The story of Fast & Furious 6 concerns Dominic Toretto & his crew, all of whom have retired to a comfortable life following the heist they pulled off in the previous chapter yet they still remain wanted fugitives in their homeland. But when Hobbs asks for their services to take down a skilled mercenary organisation in exchange for clearing their criminal records, Dom accepts the deal and reassembles his team to finish one last job.<br/><br/>Directed by Justin Lin, Fast & Furious 6 is his final stint with this franchise and he decides to go out on a high note by delivering a picture that's far too enjoyable to worry about the laws of physics being bent here on few occasions. The screenplay packs in an interesting plot filled with excellent use of humour but it isn't as tightly gripped as the last instalment and is a slight step down in comparison. But a few elements do get an upgrade.<br/><br/>The technical aspects follow the same formula that was applied in Fast Five and there isn't much to complain here for the set pieces look spectacularly detailed, the action sequences benefit a lot from its energetic camera-work, brilliant editing & more use of practical effects just like the last chapter although at times the action goes way too over-the-top yet not so exaggerated for most viewers to suspend disbelief. And the background score is fitting for the most part.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the entire main cast that was present in the last one reprises its role, Michelle Rodrigues also returns to join the gang and Luke Evans is the new addition who plays this chapter's antagonist. Vin Diesel & Paul Walker do their usual best as Toretto & O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson continues to impress as Hobbs, However, Evans doesn't get enough screen time to show his mettle and his characters turns out to be a generic villain. The rest of the cast chips in with fine contributions.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Fast & Furious 6 builds upon the very ingredients that worked in favour of Fast Five and, barring a couple of issues, manages to stay on the track for the most part. Although not as amazing as the previous entry, this is nevertheless an immensely enjoyable blockbuster material that promises a lot of fun & thrills, and effectively delivers it. Definitely more style than substance although the margin isn't as vast as it had been in the first four chapters of this franchise, Fast & Furious 6 comes delightfully recommended."
"james1080-272-547223","9","11","20","14 May 2015"," Best In The Franchise
","It's so rare nowadays that sequels improve and franchises get better, well Fast & Furious shows us it's truth. This sixth addition lives up to it's speedy natured title yet again with furious action sequences that will excite audiences from the epic scale convoy heist to the knockout plane finale, it's all so over the top and that's exactly what you want. This addition spans the globe from the streets of London, the busy roads of Tenerife and back and forth from the USA. Justin Lin is the ultimate director for this franchise, he keeps every aspect sharp from the beautiful camera-work, the expertly crafted stunts to the fantastic character chemistry. The best thing about six is that it goes in a new direction, heading towards a more action drama, as the main focus is family, and the crew are closer than ever, and whenever a character is in peril you feel for them and you begin to hope everything turns out alright. The cast deliver fine performances, all of which are the best in the franchise, there's genuine chemistry and strong interaction, and when Mia is kidnapped you will gasp. Owen Shaw, played by Luke Evans, is hands down the best bad guy in the franchise, he's menacing, motivated and very sly and he aims at the protagonists weak spots, pushing their buttons resulting in fantastic face/offs. Gina Carano is back and better than ever, I last saw her in Haywire and she is still electrifying, super sexy and a spectacular fighter, the cat fights between her and Rodriguez are enough to stand up to the ground breaking force of the Rock and Vin Diesel. The story is tightly packed, the camera-work follows the pulse racing action and there are tonnes of shocks and twists, this is a top notch addition. Plus, the credits feature an epic-beyond-words cliffhanger that will leave you in awe, and ready for part seven."
"vishalsmail33","8","17","34","23 May 2013"," A spectacular action fest with emotional depth
","Get the wheels rolling and adrenaline pumping,Fast and Furious returns and the stakes are higher than ever.There is a new enemy named Shaw and he has gathered a formidable crew who are up to no good.They have already wrecked havoc in Moscow and now set their sights on a device that can cause a military catastrophe.When the going gets tough you need the tough to get you going.Who else to counter such an enemy than our very own fast and furious team.A top police officer Luke Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) approaches Dominic(Vin Diesel) to seek help.Dominic has retired and would normally deny but there is a twist.Letty(Michelle Rodrigues),Dominic's girlfriend who is believed to be dead has been spotted.Dominic agrees and recalls his team.What follows is a face off between the two teams.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of mindless action movies.Fortunately this is n't one.This is a very interesting plot with lots of emotional quotient in the movie and the concept of togetherness,camaraderie and standing up for family is touched frequently.In fact more so here than any of the previous movies which was something i enjoyed.The wisecracks are awesome and the dialog in general brilliant.Dwayne Johnson is becoming a better actor and the tough cop role suits him .Vin Diesel and Paul Walker were amazing.For me Michelle Rodrigues as Letty walks away with the crown.Tough,Sexy and conflicted,she delivers a great performance.The rest of the cast does well too.Always good to see the banter between Roman(Tyrese Gibson) and Tej(Ludicrous).The score keeps you interested.The action is just superb.I wont give anything away but the kind of stuff the team pulls off will blow your mind.<br/><br/>Overall Fast and Furious Six is a fiery action ride but is a movie with an emotional soul to it!"
"vardown","1","18","37","9 July 2013"," terrible
","I cannot believe that someone can give this movie 5 or more stars and says it is great. Ha, ha. I give it 2 stars, but I rate it 1 to counter balance the other overrated reviews. Basically terrible script and terrible story. Acting is a joke. Let's see one example. Terrorists want to grab a computer chip from the military base but soldiers instead of protecting it in the base send it out somewhere. Very stupid idea generally since military base is a fortress. But OK, let's pretend that this is some kind of protocol. So what does this convoy have? One truck and two jeeps. Really??? Come one, the whole movie is like that. One big joke. Scenery looks good however, but that is not enough to give it more that 3 stars."

I'm a huge fan of this franchise and the way it keeps you guessing time after time. Vin Diesel plays this character to a T and has since the beginning , Michele Rodriguez is absolutely brilliant in this film she is as good as it gets when it comes to female action hero's and shows it off several times in this film.

","Im giving this one 9 out of 10! Why, you ask?<br/><br/>The Fast and the furious franchise are well-known for their amazing action sequences. Not for their average script or kind-of-okay acting. THEY GIVE WHAT THEY PROMISE YOU!<br/><br/>The Acting: It was okay! They really didn't need to express many emotions, besides Angry, happy, sad and... ready-to-race-ish. The actors did their job well enough. 7/10 for the acting<br/><br/>The story/script: The story didn't have many layers. There are some plot twists you might not expect. But you don't expect them because you probably don't care enough about the characters involved in the twists. 7/10 for the story. They did tie up the third and the fourth to this one, which I think was a pleasant surprise though.<br/><br/>The scenery: They chose some amazing places to shot at! London, Spain, a little bit of their old house back in the USA. The movie was very well filmed! 9/10<br/><br/>The action sequences: Wow! Amazing! The list of actors contained THE ROCK, Vin freaking diesel, but you won't find ""Mr. Gravity"" in there! They were great shot, amazing performed and the CGI was very well used. I could not have wished for better action scenes! 10/10 for sure!#tank #plane #therock #awesome<br/><br/>Comedy: Their was some comedic relief and It actually didn't feel forced at all. It worked very well!<br/><br/>In general: This movie delivers exactly what you're hoping for! I would pay to see it again on the big screen! 9/10 FOR SURE! Go see it as Fast as you can!<br/><br/>P.s.: Wait till the post credit scene! It will satisfy the fans and excite the audience in general!"
"nicperreau1710","4","11","21","26 May 2013"," Last third of the movie went from bad to worse.
","As a motorsports fan, the fast and furious franchise has always been on my watch list. The cars, the intense actions always kept me at the edge of my seat. There were only 2 out of the previous 5 that I did not like which was 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift. Why? 2 Fast 2 Furious was plain, boring and too predictable of a story line. Tokyo drift wasn't too bad but I did not like the sudden absents of characters as I loved the casting in the first movie. The 4th installment got better and the 5th installment was even better which is very rare to find in such franchise movies. Hence, I went to the cinema the day it was released. By the end of the movie, I was cringing and ultimately disappointed with so many of the scenes that they did. As a motorsports fan, you tend to know what is possible and what isn't with cars, and you know specification of car models and their abilities, but with Fast and Furious you tend to let it slide because, well, it is after all a movie. <br/><br/>The starting of the movie, was good. I got more eager to watch what happens next. The bad parts of the movie started with a tank convoy. In the beginning Shaw and his team heist a military convoy so dramatically and when it came to protecting a piece of chip worth billions after knowing that Shaw was after it, the convoy was a simple 2 jeeps and a truck containing a military tank with the chip inside. Shaw then effortlessly manages to get into the tank and drive it out of the truck.. which was still to me, acceptable. Then, Dom saves Letty by performing a physically impossible stunt by jumping over the highway and landing on a car to break their very dramatic fall. That was the start of many crap scenes to come. It then got worse to the point where I almost left the cinema. <br/><br/>The ending scene is always the climax and and the most action. In this one, it involved a Russian cargo plane with a few cars that manage to keep up with the plane that landed and was going to take off again on what seemed like an endless runway... <br/><br/>It was as if a 10 year old boy directed the last third of the movie and it was horrible. I wonder if this could be the end of a good long streak of the franchise."
"dparan","1","19","41","12 June 2013"," Whatever active brain cells I had left is now ... blip
","I must get my head checked to have paid money to watch this film. I am extremely disappointed with myself, actually really disappointed with myself for contributing to the 588 million that this film has made. I was happy when I contributed to films like The Reluctant Fundamentalist and Dead Man Down, but Fast & Furious 6? Oh Man.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are the laziest actors on set. It seemed so obvious that they are extremely tired of this franchise and just want out. Vinny and Paulie simply couldn't be bothered with his lines and even mustering up enough energy to make the scenes believable. Vinny says, ""...make sure they're fast."" Who wrote this stuff?<br/><br/>That anorexic chick, Gisele and her affair with Han, oh it was painful to watch. How he kept saving her and that loving look in her eyes every time he would swoop in and carry her to safety. I think that was even more staged and manufactured than Vinnie's romantic scene with Michelle's character, Letty. Michelle Rodriguez is a good actress that has been pigeon holed as a tough chick. Maybe she's happy with it, I don't know. But come on, Vinnie, learn to act again, please. You kinda owe it to people who pay money to watch you, ya know.<br/><br/>At the start of the film, like 2 minutes in, I was actually interested because there's been this robbery and the people responsible made sure they destroyed half the block before they left. They meant business and Luke Hobbs desperately wants to track them down. Ah, mystery, investigation ... and it dies there. The remaining minutes were a series of lame scenes, unbelievable settings, poor character motivations, a clumsy black dude, the sound of car engines, the sound of car engines and the sound of car engines. 30 minutes in, I was wishing for the villain, Shaw to drop everybody and be done with it. I was wishing for Shaw to succeed in stealing that freaking microchip. Of course, when he started driving that tank, I knew he would fail very predictably. I think the writer Chris Morgan practiced screen writing working on the Ultraman franchise. At least I like watching Ultraman."
"killferd","10","7","12","21 September 2013"," Just one word, Breathless!
","This is ""THE"" Movie. I am a big fan of the franchise and hence also the biggest critic of the series.<br/><br/>Let me explain, what i meant by saying that it is ""The"" movie, was that this titles redeems all the shortcomings and complains i had from previous titles.From the beginning to the end i was drawn into the universe of ""Dom Toretto"". As the story progressed i was completely mesmerised by the characters and the scenes. <br/><br/>Justin Lin is my new hero he made me remember what was it like watching John woo in my teens. Thank You. For making me remember what it felt like, to be the Kid in the movie ""Last Action Hero"".<br/><br/>The magic of Hollywood truly shines in this title, there is a trend of CGI (computer generated graphic's)dominating the movies in some titles, this one particularly justifies each and every one of them without making you feel that the CGI was intended to carry the movie. Even with all the action, the undercurrent of ""emotion"" is what i truly enjoyed, the way Dom feels about the Family, or how the equation between him and Hobb's has evolved over time, was simply brilliantly showcased. It was like in the 2002 movie ""Big Fat Liar"" the climax had a dialogue by actor John Cho, ""I told you Marty,the only way to shoot this scene was from seven different angles, on the rooftop"". And it applies truly to this whole epic. From Dwayne Johnson to all the cast this was one brilliant performance. the score in itself was subtly and yet in a adrenaline rising way suited the movie in true spirit without overshadowing the scenes themselves, it never felt out of place rather it enhanced the whole experience to a whole new level. And this something coming from a guy who loves blues over heavy metal.<br/><br/>Watch this without any disturbance, or better put; causing hindrance to this movie's showcase should be made an criminal offence."

Seeing Jason Statham at the end was a great surprise too. I'm hoping the next movie will have a great chase scene. This is one of few franchises were you don't want any of the characters to die, I like all of them, especially Han, he was one cool cat. keep the films coming guys, Vin you are a smart business man I tell ya, put me in a film too.....how about an audition for a new character on the team, who is longing to be part of a family, I do my own stunts to."

","Literally the worst film I have ever seen, maybe barring Knight & Day. The ""action"" is ridiculously overdone and cringeworthy at times. Especially when Vin Diesel jumps 20 feet through the air to catch a person while being shot at by a tank, over a bridge, tackles her mid air and lands on a car. Many other moments in this film that had me laughing about how bad and ridiculous it actually was. Once more, the worst film I have ever seen. Although it is so bad, it's comical. Mindless entertainment. Would not recommend it to anyone, unless I know that they enjoy moronic films. I really cannot believe the reviews of this film have been as good as they are, absolutely ridiculous. Considering the Rock was a professional wrestler, he is probably the best actor in it and Jason Statham coming into it makes me want to never go to the cinema again, another awful over rated actor who optimises moronic films."

While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series.The cast seems to sleepwalk through the production with only the occasional chase or explosion or plane crash to jar the audience out of its stupor. And speaking of aeroplanes, the concluding sequence - which features a Russian cargo jet lumbering for takeoff with cars and the entire cast either hanging from it or chasing it - goes on so long the runway has to be at least 50 miles long.

With the classic car chases, incredible action sequences, and explosive ending there was more than enough entertainment to sate even the most ardent movie goer. The quality and quantity covered within the movie revealed rekindled relationships, further deepened intimacies, and unexpected deaths. The movie managed to keep the franchise on track in terms of both accuracy and success. This movie was a splendid creation that is a true testament to the art of mobile action. The one anachronism that I noticed, but not pinpointed by How It Should of Ended, was the scene in the preliminary car chase where the bad guys simply fired gadgets onto their pursuers' cars, which in effect, detonated a blow out of one of the car's tires. The question, why not replace this gun with a more powerful explosive. Just something to think about."

","Fast and Furious won't let you down. Even it is a 6th installment on this series it still rocks. Movie is turbo loaded popcorn entertainmet loaded with testosteroine and smell of gas. The story isn't the brightest, but that can easilly forgive because this movie is exactly what you are waiting for. Movie is full of great action scenes which are so exaggeration that you can only laugh for them. Thankfully movie doesn't take itself too seriously, you understand that at the latest when Dwayne Johnson is to be called as a sumerian Thor. With the previous movie I was hoping that next movie get it's bad guy from Jason Statham. It didn't became truth in this movie, but the end scene promises that Jason Statham will be the bad guy in next installment. Can't wait to see that. Leave your brains to cloakroom and enjoy great entertainment."
"paul_haakonsen","6","17","37","1 September 2013"," Indeed a guy's movie...
","The faster the cars in this franchise seem to go, the more realism seems to go away with it. Sure, the action and car chases in ""Fast & Furious 6"" is breathtaking and spectacular, but the movie was just a tad over the top.<br/><br/>I sat down to watch ""Fast & Furious 6"" simply because I had the opportunity, and because I wanted to watch it because of Michelle Rodriguez. I can't say that I had any particular hopes or expectations to this movie, nor can I claim that it was a movie release that I was in any way looking forward to.<br/><br/>If you have seen any of the previous five movies then you know exactly what you will get here. There is nothing much new to be had here, it is essentially the same. However, that being said, then the movie is enjoyable, entertaining and fast-paced.<br/><br/>This sixth installment to the franchise brings the return of an assumed dead member of the Toretto 'family' and it also brings the departure of one. The returning member is, of course, Letty. I am not going to reveal who will be departing - you'll just have to watch the movie for yourself and find out.<br/><br/>As entertaining as the action was in the movie, then the last whole segment was a bit too much. I mean, a car bring down a massive Russian cargo airplane? That was just too much. And how long does it take for a plane of that size to get enough speed to become airborne? It just took forever. And speaking of forever, then that tarmac runway had to be the longest in the world - it just went on and on.<br/><br/>As with the previous movies, then it is a great ensemble of actors and actresses, and it is as always a joy to have them returning to their parts, and there is a great chemistry between the various characters. I was especially thrilled to see Joe Taslim (playing Jah) in the movie; he did a great job in ""The Raid: Redemption"" and its great to see him make it into American cinema as well. He is definitely a guy to keep an eye on in the future.<br/><br/>""Fast & Furious 6"" is, as the previous five movies, a guy's movie - full of adrenaline, muscle cars, car chases, macho guys and testosterone dripping off everywhere. The story was enjoyable, even with the part that went off the scale. And if you enjoyed any of the previous movies, then you definitely want to watch ""Fast & Furious 6"" as well."

With the help of Hobbs, Brian, and the rest of the crew, Dom is forced to track down Shawn (Evans) to not only get the love of his life back, but a full pardon as well. <br/><br/>I'll be honest! I questioned why they decided to make a sixth film. After a fantastic fifth movie, I didn't think there was much left to do. I'm happy to say they proved me wrong in a big way. If you thought the action was insane in the first one, you haven't seen anything yet! The stunts in this one make some of the action scenes in Fast Five look like child's play! Fast Five had enthralling action, but this one manages to outdo it. As crazy as it may sound, it's almost a little TOO much at times! Don't get me wrong! I had a blast with this movie, just had a penchant to go a tad overboard with it. It doesn't give you many chances to breathe, keeping the pedal to the medal at all times! Shootouts, car chases, hand to hand combat, and much more! It throws in everything but the kitchen sink. That being said, some of the action is borderline OTT! Some of the stuff they evade was highly unrealistic (Especially Dom! He looked like Superman on a couple of occasions), but I had a lot of fun with it anyway. I think the fifth movie is a bit better than this one, but I would say this movie is darker than the previous installment. There is more on the line in this one. There isn't a ton of violence; didn't need it! You don't need buckets of blood to make effective fights & action! This series proves it. I also liked how they referenced some of the other movies in this series! They clearly cared about their fan base. The performances are what you would expect! Vin Diesel is as cool as ever! He had more to play with in this one, and I thought he did fairly well with the emotional stuff. I still think Riddick is a cooler character, but I've always enjoyed him as Toretto. Paul Walker takes a bit of a step back in this one. His role is still prominent, but not as much as Vin's. He did very well with what he had to do. It was cool to see him as a Father. Dwayne Johnson is the ultimate bad-ass. He steals many scene's he's in with his gruff persona. I couldn't help but grin when he was on-screen! I'm very happy they made him a regular character in this series. Michelle Rodriguez makes her return to the franchise after being ""Killed off"" (In reality she had to spend some time in Jail) I thought she performed adequately for the most part. She had some memorable scenes. Her chemistry with Vin was decent. I'm sure die-hard's will appreciate the storyline between them. Jordana Brewster doesn't have very much to do until the finale. Gina Carano isn't much of an actress, but boy can she scrap! Her scrap with Rodriguez at a subway station was magnificent! I didn't get the pointless twist that came out of left field with her character! It made no sense. Luke Evans is a bit of a bland villain, but it didn't matter in the scheme of things. Jason Statham makes a brief cameo at the end to set up his role for the sequel. Gibson, Kang, the rest of the cast do fine. I was impressed how they spread the screen time out to everyone. <br/><br/>How do they outdo this one? I didn't even think they could outdo the fifth one! The fifth movie is a better movie overall, but this sequel is pretty awesome as well. I recommend that you to forget about the plot, just have fun! There is way too much action to even notice that sort of thing. I'm not sure how I feel about the upcoming sequel considering Paul Walker's tragic death, but I'm looking forward to it nonetheless! If you want insane action and you're a fan of this series, look no further than this one<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"coolking411","9","5","8","6 March 2014"," The best one so far
","While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series. Once a franchise about car racing, ""Fast Five"" took an unexpected turn as a bank heist thriller in the vein of Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's 11,"" a welcomed change as seen by its huge box office earnings and critical success. Now, ""Furious 6"" is neither about car racing nor bank heists, but rather a terrorist threat with obvious inspirations from ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Batman Begin."" Also including ""Fast Five,"" the results are immensely satisfying entertaining.<br/><br/>The key to the franchise's upward turn in quality is due to director Justin Lin. He is a skilled action director, and many filmmakers can learn a few things or two from him: The action sequences are impressive, engaging, comprehensible, and well-shot, with practical effects to boot. There is a sense of danger, verve, and life in these scenes are rarely found in other films. While I usually don't react out loudly when watching a film, this film had me at moments when I was gasping, jaw dropping, laughing, and applauding, or all of them at once <br/><br/>Another ingredient to the film's success is the chemistry between the movie's cast members. In particular, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have such a terrific rapport with each other that they provide some of the film's biggest laughs and memorable one-liners. Additionally, Luke Evans is definitely a step up above the previous film's antagonist, and Gina Carano provides some great action packed moments, although not much performance-wise. As for the story, it's nothing special, but I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed. .<br/><br/>If there's one thing to learn about this franchise, it's that some change can be a good thing. While the later sequels do focus away from the car racing, they still featured cars, which helped retain old fans while bringing in new ones. ""Furious 6"" is terrific entertainment, and judging by yet another dazzling cliffhanger and the audience's reaction, ""Fast & Furious 7"" will be an amazing finale for the series. Unfortunately, Justin Lin will not be back for the last installment. But I kid you not, this series needs him to make another installment. So far, this has been one of the best movies in the franchise with a very well thought out plot, jaw dropping moments, intense car chases, and suspense full moments that make you want more."

","Furious 6. Made on a story that can be detailed in single line ""Hobbs has Dom and Brian reassemble their crew in order to take down a mastermind who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries."" Furious 6 is a mad enjoyable watch or some sort of guilty pleasure. Lack of a thrilling storyline is covered by grand canvas, ruthless action, races and chases, peppy background score, man on man fights, woman on woman fights, cars against tanks and even planes. Some action scenes go over the top and you need to avoid applying logic every now and then to enjoy the sequences. All actors play their part OK and their conversations are mostly laced with delicious one liners. So, Furious 6 delivers what it promises, fasten your seat belts and enjoy the ride."

","This movie must be one of the most brainless movies I ever saw in cinemas, along with the expendables that is. However it was just so much fun.<br/><br/>What makes the Fast and the Furious so great is without a doubt the incredible team that is behind this series. It must be said there isn't much of a story in this installment of the series. However after having seen five brainless fast and the furious movies one does not expect a strong storyline. The really lovely thing about this movie is that the viewer really can see how the actors actually must have had a great time shooting this film. As in the previous movie there is a great cooperation between Vin Diesel and The Rock, now teaming up in one of the greatest bad-ass end battles in movie history.<br/><br/>But also the character of Roman gives an extremely witty feeling to this movie. As said it is not the immense stunts, the incredible special effects or the beautiful soundtrack that makes this movie, it is simply the great acting team behind this movie that makes it so entertaining.<br/><br/>A must see for every fan of action, comedy and just pure entertainment."
"lesolonkah","8","5","8","17 January 2014"," Occupy that room for improvement!!
","Based on the amount of running time I think the plot was well executed. Apart from a few goofs here and there I think the car chases were superb. Also the character would need to get facts right on cars especially the V12 American muscle! Most of the scenes repeat in terms of cars on the road which are seen on multiple scenes. The introduction of newer cars is also superb typically the Nissan Skyline driven by the Late Paul Walker. I think Hobbs role has also been well done. Many factual errors occur especially in the last bit of the tank scene and the chain that hangs on the bridge together with reality versus action. The Antonov also takes too long to lift thus causing an unrealistic situation concerning runway length. Its a great title but not necessarily for anyone obsessed with facts rather than fiction mostly on the last quarter. We would also have loved it better in 3D the 3rd dimension of things would bring a bit more realism and adrenalin. All the same I think that was nearly excellent. Good Work!!"
"ty-jensen","8","5","8","23 December 2013"," Good but not the best
","We're at the sixth movie of the high speed franchise. Dom and his gang are recruited to capture mercenaries who want to create a weapon that will destroy the world. <br/><br/>I might as well tell you guys how I feel about the other movies. The first one is good, I know it's a Point Break rip off but it still feels different kinda like Home Alone 2. The second one is good or decent, not bad, I can write one or two paragraphs on this but I won't bother. The third one is decent for sure and it's the worst. It's a spin off, not exactly a sequel and it easily could have a straight to DVD movie. I allowed myself to see it three times and I won't watch it again. The fourth one is good and it's the first true sequel because Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are in it, not just one of them. The fifth one is the best, it's a heist movie and Dwayne Johnson's character Luke Hobbs is introduced. <br/><br/>Back to Fast Six, it's bigger than the previous movie but not better. The plot is thin, it's bloated and Hobbs is no longer an antagonist. Before the premise was announced, I thought Hobbs would still be chasing Dom and his gang and maybe they would be forced to work together again. Hobbs is still interesting, he doesn't have any boring conversations with Dom but their previous relationship was better. Who knows, maybe they will become antagonists later on. <br/><br/>The action is good and yeah it's ridiculous. Dom is like a superhero and the Iron Giant just popped into my head. There's no shaky cam bullshit and there a lack of CGI. The villain is insane mercenary Owen Shaw played by Luke Evans. He is cliché but still threatening. He doesn't say why he wants to destroy the world, maybe he feels some destruction will help improve the world later on. Unlike the last villain, he doesn't sit around doing paperwork, he drives around and hurts a few people. He smiles during the tank scene which shows he's sadistic. <br/><br/>This movie is lighthearted, it's not gritty like Fast Four or the Dark Knight trilogy or the upcoming Need For Speed movie which I'm looking forward to. There are some jokes and most of them work. I didn't write this review earlier because I didn't feel like writing any reviews and I recently decided I should write some reviews because I enjoy writing. <br/><br/>Fast Seven will be coming out on April 2015 and only time will tell if Brian will get killed off. James Wan is the director, Justin Lin dropped out because he naturally wants to do other movies. I read James wants the action to be more realistic and I like that idea. I also like Jason Statham who is playing the villain and I read he doesn't want to destroy the world. Okay I'm done yapping."

","Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) are asked by Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to stop Shaw (Luke Evans) the leader of a criminal crew of skilled mercenary drivers who are acquiring parts to build a powerful gun to be sold to terrorists. Shaw needs one last chip to complete the gun. If successful Dom's crew will get a full pardon from their illegal exploits during Fast and Furious 5. <br/><br/>I was told that F&F 6 was the best one of all the sequels, And, after seeing this I believe they are correct. Of course it was all the vehicle chases that made it for me. What I saw was almost unbelievable. I don't know how much CGI was in evidence, but I do know that over 70 stunt men were used (I counted them in the credits) so I would venture to say these stunts with vehicles were fantastic.<br/><br/>You will see some things that you will have you saying, ""that's impossible."" Maybe so, but this is excellent entertainment. Suspend logic and enjoy yourself. The photography and editing were incredible to say the least. As you watch you may have wished your couch came with seat belts. Kudos all around. <br/><br/>You go to these kinds of movies to see the vehicle chases, not for the acting which was okay for this is type of movie. For the most part , there is not a lot of dialogue in here. Oh, and for your viewing pleasure the director saw fit to throw in an Army tank and a big cargo plane. Wait until you see how they are used. Wow! This just gets better and better. So if you like car chases with vehicles and people flying thru the air, and explosions this is for you. Hey, I was entertained. <br/><br/>Yes, there is a story here too, but it plays second fiddle and there is a twist you may not see coming. Also, Dom finds out that his former love interest, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), is alive and working for Shaw (Say What???). How can this be? Dom needs to find out. <br/><br/>Oh, when it's all over keep your seat belt on because after many of the credits run, you will see that F&F 7 is in the works and you won't believe who will be in it. Stay tuned. (8/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No. I don't recall any."

","Mixed emotions his the viewer seeing FAST AND FURIOUS 6 for the first time knowing that Paul Walker is gone and wondering what will happen with the in process Fast and Furious 7. But in ways that fact makes this movie more treasured. It is a whoop-'em up fast action packed film that takes your breath away with the wild car chases and one the ground derring- do. Writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin have this medium down to a predictable but fine science.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple (as usual) allowing the telling of the story to be more important than any big philosophical notions. Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson, with even larger biceps varices!) has Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) reassemble their crew (Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang) in order to take down mastermind Shaw (Luke Evans) who commands an organization of mercenary drivers across 12 countries. Payment? Full pardons for them all. The big driver is to 'rescue' Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who seems to be with Shaw's group after suffering amnesia, back into their fold. Wild situations abound and they are as exciting as ever – if not more so!<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching even for those who are not long term F & F fans. It is a terrific action film with sparkling actors having a great time. Grady Harp December 13"

They were entertaining... <br/><br/>Fast 6, though, really does take it to a whole new level. The action and stunt choreography were incredible, the twist of who the mole was in Hobbes' team was a legit surprise, and Giselle's death really caught me off-guard and struck me emotionally. <br/><br/>You knew Han had to die eventually (he had become my favourite character in the 3 films), and i think i might actually go back to watch Tokyo Drift just to see the end of his character properly. <br/><br/>This was a really good movie.

","I was actually looking forward to this, right up until the point i actually watched it. I always believed that the object of a film should be to immerse the audience and suspend disbelief, and while the former was possible the latter never happened. Let's leave aside the obvious issue with any law enforcement agency of any type based within the countries known as the ""5 eyes"" requiring a group of retired criminals to work on their behalf. It would never happen. Lets also ignore the obvious problem within the plot regarding surveillance cameras in London, the most ""watched"" city in the world being conveniently ""down for maintenance"". As there are multiple agencies controlling multiple cameras in that country there is no chance that all those agencies would be offline at the same time. ""Brian"" managing to spend less than 24 hours in a California maximum security prison, ""as a favour"", after flying there and back seemingly in a couple of days and securing all the information he needed. Anyone who is even remotely aware of the American justice system would find that laughable. The plane chase along a runway that must have been at least 20 miles long for the amount of time it took the C5 Galaxy/ Illyshin IL76 (take your pick of heavy lift aircraft) to not quite take off, making it the longest non existent runway in the world. Street racing in central London lets ignore the fact that this scene had no reason to be in the film at all for a moment, except as justification for the title. It's Impossible! Flat out impossible with traffic calming measures, and some of the most crowded and narrow streets in the world, not to mention enormous police presence. Let's not even discuss the tank! So a film with a very lose series of sequences, based basically in London, i guess because the film grants went that way, because there is no reason any international criminal on every law enforcement radar in the western world would base himself in that city, dialogue that was so poor and so clichéd that it is worth watching only with the sound turned off, and a plot that has absolutely zero possibility of ever being believable and you have this film in a nutshell. Let's hope they give the next part of the franchise to some adults for script writing, because while the 13 year old's had a ball bringing this one to the screen, it can surely only appeal to those with a similar mindset.

","The Fast and the Furious franchise has never been known for an engrossing story. No one goes to the movies to see character development and a complicated storyline. They go for the cars, the girls, and the explosions, and this installment has all of the above, including a fair story.<br/><br/>A ghost from Dom's past, Letty, has come back from the dead, and Dom reunites the team from Fast Five (a team that works on all levels) in order to get her back. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson provide some of the humor of the film, with their bantering back and forth throughout, but I found that the theater I was in laughed and cheered throughout the course of the movie. The action is good, and never lets up. For a film that is over two hours, I found myself only checking the time when I thought the finale was happening (to see how long it would be).<br/><br/>What you want in this film is something as good as Fast Five. Something original and fresh. What you get is something that improves on Fast Five (and the rest of the series) on all levels. This is by far the best Fast and Furious movie ever, and it really shows how a series like this can turn around from something as bad as Tokyo Drift.<br/><br/>And it has a nice set up for Fast & Furious 7 during the credits, where we get a little surprise for the villain of the next film.<br/><br/>Bravo, this film is awesome, and should be viewed by fans of both the series and of action movies in general.<br/><br/>8/10"

","""The Rock"" is not the only one who got bigger. The whole movie goes to a massive level never before seen in the franchise. <br/><br/>The creators of this franchise must ask themselves with each movie: How do we make this bigger? Because is getting ridiculous how massive are the racing scenes on Furious 6 (yes, that's the title showed in the intro). Well, there are not exactly racing scenes on this one (safe for one), it their place the writer puts a lot of car chasing scenes. There are so much persecution scenes on this movie that every character suffers at least one big accident in which, of course, none of them gets hurt. Everyone survives accidents that could finish with all the nine lives of a cat, without a single scratch. Between that and sort scene on a bridge involving certain characters flying on the air, the phrase ""Oh common!"" is useless in this one. <br/><br/>That said, it is clear that we are not talking about an Academy Award Winner movie. We are talking about the Die Hard of racing cars. All the car sequences are great, full with action and emotion. Every single fan is going to be pleased at the end of the film. <br/><br/>The story is very simple. There is a bad guy. Letty is working with him. The crew must bring Letty back home. The truth is that it works. The focus point of the film is to discover how she survives and why she didn't came back home. At least I can say that they came up with a good explanation of how that happens. But it must be clear that everything here has been made to please the fans. In other words, there are some decisions made in this film that if you think about it you will probably be disappointed. So is better if you just enjoy the ride and don't think about it too much. <br/><br/>The theme is the family. That's actually how (finally) the cast is feeling. On Fast Five there are characters knowing each other, but in this one everybody knows everybody. So they're one big family in the film and it is perceive as if they have become one big family outside the set. Even Hobbs feels like part of the family, even being a cop. The new guy is the villain, Sebastian Shaw (Luke Evans). He did a fine job and maybe that's because he is a good actor or because at last we have a bad guy who isn't a drug dealer. Shaw is more like a terrorist, so he is more memorable than the others. <br/><br/>Universal Pictures has confirmed the seventh film for July 2014 release date. That means that, even when we got a close ending, if you stay 10 more seconds you will witness an extra scene. In that scene we close one character gap (sadly but at last), and we're introduced the new bad guy. And he makes an impression on both, ladies and men. With that scene the producers make a statement: Fast & Furious 7 will be bigger than this."

Once these people start talking to each other you get the feeling they're on a special quest, it makes you want jump on the big screen with them and roll with some big time crowd, maybe even be like Vin diesel, driving fast cars and picking up shotguns from stores. 'The Rock' showed up in every scene of this movie like a boy scout, always keeping tings shipshape. When the rock caught wind of the tank chase he immediately ordered someone to get him a chopper so he could fly there. The tank chase featured characters like Ortiz, Vin diesel, Kelly, and Paul walker being consumed by a supreme whirlwind of drama. But The rock accidentally showed up at the end of the chase.

","By now the Fast & Furious franchise was made in the eyes of Hollywood, following a massive box office haul for Fast Five, the picture that saw Justin Lin begin the transition from street racing car movie series to explosive action heist franchise, a transformation so many other series' would never be able to pull off five movies in. This one did and, remarkably, the films began to improve in quality - in that regard, Fast & Furious 6--arguably the most bonkers and joyously fun outing for the franchise to date--is the pinnacle of a series seemingly immune to the law of diminishing returns, where Vin Diesel, the late Paul Walker and their crew only seem to become more likable, more charming and more watchable as the franchise grows more confident, more explosive and more wonderfully insane by each film. This is the one where Lin, right from the off, lets everything off the chain - you'll be hard pushed to find anything made for the last few decades that's as gleefully, knowingly dumb, fun and exciting as Fast & Furious 6. For that, it's almost entirely a joy.<br/><br/>What was originally known as Fast Six (a better title, arguably) was pre- visualised and written by Lin and series' writer Chris Morgan almost in tandem with the previous picture, hence that movie's post-credits reveal that Michelle Rodriguez's Letty was alive and well, and indeed seemingly had taken a dark turn, after apparently being blown to smithereens two films ago. Her reappearance sparks Diesel's gruffalo Dominic Toretto and his crew--now all freshly minted millionaires after their Rio heist in the last film--to this time team up with The Rock's badass DEA agent Hobbs in tracking down & bringing to heel the terrorist who seemingly has her captive - Luke Evans in full smarm mode as callous Brit-baddie Owen Shaw. Much like Joaquín de Almeida's limp drug baron in Fast Five, he's the villainous weak link here; Lin never much bothers to make him all that menacing and up against beasts of men like Diesel & The Rock, you need a strong villain. No matter because the picture has its eyes elsewhere - yes admittedly the attempts at injecting drama as Diesel monosyllabically tries to protect his 'family', but at the same time the humour and charm is plentiful amongst an ensemble who are very at ease with one another, nobody showboating to gain the limelight but all getting their moments in the spotlight. But forget all that, there's stuff that needs exploding and boy does Lin have fun there - be it a thrilling chase through London in souped up formula one heist cars, a truly insane freeway chase involving a runaway tank and an even more bonkers climactic plane sequence with the longest runway in movie history (honestly, it must be ten miles long!) and a series of fights that culminate in Diesel, literally, executing a flying headbutt. My girlfriend, a huge fan of Diesel and the franchise, admitted she didn't know whether to laugh or cheer. The simple solution is you do both, and Lin actively encourages it.<br/><br/>While the end seems to resolve proceedings in a barbecue tinted bow, Fast & Furious 6 then unleashes a wonderful stinger of a post-credits sequence that not only resolve a bizarre continuity niggle (which has basically meant films four, five & six are effectively set before three weirdly) but tees up a thrilling and very recognisable menace for the next picture, which could possibly send a franchise already soaring with gleefully nonsensical and thoroughly enjoyable bravado into the stratosphere. The way it's heading, we are surely destined Fast & Furious 10 to see a geriatric Diesel & The Rock battling alien invaders orbiting the Earth. We can only hope."
"Hollywood_Yoda","9","4","6","6 February 2015"," Number 6 is a Winner
","You probably think most reviewers gave this film high marks because of Paul Walker's sudden death soon after it's release, but that is not the case, it is a great film. Maybe not as good as Fast Five, but number six does have a good story.<br/><br/>However, it is unfortunate that Paul Walker died so suddenly, because the future of the franchise will ultimately be different. It really won't be the same. Especially since his character is explored so much in this film, becoming a father and having a family. I won't go too far into that though.<br/><br/>The cliffhanger ending makes you really want to see number seven, as it is the penultimate film in the series, revolving around story-lines that also include those in Tokyo Drift. Like what happened to Han? And what will become of Dom and Brian? Guess we will see the answers to those questions on April 3, 2015. See you there."
"CMTiago","8","4","6","31 May 2014"," The Fast and Furious franchise gets even bigger
","Just when you think this series can't get any better, they blow your expectations away and deliver another entertaining ride. After getting back on track with the 4th, and stepping their game even further with the 5th, Furious 6 will reach new heights which may be impossible to reach. Following the events of the last movie, Dom and his crew have settled down and are living the life thanks to their successful heist in Brazil. But when Special Agent Hobbs approaches Dom with photos of Letty, Dom's former girlfriend thought dead, the crew get back together to earn their pardons and return home to the US. They will have to face off against Owen Shaw, a ruthless criminal who now has an Letty at his disposal, since she doesn't remember Dom. From the moment the plot is set, the action kicks in and it almost doesn't stop. In between the action less parts, some humor will kick in as well as the genuine drama felt by the characters. As I grow older, I begin to appreciate some finer works of cinema, yet my youthful spirit still has me searching for the right kind of blockbuster, and once again I hit gold with this one. So as far as the aspects of the filmmaking process, aside from the action sequences there isn't anything totally worthy of an applause. But with crazy stunts, characters with the cool factor and insanely fast cars, what more can I ask for. As a fan I can't wait for 2015 to come so I can watch the next film, and in this case, give a memorable farewell to Paul Walker, an eternal member of the FnF family.<br/><br/>Rating: 9,5/10"
"jackmeat","8","4","6","28 May 2013"," Easily worth the price of admission
","Movie review:When I saw the first Fast and Furious, I very much enjoyed it for what it was. Racing action. That was it, no plot needed, although they put a cop in, blah blah. Well, the evolution of the Fast and Furious universe has changed dramatically.If you haven't seen the previous 5, it's OK, you will only miss out on some inside jokes, and character traits. The change it took was going from street racing to pro street racers performing high end heists (this occurred in the fifth installment) and now in 6 we have the culmination of all the characters that have appeared in the 5 others back for one last (?) big job. So, the crew is re-assembled by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, this time not for cash, but to stop a terrorist attack. This includes (not limited to) O'Connor (Paul Walker) and Toretto(Vin Diesel) who are the main players ever since the first one, O'Connor the ex-fbi agent now rogue, Toretto, the street criminal turned hero. OK, can't sum up the whole backstory so now the ""family"" has been reunited to stop the bad guy from stealing the final piece to creating a weapon capable of disabling the entire military infrastructure (they don't delve far into what/how exactly, just knocking out all communications). The mastermind behind this, Shaw (played very well by Luke Evans), is the one-step-ahead of everyone else criminal. Well, ultimately, Toretto wants nothing to do with it but there is a catch, a photo of Letty (thought to be dead Michelle Rodriguez) who was Torettos love and part of the family.So with this information, they decide with two goals in mind,save Letty and stop the attack, to take on this mission. One problem that occurs is Letty is now working for Shaw due to her memory loss after her attack as shown in flashbacks. OK, enough blabbering about plot, which there is more of it, and I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed. Let's talk about action which there is plenty of. Keep in mind, checking things like physics and reality at the door are a must for these types of movies. The director (Justin Lin) does a superb job in choreography of the racing/car chase scenes which must be seen to be believed. Even though these scenes are impossible to fathom being possible, Lin films these scenes so precisely with every bit of attention to detail possible, edited together perfectly to inspire jaw dropping moments that may lead to disbelief and even clapping when you see them. No, really, it looks that good. Lin doesn't just stop there, he also utilizes his expertise in other action sequences including gun fights and also a very well filmed hand to hand fight. It plays out as a ""how to"" manual for making an action flick, especially a summer blockbuster (Domestic Total as of May. 27, 2013:$117,036,995 + $197,000,000 foreign). But a movie being strictly eye candy wouldn't be enough. A major step up that is present is the incredible on screen chemistry of the ""family."" Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous play off one another so well, giving us some of the biggest laughs and one liners of the movie. All the characters are played so well, you will be surprised at how you actually are drawn in to the depth they provide in between explosions. Not what you would expect to be another major selling point of this type of movie. The evolution of this franchise now has taken the old die hard fans of the straight up racing from the earlier movies and brought in a whole new group of fans by introducing more of the action elements and complex (for action) stories that are not just fluff. At the end of the 2 hours, I believe you will leave this movie experience extremely satisfied with all aspects of this film, and also do to a major cliffhanger (don't stand up the second the credits start, trust me) that will leave you anxiously awaiting Fast and Furious 7, which I believe will be the final one (do not hold me to that unless I am right). Do yourself a favor and see this one in the theater. 8.0/10 IMDb 7.8 OK, I can't stop there without saying one thing that Heather and I could not hold back laughing about, no spoiler but the ""check reality"" thing is so in focus in one scene it is really stupid, luckily it is surrounded by tons of action, but the runway a plane takes off from has to be somewhere around 500-700 miles long to accommodate the scene. That is all I will say, you will know what we mean when you see it. Thanks for going to the movie with me, Heather, those who read this (including you) know I 99% of the time watch movies at home, so it was a nice change of pace. ""Ride or Die"""

","This was by far and away THE best of the Fast & Furious series! It is non-stop from beginning to end. The opening sequence is awesome, the way this movie pulls in ALL of the movies in the series to date and closes the loops/jumps of it is by far better than any other movie series I have seen. I have never seen a movie pull from all previous movies to make up it's opening credits! Having all the old crew mixed with the new crew from Fast 5 is what put this movie over the top for me! I honestly CANNOT wait until Fast 7 next year! If this one is any indication, it will NOT disappoint. I highly recommend catching this one in theaters. It will be awesome on DVD, but the full effect of the movie can only be had on the big screen!!! Will definitely be buying this the day it is released to DVD! This movie delivered everything the credits promised and SO MUCH MORE!"
"amitsingh2783","8","4","6","23 May 2013"," Best Fast ever made.
","This was certainly best movie in Fast And The Furious series. Best in all 6 movies. Like always movie goes on series of events, whose solution could only be fast cars and action. Laws of physics do not apply to Fast Movies, because following laws of physics is something Hollywood has given responsibility to Christopher Nolan. So trailers made me to go watch this movie on first day and it was certainly the best idea. It was more fun that any of fast movie. Great mix of comedy, action, romance too. An extraordinary villain was present here, who was undoubtedly best among all the villains we have seen before in this series. Making money and steeling was not the focus, but something else was at the stake. So watching criminals work with the police, this was just amazing. Dwayne Johnson, The Rock again rocks the action scenes with his never ending style. Best Fast movie ever Made."

I'm giving this movie a 2 star rating because it was pretty cool when the 2 semi's crashed on the highway and exploded in slow-motion. Otherwise this franchise seems to have died off long ago. Its no longer about the cars and racing, but horrible subplots about people id rather see written off then saved. Paul Walker is as bad as ever, but good thing is he was barely in this. Vin Diesel is getting to old to act and its showing. The rock also seem's juiced up like always. Paul Walker is so bad i wanted to say it twice. If you are familiar with the newer Mission Impossible movies then you've pretty much already know the story. I would rather XXX then this POS. I still don't understand how the series has gone so very wrong since the 1st film was only half bad. You know how at the end of the 1st one... where Vin Diesel flips the cool classic car? I really wish it had landed on top of Paul Walker's car and killed them so this movie would have never existed."

I quit watching the F&F series after the second movie; so I haven't seen parts 3,4 and 5.<br/><br/>The whole concept and the plot of these movies are of course completely ridiculous. But obviously many people don't care about that. At the time of writing this movie has a rating of 7,7 at IMDb. This high rating can easily be explained. Since it's part 6 of the series, most people know what to expect. People who don't like the previous parts, will not bother to watch part 6. So I'm assuming mostly die hard F&F fans have watched it in the cinema and they have given the movie a high rating. You can't rate a movie if you haven't watched it...<br/><br/>I won't go into details of the movie, but trust me, if you're an adult and not easily impressed by all things shiny, this movie is not for you. I watched this in an IMAX theater and still not a single action scene could impress me. Don't get me started on the plot, humor, dialogue etc.<br/><br/>Since many people use IMDb ratings to find out whether a movie is any good, I have voted 1 out of 10; to offset the high ratings that a lot of F&F fans have given. Otherwise I might have given it a 2."
"tompaxy","2","7","13","11 July 2013"," Complete and utter rubbish.

The part where Vin catapults himself out of his car to catch his girlfriend is... well.. I was pretty certain such scenes died out from movies ten years ago, but no. The movie is insult to intelligence. I came to check it on IMDb expecting to see not more than 4, and finding the people value it 7.4 is just another proof you quite often can't believe IMDb rates, both high and low.

","If you're about to watch this movie because of its 7 points, DON'T!<br/><br/>Here's the thing: Every movie has its universe. It could be a fantasy world as in Lords of the Ring, an alternative world as in super hero movies like Marvel Universe or a possible future world for sci-fi movies etc. If you're seeing such a movie you will be told the rules of that particular universe at the very beginning and you don't say ""Hey! This is ridiculous, how does he walking on the walls? A spider bite doesn't do that?!"" Because if you're watching a film like that you're gonna need to build your logic around its own rules. THAT'S OK. <br/><br/>But with this film... I don't know what to say! OK I knew that it was going to include some impossible action moves and I knew there will be a lot of lame talks of shitty characters but street race in the middle of London and not getting caught? OK, OK that can be as well, after all this movie is all about that. And then the bad guy and Vin Diesel face each other on the street and instead if trying to shoot each other they make cool talk? Like in the Heat, like De Niro and Pacino? Hahaha yeah, right! But you know what? That's OK as well! All the failing script writing and the boring plot is OK too! But street racing bad guys attacking a military base?? Arggghh gimme a break! That was it for me, I dropped it right there. Don't waste your time people, if you're not after some real crappy movie."

If this hits 8.0 it's in the same class as Mystic River or Papillon. <br/><br/>Who didn't know there was a double agent within the first half hour? Who didn't know Letty would shoot Dom? Were you really surprised when Shaw kidnapped Brian's wife? And Vin... learn how to do something other than mumble slowly and darkly. I guess that's the director's fault, not yours, but still. <br/><br/>The action was all right in this film, but it mattered less to me because I knew how it would work out all along. The only thing that surprised me was when they killed off Gisele and (apparently) Han, the only two characters who seemed the least bit real. Guess they were getting too soft on account of L-O-V-E. Can't have that. <br/><br/>The good things I wish to say: Dwayne was fun if not funny (no one was funny). Tearing up the interrogation room was as unbelievable as everything else in the movie, but it was entertaining to see him spoof his rasslin' career. Um... that's it."

Not only are the F&F movies fun and great popcorn entertainment they don't insult your intelligence like the Transformers or Battleship type blockbusters do.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have great chemistry together as the leads for the series. Great to see one of the original 4 characters of Michelle Rodriguez back in the fold. Her lack of presence was missing in Fast Five. Don't get me wrong Fast Five was a great movie even without her but the Brian, Dom, Mia and Letty characters make it feel like a true F&F movie. Without one of the 4 main characters it takes away from the F&F feel of the movie. That's probably why Tokyo Drift was the weakest of all the F&F movies."
"Cinobite17","4","5","9","16 November 2013"," Most Ridiculous Film I've Seen All Year
","I've rated this a 6, because it is well made, the visuals, cgi and effects are all well done, they clearly made good use of the budget they had. It's saturated, contrasty and glossy.<br/><br/>However, it is single handedly the most ridiculous film I've seen this year. The story line is OK, it's your standard naughty boys after some top secret tech. But the stunts in it are just unbelievable. <br/><br/>When you make a film in a specific genre, there are constraints to that genre. You don't get alien spaceships flying around London in Bond films and you don't get scenes of real life snuff in Finding Nemo. But in FF6 they over stepped the acceptable mark. This could easily pass as an X Men film the way some of the scenes are played out. The characters are indestructible, there is no ""protocol"" - basically American police come to England and start pulling guns and violence on officials whilst making their demands all whilst American civilians are allowed to wonder the city shooting automatic weapons without so much as an eyelid bat - and there are more plot holes than an 24 hour Syfy film.<br/><br/>Whilst the film does the typical americanism of portraying the British police as bumbling fools who are easily beaten up - probably a poke at us not all carrying guns - they do portray London very well indeed. On the subject of police, it's quite hilarious to see these ""street racers"" in some of the worlds fastest most powerful cars, screaming down the streets with their lives on the line, with the London police cars tailing them by only a matter of meters.<br/><br/>So yeah, the portrayal of London was very nicely done and there is a scene or two showing a lot of armed response police which makes a change.<br/><br/>There's one women who I particularly liked, she had a big bag of balls and a great mma fighting style.<br/><br/>The only other thing that stood out was Ludicrous' acting which was a lot more toned down and believable, instead of the usual ""nigga you be trippin on ma wraps up in her'"". <br/><br/>Amongst other things, and trying to avoid spoilers, they have the worlds longest runway, chasing an aeroplane as it takes off for about 30 minutes which also climbs at a rate of about 10cm a minute - if that. They have a tank that vapourises EVERY car it touches - apart from the American protagonists which it just pushes along. And these people can repeatedly jump great heights / several stories high and hit the floor (or moving car) without a scratch. If they shot a scene where the Rock jumped from the moon and landed in a 2ft swimming pool in Iceland, it wouldn't look out of place in this film.<br/><br/>And that's what ruins it, it just goes WAY too far.<br/><br/>If you like ridiculously over the top unbelievable films, you'll love FF6. But they really do push things WAY over the line from ""maybe plausible"" to just being a complete joke."
"quincytheodore","6","8","17","23 May 2013"," Quirky humor and insane set pieces overcome its shoddy plot
","While it doesn't reach the same height as Fast Five, the newest and most ludicrous installment of the franchise thus far still packs a lot of noisy high octane entertainment in its engine. With increasingly expanding star-studded cast, Fast & Furious 6 exhibits a lot of value by just pinning these familiar names together in scenes, despite some of the script they use doesn't really work. It has good amount of humor, and also highly dubious amnesia plot. Quite frankly, it does its best when it doesn't try to be serious.<br/><br/>Starring buff gents and ladies, almost everyone on-screen has weighty name, although they are heavily leaning towards action oriented rather than acting, which might've been the direction from the start. Plot revolves around Vin Diesel trying to woe the amnesic Michelle Rodriguez, thus involving the crew into a shady military operation in the process. It gives what people want in spade, the bridging between set pieces is fairly clumsy, but it does pay off with ridiculous amount of flying cars and bodies.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough, there are plenty of melee brawl across the movie. The addition of Gina Carano, the MMA star, is a good choice, she brings the rawness in these scenes. Several others will join the fray in close combat, obvious if they have The Rock and Vin Diesel it'd be a waste not to. However, there are some stunts that borderline corny and unrealistic, even by Fast and Furious standard, many wiring might look awkward as well. It's not a major concern, but I prefer the more structured natural stunts rather the high flying ones.<br/><br/>Chasing scenes have been up-scaled, bringing ramp cars, tank and whatnot into the mix. Apparently, there's demand for even more over-the-top driving scenes to fulfill. This is where it truly shines, fast motion, carnage all around and seemingly impossible traits. The building up and finish are somewhat imbalance, sometimes resorting to incredibly odd coincidences. Script works adequately, some of its jokes are better than others, and definitely league ahead compare to the supposedly more dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>Fast & Furious goes extra miles for crowd enjoyment. Action junkies or car enthusiast will be pleased, however the result is less organized pace. The movie is a blast, even if there are shortcomings, catering directly to the core audience.<br/><br/>Rate 6.5"

","It is not good but nor is it bad. Fast and Furious 6 is a bit above average movies that was flawed. I found the story predicable and cliché. It was pretty much unoriginal from a person having amnesia to a person who betrays the groups. Also, too much was going on and after one thing got fixed more problems came in when it should of just ended at that point. It is also really stupid when the villain is right in front of your eyes who you are trying to capture and yet you let him go and wait another time for the real deal. The story is not as clean as the last one but is it far better than the earlier movies of this franchise. I also found the dialogue ridiculous and unnecessary and kept on face palming each time they add a line. <br/><br/>As for the positives, obviously the action scenes were awesome especially the plane scene at the end. Also, make sure to stay after the credits, it will give you clues to what F&F7 is going to be and possible villain for 7. Overall, Fast and Furious 6 is a mediocre movie that is worth a one time watch. Nothing really special but if someone wants some action this is the movie to watch. Not the best so far this summer but neither is it the worst. Fast Five will remain the best of the series."

So many of the scenes are just unbelievably bad and ignore every single law of physics.

","This movie was too crazy and silly to be any good. First of all, since it is the sixth film in the serious, you already know there is no plot. And then too many absurd things happen. Like Brian returns to LA to go to prison under an assumed name. His cop friend just gets him in a high security prison under a false name and then he meets the guy he was looking for, fends him and his goons off, and the next thing you know he's back on a plane to London. Yeah, sure. But the worst part of course is the ending and the plane. The action here is just too over the top. Cars hanging on a plane, people jumping out of a fast moving plane and landing in a car. Give me a break, they would have been on the runway. Then how long was this runway. And the plane explodes but Dom walks away with not even a tear in his wife beater. And how could Dom not have known to hide his sister, terrible.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Stay far away from this."

","There's a lot of things I can say about this, none of them complimentary, but who has the time? Instead I will restrict myself to a few questions I hope someone may answer, so I can maybe have a better appreciation for this mess.<br/><br/>1. Is an army commander allowed to give orders that put the lives of entire nations at risk in order to save his own skin, such as happened when whatever-his-rank-was had a gun to his head by Hobbs, so as to let the bad guy go, so as to possibly save the spouses of those two guys who can't act? Not to mention the troops heavily outnumbering our so-called heroes plus the bad guy. 2. Once he was let go (the baddie at the army base scene), why did they immediately try to recapture him. I mean they had him, then let him go, then immediately tried to recapture him without there being any change in the situation as far as they knew. Did I miss a key detail somewhere there? 3. If a properly forewarned army base is not able to defend itself against a bunch of thieves, what's the point of having such a base? Couldn't they call reinforcements just in case? 4. Why send the worlds most dangerous chip out with the world's most smallest convoy? 5. Why did the baddie put up with such a flaming red security risk in the person of Toretto's presumed-dead-but-alive girlfriend Letty? Why not put a bullet through her head soon as Toretto starts pitching up? Why believe in amnesia? It's not like you can see it. 6. On a related note, the Letty character was actually a genuine baddie. Why was it assumed that we sympathized with her? <br/><br/>There's so many other questions but honestly I don't have the energy."
"nirvanaisgoed","2","4","7","17 August 2013"," The stupidity of inaccuracy
","This movie contains just to many errors. OK of course a director could bend the laws of physics a bit in his favor, but this was just to much to handle. It starts with the opening scene, lots of really ugly edited sped up shots of 2 cars racing. For some reason a charger can keep up with a GTR, but OK. Then, since when is a landing strip 20 miles long? The airplane scene just doesn't seem to end, and when it does, hey there's the end of the runway... finally... after 15 minutes of 100mph driving and fighting. Also there are cars flying trough the aircraft as if it was made out of cardboard... Everybody is shifting gears (with the lever) in cars with automatic transmissions (also the ones with paddles on the wheel) probably to make it seem like they are driving ""really fast"". Please just hire pro drivers, put a camera on a lower point of view and actually drive fast, it will look fast. The tank is an ugly prop, when it breaks out of the truck it's in the canon hangs loose as if it's not even bolted to the tank. Someone slapped on some parts to hide the actual tank and the director doesn't even know what he's dealing with because in interviews he is talking about a WWII tank, but in fact it's a British Chieftain tank first build in the 1960s. (i believe WWII only lasted until 1945) It's driving over cars as if they are not even there (ok a tank can do that) but when he gets to the car of one of the main characters, for some reason that car just gets pushed forward for 2 minutes. Also apparently in Spain its the middle of the day while it's midnight in London (1 hour time difference in the real world). The whole movie is just really bad, the acting is horrible, the story is bad, and there's not a single scene that doesn't contain an error of some kind. Other Fast and Furious movies were over the top, but this just was to much stupidity for one movie."

","I had never seen any of the Fast and Furious movies and I say this one by mistake, and I am glad I did. I believe they did a good job at explain the back story for first time watchers. Will defiantly be watching the other 5! For me there was a little to much unrealistic parts but I believe that is what happens with any high budget action movie. Like I said this was my first Fast and Furious movie so I am not sure if every actor has been in every movie but I believe you can truly tell that they have an almost family like bond between the cast and even the crew. I believe that, the fact that they have this relationship with each other truly adds to the movie. Now I could be 100% wrong and they could just all hate each other and be great actors."

","A rare film that I saw in the theater and barely remembered I saw it just a few hours later. Honestly, I had no interest in it, was just with family over Memorial Day weekend and had a free ticket anyway. Still, what a waste of time. Who cares about the plot? Whenever the characters are talking between action sequences, it's pure torture. Who gives a crap what these people are saying? The action sequences themselves are somewhat amusing, but they aren't really that good. Too much editing, leading to occasional confusion. Physics are completely ignored. Momentum, inertia, gravity: fuhgetaboutit. When I watched the fifth F&F movie, which I did because it actually got very good reviews somehow, I thought to myself, eh, maybe I disliked it because I was watching it at home alone, which is clearly not the right environment. But hanging out with family and seeing the sixth one with an audience, yeah, I think they really do suck (though, truth be told, I remember enjoying the first one, which I saw on video with my brother when it came out)."
"leonblackwood","6","11","27","22 September 2013"," Loads of Action!
","Review: I quite enjoyed this action packed movie, which had a decent storyline and loads of car chases and explosions. It's basically want you expect from a movie in this franchise, which was what I found a bit disappointing because there wasn't much fresh ideas. The tank and the plane was a bit different but that was about it. What made me laugh was the length of the runway for the plane scene and it was amazing how they made England look so glossy. Anyway, if you look at the money that the movie made, expect many sequels and with the introduction of the Rock in the last movie, he has obviously made a massive difference to the franchise. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Everyone in this movie has been in the gym before there scenes because it sacked full of muscles. Even the ladies show that they can hold there own against the men. The Rock is over pumped and in every scene he looks like he's sweating because he has just put the weights down. Anyway, the director done a good job with putting this movie together, especially as it was set in England. Some of the stunts were a bit over the top, but that's what you expect from a Fast & Furious movie. All the way through the film, Vin Diesel is sizing himself up next to the Rock, but I liked the chemistry between them. In all, there wasn't anything that really stood out about the film, but it does keep you on the edge of your seat and you just don't know what there going to come up with next. Maybe boats or horses, lol.<br/><br/>Budget: $160million Worldwide Gross: $789million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into the Fast & Furious franchise, which always brings loads of action and, of course, cars. 6/10"

Very glad to see he is in the pack again. A great character to the franchise. Vin Diesel is still the same old Vin we all knew from the previous Fast and The Furious movies ,but pairs up with The Rock which makes it even better.<br/><br/>Very good movie you wouldn't want to miss in theaters.

"j-pryde","7","5","10","19 May 2013"," Fast 6, Fast but not quite as Furious as the previous outing
","The Fast and Furious franchise is one of the more strange ones – it improved the older it became. Coinciding with the 10 year anniversary of the The Fast and the Furious, Fast 5 marked the highpoint in the hugely popular series. Street racing culture was ditched in favor of a heist plot in Rio de Janeiro. To say it worked would be a massive understatement. <br/><br/>Fast 6 is continuing where its predecessor left off, although with a little twist. As it has already been explained in the trailers, the team surrounding Vin Diesel's Torreto character is asked to help Luke Hobbs (played by the ever charismatic Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) capturing criminal mastermind Owen Shaw (portrayed by Luke Evans), this time around in London. <br/><br/>The Good <br/><br/>Working in its favor is the wonderful backdrop provided by the London metropolitan area. It offers a lot of variety and distinguishes Fast 6 from the previous entry. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Torreto's crew is as good as it has ever been. Furthermore, The Rock really meshes well with any of the gang.<br/><br/>Tyrese, without going into detail the banter he shares with Ludicrous or the aforementioned Dwayne Johnson is worth the ticket admission alone. It's obvious that his character serves as comedic relief, as has been the case in Fast 5, but he has to have the funniest scenes in any of the major (non-comedy) blockbusters this year. <br/><br/>The action in the FF series was never realistic to begin with, so no surprises here. Still, it shouldn't take away from some impressive set- pieces. Justin Lin knows what he's doing. <br/><br/>The Bad <br/><br/>Fast 6 is too crowded; there are too many characters in the movie. Even the main villain, Owen Shaw, is underdeveloped, as is the Letty sub- plot. It just feels like the producers were gung-ho about reuniting the principle actors from the very first FF movie, at any cost. <br/><br/>Gina Carano, though she can definitely hold her own in the action scenes her acting is wooden at best. If pressed for a comparison – she'd be a bad female imitation of notorious stoneface Keanu Reeves. There's little to no facial expression. Frankly, her character is redundant. She may have pulled a half-decent performance in Haywire, but given the nature of her character (a stoic, hardened, operative) it played right to her strengths (or lack thereof?). At this rate it's hard to see her carrying a movie anytime soon. <br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>Fast 6 is one of the better flicks in the franchise, perhaps the second best, but some way off Fast 5. One can't help but feel that the finished product has been rushed into production. A little fine-tuning (no pun intended) here and there would've served the movie better. The ending in particular is a little underwritten; it's not as glorious or as satisfying as Fast 5."

","Fast & Furious 6(2013) Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Disel, Dwayne Johnson, Jordana Brewster, Luke Evans, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Gal Gadot, Sung Kang, Ludicrous, Kim Kold, Thure Lindhardt, Elsa Pataky, Johannes Taslim, Shea Whigham, John Ortiz, Gina Carano, Clara Paget, and Jason Statham Directed By: Justin Lin Review All ROADS LEAD TO THIS. Dang this series is starting to be the action franchise to go to, it's the equivalent to an 80's action movie. But only it's a series with sequel after sequel after sequel after sequel and guess what they've been getting better. Ever since I saw the first four Fast movies I thought they were terrible but they had a fanbase so they kept making them of course and then came five which is what this series should be and it's also one of my favorite films of all time because it is one of the best action movies in years that isn't based on a superhero. Fast & Furious six delivers a badass action flick as well. The film has Hobbs assembling Dominic and Brian reassemble their crew to take down a team of mercenaries: Dominic unexpectedly gets convoluted also facing his presumed deceased girlfriend, Letty. The opening sequence and credits alone to me would have been worth the price of admission. It's one of the best opening sequences I've seen in this series in particular since Fast & Furious which no mind you is a bad one. Any fan of this loved this one which is great cause with word of mouth they got the naysayers attention and they see well you know what the last one was awesome and this one is just as good too, so know everyone is on board wit this series. This series was always had the purpose about being fun action movies, but in this day and age if your going to be an action film in a growing franchise your going need to step up your game. That's exactly what this series doing now. It has an interesting plot with the return of the one characters, Letty played by Michelle Rodriguez who was presumed dead in Fast & Furious. She has lost he memory and is working with the films villain played Luke Evans. The Performances are good for the most but at moments can be a little stiff, and Gal Gadot what little dialogue she does have in the film she still can't act. I liked most the main cast they were good actually they were great but yet again at times stiff. The acting is still good for the most part. The direction from Justin Lin hast Vastly improved since Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift and I'm guessing that what's happening in the series was either his plan or the writers plan or I don't know someone who works with him on these movies. Fast & Furious six contains all the greatness of the previous chapter in this series with an interesting story, good acting that at is stiff at times and has one bad performance from one actress but good direction and the most intense action sequences you'll see with crazy stunts, I'm giving Fast & Furious six a four out five."
"hotamolly","8","3","5","4 October 2015"," Review of the movie Fast and Furious 6
","Fast and Furious Keeps Getting Better <br/><br/>The action-packed saga Fast and Furious adds another sequel to the collection that exceeds expectations. ""Fast and Furious 6""; starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, is set in a new country with new boundaries to overcome. Director Justin Lin is at it again producing another great movie that is entertaining. ""Fast and Furious 6"" hits all emotions and makes you feel like you're apart of the adventures taking place. The Fast and Furious franchise has improved their movies from the first one in 2001.<br/><br/>Retired street racers Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) have started calm lives with their family in foreign countries after pulling off a major robbery in ""Fast 5"". Throughout every Fast and Furious movie, it is shown that Dom's main concern is his family because he believes family will never let you down. Since family is very important to Dom and his group they decide to help Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) in exchange for amnesty to return home and to possibly save one of their own.<br/><br/>While watching this movie you will experience all kinds of emotions. Like all the other Fast and Furious movies, this new one of course has a couple high intensity car sequences that will have you on the edge of your seat. The special effects used to make these shots do a very good job in making each scene feel believable and real. From flying through the air to car crashes, each scene looks authentic and convincing. There are also many scenes that will cause you to tear up a bit and lay heavy on your heart. <br/><br/>In addition to a having a notable plot, the main characters Vin Diesel and Paul Walker show the ease of committing to their role. Since they have played these characters for 6 movies in 12 years, Diesel and Walker have great chemistry on screen and are able to successfully become their characters. These two main characters are also best friends off screen and use that relationship to make their characters seem very close. Vin Diesel does an especially great job as portraying the tough street racer with a hard exterior yet is able to have a soft spot when it comes to his family because of his mannerisms and tone of voice. <br/><br/>With all the action shots during this film, the cinematography does a very good job in each scene. By having close up and long shots at the right time, it is easy to see the emotions and body language of each character during the shot. This is especially shown in the major action scenes involving a tank on a highway and a plane crashing. The angles used help display the full effect of how intense and extreme each sequence is <br/><br/>""Fast and Furious 6"" makes each viewer want to be apart of the film. Being the second most successful Fast and Furious movie, ""Fast and Furious 6"" is a great one to see. It is impressive for the Fast and Furious franchise to still be producing movies in the saga. By improving each new movie, the franchise has become very successful and have created a fan base that is excited for each new movie created."
"morellsmn","9","3","5","30 May 2015"," Best one yet!
","this movie contains jaw dropping action and suspense while adding a major plot twist. you will find this movie entertaining and well made, especially if you are a F&F fan and love the series. as any F&F movie would, it contains violence and language mixed in with sexuality, which is why i would not recommend this for younger audiences. the end scene is very intense and brutal, and so are some of the scenes scattered across the movie's sequence. in the end scene, Dom and the team is chasing the villain into an escape plane. Dom and Brian and Hobbs and Letty make it into the plane, where Mia is being held hostage. bloody fist fights occur during this scene, and it is brutal. Brian and Mia escape, where outside the rest of the team is fighting and chasing the plane. the cars shoot harpoons that go through the planes wings, which keeps it from flying. while fighting, Letty opens the emergency exit door, and one of the villains is impaled with a harpoon and falls out of the plane. death is implied. while fighting, one of the cars kicks a guard off the top of the car, and he falls into the planes propeller engine, slicing him up. also very violent. the villain is shot at and falls to his death. the plane explodes, and it engulfs in flames and breaks to fragments. the ending scene makes this movie a very high PG-13 rating."
"CinematicInceptions","7","3","5","25 May 2015"," Pretty good for a summer cash magnet. Slightly lacking in a couple spots but above average action.
","Despite FAF 6 being a largely money-based continuation of the saga, I felt like the filmmakers did a decent job. It's not an incredibly well done film, but it could have been much worse and still made a lot of money. It's certainly better than the Transformers sequels, where there is absolutely no attempt at making a high quality movie. If we're all completely honest, we can agree that the FAF series could probably be much smaller than it is. But this is Hollywood, and while a series keeps raking in the cash, it will thrive through an unlimited number of sequels and reboots. So even though a solid sixth installment wasn't needed to preserve the franchise, it seems like the producers took the film seriously and tried to give it decent quality. I have watched trailers of all of the first five and have a decent sense of what each is about, though I haven't seen the,. So I'm sorry if some of my pre-6 information is skewed, but I'm doing the best I can and hoping that my good intentions pay off.<br/><br/>There is a present plot, but it is primarily action driven. There are pieces of it that you might not understand fully the first time around, but I would advise that you don't stress about whatever you don't grasp because it really won't make the plot have any more meaning. Basically all of the little plot progressing scenes are just set ups for later action sequences. The only exception to this is the lead-in to the climax, which has a lot of emotional weight to it. Apart from that, any scene that progresses the plot and doesn't have a significant fight scene is of little importance. However, this only applies for the plot of the individual film. The characters' relationships that build on the previous films is something that you'll want to pay some attention to and maybe even get a little background on if you haven't seen some of the first five. For anyone without this background, just know that the team wants to bring back Letty to preserve their ""family"", and things should make a fair amount of sense to you. Also, watch the end of the 4th movie beforehand. <br/><br/>There are lots of prominent characters, and I'll just give each one a quick overview here. Dom has the spotlight most of the time, and has a mellow disposition when he's not in a high octane fight or car chase. Practically all of his lines have a lot of weight to them. Brian has no real arc, but has a consistent motive of trying to protect Mia and his newborn Jack while helping Dom. Hobbs drives the external story line as he hunts down the new villain Owen Shaw. He is very straight-faced and serious the entire movie, whether he's being casual, threatening, or a human war machine. Owen Shaw is a pretty good villain, and can deliver on his word whether on his own or through his disposable team. Letty has less depth since she has lost her memory, but she does provide a good plot engine for Dom. Hobbs' sidekick, Reily is probably one of the weaker characters, and really could have been left out except to provide a couple extra fight scenes. Tej and Roman provide most of the comic relief and aren't really important in the big scheme of things despite their ample screen time. They have decent chemistry since their basically polar opposites with Tej being the unsung hero and Roman being the loudmouth who can't back it up. Han and Giselle are given a side story and are both written well SPOILER ALERT though this could be accounted for by their separate deaths at the end. Lastly, Mia and Elena both get a little screen time all of which is important, but they are rarely a present force in the story on or off screen.<br/><br/>The action sequences are relatively long, with an average length of about ten minutes each. Much of it is hand to hand combat, but there are some more explosive fights as well. The fight scenes are kind of rough, but not at all bloody. The choreography is good, but there's nothing wowing about it. There are a couple of scenes featuring the obligatory fast cars, primarily a Dom and Letty street race. There is a lot of comic relief intermingled of about B- quality. Most of it's not gut busting (think more Marvel movies and James Bond than RED or Pirates). There's probably going to be one or two little jokes that you really like, but most of them are forgettable.<br/><br/>I might say that the acting talent was wasted here considering the all-star cast, but it wasn't really bad. The script was a little lacking at points The technical execution of the fight scenes was satisfactory with visual effects and shot cuts. The scenes with cars were well shot, and you pretty much knew what was going on the whole time, which you can't say for some action flicks. The soundtrack has a lot of the standard rap-hop music, but Brian Tyler's score really comes alive at the end with the plane.<br/><br/>Again, my knowledge is limited, but if you liked Fast Five, this should be enjoyable for you. If you're more into the street races aspect of the franchise, there is only one race scene. It's not amazing as an action movie, but it should be fine. You can watch it basically any time under most circumstances, but there are some parts where you might not want a lot of distracting background noise. I would recommend that you buy it right off if you're a fan of the series, but otherwise just rent for the best possible price. If you like this one at an above average level, definitely go see Furious Seven. Overall Rating: 8.35/10."
"girarrazaval","8","3","5","16 April 2015"," Just a great action movie
","Great cars, fine actors, amazing fights and OMG the actions scenes from the car chases were good enough to make me happy and put a big ass smile on my face. Even if you don't like cars, this is a great example of a good action movie, fun, simple but with nice twists and...if you really don't like cars, with this franchise you will start liking them, and a lot! Can't wait for the next one. Finally this movies, the fast and furious franchise did something other franchises should do, mix the recipe, change the story, present new and exciting characters and make a new great feeling for the movies to come. Hope other franchise do the same, if necessary!"
"JaydoDre","6","3","5","6 July 2014"," A well shot, fun, ridiculous, dumb action movie
","So let me ask you a question. Say, a man had been doing dangerous criminal activities in the past. Having managed to survive and even earn some money, he now has a wife and a young child. An old acquaintance shows up and entices the man to go back to doing dangerous work. What would be the man's reaction and what would be his wife's reaction? If you answered something like, ""the man would decline and the wife would get furious and probably start yelling"", then you are a sane human living in the real world. And if so, I cannot see how this movie would not irritate you, at least a little, unless you are able to entirely let go of reason for the sake of enjoying action. As for this reviewer, I am no longer able to let go of common sense as much as so many movies ask me to.<br/><br/>This is film where a British policeman shoots a submachine gun from the open window of his car on a busy street; where families and good lives are being abandoned for the sake of a questionable plot; where pretty girls are running around with guns and driving fast cars; where everyone talks cool but dumb.<br/><br/>The movie throws character development and story introduction right out of the window and makes whatever shortcuts it needs to make to get you to the speeding cars as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Well, at least it's efficient at getting you what you are expecting from this movie. Because what Fast and Furious does well is action racing. There is a good variety of vehicles racing, getting smashed and doing the smashing. And all that action is really well shot. The cuts between the shots are fast but not erratic. The shots are made from interesting angles, often from the bystander's perspective. There are also quite a few fight scenes and those are well choreographed and well shot as well. In fact there are usually several fights scenes happening at the same time and you can tell who is punching whom, where and how. You see stunt people doing actual work.<br/><br/>Having said that, even though the story only exists to get you from one action scene to the next and it is not very logical, you do understand what is going on. And as the movies progressed I found something strange was beginning to happen. It was getting continuously better and better and better. The plot mattered less and less and the situation at hand and the relationship between the characters mattered more and more, so that the stupid receded and the good had come to the foreground. The plot raised its ugly head a couple of times again towards the end though.<br/><br/>The acting from the leads, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, and Michelle Rodriguez hold up this film. Diesel and Rodriguez still have chemistry. If anything, these people gotten better at doing the Fast and Furious stuff. Dwayne Johnson as the lawman is also really good. In fact, with Vin's and Paul's characters always being so serious and playing the same old puppy-eyed good guys, Dwayne's character brings much needed fun to the movie. And his appearance really fits the fast muscle cars.<br/><br/>The character of the British villain played by Luke Evans does not have much flavor besides ""eeeevil"", but having said that, he does his job at appearing to be really cold and calculating.<br/><br/>The rest of the crew though are not as good, though neither are the things they are given to say. The side characters are really at their best when they shut up and fight. The dialogue is kind of dumb containing a lot of short shallow one-liners. Interestingly though, the better dialogue is saved for the team of the British villain. In fact I wish those guys got more screen time.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a lot of REALLY dumb plot points but all together a fun action movie.<br/><br/>P.S. Somewhere in Spain there is a military base that has a runway that goes the entire circumference of the Earth."
"christoforospaphitis","3","3","5","8 September 2013"," Should be renamed to ""punch and furious"" it has nothing to do with cars
","I just watched the movie in anticipation of seeing some cool cars and unbelievable races like in the first two installments of the franchise so here is an opening scene with a new Skyline playing catch with a Dodge Challenger in twisty Spanish mountain roads and I think to myself GREAT start I'm gonna love this one! So about an hour passes by seeing a couple of stationary exotic and classic cars but nothing exciting in terms of racing and a few nonsensical hand to hand combat. Fast forward about another hour and the only thing that has to do ANYTHING with vehicles is a tank rolling over small old cars in a highway and yes that was it SERIOUSLY??? Is the franchise about cars or not? Even as an action movie it sucks big time as the plot is very superficial and the clichés were predictable long before they said them. Really if I didn't have any ironing to do to keep me busy it would be too painful to watch. a five years old would catch up to the plot and the acting full of goofs. For example Letti is hanging from the window seal with one hand pointing the gun with the other hand and guess what her arm that hold her from falling is bent and relaxed... now unless you are incredible Hulk it is impossible. In bullet points: Bad Acting Superficial plot (I wouldn't mind that if the movie was about cars) Nonsensical violence (time fillers) NO CARS!!!!!"

It isn't shocking to see a mindless movie like this gross a lot of money at the box office, since it is 12 year old's that frequent cinemas, but i can't understand why this movie has a 7.4 rating on IMDb where 12 year old's don't own accounts.<br/><br/>I liked fast 5 because, so i went to the theater with my friends with bigger expectations and came out highly disappointed. the movie is full of plot holes to begin with. I usually forgive summer movies for this sin but it way to much here. It wasn't as half as funny as the first one. Some of the lines between Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous, who isn't a good actor by the way, aren't amusing. What is worse is that some times other conversations are introduced just so as to bring in a line between these two. It must be the epitome of bad script writing. My 13 year old sister could write better lines. The action sequences are also ludicrous. I know this is a fast and furious movie but the guys here do some stuff here that Spider-Man only dreams of. <br/><br/>What is even more insulting is that the critiques aren't all that hard on this movie. I don't know why some summer movies are admonished for minor misdemeanors but this one gets a pass. One critique wrote that the fast and furious movies are getting so good that by the time they get to fast 16 it would be up for best picture. <br/><br/>Do you value time and money? Do you have an IQ above 70? Are you older that 12? If your answer is no, then you are in for a treat."

","OK this film is worth watching, however the older you are the more you will be put off by the quantity of action in it.<br/><br/>Everyone managed to have at least one worthy performance. Although some of the better actors managed to perform well throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>For me the disappointment was with Bruce Willis and the quiet Chinese guy. They were the most unconvincing performances.<br/><br/>Like bad roller coaster rides, the kind that do more than just excite/thrill you, by the end of the ride you feel sick and never want to go on it again. This also describes this film's viewing experience.<br/><br/>If only they could beef up the script, tone down the action, stop putting in, so called ""cash magnet"" actors like Bruce Willis, (that really should retire.) Add some depth along with a more sophisticated soundtrack. They would have made a one-to-remember type film.<br/><br/>I normally do not like ""the Rock"" however in this film he does one of his best and believable performances! I really liked Vin Petrol too, he was awesome in this film and I wish he would act in more credible titles. The guy that plays the baddie is very good, once again proving he is around to stay.<br/><br/>Anyway all in all a good movie, one that requires zero brain power to process, yet not quite boring enough to send you to sleep half way through.<br/><br/>Summary A cliché feel good action flick.<br/><br/>Questions... Is it worth cinema viewing? - No; Is it worth buying? - No! Therefore wait until it is on the TV or hire it out when there are no more ""Big Titles"" left to watch. ;)"
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","5","28 May 2013"," Fast & Furious hasn't ran out of gas yet. Seems like it is just getting started.
","Honestly, how many movies are they going to make out of these characters? I know, most of the actors can't find work outside from the popular Fast and Furious film series, but seriously, it's the 7th movie in film series. It's starting to look like all they got is this franchise. The actors are all becoming ""One trick Ponys"" in my opinion. In my opinion, this movie by director Justin Lin is probably the Fastest and the Furiousness yet. Still you got to watch the other movies to even get this far in. There is a lot of things you wouldn't get if you didn't watch the previous films. Fast & Furious 6 follows a professional criminal gang led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) who have retired following their successful heist in Fast Five (2011), but remain wanted fugitives. U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) offers to clear the group's criminal records and allow them to return home in exchange for helping him to take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and his second in command, Dominic's presumed-dead lover Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) who is after a secret military chip. There wasn't a lot of silly moments which Fast Five was full of, in my opinion in this movie; but the car coming out the nose of an airplane is bit outrageous dumb. Still, that had to be the longest airport runway in the history of the earth. The plane in the movie was in flight for 5min 33sec. Based on that the runway was at least 13.88 miles long, that doesn't even include the beginning of the take-off and the fact that where they stopped. It didn't seem to be anywhere near the end. Longest runway I know of is 18000 ft. Anyways the action was pretty intense, you might have not notice that. The tank battle was pretty good as well. I just didn't like the whole bringing in the speed racing theme into the middle of the movie. I know it's in the original Fast & Furious movie (2001), but it takes out the seriousness of this film. The plot get more and more out there. With each passing film you can see it becoming more and more far- fetched. Most of this movie plot come from Fast & Furious (2009) since it deals with Letty. In 5 films, not counting Tokyo Drift (2006), the story has evolved from fast cars, racing and hijacking tractor trailers to heist money from drug cartels to now fighting international terrorists. Then you got people turning evil to good, good to evil. I didn't know being an international terrorist can get parole from the same country, she was attacking. Watch the movie to get who I am talking about. I noticed Vin Diesel doesn't look very buff out like he used to be. Age is getting to him. Still, the Rock doesn't look normal. Are you sure this guy isn't taking Steroids? The acting is OK; everybody had their bit parts. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous give the film its laughs and memorable one-liners. There wasn't anything new and sexy in this film unlike the others, but seeing Gal Galdot was pretty OK. Han (Sung Kang) is always an interesting character of mine. Also make sure you check out, Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) before watching what happen after the end credits. There also a special new actor joining the cast on the 8th movie. Overall: Sit back and enjoy the ride, let reality leave you for a couple hours."

","I really have to give the producers credit for how they have tuned this franchise. At some point, the formula will have to outlive Diesel like Bond had to survive after Connery. The fans won't abandon the series but as with Bond, the constraints will get ever tighter. In the meanwhile, this is still evolving, getting more pure. <br/><br/>What I see is that the target audience for this is not 13 year old boys, but men who incubate a nostalgia for when they were 13. That bends everything.<br/><br/>The car chases, for example, are not designed for cinematic excitement as if we were in the cars. They are designed to mimic the way boys play with cars; heavy with crashing and public mayhem. It is why every situation is abstracted into a contest between car armies.<br/><br/>I believe this is why we don't have that business about Fathers and remote sons working out issues. We see that in almost every kid-targeted movie. Instead, we have a similarly reduced value: loyalty to family, regardless of cost. Any cost.<br/><br/>Here, the supposedly lost family member doesn't want to be rescued, in fact fights it. This reduction ends up giving us some very strange plot necessities: the girl friend who sends her man away for family is odd enough. But the new mother (the only real family in that world) who is willingly left alone, unprotected, was really something.<br/><br/>It is also why the women here are so unlike what we expect in a teen oriented movie. These aren't the buxom, seductresses of teen fantasy. They are stereotypes that a middle aged guy will have grown. <br/><br/> The woman in the family who turns out to have been cheating all along. <br/><br/> The woman who needs to be rescued in spite of herself because of stubborn stupidity. <br/><br/> The sexy beauty who will leave when you want.<br/><br/> The compliant wife.<br/><br/>We do have some wiggling butts when a street race is starting, but that's presented more as just part of the brand, as incidental as lacquer is to racing. Sex in this film has less to do with genitals than trust and shared adventure. You have to have been in a relationship for years for that to register, and be well past testosterone mania. Men control the machine, not the other way.<br/><br/>More nostalgic value is in the 'dirty dozen' gathering. We have teams now in many action films, but here there is an emphasis on the outlaw nature of the individuals. The dirty dozen trope goes as far as the phone calls after which everyone immediately gathers.<br/><br/>The stunts are tiring. The way the justifying story develops is proudly weak. But I find the engineering of the thing to be engaging as getout. It invents a new market for cinematic color."
"mttafesse","1","4","8","11 August 2013"," blah blah boom stunts...fine, but how in the world did this script make it to screens?
","Fast 6 starts out as a promising film. Brian feels something is missing and he's not at home. Han is trying to figure out his life with his girlfriend while Tej and roman are making it rain dollar bills and Euros. things change and they're all called when high stakes blow out in Moscow. After that, you will be treated to some junk CGI stunts including crazy armored cars, tanks, monster airplanes and an insane leap that is more suited to a superman movie but still entertaining. however, the movie comes short in dialogue and plot.<br/><br/>SERIOUSLY WHO WROTE THE SCRIPT??<br/><br/>And How on earth did it make it to production? A first grader can collaborate with a three year old and write a better story using crayons on a drawing book. Is it that bad? YES!!!<br/><br/>In fact,the script was so bad that it made the actors look stupid. And this is a top drawer cast we're talking about. I'm not going to attempt to point out each of the thousand plot holes but allow me to appeal to common sense. -What if the British government people decided not to be stupid and let an international threat walk away from custody because some chick was kidnapped (plus with no guarantee of her safety). -What if the crew members decided that they're millionaires and they wont be willing to risk their lives again so Dom and Letty have a notebook reunion? -More importantly, what if governments decided they should prevent a disaster using trained operatives and secret service instead of a group of runaway carjackers? And people, this must go down on record as the longest runway ever built in history. But still, grab a popcorn and enjoy the stunts because that is all the movie is good for. and there's a good twist of events in the end that makes the two hours spent sitting there worthwhile, a tiny bit. try not cry over spending your money to watch it. I did. Far as script goes, this is AWFUL AND TERRIBLE AND AWFUL. as a screenwriter myself, it makes me sad whatHollywood is coming to. -Plus The Cop is a bad cop? like wow!!! After she looked sooo.. serious about destroying Michelle rodriguez. Why did they fight, if they were on the same team? Forcing the plot twist, you think?<br/><br/>And the movie got a 7.3 rating. please kill me right now, I mean right now."

It is bad enough that Shaw manages to coordinate a huge cargo plane to a military base right when he is set free but don't even get me started on the runway. 13 minutes of 110-140 mph speeds - thats only like 20-30 miles of runway.

Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson once again team up to create a lot of excitement. The story itself is great. It contains almost nonstop action interspersed with clever lines. The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. Luke Evans delivers a strong performance as the lead bad guy, Shaw.

","At first I thought it could be fun, otherwise why would they make a 6th movie? I even checked the reviews on this site, it had a fair amount of critical acclaim, so I thought - why not?<br/><br/>It wasn't until characters like Vin Diesel and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson started speaking their lines, that I realized how poorly written the film was... I'm surprised IMDb have even bothered to add ""memorable quotes"" because there aren't any. I would have expected a better script from a children's film, it was so cliché - but that was probably to be expected.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on how unrealistic some of the scenes were, the most surprising was the final runway scene, where the plane kept on going for 15 minutes, surely the runway would've ended? But you probably saw enough of that in the trailer.<br/><br/>Overall, the film had a good production value, some of the backdrops were impressive and quite well directed, but if I were the director, I wouldn't want to be seen on set with some of that acting. <br/><br/>I would only watch for the action scenes which are cliché but still pretty impressive.<br/><br/>Rhys Jones."

There are many movies out there which have a shitty storyline, but great action to make up for it (Die Hard 5 comes to mind). But this couldn't even achieve that. The action choreography seemed to have been done by a child playing with action figures. The movie is plagued with bad dialogues and stupid attempts at comedy.

","I've said it many times before, but one of the main reasons why the F&F movies failed to reach mass appeal before Fast Five was because of their villains. They were always forced to take on low end drug dealers and people who have little to do with their line of work; driving cars really fast and stealing things. With Fast & Furious 6, the team gets to take on Owen Shaw & his own crew, who are equally as good at doing crazy stuff on wheels.<br/><br/>Dom regathers his team, including Brian, Han, Gisele, Roman, and Tej, after Hobbs comes to him with an offer he can't refuse. The chance to save Letty from Shaw and take him down, in exchange for full pardons all the way around. After quite a few films on the run and unable to return to his home in Los Angeles, there's no way he could turn down this opportunity, even if it meant going up against his former girlfriend thought dead, Letty. <br/><br/>Fast & Furious 6 has even more muscle, explosions, faster cars, and just downright insanity. But it isn't as clean cut or polished as Fast Five. Granted, a movie like this doesn't necessarily need to have a concise story or developed characters, but they've done a much better job at doing those things within the last few films. The 6th film feels a little slower and maybe even a little too long, with the end product still putting a huge smile on my face. But when comparing the two, a second watch definitely exposes some of this film's minor flaws.<br/><br/>The one thing this film, and pretty much all of the films since 4, is that each keeps topping itself. Just when you think they couldn't top stealing a vault and dragging across the streets of Brazil, they take down planes with cars. The tone deafness of the series is gone and the new breed of F&F is here to stay. The crazy thing is, you buy into all of it. I bought into the family from the beginning and I one-hundred-percent buy into the series embracing it's goofiness. The film also manages to implement more humor into the 6th film which is something the franchise has been missing. Or at least, humor that actually makes people laugh. I won't count those horrible attempts at humor in the 2nd film.<br/><br/>What makes this film stick out his that it's the first time the crew gets to go up against an entirely new crew with the same set of skills. Luke Evans is great as Owen Shaw, The Rock has never been better, and who doesn't love watching Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson crack one- liners at each other. Better yet, every word out of Vin's mouth is a one-liner. Overall, the ante is once against raised and the series punches its way through another smash hit. Fast & Furious 6 is an insane thrill ride from the beginning to end.<br/><br/>+Owen Shaw<br/><br/>+Team vs Team<br/><br/>+Rock & Vin working together<br/><br/>+Always pushing the genre and series to a new level<br/><br/>-A bit slower & a tad too long<br/><br/>9.1/10"

","CIA agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) returns and asks aid of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew in taking down a ex-military mercenary who plans to steal a microchip capable of ruining an entire country.<br/><br/>Following on from the previous installment Fast Five, director Justin Lin hasn't let up his intention to give this series some sort of conviction. Most of the characters return (the film even begins with a montage of all the previous films) yet for all of its efforts to make a malleable universe, we are still dealing with the most uninteresting, good-looking people. For example, Tyrese Gibson just eats stuff and laughs, while my favourite character Han still just talks about ""going to Tokyo"", it is actually getting insulting now; these films only exist as prequels to the third film so they can include him yet his only characteristic is ""I want to go to Tokyo"".<br/><br/>Even Michelle Rodriguez returns (due to fan outcry) yet the writers couldn't think of any better excuse to bring her back than the tired ""selective amnesia"" fall back; she doesn't remember the love of her life, but she can still drive and tune a car. Don't even talk to me about the villain I have no idea what his motivations really were, and he was never threatening when up against Diesel and Johnson<br/><br/>The film does do some things right compared to the deplorable Fast Five. Some things. The chase sequences here are better, specifically the chase through London and a race between Dom and Letty. But for every good race there's a over-the-top, nonsensical scenario. The crew face off against a tank. Yes, a tank. Why? Because the villain needs the microchip that is (for no good reason) stored inside the tank, inside an armoured transport. Or the final encounter that involves a carrier plane and the longest runway in the world!<br/><br/>The film isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't good either. I have no idea why it is praised as highly as it is, but it can only be for the action sequences, fight sequences alone, which are at times impressively far-fetched. The dialogue is terrible too; all of Dwayne Johnson's lines are metaphorical nonsense: ""To catch a wolf, you need wolves. Let's go hunting!""<br/><br/>The series is a nonsense now."

"mitchell5954","8","1","1","17 August 2019"," My Personal Favorite Fast Film
","Fast and Furious 6 is my favorite film in this franchise thus far. I will say I enjoyed it even more than Fast Five. While Fast Five, from a critical standpoint, is better I had a bit more fun with this film. It is amazing to see where this franchise has gone throughout the years. This franchise went from films about street racing to straight-up action and adventure films, starting with Fast Five. Some people might not care for the change but I, personally welcome it. This film continues in that direction and I found it to be the most entertaining. There is nothing deep about this film. This film will not win any awards but it is not supposed to. This film, as well as the other Fast and Furious films, is meant to entertain, and I think it definitely succeeded.<br/><br/>The cast from the previous films all reprise their roles here. The characters are all still enjoyable and play off each other very well. I love the banter between the characters. I thought this film had some of the best comedy of the series.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous films, this film feels more like Vin Diesel's movie. In the first two films Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) was definitely the main protagonist. In Fast and Furious and Fast Five I felt Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were dual protagonists. Here Toretto feels more like the main protagonist. I do not mind this because of the plot of this film and because I like Toretto better than Brian anyway. I especially like his scenes with Letty. Brian is still important though, and goes through his own arc as well.<br/><br/>Letty, played by Michelle Rodriguez, is back in this film. The way they explain how she survived in Fast and Furious, I thought was lame and implausible. However, she does have more to do in this film. In the first film she was one of the side cast and did not do much. In Fast and Furious she was only in the opening. However, in this she is given more screen time, more to do, and a pretty decent in the middle and end of the film. The scenes she shares with Toretto I liked as well.<br/><br/>The villain Shaw I really like in this film. He's easily one of the stronger villains. This is probably because he has so little competition. The Fast franchise's main problem was its villains. The villains have always been weak and uninteresting. Shaw, I think is a big step up. I like that they make Shaw the antithesis of Toretto and his code. The incorporation of Letty makes this a very personal story for Toretto like Fast and Furious, which I like.<br/><br/>The action is very loud, fun, and intense like in Fast Five. The effects are great too. There is CGI, but I think it is used effectively. Like in the last film, this film puts more emphasis on action and gun fights rather than racing. However, there are still one or two races that are incorporated, which I found to be enjoyable. Since my theater only shows movies in 2D, I cannot comment on the 3D aspect of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a great time at the movies. If you are a fan of the Fast Franchise, definitely check this one out. The ending scene during the credits was also amazing. Like Fast Five it won't win any awards but, for what it is, it's at the top of its class as far as action movies today."
"alindsay-al","7","1","1","4 August 2019"," A good crazy action film
","Following watching Fast 5, I have now just seen Fast 6 and I enjoyed this one about the same amount as Fast 5 & Fast 7 meaning these are a solid set of films. The premise of the film sees agent Hobbs recruit Dominic Torretto and his crew in order to take down a rival gang, who has a former family member amongst there ranks. Vin Diesel is back as Torretto and he does a better job in this film, his character has a more emotional stake in the story this time and even though he isn't the best actor I thought he did a good job with the material given. Dwayne Johnson really does add something to these films, I liked his chemistry with the crew and thought pretty much everybody bounced off of each other well. Luke Evans plays the villain in this film and I thought he did a good job, it was nice to see a villain that squared up to the heroes and provided a challenge both physically and mentally. However, I feel like in these films that Paul Walker is just really bland and really doesn't add to much to the film, I know the tragic circumstances around his life but that doesn't change my opinion that he is a pretty boring character in this film. The story in the film has a more dramatic feel to it the the last film, it feels like there are personal stakes in this film and that makes it more interesting. However, the film never does a particularly good job to get across the villains motivations, it just feels like we gotta stop him because he is the bad guy in the film but there isn't a particularly interesting reason for these two crews to be feuding. The script is fun with a well balanced use of humour and drama which helped improve this film. The style is as ludicrous as you would expect, there are some entertaining and high octane action scenes that are fun to watch. Though I felt the setting for the climax of the film was really dark and it was quite hard to see exactly what was really going on, what you can see is entertaining but you can't see enough. Overall this is an enjoyable film that is another fun addittion to this franchise."

","Despite a poorly handled character death, Fast and Furious 6 is an incredible sequel that continues to build on the franchise high of the previous installment. Justin Lin's direction is once again great. The returning cast are all great and their chemistry is fantastic. The action is incredible and some of the best in the franchise. It even fixes the problem with the previous installment with Luke Evans, who is an extremely good villain."

","Action to the MAX. crazy intense complex scenes with all types of action like fighting including martial arts, shooting, exploding, chasing, and of course racing. Again they connected the story perfectly with lots of parts from the previous movies coming into play. they took everything from fast five to the next level. of course there are some parts that are hard to believe but that is expected. they keep finding creative ways to elevate the magnitude of the action like...

","Fast and Furious is an American series of action films. But I Think the best one is fast and Furious 6 by Justin Lin which was produced by ""Media Original Film"" and ""One Race Films"" and writes by Chris Morgan. It was made in 2013 in Untied State. It tells the story of Dominic Toretto,Brian O'Conner, Luke Hobbs, Letty Ortiz and Gisèle Harabo played by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez and Gal Gadot. Fast & Furious 6 follows a professional criminal gang led by Dominic Toretto (Diesel) who have retired following their successful heist in Fast Five (2011), but remain wanted fugitives. U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson) offers to clear the group's criminal records and allow them to return home in exchange for helping him to take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw (Evans), one member of which is Toretto's presumed-dead lover Letty Ortiz (Rodriguez). I personally think it's an irresistible film, it's captivating and so exiting. I will recommend it because the acting is awesome and the script is bright."
"ma-cortes","6","9","26","24 April 2014"," Nail-biting sequel plenty of noisy action ; being mostly filmed in London and Canary Islands , Spain
","The picture mingles action-packed , thrills , drama , exciting car pursuits , suspense , fights , a little bit of violence and spectacular sequences though won't mean much on little screen TV. It's a summer Blockbuster where reality , plot and dialog have no place . Since Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian's (Paul Walker) Rio heist toppled a kingpin's empire and left their crew with $100 million, our heroes have scattered across the globe. But their inability to return home and living forever on the lam have left their lives incomplete. Meanwhile, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled mercenary drivers across 12 countries, whose mastermind (Luke Evans) is aided by a ruthless second-in-command revealed to be the love Dom thought was dead, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). The only way to stop the criminal outfit is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks Dom to assemble his elite team in London. Payment? Full pardons for all of them so they can return home and make their families whole again. As Brian goes undercover to infiltrate a prison to figure out dark secrets.<br/><br/>This is an exciting follow-up with exceptionally fine camera work and great car chase sequences and crashes on the metropolitan streets , motorways , airport and several other places . The drivers, the cars , explosions are the real stars of this movie from the beginning to the end . Dennis McCarthy, the man behind building the vehicles used in the fast car franchise says that they used ""a whole fleet of BMW M5s"" in order to complete one sequence . Pulse-quickening action but plenty of clichés and lots of dirty driving and heavier on crashes than coherency . All stunts were performed by authentic experts without people damage . Drivers challenge their contenders for car races , through illicit street racing and highways , even less legal, with tank included ; causing wreak havoc racing 195 mph . The tank chase was originally planned to be created via CGI, but director Justin Lin insisted that it had to be done practically with some post-production enhancements . Several hero cars for the new film are being procured from California-based Lucra Cars . Very much in the B-movie tradition of the original ¨Gone in 60 seconds¨, ¨Grand theft auto¨ and ¨Eat my dust¨. Paul Walker does impress again in the role of a retired cop who goes back in action to help his friends . Again Vin Diesel as the patriarch-philosopher-thief character , the head of a tight-knit family or quirky thieves hopped on car exhaust adrenaline . Nice support cast such as Tyrese Gibson , Sung Kang , Gal Gadot , Ludicrous , Luke Evans , Elsa Pataky and Gina Carano . <br/><br/>Thrilling and rousing musical score by the Spanish Lucas Vidal . Colorful as well as glamorous cinematography by Stephen F Windon . Justin Lin's direction (he previously made Annapolis and Better Luck tomorrow , The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift) is competent though the story eventually run out of gas . Two theater-sized units were used for post-production work overseen by director Justin Lin . The flick will appeal to adrenaline lovers and those young people looking for strong emotions. This is the kind of film in which the cars enthusiastic will enjoy immensely, it's a must see for car fonds."

But one must appreciate the one liners which keep us interested always. All in all may be we expected too much.But tanks , planes shooting it reminds me of THE EXPANDABLE rather that a F&F sequel.

"visheshvijay","7","10","30","4 August 2013"," Just another evolution of the series not the revolution
","Like a well-oiled engine, the Fast & Furious series can be counted on to deliver what it promises on the box: gleaming cars, thrilling chases, and buff stars who look like they've stepped out of the pages of a fitness magazine. The new installment, Fast & Furious 6 is just as dumb as the previous films, and its action scenes so furiously edited that it's hard to tell who's doing what, and to whom. But, as we've come to learn, that's the charm of these moviesthe stunts are outrageous, and the plot basic enough for an eight-year-old to enjoy.The new film opens with our heroes Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) enjoying their retirement, when federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) shows up to recruit them in a mission to capture professional hijacker Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). The incentive for Don is a possible reunion with his ex, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was presumed dead at the end of the fourth film and who now may be working with Shaw.Director Justin Lin packs the film with back-to-back chases and set-pieces, never giving you a moment to ponder over the fact that you have no idea till the end, exactly what our villain is after – some codes are mentioned, but never clearly explained. The action itself is outrageous, and whether we're seeing real stunts or special effects, or a cocktail of both, it's pretty entertaining stuff. Cars are flipped like pancakes every few seconds, an armored tank creates carnage on a bridge, and an airplane is demolished in the climax.For those who enjoy their action a little more gritty, you'll be happy to know Gina Carano (Mixed Martial Arts star, and leading lady of Steven Soderbergh's Haywire) is cast as Hobbs' sidekick, and she gets down and dirty in a thrilling girl-on-girl fistfight with Rodriguez in the London Underground.Don't expect any improvement in the dialogue – the actors still mouth lines that appear to have been stolen from bumper stickers – and the performances are basically a range of stock expressions: angry, very angry, mad as hell.At 2 hours and 11 minutes, it's a little too long, and even the most devoted action-movie fans will sense the exhaustion creeping in. But don't leave until you've caught that post- credits cameo from a popular British star who sets up next year's seventh installment.I'm going with seven ratings for Fast & Furious 6. It's loud and noisy, and a lot of fun even if it doesn't make much sense."
"bobalexander45","1","4","9","24 June 2013"," After ending world hunger, this movie would be next on my list
","This movie should be deported to North Korea and forever banned here in the United States. <br/><br/>Absolutely nothing about this movie makes sense. 15 minutes on a runway? What is this, a stairway to heaven or something? Also, the whole point of the movie was to save a member of the crew... and they end up losing a different member at the end. Agitated or disturbed in any way? Nope, they all carry on like nothing happened. Like what?<br/><br/>There were so many ""that doesn't make sense..oh it's just a movie"" scenes where either the protagonists or the antagonists could have ended the movie right there (was really hoping for that to happen so I could go home, take a shower, and go see a doctor for post-bad-movie-thermia) <br/><br/>I paid good dough for this movie and I want a refund for not only my ticket, but the mental and psychological torture that I faced in my Herculean task of keeping my eyes on the screen. <br/><br/>However, this movie did live up to its name.

"Jayme96","5","4","9","30 May 2013"," Ridiculous
","Parts of the movie were decent, but there wasn't a whole lot of a plot line since we already know Letti is still alive. To me, and many others I've talked to that have seen the movie, it's just so freakishly unrealistic that it ruins the whole show. Most notably would be where Dom jumps out of his moving car, flies through the air, catches Letti and they crash into the windshield of another car and no one is hurt. This film series has devolved into nothing more than a cash cow with mediocre acting at best, and a bunch of unrealistic stunts, and virtually no plot line. Sad. For the first F&F to be so good, and they just keep getting worse. Since I need to add more lines to submit this, the entire sequence involving the plane on the runway was absurd too. I expected some ridiculous stunts, but not over the top ridiculous, and that was the bulk of the entire show."
"Mr-Fusion","5","3","6","3 February 2014"," Faster, louder and way too long
","They've brought this series a long way from the streets of East L.A.; exotic locales, more characters, gonzo stunts and frenetic editing. But it's still the same hokey dramatic plot twists, hot-body posturing and really bad one-liners from way back. And the fast cutting and noise with these car chases just grows numbing after a while. I'm not kidding myself; I know I'm not the target audience. And that audience is specific and well-catered to. But this is really bad soap opera. On the plus side, it's still fun to watch The Rock work, and they sweetened the pot with Gina Carano. <br/><br/>But this recurring cast is awful. <br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>On second thought, what i really do like about the last two movies is their serial nature. The end of one folds right into the beginning of another. You don't see that every day on the big screen."
"pwmartuneac","1","3","6","14 January 2014"," Absolute garbage
","I'd give this zero stars if I could. Everything about it was just awful. The weak script was made even weaker by the dry, emotionless, utterly unremarkable acting (Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez being the worst perpetrators). A ten year old writing a creative essay for school could have come up with a better plot. What action there was was so meaningless and forced. To be specific:<br/><br/>1) Why have Gina Carano, who apparently is a mole in the crew, fight Michelle Rodriguez who, at the time, was working for the bad guys? They were both on the same side, so they wouldn't have needed to fight.<br/><br/>2)I'm sorry, but since when is a super-tank guarded by two unarmored jeeps with no turrets? And since when are tanks shipped with ammunition in them? And how do they know how to drive it? The squashing of all those random cars was a lame attempt at making the bad guy more detestable, but it was just laughable. And the way they brought it down was absurd and an insult to physics.<br/><br/>3) Probably my biggest gripe in the movie is in the same tank scene. As Rodriguez's character (I forget her name b/c she's so forgettable as a character. I think it was Larry or something)is about to fall off the tank and down to certain death, Vin Diesel scrambles to the hood of his car. Just as Rodriguez falls of a fast-moving tank, Vin Diesel jumps from his also fast-moving car (and apparently he has hops like Michael Jordan), catches her in mid-air, slams into a car on the other side of the highway, and is JUST FINE. Not a single scratch or bruise. Later on, Rodriguez asks him ""How did you know that car would be there to break our fall?"" WHAT. BREAK YOUR FALL? Since when do cars ""break your fall""? The last time I checked, people who jump off of buildings and fall onto cars don't survive. THEY DIE. And at the speed they were both going, and the way Vin Diesel hit that car's windshield, they both would have died or at least suffered life-altering injuries.<br/><br/>4) The ""plot twist"" was also ridiculous. The bad guy is caught, but he threatens one person and they hand over a chip that can start WWIII? And then he conveniently has an AC-130 transport plane waiting for him?<br/><br/>5) The final 20 minutes of the movie I spent with a look of grotesque disbelief on my face. The plane is moving at take-off speed, about 150mph, throughout this ENTIRE scene, and yet it doesn't run out of runway? Where'd he find a 50 mile runway? And the rear door was conveniently left open the whole time so cars could keep driving up inside and wreaking havoc. Vin Diesel does this ridiculous flying headbutt. The bad guy gets jettisoned out of the windshield of a jeep he was trying to drive off the plane and yet the jeep was barely rolling when it shot him out of the plane. The plane is stopped from taking off by three lightweight cars affixed to its wings. A fourth little car SOMEHOW brings the whole thing down and wrecks it. It bursts into a ball of flames and Vin Diesel somehow drives a car from the cargo bay through the rest of the plane (which is impossible) and out the nose of the airplane while it's burning up and exploding. His car flips over a dozen times at over 100 mph and he not only survives but walks away unscathed.<br/><br/>6) The whole plot was just absurd to begin with. An uber-terrorist is trying to gain control of a computer chip that could start WWIII and instead of sending in some SFOD-D operators, Navy SEALs, CIA agents or whatever, they get a crew of criminals who only skills are driving fast and shooting unnaturally well? COME ON.<br/><br/>I can't say enough bad things about this movie. Bad acting, bad script, bad plot, and to top it all off it was too long. Hands down the worst movie of 2013."

","So after 6 installments of the Fast & Furious franchise this is what we know for sure1. A good story and/or script aren't necessary to have a successful movie franchise, 2. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson really likes his muscle juice and 3. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker still can't act.<br/><br/>Fast & Furious 6 (Dear Godwhy have you people let them get to 6) is absolutely ridiculous. And not the good kind of ridiculous likedid you see what Walter White just did on the last episode of Breaking Bad kind of ridiculousI'm talking about the dumbest, most absurd, I can't believe people actually go to tanning beds and purposely get beamed with cancer rays kind of ridiculous.<br/><br/>The first few Fast movies took themselves soooo serious it actually made them kind of funny to watch. Similar to seeing an episode of Honey Boo Boo on TVit's mindless good fun, but after a while you just need a shower to wash the stench of stupidity off yourself. But the sixth installment has gone off into a distant planet that has yet to be discovered. Is the film campy? Are they intentionally trying to make a bad movie, or is this all a joke that Hollywood is playing on us to see just how stupid the audience actually is? It's hard to saybut one thing is for surethis is not a good movie no matter what the bulked up nimrods at your gym tell you.<br/><br/>The story is just plain dumb, the dialogue is unrelatable to the way any humans I know speak, and the action sequences are so unbelievable they make The Avengers movie seem like a true story. These characters literally jump from car to car traveling at top speeds, and walk away with minor scratches. Are you kidding me? At least John McClane gets a little bloody when he leaps through glass windows in all the Die Hard movies. **Spoiler Alert** Vin Diesel's character actually gets shot in the chest, then pulls the bullet out himself, and walks away like nothing happened. Seriously???<br/><br/>I get itmost people go to the movies to escape their normal boring lives. You want to see unusual people doing unusual things, but seriouslyif your life is so hard pressed for escapism that you find these Fast & Furious movies entertaining then it's probably already too late for you. I hope you enjoy the next Honey Boo Boo episode, because intelligence has waved bye bye to you for good.<br/><br/>For more quick skittle reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com"
"KineticSeoul","6","3","6","20 June 2013"," The most ridiculous and over the top installment in this franchise
","This is probably the most ridiculous and over the top movie in this franchise so far. And the previous movies in this franchise gets pretty darn ridiculous and over the top. The thing is there is some cool action sequences but I just quickly became numb to it. Especially since there just wasn't much substance when it comes to the story. It's basically the good guys team led by Dominic Toretto against Owen Shaw's team which the bad guys team. This whole movie however goes in a extremely superficial and lame direction it gets slightly annoying. Especially how all the character constantly tries to prove how macho they are. Especially Letty Ortiz who make it back into this franchise somehow which isn't really surprising. She is basically ""The Grouchy Ladybug"" and is a laughable character. She even goes head to head with Gina Carano. Few of the humor works most don't but it's all corny as hell, like it's straight from some Michael Bay movie. Maybe even the action sequences as well. The thing is this movie seemed like the story revolved around the action sequences. Which means they probably planned all the action sequences then tried to figure out a way to connect the story to those action sequences. I heard the plane scene was suppose to be in ""Fast Five"" but they took it out of the storyboard because of lack of budget and since it seemed random. I did like how it sort of connects all the previous movies into this franchise into this one. Anyways if your in the mood for a action movie with tons of action but forgettable characters despite it being the 6th installment in this franchise and lame story. You might enjoy this, well I thought it was a watchable popcorn flick.<br/><br/>6.6/10"

","Will I like this kind of Movie....The Voice and Style of Van Diesel, the Power of Champ(Rock) Outstanding Movie... The F&F 6 I also liked Because the uniqueness in Style like in 6 Series they stole the whole bunch of Money Bank....And the way they carry is WOW... There's love between man and his machine (aka: shiny paint jobs on cars most of us can only afford to download images of); the love of the adrenaline (aka: there goes the neighbourhood, and the city's reconstruction budget); the love of a man with his fellow man.<br/><br/>There's also love for the family and the urge to keep it together but most importantly to the antagonist of the movie – the love of money. These last two factors play a big role in Fast 6 (also known as Furious 6). The former of the reasons include the misleadingly deceased Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodrigues), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel's) former girl- friend, turned amnesiac female muscle of the villains.<br/><br/>Letty's actual necessity – as the necessity of any of the parts of the Fast franchise – is questionable. Perhaps it is just as much as the plot device about the villains needing a chip to make a 'Nightshade' contraption capable of blacking out the power of an entire region (seriously? Well we experience the use of same device daily, I guess).<br/><br/>This matters not, because for whatever its worth, the Fast movies are beyond unexciting. Mr. Diesel and co. is the reason behind the sale of the tickets; later DVD's; much later the commercials on television. His recent workmates include Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs and Gina Carano as Riley Hicks – aka the anti Letty. Seeing Ms. Carano and Ms. Rodrigues duke it out is one of the giddy delights of Fast 6 (they duke it out twice, so the ticket automatically pays for itself twice at one go). However, there's still more.<br/><br/>In keeping with the style here's what you get:<br/><br/>Hobbs and Dominic – with their bulging biceps – muscle out frames, trying out plans to knock out the bad guy mercenary (Luke Evans); Brian (Paul Walker), now relegated to a notch-above-extra status, travels back to the US to learn how Letty survived; Roman and Tej (Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Badges) play with machines; Han and Giesel (Sung Kang, Gal Gadot) provide ancillary window dressing. And of course, let's not forget the usual': mean hot-rods, skimpily clad women and two road- crushing, people-crunching finales – one involving a tank, the other a runaway airplane on a hundred mile runway.<br/><br/>Fast 5's climax involved a giant bank vault being through the city, so in keeping with reality is not really a priority here. But by now, you already know that.<br/><br/>Starring: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Luke Evans, Gina Carano, and Elsa Pataky.Fancylive.com"

","If you're sick of soulless excessive violent movies, Hollywood got a way to keep you calm as that's the reason why franchise like Fast & Furious keep coming back, each time better. I can say, to me, this is the BEST of all. <br/><br/>For once, we can see past the impression that Fast& Furious is just a car movie, it's about family, loyalty and on-the-road romances. On the last part, remember how we're madly drawn towards Letty & Dominic or Brian& Mia love stories. It's the action that glue all the high packed emotions together, making FF a complete platform of emotions<br/><br/>Secondly, Vin Diesel proves himself an irreplaceable asset to the franchise. Simply put, without him, the movie by and large will loose it magic. He deliver a solid walking tall alpha men stereotype that stands out from others. He can fight, He can lead, He can race. There is something about his voice that set him apart. It's beyond words. <br/><br/>Last but definitely not least, Fast & Furious always got a moment that you walk away from the cinema and can't help talking about it. In this one, that's the moment when DOminic catches Letty when she's falling out of the tank. he catches her, in slow motion of course, w/o being sure if there's another car to bounce off. He was just there for her literally. <br/><br/>and whatever it is, Letty's bitchy look and attitude always screams sexiness<br/><br/>With just these reasons, I can say Fast & Furious have made their way to a Hollywood signature franchise"
"billygoat1071","7","3","6","25 May 2013"," Level of Absurdity
","2011's Fast Five was the franchise's glory for abandoning the sins that slows down their movies and excel to something crazier and suitable to what it is called. Fast & Furious 6 grows the scale with even more ridiculous car racing and stunts. Now it involves a fight between military and terrorism while it has a serious sentiment about family. Things can get way out of hand, but the film is so fun, it's hard complain about how stupid it is. It's not a classic, but the stuff that are supposedly awkward actually made the film a fantastically exhilarating ride.<br/><br/>Before, there were just street racing and cartels. The last one is about an extreme heist. Now they are chasing down super terrorists, running away from tanks, and a character who faked her death. The more stories they tell, the sillier it becomes, but no matter how absurd these are, they are still a pleasure to watch. They are really forgetting the mistakes of the past(first four) films and think more creative ways to excite the viewers. The series also finally has a highlighting villain. A campy one as well that could fit in a superhero movie. The weakest parts of the story are the twists that are much inane than the craziness it was displayed. The sideline of the plot is about family. It contrasts between Dom's team who are loyal, and Owen's team who are careless. It's a fine speculation but nobody would care about it.<br/><br/>We are here for the racing, cars crashing, and some fistfights. The last film had cars that can pull off a vault, now we see a bunch of cars pulling down a cargoplane. It shows how it insanely ignores the laws of physics. It's exasperating if you take it too seriously, but I don't think anyone would ever take a blockbuster like this too seriously. However, they are amazingly directed. The tank scene, which was already beyond ridiculous, was kind of inspired. And the early London chase was an energetic sequence. The performances are the same before. What's new about Vin Diesel is the swagger he makes in the end. Dwayne Johnson is always entertaining, but he is much entertaining when he was beating a guy around an interrogation room. Newcomer Luke Evans really makes a worth rooting villain. His character is not as well developed as any villains from big blockbusters, but he manages to make this one slickly fun.<br/><br/>Fast & Furious 6 reaches the scale of blockbusters that have superheroes, super spies, aliens, or whatever. Except the cars are the ones that have superpowers here. These set of magnificently dumb action sequences reminiscence your standard blockbuster when this film is suppose to be smaller than those kinds of films. It's strangely grander and louder, but of course, it's also as fast as the title suggests. Verdict would still call Fast Five the best of the series, but honestly they are both equally good. This one just takes a new level of absurdity even though the characters are trying to be down to earth. Fast & Furious 6 is far from perfect but as a modern blockbuster it's an extremely entertaining film."

","With having been left gasping for air after seeing Fast Five,thanks to it unexpectedly rejuvenating the franchise with an amazing confidence,I decided to pay a visit to local cinema with some friends,where we all buckled up,and got set to witness the sixth part in the franchise speed across the screen.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Investigating a recent theft of military equipment from a Russian convoy,Dipolmatic Security Service agents Luke Hobbs and Riley discover that the attack was committed by a highly trained gang,led by a former British Special Forces solider called Owen Shaw.Fearing that the military equipment could soon disappear onto the black market,Hobbs decides that it is time to take drastic measures and fight fire with fire,by locating the leader of a gang who stole $100 million right under Hobbs nose.<br/><br/>Eventally locating the gangs former leader (Dominic Toretto) on an isolated erotic island,Hobbs is left disappointed,after Toretto gives him a stone face answer,that he has no interest at all in working for Luke.Pulling out his trump card,Hobbs calls Dominic's bluff by revealing to him a top secret photo that was recently taken of the thieves,which reveals that Toretto's ""dead"" girlfriend Letty is actually alive and well,and currently working with the gang.<br/><br/>Desperate top see Letty again,Dominic grudgingly accepts Luke's request and begins to gather up his old gang.As Toretto and the gang begin to investigate Owen Shaw's recent activates,Dominic begins to fear that Letty may not give him the warm welcome that he had originally expected<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Despite having to complete 18 months worth of post-production in a 12 week period (which led to 3 editors being hired for the movie!),director Justin Lin shows a new clarity for each of the tremendous action scenes,with the limited post-production time allowing Lin to give the film a real raw edge.<br/><br/>Smartly placing just enough character beats so as to allow each of the actors their moment in the one-liner spotlight,Lin takes the gravity defying action of Fast Five to a new,literally in the air defying the laws of physics level,with Lin giving the excellent London location a futuristic sheen,as he takes the viewer on a joyful,tongue firmly placed in motor-mouth thrill ride,which go from isolated, one on one street races in sections of London that are,in reality never anything less than jam packed, (the crew were only given 2 minutes every hour to film on some of the UK's busiest roads) to Lin finishing the movie on an epic car (s) V plane fiery race to the finish.<br/><br/>Bringing a striking new element to the franchise,director Justin Lin places all of the female character's of the film right at the centre of the movie,with Toretto's desire to uncover Letty's recent activates being used as the main plot thread which keeps the film speeding along.<br/><br/>Along with being much more involved in the story part of the movie,Lin also gives each of the actresses some of the films most intense action beats,with a hard-hitting,rough'n tumble fight between Letty (played by a feisty Michelle Rodriguez) and Riley (played by a take no prisoners Gina Carano) being the most gripping action scene of the entire movie.<br/><br/>For his terrific screenplay of the movie,Chris Morgan carefully balances moving the franchise forward with an espionage angle,that leads to each of the gang having doubts about their alliance's,whilst also making sure to include enough mention to past events in the films which allow for a side plot to slowly develop,which ends up delivering a huge scorpion like sting at the end of the film,as Morgan begins to fully display the new road that this fast,and very furious film is racing upon."

","Review of Fast & Furious 6 http://www.yusufpoonawala.com/movie/fast-furious-6/ <br/><br/>The gang is back,yet again. Fast 5 had taken this street racing franchisee to a new high and current series director Justin Lin, in what seems to be his last outing in this series, manages to say that elusive goodbyein style.<br/><br/>This is pure adrenalin rush.<br/><br/>The gang, living in early retirement after their 100mill heist in Fast 5, are reassembled by DSS Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and his partner Agent Riley (Gina Carano). Yes, its the cops asking the help of the thieves, since their latest case involves sophisticated thieves of a similar kind, but different class altogether. And the movie keeps on reminding us that class difference, repeatedly."
"roger-pettit1","7","3","6","20 May 2013"," A surprisingly enjoyable film.
","Fast & Furious 6 is not the kind of film that I generally like. It's preposterous, absurd and completely in your face. But I enjoyed it! It's not really a good film, let alone a great one. However, that does not really matter. This is a film that does not take itself too seriously - and it's all the better for it. The director and the cast seem to know exactly what they're doing - and they deliver a film that won't live long in the memory but which nonetheless provides two hours or so of solid entertainment that allows the viewer to forget about the stresses and strains of modern life for a while. And, it does so very well indeed. <br/><br/>Much of the film is set in London. The plot strains credulity and is full of holes. It took me a while to get used to some of the characters and what I assume were occasional references to their back stories (because I have not seen any of the 5 earlier films in this seemingly ever popular series). But, to be honest, the details of the plot are not really that important. Fast & Furious 6 is an almost wholly visual film about machismo, crazy driving sequences and adventure. Vin Diesel (that cannot be his real name, surely?) is very good in the lead role and he is ably supported by a cast that seems to have been plucked from the United Nations branch of central casting. I particularly liked Luke Evans (Owen Shaw), who plays the arch baddie.<br/><br/>Fast & Furious 6 is the sort of film that defies rational criticism. It's a delightfully innocent, energetic and enjoyable romp. 7/10"
"s_campanale","9","3","6","17 May 2013"," Its Fast and Furious 006...but its 007 they're aiming for!
","We here in London are getting it a week early as a present for it being shot here.<br/><br/>The ""Fast and Furious"" is one of those surprisingly long lasting pulp B- series that alongside ""Underworld"" ""Resident Evil"", ""Mission Impossible"" and ""Scary Movie"" are now into their second decade and umpteempth instalment. All of those have become family cottage industries for the reoccurring cast and crew, rather like the greatest long runner of them all James Bond, and it is a good advertisement for what this kind of ""house"" production style can achieve as opposed to the more cynical quick cash grab approach taken by bottom line studios and their disinterested hacks.<br/><br/>When the first ""FF"" came out in 2001 it was an intimate family-crime drama based around the then unknown Street Racing scene, with a couple of chases and races but mainly stayed on 2 legs. A dull sequel came in 2004 then a totally separate story strand in 2006 which nonetheless showed the technical competence of director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan, who became entrusted by the returning original cast (whose expected great careers had never really materialised!) with the transformation of the series into a sort of ""Avengers"" or ""Mission Impossible"" on wheels, a team of recurring characters who take on the big crime bosses street racer way. In that form we now have the 6th movie and 3rd ""re-launch"" instalment.<br/><br/>The trailers tell you pretty much the whole story & there is little to spoil here. Agent Hobbes (Dwayne Johnson) comes knocking to the team's door with the promise of pardons if they help bring down a crew of dangerous ex-British and Russian special forces operatives headed by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) with the added enticement of the presumed dead Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) alive and well and running with them. Seems she did not die in ""Fast N'Furious"" but merely lost her memory in a classic case of plot convenient amnesia and was reshaped by Shaw, who was working with FNF's Mexican drug cartel villain Campos at the time, into his number 1 deadly driver girl. So the crew ups and moves to London where Shaw and co are stealing components for a deadly ""Goldeneye"" style EMP bomb that they will sell to the highest bidder or else! Cue chases and fist fights in Mayfair, Canary Wharf, Kings Cross, Piccadilly, Camden, Waterloo, and Battersea, even down the Underground, all great fun for Londoners like us after ""Skyfall"", and a nice touch of exotic foreignness for World audiences. The third act takes place in Spain, where a deadly battle on the suspended motorways of Las Canarias against a hijacked Tank gives way to a final showdown on and around a Russian Antonov transport plane attempting take off. <br/><br/>This unashamedly 007-esque climax appropriately tops off what is really a Spy adventure with the team working with the intelligence services to stop an evil villain and his high-tech scheme, making it different from the previous instalment (Oceans 11 in Rio) and the one before that (Revenge in Mexico). Same beats different set up – The key to a good franchise!<br/><br/>The film has several big action set pieces, starting with chase between the team in black BMWs trying vainly to capture Shaw and co in London, followed by a gun battle in Elephant & Castle and a nasty girl fight between the 2 toughest chicks around, Michelle Rodriguez and Gina Carano,(making good on Soderbergh's gamble to launch her as an action star) in the confined corridors of the Tube station. The Street racing roots are acknowledged with a car show-street race between Dom and Letty from Green Park through Piccadilly Circus to Battersea power station, then the Las Canarias tank-car battle, and eventually the airport- Antonov climax. All are slick and exciting, at least for those who enjoy exotic cars going fast.<br/><br/>The cast of returnees are all excellent, though some show fatigue, mainly Sung Kang's Han and Gal Gadot's Giselle, supposedly lovers but obviously not of this franchise anymore! Jordana Brewster's Mia has her baby and promptly misses out on most of the rest of the movie, as does previous love interest Brazilian cop Elena (Elsa Pataky) who becomes the spare wheel once Letty turns up (She is very noble and dignified about it of course). Evans is hardly tough guy material, but is actually surprisingly convincing as a cold blooded SAS hard man, reminiscent of Robert Shaw's Brit mercenary in ""Taking of Pelham 123"", while his crew is composed of generic stereotypes like evil Asian dude, big heavy Russian, cute blonde but vicious Russian girl, evil bald guy, evil bald black guy and evil handsome black guy. Carano does well in a supporting role, not having to carry a movie as she bravely attempted in last year's ""Haywire"", and her muscular brawn sets her well apart from the other supposedly tough chicks. Even Rodriguez is outmatched by a woman twice her size, but uses dirty tricks to even the odds in their various encounters.<br/><br/>This instalment is good dirty fun, and delivers what its inspiration, the 007 series, used to before they decided that it was all somehow beneath them (good luck on the future there guys!) The ending returns to the series roots, with the Toretto's Italian-American family values at play in a round table barbecue, but of course it won't end there, not yet at least.<br/><br/>The ending, which retcons ""Tokyo Drift"" (which finally happens in this continuity) sees the arrival of a new adversary for episode 7 – The Transporter!<br/><br/>Roll on Fast and Furious 7 – And along with Mission Impossible take 007's mantle and give us something to look forward to in a couple of years time!"

Think about it, they went to save Mia and get Letty, a member of family died trying to do that but no one cared afterwards. Really in real life I would be so mad and maybe turn against them. Hope this is not next FF, where Han does this.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the move but this thing at the end made me think how whole crew could now say something about it and let it air this way. I had to make this whole explanation, but short one is : You cannot kill a key player like that, I mean its not about killing but its all about not mentioning, I was praying for her to appear at the end but no.

"Ladiloque","1","5","13","31 May 2013"," De gustibus...
","To start with: I'm a film amateur and I appreciate those old fashioned films that nearly no one bears. Given this preamble I have to say I'm really astonished by the votes here on IMDb. I give this film the worst possible vote not since it deserves it but just to push a balanced judgement as it's now on cinema and the actual average is 6,5 (I'd give it a 4-5). The film is a standard B-movie with the standard ingredients of the series. Races, pursuits, and everything authors could think when dealing with cars. Add some nice guys, some nice girls, a bad guy and expect authors to force their minds to find something more engaging than the 5th film finale (I admit it: 5th film final 10 minutes scene was really good from an action film perspective). Everything is predictable. Irony tries to be there but fails. Characters seem to follow a 200y old theater script. This seems to be just the summary of what producers think about the audience of their series: vroom, boom, bang, boobs, lol. Not good at all. I could give it a 6 only if I'd be with no money and I'd need to justify myself after spending my last 10 dollars on this flick. Fortunately I'm not so desperate."
"artgutierrez","1","3","7","15 November 2017"," Too much incredulous stupidity for me to handle
","I can handle a certain amount of incredulous stupidity in film, if it entertains. But when a movie like FF6 blatantly abuses that limit of incredulous stupidity, I tune out.<br/><br/>I only paid to see FF1 and FF2 in theaters. After that, I have only watched the rest of these ridiculous sequels for free on cable TV. I figured that I can handle the stupidity if it is free and it entertains.<br/><br/>But the entire time you watch this movie, you will not be entertained. You will be constantly asking yourself ""do the people who make this movie think I'm THAT stupid??""<br/><br/>There are ""turn off your brain movies"", and then there's this overblown turd which amplifies the stupidity x100. I won't bother giving a plot review because there is no plot. I won't bother commenting on the acting, because there is none.<br/><br/>All I'm saying is this.... If you're going to make a movie to entertain me, don't insult my intelligence this blatantly."

","Enthralling car chases , heavy-duty action scenes coupled with live- action heroes like Rock and Vin Diesel is what defines Fast & Furious 6. Fasten your seat belt cause this one gonna blow your mind !!!<br/><br/>Hobbs gathers Dom & team to track down an international mastermind Shaw who is designing a tech bomb which is capable of blocking the entire military communication grid. <br/><br/>From the director of Tokyo Drift and Fast Five , Justin Lin gives you yet another knockout core action film which is breath-taking and stunning. The story is simple but it is execution part which is effective. Though the screenplay falters especially the runway action sequence ( which never ends :) ) but the gripping performance and well- choreographed stunts will keep you entertained. Cinematography is excellent . Art direction is spellbinding. Editing could have been better. It is Vin Diesel and The Rock which steal your heart with captivating performances. Paul Walker and Michelle Rodriguez lends in good support. I liked the fight scene displayed by Gina Carano ( MMA fighter featured as actress in HayWire(2011))<br/><br/>Overall , I liked Fast & Furious 6 with high volatile action , cool car chase and strong performances by entire star cast.

","Watched it 4 times already! Fast and furious 6 is equal with fast and furious one (fast 1 would only win because when it came out it was new and cool). <br/><br/>The fast and furious franchise has, since number 4, improved dramatically in terms of screenplay, quality of acting, storyline and action sequences!<br/><br/>The coming together of the team again together with ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson, really brings the chemistry of the team to another level. Watching Brian and Dom work together to run the team works so well, and each team member really brings in a special element that they can add to the team.<br/><br/>The return of Letty to the franchise also helps to complete this and is good to see her character return to the story!<br/><br/>Fast Cars, Amazing Soundtracks, Awesome Stunts and action sequences, overflowing testosterone and classic one liners really make fast and furious 6 the great movie that it is! 10 out of 10!<br/><br/>Make sure you wait until the end of the credits!<br/><br/>There's a reason why this movie was number one in the world for two weeks!"

"sandiglendinning","6","3","7","16 June 2013"," Two bald men have a bromance!
","The Fast Family are all grown up, they've come a long way since we first met them back in the ancient days of yore, it fair brings a tear to one's eye.<br/><br/>'Loveable' idiot Roman is poncing around on a private jet full of smashing birds, Han is in Japan eating some Spam, Tej is giving away his dollars like they are Specsavers 2-4-1 flyers, Dom is getting over Letty by getting his leg over Elena. Brian has even had a baby. Well I never! Everything is going just fabulously until anally-retentive lunatic Hobbs (yup it's the Rock) shows up with a recent photo of Letty claiming that everyone's favourite scowly- faced Latina has been sighted in London guv'ner! After muttering some clever things about needing wolves to hunt wolves Hobbs scuttles off for a word with Dom, it seems there is a nasty terrorist/crime-lord/Englishman running around London stealing gizmos to build a world exploding machine. Unable to resist the Letty-bait, Dom assembles his troops and off the Fast Clan go to dreary old England to find Letty, save the world and earn themselves pardons.<br/><br/>Next as ever, there are some car chases in some lovely shiny auto mobiles, a street race, an impressive range of ladies bottoms to gawp at and some funky music. Rita Ora pops up at one point like a sparkly street-race fairy to plant her magical seal of coolness fully on the baldy bonce of 40-something Dom. There are some fantastic fights between the Fast ladies in particular Letty and Riley in an epic battle of camel-toe fury which must be seen to be believed. There are laughs aplenty often at Roman's expense, it also seems that the Fast crew's nickname for Hobbs is 'Samoan Thor' which weirdly does suit him.<br/><br/>For Fast fans, there is more of the same Fast formula- and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, if it ain't broke don't fix it. What makes this particular outing in the Fast saga distinct from all of the others however is a beautiful bromance between Dom and Hobbs which punctuates the narrative from beginning to end. This culminates in full male bonding toward the conclusion of the piece. The emotional depth and authentic beauty of this relationship should not be underestimated. This element of the plot is also a twist as after all this time I was truly expecting that Dom would finally get it on with the Dodge Charger or maybe the Mustang. It seems that the love that dares not speak it's name 'twixt man and car must be reserved for the inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>Fast 6 is exceptionally entertaining. If you are a human and you have eyes you will probably find it an enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours. It is also exceptionally silly. This is a film which is unapologetically about fun and escapism, it doesn't claim to be clever so do not expect it to be! If you sit down to watch it accepting these truths you will leave a very happy punter. If not don't bother."

They should have just made them all drag racing super heroes instead this, it was too gimmicky. A three because there were some funny witty moments but overall not a must see at all, would only recommend seeing if its a gift card you are trying to use.<br/><br/>I was not a fan of the serious at all, and to be honest with all of you this is the VERY FIRST of the series I see. I am do not watch these types of films with far fetched intertwined over the top plots that later on make all the characters become involved in very elusive almost cartoonish stunts.

","The sixth movie of the fast and furious franchise continues on the new path that the franchise took with fast five. Toretto has gone from being a local street racer to the master mind of a heist of 100 million dollars. That sort of transformation is what the franchise has become, it isn't about street racing anymore. I am not condemning nor praising this transformation, just merely pointing it out. The rush of NOS is gone and instead we have the rush of hand to hand combat and gun fights.<br/><br/>The movie starts with all the people from the previous movie(except for Leo and Santos) enjoying their life but Toretto decides to stop that because its time start a plot rolling. Hobbs who now wants to team up with Torreto's team (despite the incident at the end of the last movie) to stop the master criminal Shaw.<br/><br/>The movie is hard to talk about without spoiling it so I will say that the movie is ridiculous and if that intrigues you, then go see it!"
"Scarecrow-88","6","2","4","6 September 2014"," Fast & Furious 6
","Well, another Fast and Furious, another guaranteed number of fast cars put to great use in the artform of elaborate crashing and explosions. The plot has a maniac named Sam Shaw (Luke Evans) with a group of terrorists who plan to gain access to a chip that, once applied to a specific device, would knock out a power grid of an area of length certain to create a cascading effect that would cripple this said area with unimaginable death and violence. Michelle Rodriguez returns to the franchise as Dom's (Vin Diesel) love interest, Letty. She has no memory of the Dom family and is a part of Sam's crew. The Rock returns again as ""Domestic Security Service"" cop, with extreme fighter Gina Carano making her series debut as his partner. They are offering amnesty and freedom to Dom and his gang in order to help them catch Sam and stop him from attaining the chip he desires. What ensues is a tank on a freeway, speedy racecars flying down London streets, a giant attempt to halt the ascent of a massive cargo plane at night, and Dom engaging in a race with Letty for old-time's sake. Seeing Rodriguez and Carano duking it out twice was cool, and the humorous banter between Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson led to some fine zingers. Of course, Paul Walker's Brian and Dom will have to rescue Jordana Brewster's Mia from captivity, and as often is the case in sequels, members of the crew representing Dom tragically leave the series. But I thought one of the nice additions to the series (in the previous film, Fast Five), Elsa Pataky's Elena is sadly wasted, and having so many characters in one film means the star power must take a somewhat back seat (The Rock gets to flex his pecs and fight this gargantuan behemoth henchman, but his badass cop isn't featured as extensively). Even Walker isn't quite as substantial to the film, although he does sacrifice possible jail time as a fugitive to extradite information ""on the inside"" from a low-life drug kingpin associated with Shaw. But he's relegated to behind the wheel avoiding calamity as cars flip towards him. I think that's a good bit of what you see (or sadly, in the case, at night when you have to squint a lot and create a lot in your imagination as visibility is tiresome): cars flipping towards other cars in mid air. That and cars landing on roads, sustaining the usual loss that occurs when metal meets asphalt at high velocity. All the regs from the last installment (Sung Kang and Gal Gadot as the thieves who became a couple and joined Dom's family) show up here to help out Dom and Brian. The end chase with the plane in the dark couldn't match the quality of Fast Five (the tank does add bonus points to the mix but that damned vault was awesome!), and the climatic car crashes that result need to really impact with a big bang. Night chosen for this doesn't help add pizazz to the big bang."
"stephenlovelette","5","2","4","28 June 2014"," As bad as you'd think.
","Perhaps I've no right reviewing the sixth movie in a series when I'm only acquainted with One through Three. I am literally so lost at the beginning of this film I can't even tell you.<br/><br/>I want to give it a shot. I've heard from several reliable sources that it's ""not as bad as you'd think.""<br/><br/>I'm a sucker for liking movies of this sort. The X-Men films are the best examples coming to mind.<br/><br/>However Fast & Furious 6 is just as bad as I'd think.<br/><br/>There are a few good shots, a couple cinematic moments. But I was hoping for even more eye candy in exchange for 130 minutes of my time.<br/><br/>I support these efforts. You can tell they're trying to craft intriguing and believable plot lines.<br/><br/>But try as I might, I simply can't buy into the story. I think my ineptitude in the automotive universe is what gets me. There's not enough of the ""Wow"" feeling when certain cars are revealed.<br/><br/>Paul Walker and Ludicrous turn in some of the best acting performances in this film. Sung Kang and Gal Gadot, my favorite characters, are also really great. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson turns in a solid performance for the writing he's given.<br/><br/>He's a cop who tears apart an interrogation room while beating up a witness at the very beginning of the film. (It's at this point I realize that it's going to be one of those types of movies.)<br/><br/>That Dwayne is turning into quite the acting talent. I appreciate his commitment to the craft. He never mails it in. Good on ya, Mr. Johnson!<br/><br/>Speaking of mailing it in, Tyrese is not up to his usual par. I usually like him, and I know he's playing a certain character (which might not be written all that well) but his performance detracts from Fast 6. And I'm sorry to say that.<br/><br/>All in all, there are a lot of hokey scenes, and personally I will never revisit the sixth installation. But if you can stomach irksome acting and weak plot structure in exchange for flashy car chases and decent action, more power to you.<br/><br/>Fast 6 clocks in at 5 stars for me, positing it in the 'just barely unwatchable' category. <br/><br/>So car fanatics; have at it!<br/><br/>Just don't come crying to me when the acting and storyline aren't up to snuff.<br/><br/>Beware the spoilers lurking below.<br/><br/>I admire what they're doing with the Fast & Furious series. They're trying to keep an elite cast of characters (well-liked by a certain audience) and retell different stories throughout the franchise's lifetime.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's time for a prequel. A shorter, more focused tale, that doesn't take place on such a grand scale.<br/><br/>Enough speculating, because according to the scene during the credit sequence (that's right, I waited!) one of my favorite characters gets killed at the beginning of the next film. By none other than Jason Statham.<br/><br/>Which is awesome in it's own way.<br/><br/>But it's also super lame. For this reason:<br/><br/>I pick up two favorite characters (both relative unknowns) and they both die by the end of the rolling credits.<br/><br/>Why? Because it creates the illusion of plot depth.<br/><br/>There are twists and turns that slightly justify the unbelievable moments (such as Michelle Rodriguez joining the evil squad because of memory loss, or her character asking Vin Diesel if he knew there'd be a car to cushion their fall). In this way, the writers are trying to lessen the effort the audience must put forth in suspending their disbelief.<br/><br/>So during the climactic sequence, a character must die, because how could they possibly succeed otherwise? And in order to tease the next movie, they must kill another character to create tension and suspense.<br/><br/>But in doing so, they're only willing to let go of the two most disposable characters in the cast.<br/><br/>To me, this illustrates sloppy writing.<br/><br/>My basic, overall reaction to Fast 6 is, ""Fine. But can't this be done better?"""

"jaywensley2004","2","2","4","18 March 2014"," What's to review?
","This is not a movie, its a clip-show of stunts. There's not a lot of point in reviewing ""Fast & Furious 6"" because nobody is going to watch this as a movie; you'll watch it to see the stunts and you'll watch it for only as long as the escalating scope and scale of those stunts can hold your attention. For what its worth, the heart of the (I use this term loosely) plot is a mcguffin. Usually this device is used to drive a story; in the case of ""F&F 6"" the only thing it drives is cars, trucks, a plane and...uhm, no, that might count as a spoiler. Let's just say there's a sequence that is a militarist's wet dream and walk away. No character development, an awesome array of destruction, no wit, no sense, and dialogue unworthy of an 8th grade melodrama. But we do get to watch, listen and cringe as Vin Diesel tries to do sensitive and romantic. THAT'S worth something. But in the end, remember that Paul Walker died making ""F&F 6,"" and that is both tragic and ironic."
"cosmo_tiger","4","2","4","9 December 2013"," Fans of the series will like this. I found it too ridiculous to get into. The chases were so unbelievable it was almost laughable.
","""You wanna catch wolves, you need wolves."" After their heist made the gang all rich they have all settled in nicely to normal life but not in the US. When Hobbs (Johnson) needs a way to catch a criminal mastermind there is only one call he makes. Dom (Diesel) and Brian (Walker) get the crew together again but this time they are working with the law. This is a movie that doesn't really need much said about it to convince you to watch or not watch. Since it is the 6th in the series you have either kept up or not. That said...I have seen all of them and only really liked the 5th one because it was more of a heist movie then ""I have car, I go fast."" I know what your thinking...if you don't like it don't watch, on the other hand I can't really talk about it if I don't watch them. This one was, how do I put this...not good. The plot seemed OK, help catch the bad guy and you can go home. The problem is that this seemed to be that last thing on the movies mind. Five minutes after they agree to catch him they find him, and let him go. Then Dom and Hobbs meet him face to face, and let him go. The only way to catch this guy is only during long car chase after long car chase. The stunts and chases got more and more absurd to the point of being laughable. ***SPOILER*** Taking down a TANK with a smashed up Mustang to taking down a PLANE with a car that looked like a GEO Tracker on a runway that must have been 60 miles long. I mean seriously! ***SPOILER OVER*** There are also so many people jumping onto moving cars I lost count. I will again say I am not a fan of this series...and this movie is an example of why. Overall, fans of the series will like it, I struggle to find anything good to say...even the dialog is bad. I give it a C."
"dinalt10","5","2","4","19 September 2013"," What happened ?
","Yes it's an action film...........so you don't expect a script worthy of Shakespeare.<br/><br/>But seriously, there's barely any character development in this film whatsoever - and the script is so basic it's totally unbelievable.<br/><br/>###########Spoilers ahead################# The franchise has never been known for realism - just think of the safe scene in number 5.<br/><br/>But it's generally always been an enjoyable ride - fun characters, great action and excellent car chases.<br/><br/>This film fell flat for me - the action scenes ironically overpowered the film, leaving what was left feeling empty.<br/><br/>Starts off well, but soon becomes just an expensive reel of stunt after stunt.<br/><br/>And the majority of the cast were barely used. Most of the script just involved The Rock, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.<br/><br/>And a couple of the action sequences weren't even believable - you can suspend belief so far, but this was taking it to extremes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately those action sequences were the 'big' ones............the tank leaving a trail of destruction and the finale featuring the longest take off in history!!!! The tank being totalled after the car it was towing went over the bridge, and the finale with the aircraft chase going on forever.<br/><br/>I mean seriously - the plane touched down partway down the runway, didn't stop and carried on at near take off speed forever.<br/><br/>Visually impressive, but not at all realistic. And that was the problem with the scene, no sense of suspense or even attempted realism.<br/><br/>Then there were the character moments. Vin Diesel pulling a bullet out of himself with no hint of a whimper, and cars rolling all over the place - but no hint of even a graze or limp afterwards.<br/><br/>Worst part for me anyway though was the quick death of Han and Giseles relationship. May just be me, but their relationship seemed the most real - yet Gisele dies in the blink of an eye...........and no funeral, not even a look for the body in case she survived.<br/><br/>Then you've got Paul Walkers character infiltrating a prison, getting into solitary and then (seemingly) just walking out and flying back to London.<br/><br/>So gets a 5 from me. Looks like they've already got number 7 lined up from the ending, but it'll need a far better script to get me hooked.<br/><br/>Series should really have ended at number 5."
"miladed","4","2","4","9 September 2013"," The last 40 minutes was ridiculous.
","First of all, I'm gonna say I'm not that huge of a F&F fan, and I'm not sure how true fans feel about this, I'm just reviewing from a logical point of view.<br/><br/>The film starts nicely, the whole crew is relaxing with all the fortune acquired from the previous film, and things are going smooth. Then you see Hobbs, investigating an attack on a military convoy in Russia, and he knows who has done it, and with Letty alive, he knows where to look for help. He gets Dom and his crew's help and with some intelligence Hobbs has acquired, they track Shaw in London. They have trouble capturing Shaw as you would imagine, and after a race between Letty and Dom where he threatens Dom's family afterward, the ridiculousness starts. Shaw wants some computer chip that is apparently inside a tank, but you'll find that out later. This chip is in a NATO military base in Spain. Somebody working for Shaw infiltrates the base, he is captured, so Hobbs and the commander of the base decide to follow protocol and move the component, with a ridiculously under-powered convoy. Just two jeeps and a truck, that are so incompetent they can defend themselves from 4 guys attacking them with another jeep. Anyway, Shaw, Letty and one of his men, that apparently has learned how to operate a tank somewhere, literally drive out of the truck carrying the tank and start rolling over and shooting up innocent people, when Letty protests their acts. The tanks chews up cars and move true the highway, the crew are deciding what to do, until Roman drive to the front of the tank and has to hit the brakes because of an oncoming car, yet for some reason, his 1970s Mustang is not instantly crushed under the tank, but it can be explained because the car was moving fast and it didn't hit the tank's tracks, so it's not that off. Roman hooks the car to the tanks with a cable and jumps in Brian's car, and they decide to use the tank as an anchor to stop the tank. Through effort, the throw the remains of the Mustang down a bridge and as they thought, the car acts as an anchor and tanks is overturned, not like it is 80 tons or anything. So they capture Shaw. And now it gets even more ridiculous. As one would expect, Shaw has a backup plan. He has taken Mia hostage. The commander of the base says, naturally, it changes nothing. Then, suddenly, Hobbs pulls out his revolver and puts it to the commander's head and say ""It changes everything."", and they decide to let a world class criminal, capable of killing millions of people go, with the military chip that will make him capable of that. Yeah, right. NO ONE would risk millions of lives for somebody they don't even know! I wouldn't do it for the love of my life! But, then again, it's a movie, so these things are expected. Shaw starts fleeing, though he had warned them he would kill Mia if he sees them pursuing him, Tej jams the phones and they start to follow him. Then out of nowhere, conjures an Antonove An-124 that has been able to dodge all the defense systems and land in a freaking military base. Here's where the most ridiculous action scene in history of film making starts. The Runway appears to be 40 km long, while the longest runway in the world is 5.5 km and it's in China. Anyway, Dom manages to board the plane after Shaw, with Hobbs following him. And they start to fight, all of them. the rest of the crew is on the ground and tries to shoot the plane's flaps with harpoons they had acquired previously. Some manage to shoot the wings of the plane, and are unsuccessful. Then Brian and Mia getaway from the plane in a small Alpha Romeo, and with a harpoon that I don't know where they acquired from, manage to shoot the one of the flaps of that gigantic plane, while it's been trying to take off with its nose in the air for the last five minutes. The small Alpha Romeo manges to pull down the flaps, and plane starts going down, and breaks like it's made of freaking plastic. Oh and Gisele died in the middle of all this. The film ends with the whole 'family' having barbecue, and I believe they want to have a 7th movie. I hope that won't be as ridiculous."
"pijavica","3","2","4","20 July 2013"," Brainless action with colorful cars, tanks and planes...

Mix that, ad few explosions, and you have Furious 6...<br/><br/>This is a B movie that won a Jackpot and spend it all on visual effects. And underneath the sparkles it is still B movie with B movie actors, B movie script and shiny, but completely unbelievable action.<br/><br/>Acting is wooden and most actors deliver their lines like they don't believe whats coming out of their mouths. Script is full of plot holes, plain stupidity and attacks on logic. Action scenes are just plain old fist-fighting and marshal arts bore, or elaborate stunts involving various forms of vehicles at high speeds and no considerations for laws of physics at all...<br/><br/>I believe it's possible to make action movies that are not insulting viewers intelligence.

They have 6 about to be 7 of these and it is still awesome. Usually sequels don't last after the third one but this one is at 6 and it is still an outstanding movie. I don't know anyone who wouldn't like this movie. I also think this it one of the best movies I've seen and I can't wait for the seventh to be released but I hope the fact that it's a different director doesn't change it in any way.

From the montage video in the title song (We Own It) including important scenes from all the movies (except Tokyo Drift) - the series finally connects Tokyo Drift to Fast 5. The stunt scenes including the tank are one of the best ones I have seen ever. And the emotional side of Vinn Diesel is one of the best. Its sad that they took Han and Gisele out of the equation, since they are one of the coolest people in the movie. This movie is definitely the finest Fast and Furious Movie ever. Loved it.

"JohnRayPeterson","8","2","4","11 June 2013"," Michelle Rodriguez and Gina Carano worth the price of admission
","For those who've watched all six of the episodes, we have to admit that the second and third instalments were a let down from the initial and innovative first of the run (pun intended). When the fourth instalment reunited the Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Connor characters, along with some of the old gang, things started picking up again and the stage was set for the next two (and third 2014) episodes which are the most interesting and fun ones to watch thus far.<br/><br/>In episode five, the addition of Dwayne Johnson to the series, and the setting in Rio, made for the best improvement and comeback of a series yet, in my opinion. The family, extended kind of course, loyalty theme came into its own as originally championed in the very first movie and the prospect of the next episode with much of the full crew promised to be a winner; it is.<br/><br/>The action and the twists we come to almost predict, is present just like the fans want it. The return of Letty, played by Michelle Rodriguez was a welcome site, even if the character has lost memory of the past, the spunk and sensual appeal of the character is there in fine form. What I didn't expect was the addition (unfortunately it's only for this one episode) of Gina Carano. Carano has the credentials to play the action part her role required and she delivers very well. By the way, if you haven't seen her starring role in the movie Haywire, 2011, rent it.<br/><br/>Watching Carano and Rodriguez go at it not once but twice in no holds barred fight scenes was for me worth the price of admission. There are more fight scenes in this sequel of Fast & Furious than in previous ones; not that one would let the presence of Dwayne Johnson go to waste, right. We are also sort of spoiled because in the sixth episode, the action and story take place in more than one country. Watch the previous one before you catch this one; they go very well together."
"troy-manatunga","9","2","4","10 June 2013"," There is room for Justin Lin and the crew to blow our minds once again when they reunite for FAST 7!
","Brothers (In Laws) race down the scenic road of Canary Islands in Spain as Mia gives birth to her baby boy. Brian a father now and Dom and the rest of the wanted crew have retired since their near unbelievable heist in Rio. Settled into a good life they all have left their pasts behind them whilst still holding onto the passion of pushing the pedal to the metal. The Samoan Thor; Hobbs turns up at Doms front door seeking help to bring to justice a gang of criminals headed by a ruthless ex-mercenary by the name of Shaw. Hobbs' main vantage was a photo inside the brown case envelope that he hands to Dom which has a photo of his old flame Letty who was presumed dead in FAST & FURIOUS (The 4th Movie). If it matters to Dom it matters to his entire crew. All hands once again on deck for an even more faster and an even more furious-er FAST & FURIOUS 6. This is round 4 for Justin Lin with this franchise which is over 12 years old. For 6 years he has pushed the limits further and further toy-ing the thin boundaries of reality and fantasy. The first scene from FAST 5 and every scene from F&F 6 make me wonder if his nitrous powered franchise would burn out. Just as one may look at a Nissan GTR fly by and say ""that's unbelievable"" , the audience will not stop thinking the same but then caught up in the brilliance of the moments simply believe. How Lin and the cast does this only they can explain. I just sat their mesmerized, entertained and at the edge of my seat the whole way. The franchise has never been about a genius plot. It's always been about the grease, nuts and powerful engines roaring under the hoods. The franchise breathed new life in American Muscle Cars worldwide bringing up trends and lifestyles of street racing. F&F 6 mixes the old and the new all up once again and revisits the beginning from 12 years ago, racing for pink slips, hot pursuits and reinventing cars. Computer Generated Imagery plays a pivotal role as most of the stunts require serious if not complete CGI assistance. The distance reached out by the stunt team is massive and every minute of their effort will be worth it when you see the Dodge and the Skylines take to the streets. There is only so much I can discuss without spoiling this for you. So if you have not watched the movie as yet get to it right now. A final comparison needs to be done since FAST 5 is my all time favorite so far. Let me wrap up by saying the heist in Rio has not been outdone as yet. There is room for Justin Lin and the crew to blow our minds once again when they reunite for FAST 7!

","I'll admit I was always a fan of the Fast and Furious series, but I wasn't a true lover of the series until it was revamped in 2009 with Fast & Furious; from there the series took off and became bigger and better.<br/><br/>With that, Fast Six was a great flick don't get me wrong, the action, the story, and the cars were great, but I feel the movie was slightly too long and dragged out. I feel if they stuck to the pace of Fast Five, the film would have been perfect<br/><br/>The Pros: The cars were great! The actors sexy and believable and the action bigger and better than the predecessors.The sets amazing! had this been a straight racing movie, I feel the film would have fallen flat and not been as great.<br/><br/>The Cons: The story had potential, it made sense and was definitely obtainable, having said that the story had too much going on that made the film jump around and wasn't cohesive. The action while amazing, was insane and probably would never happen in a real life setting (still was amazing to watch).<br/><br/>Regardless of the cons that didn't float my boat, I still loved the movie and it was a pleasure to watch, i'm super stoked for Fast 7, if you want a taste of Fast 7 go watch Fast 6, enjoy a great car action movie and have a good time."
"kunalkhandwala","7","2","4","1 June 2013"," Furious entertainment unleashed by cars and stars
","You won't queue up for it's first show. You won't gather a group of 10 friends to go watch it on Saturday evening. You won't spend extra on 3D and IMAX ever on this series but you will surely buy some popcorn because 'Fast and Furious' is one of the most entertaining franchises ever. By now, you know what to expect in terms of some sizable destruction of cars and assets, stunts that defy laws of physics and the scorching pace at which you can drive through densely populated cities. None of which is possible in reality but yet, there is something about this group that makes you want it to be real. Justin Lin has directed 3 of the more memorable F&F movies and this time too, he gets the combination accurately with just the right amount of hot women, sexy cars and high octane action. Buckle up for this fun ride. <br/><br/>The opening sequence seems like a James Bond movie with a Dodge Challenger and Nissan Skyline racing along the Spanish coast, reflecting the carefree lives of now millionaires, Dominic and Brian. Shortly thereafter, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) surprises Dominic with a visit and a motive (Letty lives!) to join forces to crackdown on Owen Shaw (Luke Evans)'s mercenaries who have performed a series of audacious heists to assemble a devastating weapon. Hobbs attempts to re-unite the team to take on Shaw on the street level and win full pardons for their past crimes. The action proceeds onto London's streets with Dom and Brian in hot pursuit of Shaw's mercenaries. Thereafter, Dom and his blast from the past, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) scorch the streets of London in an epic race that leads to the revelation that she survived the explosion a few movies ago but lost her memory. Shaw was the one who rescued her and hired her as his top mercenary. Following such an emotionally pleasing scene, we move on to Spain where the components of the Nightshade device are being transported to a secure location but the convoy is brutally attacked by Shaw's forces who also tear through the oncoming traffic in a tank along the highway. The team defy the laws of physics, create more destruction than some Decepticons and save each other in the name of being a family. The climactic action is on a never-ending military runway with the massive bomber aircraft being kept on ground by a handful of super-cars and heroes. The inaneness of the action is jarring but the actors make it all entertaining by giving their best in every ridiculous scene. One can also credit Lin for reviving these characters in 'Fast Five' and adding some richness to their bond to make us feel for them every time they defy physics. <br/><br/>Justin Lin's fourth F&F venture is a super-charged engine aptly titled 'Furious 6' for it takes action, storyline, characterization and vehicular warfare to a higher level. As ridiculous as they may sometimes be, the sequences are bigger and more explosive with actors partaking in most of them. Hundreds of cars are sacrificed in the devastation that follows this team in their pursuit of Shaw and in their journey, we are given a better insight into their characters. When your expectations for a silly engine revving franchise are modest, the cars and humans can provide quite a rush of entertainment. <br/><br/>Dwayne Johnson looks like the Hulk. He can only fit into army grade vehicles including the Hummer now but with G.I.Joe and F&F franchises, he's made his mark in the genre as the massive Rock of action. Vin Diesel's career is all about Dominic Toretto now. With few dialogues and more stunts, his talent is optimized by this franchise. Paul Walker could've been an unknown were it not for his partnership with Diesel in their car chases. With fewer dialogues and subtle emotions of being a father, Walker does justice to his role and no more. Michelle Rodriguez is badass in this film. Apart from some MMA fighting with Gina Carano, Letty also gets to shoot and drive some while her character gets a grasp of her past and present. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous are funny but limited in exposure on screen. Luke Evans poses as quite a formidable villain, but we do not get to see much of his ruthless aggression since most of it is manifested in the manner of tanks and flip cars that create the destruction. Oh and please bring Gal Gadot back.... please.<br/><br/>With some crazy car chases in London and physics defying sequences in Spain and the airstrip, Fast & Furious 6 packs quite a few horses to satiate the enthusiast. The plot is typical and is played out in banal fashion with occasionally cheeky dialogues. But that's not the point of this franchise. It's the super-cars, women, action and hip hop music that the protagonists roll out to in the drag race arena that will bring you back for more.... Speaking of which, there's a nice cliff-hanger to F&F 7 after the end so remain seated with the belts still on.<br/><br/><ul><li>7.853 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","At first when I heard the song ""We Own It(Wiz Khalifa ft. 2 Chainz)"" playing at the starting credits of the movie which is a collage of first 5 films, I said to myself, ""I have got my money's worth"". Fast and Furious 6 brings out an ensemble cast along with amazing action.<br/><br/>In this movie, Hobbs(Dwayne Johnson) seeks the help of Torreto(Diesel) to catch a criminal named Shaw(Evans) by offering him to reunite him with Letty(Rodriguez) who was presumed dead. Then on its the story how Torreto assesmbles the team and takes on Shaw, along with trying his best efforts to get back Letty. The story doesn't have much to it, but its the action sequences with some nest jaw dropping moments in recent times along with one-liners, keeps you entertained. There are few over the top sequences, but Fast and Furious fans are not gonna mind that.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, essay their roles with ease. In this part we see a lot of action from Dwayne Johnson and trust me its good. Gina Carano's fights are cool. But its Tyrese Gibson with his funny and loud-mouthed Roman Pearce who wins your hearts and a special mention to Ludicrous who has some witty dialogues.<br/><br/>Director Justin Lin shows how genius he is at the end when he connects some missing links. Overalll Fast and Furious 6 is another super 'add-on' to one of the enthralling movie franchisees. Go and sit in the Driver's seat!"

","Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is officially the new Arnold Schwarzenegger. But more importantly, the person in charge of keeping The Rock bicep-deep in arm butter should get some Executive Producer credits and be deemed the new hardest working man in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Under the direction of Justin Lin, ""Fast & Furious 6"" sees the return of almost everyone from ""Fast Five""; including Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, etc. as they come together for one last job...again. Also joining the crew is Gina Carano as Hobbs' assistant (and my future wife) who is apparently given free rein to go MMA on everyone she sees fit. And returning (because she's got nothing better to do) is Michelle Rodriguez, in a storyline less focused on, the better.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Duhhhhhh.Fast cars go fast.<br/><br/>Why the movie works: This is clearly Lin's best visual stab at the franchise yet, as he not only creates the best things-blow-up climax to come out of any of these films, but also (for the second time in a row) gives his audiences exactly what they came to see. Lin does a brilliant job of making sure there is either a car driving fast, a woman in a bikini, or the Rock giving someone the people's eyebrow and spouting off something fantastically WWE-ish, on the screen at all times. In fact, he has done so well with guiding this franchise into the realm of highly entertaining B movie fluff, that it is a wonder why he is being replaced by horror director James Wan for the upcoming ""Fast & Furious 7"".<br/><br/>Side Note: I realize Lin did direct both ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" and ""Fast & Furious"" as well, but let's be honest, those movies are better left forgotten.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Aside from the fact that ""Fast & Furious 6"" is a tad too long, that Vin Diesel still calls what he does acting, that there is an odd body distortion phenomenon which happens when Diesel and The Rock stand next to each other and that the storyline doesn't really matter (especially the more sentimental sections) I'm not ashamed to say that I was thoroughly entertained as I walked out of the theater. And while I realize that this is a lot to look past, if you are the type to spend your hard earned money on a movie entitled ""Fast & Furious 6""; a movie which is filled with unbelievable, yet well constructed, high flying, auto-centric stunts and enough comic relief to get the casual fan through, then this installment is clearly worth watching.<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

"Christian_Dimartino","7","2","4","27 May 2013"," It's dumb fun, and proud of it.
","I can honestly say that going into Fast & Furious 6, my expectations weren't exactly high. This is one film series that has gone on for way too long. But America just keeps going to these demolition derbies, and they simply just aren't for me. But even I can't deny that I had a good time at the latest entry in the series. There is not a boring second in the damn thing. Plenty of stupid ones, but none boring. That is the thing about these movies: They are dumb, and they know it, and I admire that.<br/><br/>This time around, Hobbs (The Rock) asks Dom and Brian (Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, mainly here for a paycheck) to track down a guy named Shaw(Luke Evans). He promises them that if they succeed, he can give them a pardon. They don't want to do it, but one thing gets them on board: Dom's supposed dead wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is working for Shaw. Say what? <br/><br/>At times, it is over the top. But isn't that the point? There are some spectacular action sequences here, and basically everything else that you expect from these movies. The ass kickings (mainly left for MMA fighter Gina Carano from last year's under seen Haywire), the babes, the explosions. This is a movie that knows how to blow stuff up real good, and proud of it.<br/><br/>It is mindlessly entertaining, but I even gave into it this time. I liked it. Sue me, I don't care. It is a lot of fun. It is a good way to kill two hours. Hell, four hours. You may want to watch it twice in a row. Fast & Furious 6 is a lot of fun, and it actually sort of leaves you pumped for the 7th. Is the series overkill? Sure. Eliminate entries 2-4, and you have yourself a decent series. It isn't as good as something like Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol or Skyfall, but the actors are all having a good time. So is the audience. I can't believe I am saying this, but see it. I doubt my opinion will sway you, because you probably already have.<br/><br/>B"

","I think this one is the best in the series! It has action fast cars and great stunts. The franchise is just going to get better and better. I would make one change and that is to return to its roots, Drag racing and a bit less circuit racing. Don't get me wrong I love the movie but Drag racing is just so much more exciting. I was really pleased with the return of Michelle Rodríguez, I love her character. The car selection is great from the Nissan Skyline to the '74 Ford Escort RS2000. The casting is great all my favourite actors and actresses are back and looking good. The fight scenes where very well choreographed and very entertaining. And the way the audience is told about Letty was very well planned out and brilliantly executed."

","More than a decade has passed since the first ""Fast & Furious"", still like all series this one calls for whistles, applause and OMG moments.<br/><br/>Now, the movie sort of takes start from where it let off in the last flick. But the comparison ends then and there, this is a whole new thing.<br/><br/>Kudos to Justin Lin for making such a fantastic movie with an amazing star cast and not to forget the beautiful yet brawny CARS. This movie is much more than an eardrum tearing acceleration sounds or big muscled people delivering punchy dialogues, this movie is more emotional yet full of action. If you thought Fast & Furious 4 was emotional, you need to see this one. All actors did their job wonderfully as expected.<br/><br/>This is definitely one flick you should watch if you are a Fast & Furious series fan and if you are not then give it a try, you are bound to watch all of the series then. Brilliant flick, just plain brilliant.<br/><br/>And at last there are two things worth mentioning that would increase your appetite for this movie:- (i) The scene where Dom save Letty's life is breathtaking. (ii) Do not leave your seat when the movie ends, this too like the last one has a BIG surprise.<br/><br/>Enjoy the torque!!"

"stevendbeard","8","2","4","24 May 2013"," Summer Popcorn Movie
","I saw ""Fast & Furious 6"", starring Vin Diesel-XXX , Pitch Black, Dwayne Johnson-Pain & Gain, Tooth Fairy, Michelle Rodriguez-Machete, Resident Evil, Luke Evans-Immortals, Clash of the Titans-2010 and Gina Carano-Haywire, Blood and Bone.<br/><br/>Sometimes sequels will run out of steam as they go along and sometimes they continue to be watchable. This one is more than just watchable, it's still a summer popcorn movie. It is action packed with over the top stunts-jumping from moving cars to other moving cars, for example, not too believable, but fun to watch- but it also concentrates on the characters. Luke plays the bad guy here, a terrorist that is tearing up different countries in his pursuit of a weapon that will make him rich. Dwayne is the super-cop on his tail, but he is always one step behind him. Dwayne decides to enlist Vin and his team to help catch Luke. Oh yeah, Michelle-who supposedly died in an earlier movie-returns and she is working for Luke-it is explained how she pulled that off in flashbacks. Gina plays Dwayne's new partner and if you have ever seen Gina in action-see Haywire-then you know she can fight. Gina and Michelle have a couple of good dust-ups. There is a scene right after the credits start that perfectly sets up the next movie, introducing a major actor as a bad guy-I am a big fan of his. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and sexuality-no nudity and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"neil-476","8","2","4","24 May 2013"," Ridiculous, but very entertaining
","Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his fast car crew scored enough from a heist in Brazil in episode 5 to retire (but outside the USA, where they are all wanted). Then Interpol supercop Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) talks them into helping him catch someone who has a fast car crew who may be even better than Dom's, in order to prevent a maguffin which is worth billions to terrorists from falling into the wrong hands. The hook here is that Dom's missus Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who died in an earlier episode, appears not to be dead after all.<br/><br/>Once upon a time there was a movie about the street car racing sub-culture in Los Angeles - notwithstanding the appeal of fast cars (which don't really appeal to me), one would have expected this to be something with limited appeal. Yet here we are with the 6th in the series.<br/><br/>And, while no-one expects it to rank high in the Oscar nomination stakes, it is still an entertaining movie. It has no pretensions to be anything other than a spectacular, action-adventure romp.<br/><br/>This is why it can get away with several high-speed car chases on London streets which are, in places, strangely devoid of traffic, not to mention a lengthy sequence involving a cargo plane trying to take off on a runway which is at least 5 miles long (do the maths). Oh, and - best of all - the most preposterous and exhilarating rescue since Arnie hauled Jamie Lee Curtis out of a limo in True Lies. I nearly cheered.<br/><br/>Roll on episode 7!"
"chrysoberylz","8","2","4","22 May 2013"," They Got A Tank!
","No doubt that Fast & Furious franchise is the best in its genre (action, fast cars, adrenaline rush!), although Transporter franchise is also good. Justin Lin once again succeeded in bringing us a movie which is not just about fast cars and nitro packs everywhere, but he can also give character development. Like he did to Letty, who suffered from amnesia. But I must admit that it is a typical storyline of one character's memory loss.<br/><br/>The movie began with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Riley (Gina Carano) in Russia, awesome opening credit containing clips from 5 previous movies which drowned us in nostalgia, then Mia (Jordana Brewster) was about to give birth, Brian (Paul Walker) rushed to be on her side, then Dom (Vin Diesel) and Elena (Elsa Pataky) in their house, suddenly Hobbs showed up offering Dom a ""new job"", Dom called all his team, all his team were enjoying their wealth from the last Brazilian Job, the team united again and met the antagonist, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) with the help from Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and some other crews. Joe Taslim as Jah was also Shaw's crew. I'm proud of him as an Indonesian, and he got quite a lot of screen portion. He beat Han (Sung Kang) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson), too. But too bad that Rico and Tego didn't appear in this movie. They are hilarious!<br/><br/>This movie is good, adrenaline rush from the fast cars racing, the late night street race in London was a beautiful moment. Yeah, and don't forget the double-decker too. It's not London if there is no double-decker. Action, a (really little) bit of parkour, nitro packs, artillery, guns, fire, explosion, all the action movie lover will love this movie. You won't get sleepy at all during this movie because the sound effect is also amazing, bam in here, boom in there!<br/><br/>But some elements are just so predictable. Just like when Dom and Brian left Elena, Mia, and her baby, I know something gonna happen to the girls and the baby when the team were in London. It's true, Mia was abducted by Shaw and then, yeah, she was saved, but they lost Gisele (Gal Gadot). Han must have been depressed, but in the post-ending scene, Han died anyway, like in Tokyo Drift. But in this scene, Han was showed killed by Ian Shaw (Owen Shaw's brother) who was portrayed by.. Jason Statham! I know, it's about time Statham joined the cast of Fast & Furious.<br/><br/>And there are also many surprise elements in it; Riley was actually working for Shaw, Letty suffered from amnesia (I thought she just became evil), Gisele's death, and Dom saved Letty from falling (the best scene in the movie, made me almost screaming out loud). The most surprising is still the debut appearance of Jason Statham in the post-ending scene. The whole movie is just great, you don't have to think really much when watching this. Just enjoy the fast cars, hilarious scenes (mostly with Roman in it), sexy ladies on the night street car race, and the beautiful landscapes shot."

"dilipbts","8","0","0","10 June 2020"," Furious 6
","While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series. Once a franchise about car racing, ""Fast Five"" took an unexpected turn as a bank heist thriller in the vein of Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's 11,"" a welcomed change as seen by its huge box office earnings and critical success. Now, ""Furious 6"" is neither about car racing nor bank heists, but rather a terrorist threat with obvious inspirations from ""The Dark Knight."" Like ""Fast Five,"" the results are immensely satisfying and undeniably entertaining.<br/><br/>The key to the franchise's upward turn in quality is due to director Justin Lin. He is a skilled action director, and many filmmakers can learn a few things or two from him: The action sequences are impressive, engaging, comprehensible, and well-shot, with practical effects to boot. There is a sense of danger, verve, and life in these scenes rarely found in other films, despite how over-the-top and ridiculous they may be; and yes, they often drift into gratify-defying territory. While I usually don't react out loudly when watching a film, this film had me gasping, jaw dropping, laughing, and applauding, sometimes all at once!<br/><br/>Another ingredient to the film's success is the chemistry between the cast members. We have grown to love these characters over the course of the series that one cannot help but cheer on for them. In particular, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have such a terrific rapport with each other that they provide some of the film's biggest laughs and memorable one-liners. Additionally, Luke Evans is definitely a step up above the previous film's antagonist, and Gina Carano provides some great ass-kicking moments, although not much performance-wise. On another note, I want to mention how refreshing it is to see minority actors fill these roles. Certainly, the film's use of a diverse ensemble cast should be commended. As for the story, it's nothing special, but I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed; I did so more than I would like to admit.<br/><br/>If there's one thing to learn about this franchise, it's that some change can be a good thing. While the later sequels do focus away from the car racing, they still featured cars, which helped retain old fans while bringing in new ones. ""Furious 6"" is terrific entertainment, and judging by yet another dazzling cliffhanger and the audience's reaction, ""Fast & Furious 7"" will be an amazing finale for the series. Unfortunately, Justin Lin won't be back around for the last installment, but someone please get this man to direct every and all upcoming action flicks."
"twpain","7","0","0","6 June 2020"," Cool Movie
","This is a pretty good Furious entry. There is some good action sequences and characters. This film also has some really cool cars like the other films but I don't find Furious 6 as enjoyable and rewatchable as some of the other films."
"adam_evans14","5","0","0","1 June 2020"," Noticeably Sillier
","Firstly I'll state by saying fast and furious is my favourite in the series. Having fallen off the franchise for a bit I picked up years later and found that although there were some over the top sequences, the film felt more grounded, took its time to build up, and the motivations of each character made sense. Sadly, I can't say the same here. The film starts with the scene of a robbery and some hammy dialogue from the Rock who rolls off his partners CV rather than simply say hello like a normal person. After this it's declared there's a surviving witness who the rock proceeds to beat the hell out of with no consequences, all the while it shot as a bit of a joke. It was at this point I knew the tone of the film was going to be a problem.<br/><br/>So a little bit of a retcon takes place revealing lettie is alive to give Dom some much needed reason to come out of retirement and in fairness, what else were they going to do at this point? What bothered me is the ease in which Dom is tracked down by Hobbs and the inexcusable logic of Paul Walker; a new father feeling compelled to join in risking his life for the ride. He's actually egged on by his wife (girlfriend, I duno) and really does stretch my patience.<br/><br/>So the film gets going and familiar tropes of tracking people through vehicle mods all crop up again. The banters largely fun between the team as it was in the last film but I can't help but find the moments of silliness (the rocks dive from a freeway onto a vehicle roof) grate on me a little too much. My score usually is 6/10 if decent and 7/10 if solid.... But if this film was on TV I'd probably skip next time. So with that in mind I'm giving this a 5/10."

Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges and han get their back sides kicked in the underground are left with the snappy comedic relief, while Gina Carano, Gal Gadot, and Elas Pataky merely get to look feisty and hot in their action scenes (but at least they do a great job at it). As for Dwayne Johnson, he gives an unusually deadpan performance this time around, with only just a few outrageous outbursts of manly banter here and there. Nonetheless, the cast here is consistently entertaining, with the screenplay letting everyone get a chance to shine, even if some of them aren't quite as memorable as others. The script delivered an action moments with high explosions on an airplane that are not forgettable. I love that fight between Gina Carano & Michelle Rodriguez which it was tremendous. Getting to grips so much happing
The Budget: was massive 160mil but these films grosses keep going up with an opening in America of $97,375,245, and finished with$238,679,850 and

","Keeping up the momentum from the previous film, the sixth film in the Fast & Furious saga sees the return of Brian (Paul Walker) and Dom (Vin Diesel) as they're once again pulled into doing a job. This time to save Dom's supposedly dead girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez). And I have to say, it's good to have her back.<br/><br/>Pretty much everyone from the previous film is back, which means that the dream team is still holding strong and this film continues to build their bond together. Both one on one and as a team. And it's easily the best part of the film.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's still a Fast & Furious film. Meaning fast cars, hot chicas, good music and great action scenes. The fifth film took the action in this franchise to a much grandiose direction and this film keeps up the trend. And I have to say that I love it. The first few films were fine for what they were, but these last few films have simply been in a class of their own.<br/><br/>As for the villain, played by Luke Evans, I have to say that he could have been better. Evans is a talented actor and I've seen him pull off some really impressive characters, but this time he swung and missed. Part of that is the writing, no doubt. I'd actually go as far as three fourths. But some of that is on Evans as well. I simply didn't find him that threatening.<br/><br/>Still, if you've liked the franchise so far, this is more of the same goodness."

The brilliantly fun storytelling of five has taken a step back, but the action is still every bit as awesome, as are the character relationships. And did Diesel and Johnson ever get along?

Paul Walker is always an enjoyment to see, Vin Diesel not so much. I hated how he had no emotion in every scene. I remember seeing him in the Pacifier and he had so much energy when acting. It's just a disappointment. There weren't any stand out actors/actresses in this film.
The fights scenes were insane and awesome. Everyone did a great job. The scene with the tank was pretty unreal when watching it. However, the one scene I hated was when they killed off a character that had more meaning than the others to another character.

","The movie is faster than ever, it's a popcorn flick just like the previous one but that doesn't stop it from being great and being a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The movie gets pretty much straight to the point with ironing out the plot which was teased at the end of Fast Five. The team from Fast Five face there biggest challenge yet and Domonic (Vin Diesel) has to secure what he loves most while trying to look out for his friends and family.<br/><br/>The movie has some great action scenes with humor all the way through it, mainly from Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous and the odd one liners from Vin Diesel and Sung Kang. Despite very far fetched action which was crazily unrealistic at times it still didn't take away the fun, it just left you feeling, how the hell is that possible? That was my only real gripe with the movie but lets not forget, if these movies didn't have that sort of action that makes your jaw hit the floor in disbelief they'd be no where near as fun of enjoyable. I also was kind of let down by the bad guy in this film, maybe it's because I watched Star Trek Into Darkness and Benedict Cumberland was amazing as the villain, but really Luke Evan's was quite disappointing.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel is as awesome as ever, mainly due to him pulling off the super-human activities like they were nothing. Paul Walker didn't really do much for me though but the rest of the character really do put a great shift in. So really the cast were good for what they were in it for.<br/><br/>Overall I'd definitely go see this movie if you enjoyed any of the previous ones because this is on par with Fast Five, which for me was probably the best one. Enjoy this movie for what it is and don't go into the theater expecting to see Oscar worthy performances.<br/><br/>I'll give it an 8.

Granted it helped in some areas, such as the villains, but that doesn't mean everything needed improving. It does have its moments and when it shines, it shines, but it's not as good as 5. It is better than 1-4 and I can recommend you seeing it but I just feel it wanted to go bigger and better but only went bigger, and that thought hurt the film.<br/><br/>The story for this movie was over-bloated and it tried to go bigger than 5 but that harmed the movie. I really enjoyed 5 partly because it was Torretto and co doing what they do best and the fact it was just a great, fun heist movie that mixed the franchise up. 6 tried to turn them into international spies which tries to give bigger stakes and make the movies seem more grander than what they are. I do like how they attempt to interconnect all the movies 'individual stories' which one 'overarching narrative' and think it was pretty smart to do so.<br/><br/>Paul Walker was decent as Brian O'Connor. Vin Disel was not good as Dominic Torretto and I don't think lightning can strike twice. Dwayne Johnson was great as Hobbs and is still the stand out character. Michelle Rodriguez was fine as Letty but her twist was pretty lazily handled, as far as I'm concerned. Luke Evans was good as Owen Shaw and made Shaw the first good villain in the franchise. <br/><br/>Technically, the movie was passable. Some of the effects were pretty great but aside from that the cinematography and whatnot was fine.<br/><br/>This movie needed to provide fun action scenes and set pieces. This movie had SIX movies of bad villains weighing on its shoulders and it managed to create a passable villain in the form of Owen Shaw but it still felt like they were trying too hard.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie has some enjoyable moments and I do recommend you see it but it doesn't hold a candle to 5 but I suppose it couldn't live up to it.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Would Recommend"

They are on the same side at this point since Letti hasn't defected yet (quite possible Letti does not know about the double agent, meaning that this isn't a flaw) <br/><br/>-They find the paint from the compound inside the base BEFORE they head to the compound<br/><br/>-Vin Diesel can fly<br/><br/>-Steroid Chef Ramsay is not a parody of actual Chef Ramsay (also predictable fight with The Rock) <br/><br/>-Bad guys shoot little devices onto cars that: a) can override a motor b)are for whatever reason not packed with an explosive charge (they even had a remote to trigger them)<br/><br/>-The trip wire guns shoot chunks of metal into rock so hard that the wire stops an entire armoured truck from moving yet has little to no recoil<br/><br/>-They have vending machines in their super secret covert hidden base(those things are kept track of) <br/><br/>-The convoy to hide the chip from the bad guys known for using fast cars to do their work consisted of slow cars<br/><br/>-The convoy did not consist of a helicopter<br/><br/>-There was a tank inside the truck. <br/><br/>-The tank was armed and unmanned.<br/><br/>-The runway was a million friggen miles long<br/><br/>-Tokyo drift's girlfriend died predictably (it was predictable because they settled their conflict too early) <br/><br/>-Predictable wife kidnapping <br/><br/>-After sniper showdown Shaw drives away. Vin stands there and does nothing as The Rock leaves his sniper post to join him. They are both at the mercy of other sniper who does not shoot them for whatever reason. <br/><br/>-Super bad-ass antagonist Shaw is killed by freak accident. Very unsatisfying.<br/><br/>-Jeeps drive as fast as a plane can fly.<br/><br/>-Vin catches Letti in the air and completely reduces her speed rather than exploding into a rain of gore.<br/><br/>-Vin drives his car from the storage part of the plane out the cockpit<br/><br/>These are just the ones I can remember from the 20 minutes I spent on this. In short, this is a movie for dumb people. On the more optimistic side, the cars went fast, the ladies were buxom, and the fights were pretty cool. Did I mention steroid Ramsey? If you want a good rental to watch with a couple of buddies, this is it. If you want to feel stimulated, go watch something else."

","Fast & Furious 6 is the sequel to Fast Five (2011) and the sixth installment of the FAST & THE FURIOUS franchise. This film was in development by February 2010 as the first film in the series to move away from the underground car-racing theme of the previous films in the series which was considered to have placed a barrier on audience numbers. The film was released on May 24th, 2013 and grossed over $780 million dollars worldwide.<br/><br/>The plot follows Dominic Toretto and his crew who has retired following their successful heist in the fifth film, but remain wanted fugitives until they return to the USA at the end of this film. USS Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs offers to clear their records and allow them to return home in exchange for helping him to take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw, one member of which Toretto's presumed-dead lover Letty Ortiz. They save Letty, but Mia is kidnapped by Shaw's team and this leads into a super-intense conclusion.<br/><br/>The story is really well-thought out, but there are a few flaws but that does not stop this movie from being really good. Some of the dialog does not make any sense, but some of the jokes and dialog by the cast makes a lot of sense in some of the movie really cool. A few lines are also really quotable lines especially with our main antagonist when he reminds Dom and the crew saying, ""This code you live by, is the very reason why you weren't even in the game."" The action is a little over-the-top but it stills keeps me interested. However, the second car chase in the middle of the film was way too destructive in this film, but I really liked it though. But did you really had to try and kill Letty by throwing her off a tank? No. I will admit, the ending 12 or 14 minute climactic car-chase sequence is pretty awesome with a mix of CGI, pre-visualization, stunt work and live-action footage.<br/><br/>The acting is a little confusing, but I will give credit to our main actors: Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs, Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto, Sung Kang and Gal Gadot as Han Seoul-Oh and Gisele Yashar, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous as Roman Peace and Tej Parker and of course, Elsa Pataky, Chris Hemsworth's real life wife, as Elena Neves. They all do a good job. John Ortiz returns as Braga and he does a good job, but he is only in the prison scenes. Gina Carano plays Riley and she does a great job as a villain, at the end, but even then she's a mixed-martial arts fighter and her performance is over-the-top in a few areas, but she keeps me interested in her character until she is killed by Letty.<br/><br/>Our villain is British newcomer, Luke Evans as the role of Owen Shaw, the brother of the next villain, who is revealed as Han's killer at the end of this film in a post-credits scene that sets up FURIOUS 7 fantastically as the evil Deckard Shaw, who calls Dominic with a threatening message: ""Dominic Toretto, you don't know me. But you're about to."" The music is composed by Lucas Vidal and I am confused because I like Brian Tyler's musical score for the other films in the series, even Furious 7. I don't like half of Vidal's score, but I am glad some of Brian Tyler's music is present in this film.<br/><br/>Also, I am very sad to see Gisele die. That part when Gal Gadot's character sacrifices herself to save Sung Kang's character, Han was a little bit over-the-top. Also, we see Han die again and this was shown in Tokyo Drift, the third Fast and Furious film, that was released in 2006.<br/><br/>So, overall, with FAST SIX or FAST & FURIOUS 6, I both love it and hate it. The movie does a few things right, but the whole idea of kidnapping Mia was a little bit crazy, but this is FAST and FURIOUS, so I'll give credit to the director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan for coming up with a great climax. I give it a 7.9 out of 10. It's not the best Fast and the Furious film ever, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse. And I do mean worse, I'm referring to the fourth film, simply titled Fast and Furious, which was released in 2009."
"pointsss","3","2","5","7 April 2015"," Dumb people's favorite movie
","This movie is simply put ridiculous. <br/><br/>While the first 2 movies had little defying physics and no common sense scenes, usually reserved for the culmination, the further you go in the franchise the more absurd it gets. The 6th movie is full of plot holes, defines physics and lacks absolutely any logic. In fact there are scenes that lead to nowhere and do not contribute to the overall plot of the movie.<br/><br/>As expected Fast and furious 6 has a lot of actions scenes that are more fantasy rather than action. It it is clear that no thought was put in the funny parts and the jokes but at least there are some.<br/><br/>One can easily conclude that the move was purely made for money. It is focusing on the mindless masses who would watch anything as long as there are explosions, nice cars and good locking actors without thinking a bit about the plot of the move. One has to turn off his brain in order to enjoy this movie."

I guess I wish all the effort spent on regurgitating F&F went into delivering Riddicks more often!<br/><br/>Of course I realise such a preference is harder to satisfy, given the relative cost of sci-fi, whereas, apart from smashing up a few cars, F&Fs tend to be relatively low budget.<br/><br/>The first F&F had some suspense but after that with the details of the roles established it just seems to recycle to no good effect. I did like some of the theme tunes, although it needs to go more underground for the music accompanying the action.<br/><br/>The basic plot seems just too similar between one issue and the next for my tastes."

Having Gina Carano fight is a great addition for this movie. She and Michelle Rodriguez have a couple of great fights. The one in the subway is epic.

","I thought that 5 featured less cars in lieu of ""story"". However, 6 was too ambitious in scope. How did street racers become a Interpol sanctioned crack team ? Supposedly, against ex-military ? We're supposed to suspend our disbelief and go along with it. I think the franchise should stop after Walker. it's a sign that the series is dead also. Now, up to 4, it was plausible, albeit unlikely, but it didn't try to set the film against the world stage of the greater good that rivals the Bond films. It needs to tone down the scale of plot to make it just as entertaining as uber realistic. For me, the series ended with 4. Before the cloak and dagger element of the sub standard 5 & 6.<br/><br/>IF, and that's a big if, you have a Michael Gay fetish for nonsensical action, and gaudied classic cars done through West Coast Customs, this is right up your alley. Otherwise, watch Two Lane Blacktop, Last American Hero, and The Seven Ups for your classic muscle fix. I do on my breaks between turning wrenches."

Action can be unrealistic but if its also boring then you are doing something horrible wrong.

","I didn't expect much better to be honest. This is the sixth 'Fast & Furious', I mean how much more can be said about a gang a villains who run around in fast cars? I enjoyed some of the visual and action, especially around central London but as far as the story and acting goes I feel it was rather weak. It's a story which has been told over and over again, the ex-villain (played by Vin Diesel) who corroborates with the police (played by Dwayne Johnson). There's nothing wrong with the plot itself, but when a movie is over two hours long you need to find a way of keeping it interesting.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of this series then of course you should watch it, otherwise I would say don't bother."

BOOOO!<br/><br/>This film is just so uninteresting, but it does have some promising visual effects.<br/><br/>4 out of 10."
"Engenius","6","2","5","11 June 2013"," You get what you expect, as long as you don't expect much
","Movies from the Fast and Furious franchise always bring up the same problem. If the cars are fast enough and the explosions are big enough, is the fact that there are uninteresting characters and a brainless story irrelevant? After all, people see these movies for the action, and in the case of Fast Six, it delivers handily. But newcomers to the Fast and Furious world that long for an intelligent story in their movies may want to stay as far away as possible, because the plot in Fast Six is a dud. What it all boils down to is that the most loyal devotees of the franchise will find lots to enjoy, but it won't be making many new fans either. This really is a shame, especially because last year's Fast Five made me a believer in a film series I had long thought had no sign of life.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that the movie is terrible. In some ways it even exceeds Fast Five. Vin Diesel's (back as Dominic Toretto) stone-faced acting and deep monotone is an almost welcome sight at this point, as it has become a staple of the franchise; and Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs is as entertaining as ever. Like in all the Fast and Furious movies, the acting is best when the fists do the talking. The movie has some clever throwbacks to Johnson's wrestling days and just visualizing Vin Diesel's flying head-butt brings a smile to my face. An excellent call was made in casting Gina Carano as Hobb's partner Riley. She may have very few lines, but her fight scenes are incredible. If you haven't, see her in last year's Haywire which is tremendously underrated.<br/><br/>The dialog, which has often inflicted this franchise like a plague, has been greatly improved this time around. Don't be fooled, it still isn't great, but the clichés and bad jokes have for the most part been eradicated. One of the most impressive amendments the film makes is the strength of the banter between the principle cast, which is among the most glaring issues with its predecessors. This is especially true in regards to the back-and-forth antics of Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris), both of which I had originally hoped they wouldn't bring back for this sequel. I was prepared to be annoyed by them, but was pleasantly surprised by their genuinely witty jokes. I also thought it was a smart move to not bring back every single character from the previous films. Fast Five was largely unsuccessful in juggling its many characters. This time, there's just the right amount of characters for the film to play with, so longtime fans needn't worry as most of their favorite characters are back and have more screen time.<br/><br/>The problems with Fast Six are rooted in its story that defies logic and the absurd melodrama and pointless twists that accompany it. The plot reads as nothing more than a bad soap opera with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) being brought back from the dead and suffering from amnesia. The amnesia ends up playing out solely as a vehicle for inconsequential drama with no regard to the actual affects amnesia would have. Equally outrageous, is the film's villain Shaw (Luke Evans), who is the antithesis to everything Toretto believes and stands for. His motivations are as unoriginal as they come and his actions are so questionable you wonder how this guy was so hard to catch in the first place. Let's not forget he also has his own ragtag team of criminals that mirror Toretto's. It's not a compliment. The film even refers to them (out loud) as their evil twins, so you know in true melodramatic fashion, they each have to fight their own counterpart in the climax. I really do wish I was making all this up.<br/><br/>Far too often the film resides in sentimentality. Toretto constantly addresses how important his makeshift ""family"" is to him; a nice message for sure, but the constant reminders lessen the impact. In the film's most cringe worthy scene, Shaw argues the flaws of Toretto's belief, which begs the question of why he even cares. As is par for the course for the Fast and Furious movies, the characters have little depth. Only fans of the series can enjoy them, but only because they've been exposed to them for six films; it's merely a side effect.<br/><br/>If you can stomach the bad, the movie can be very rewarding. After all, this is an action film, and that is what it does best. The film has more of the physics defying action that is so beloved in the Fast and Furious universe. Particularly, the two set pieces in the last forty minutes, which include a tank AND a plane, are worth seeing the movie for alone. It reminded me of why I liked Fast Five so much. Because the best parts of the movie are crammed in at the end, the rest of the film suffers as a result. It would have been better to see something more grandiose in the first ninety minutes that would grab my attention and hold it throughout the film, similar to Fast Five. I got the impression that after how over-the-top fun Fast Five's ending was, director Justin Lin felt that the only way to up the ante was to make everything bigger. But part of the joy of Fast Five's climax was how wonderfully original it was conceived. It is proof that bigger isn't always better.<br/><br/>With all the highs and lows taken into account, Fast Six equates into nothing more than a noisy ""OK"". What is most frustrating of all is that after Fast Five injected some much needed energy into this lifeless franchise, that this one doesn't quite carry the torch. But with quite an intriguing cliffhanger (stick through the credits), I'm hopeful for next year's installment."

His acting out shined everyone even though his part was minimal. I rather see Jason as a good guy rather than a bad guy. Vin Diesel looked a little chubby around the face and needs to hit the gym or diet a bit better. It seems the Rock tries to hide his limited acting with his perpetually pumped wannabe Arnold's biceps. Paul Walker's acting was good. Tyrese's part added comedy, however, his acting ranked a little better than the Rock's. Sung's expressionless acting worked. Michelle Rodriguez acting was okay but I've seen a lot better performances by her in other shows. Character development needed more work and better acting needs to occur. The special effects existed however, we found ourselves daydreaming, bored, and unimpressed because the visuals kept repeating endlessly and pointlessly. The climax with the cargo plane had amazing special effects but seemed as it would never end. It became boring and ridiculous. World's longest runway? The movie ranks a bit higher than the latest Die Hard. Is it worth to see? Maybe."

Given that a lot of action movies lately have been disappointing mainly because of the lack of action, this is continuing the resurrection of proper action movies following The Expendables movies and The Last Stand. Let's hope this path remains open. <br/><br/>Being a UK citizen, I loved the idea of having it set in London and having some of the action scenes take place in London, even though they were actually filmed in Glasgow. It made good use of the London scenery and it was nice to see the fabulous Rita Ora make a cameo. <br/><br/>It also had a lot of humour which made it funnier than most bad comedy movies and even some popular ones which in my opinion were overrated (*cough* The Hangover *cough* Ted *cough*). <br/><br/>The story-line wasn't exactly good but then again, none of the story- lines in any of the movies in this series are. At the end of the day, it's more style than substance. <br/><br/>If I have one criticism to make, it's that one or two of the stunts were unrealistic. But let me put it this way - at least it's not as bad as a lot of really terrible and over-the-top Bollywood movies.<br/><br/>I seriously think that this is the movie that should've rounded off the franchise rather than make a seventh movie for next year. All I can hope for now is that without Justin Lin on board, they don't mess it up."

MMA champion (and rising female action star) Gina Carano (of 'HAYWIRE' fame) and Luke Evans also join the cast this time around.

Toretto reluctantly agrees to help Hobbs when he discovers his old love, he thought was dead, is still alive and working with the team of mercenaries. The film is of course bigger and more action packed than ever and delivers everything die-hard fans of the series have come to expect.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Dom (Diesel), Brian (Walker) and the rest of the car racing crew living around the world, on the lam, while spending the $100 million loot they scored in their Rio heist (at the end of the last film). Hobbs (Johnson), now working with his new partner Riley (Carano), tracks down Dom and convinces him to help him capture a team of mercenary drivers led by an ex-British Special Forces soldier named Owen Shaw (Evans). Hobbs offers Dom and his team full pardons if they help him stop Shaw but it's the info that Dom's ex-love Letty (Rodriguez) is still alive that persuades him into doing the job. Action and carnage ensue.<br/><br/>I was never a huge fan of the original 2001 hit but I've liked each sequel a little more ever since (although I still haven't seen 'TOKYO DRIFT'). I think the franchise got a lot better with the last chapter when it added 'The Rock' into the mix. That's when box office for the series really skyrocketed and it also reached it's critical acclaim peak; how many movie series can one say that about (I can't think of any). It's great that this film added Carano as well and they also add another big action star at the end, in a post-credits scene, that should build even more anticipation for the next film in the series (which is already planned for next year). The franchise is still just a series of brainless action scenes strung together with no real plot or involving character development but they do keep getting more and more spectacular. This film does have some amazing car chases once again (including one involving a tank) but it still couldn't top the best car chase of the year (or just about any year) from another long running action movie franchise: 'A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD'.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM"

","I was so excited to watch this movie when it came out, I organised my friends for this movie myself and one of my friend's birthday was that day. I was expecting a quality movie, and it was until the end. They tried to make the effects very exciting and fascinating, but they forgot to make it realistic! Flying head-butts, smack-down moves while fighting, endless plane road (the plane was moving for at least 20 min)... The ending was so terrible that I almost went out of the cinema and skipped where Jason Statham came. The car effects were amazing, the story was good but they made it very unrealistic and it looked dumb for me at the end. Don't go to cinemas for this movie... not worth it"
"jason-godin232","5","2","6","28 May 2013"," Better, but far from being good.
","Warning: There will be spoilers in this review, specifically one scene, that I really need to talk about.<br/><br/>Alright lets get facts, I liked the first three movies, I honestly can't remember what happened in the forth one, disliked extremely the 5th one and I'm at a neutral stand point on the 6th one.<br/><br/>Story is basically Hobbs played by Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson needs help catching a gang of terrorist who stole billions of dollars worth of Military equipment. He seeks out our main character Dominic Toretto played by Vin Diesel. (I always found it funny that his last name is Diesel.) Which is pretty much a criminal and likes to break every law out there, including laws of physics it would appear. And of course he gets the team back together after their last adventure of stealing 100 million $ to try and catch these terrorist. But why would Dom want to help a cop you might ask? Well lets just say, he saw a ghost.<br/><br/>Lets talked about what I liked about the movie, well the action was a lot of fun. And they had 2 races this time, (Car chases don't count as a race) Though they had a lot of those which I can't say the same for Fast 5. Needless to say they were more in a car than before, and that is what I want to see from these movies. Not a Drama Flick, which needless to say, there was a lot of that as well. It had some comedy to it that also I found enjoyable. The Characters were relate-able as well.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about what I didn't like about this movie. I know, just as much as anyone else who likes American movies that Hollywood, really goes the extra mile at bending laws of physics, especially when it comes to movies that are suppose to be based on reality and not fiction or fantasy. What I really don't like is when they go beyond the extra mile in racing movies like this. Purely Critic talking, you have to obey laws of physics if your going to base your movie in real time. You are using real places, real cars, in areas where things could really happen. You cannot bend the rules and make cars rip through a cockpit of an air plane.<br/><br/>Let me elaborate on this. The final action scene of the movie, is where the Antagonist is trying to make an escape through a moving plane, and our heroes need to stop them before they get away. THANK GOD THE RUNWAY IS AT LEAST 20+ KM LONG!!. This scene literally starts off with the Bad guys, and the good guys chasing each other on a runway, for a good 2 minutes as what I'm assuming judging by these cars 220 km/h+ then the air planes comes in, lands on movement, and we now have them trying to get in through the cargo area in the back of the air plane. They get in the plane, getting out of their cars, then fighting. Meanwhile the others are shooting these grappling guns on the wings (attempting to hit the engine). And as the plane starts to take off, it stays a the same height for another good 5 minutes not going any higher. Before you say, they were making a (meanwhile) kinda thing by going back and forth outside of the plane to where the cars were, and inside to see the fighting, shut it, it's still to freaking long! After 15 minutes of being on this runway, the Power ranger Turbo (seriously it really did make me think of that) got to bring the plane back down, and might I add that this wasn't a little power jet, no this was a beast of a plane, with like the 8 wheels. They bring the plane down, and Vin Diesel, drives literally THROUGH THE COCKPIT OF THE BLOODY PLANE MADE OUT OF STEAL, LANDS IN FRONT OF THE PLANE. Mind you he does lose control of the car, but he roles out of the way just in time.<br/><br/>You cannot do that. Sure it is really cool to watch, and it's all action, and most people are like ""Holy crap that is so wicked that I wanna name my first born Vin Diesel"" But you don't know better, you really don't. This isn't the kind of movie to be bending the normal laws of physics. Sure, take this story, put it in a planet called ""Nos"" then do that stuff. Non-Ficton Action flick demand to be realistic. This was the biggest scene of the movie, and I'm picking on it, because it was the worst. But they do it all over the movie. The part about the tank, and catching the girl in mid-air. There is so many things I could talk about in this movie that pisses me off when it comes to realistic. But I made my point. I'm giving this movie the rating that I'm giving it because yes it may have ticked me off with the realism, but it was fun to watch for the most part.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 5/10."
"generationfilm","5","2","6","25 May 2013"," Fast & Furious 6- A Consistent and Idiotic Continuation of the Franchise that Boasts Typical Adrenaline Infused Action and Stodgy Dialogue
","A key aspect in achieving success in the entertainment industry, at least in terms of obtaining a dedicated audience following, is keeping a strong sense of what defines your product's particular genre or style and confidently presenting its strengths in full force but also accepting the weaknesses presented in self-aware jest. Ever since director Justin Lin took over the Fast and Furious franchise the series has taken the route of self-aware confidence where it has embraced its strengths for nonsensical, physics defying action as well as the weakness for having leaden dialogue coming from expressionless characters and fans have been thankful for the consistency. Fast Five might have been the franchise's peak because of its tongue and cheek attitude towards its Looney Tunes environment of unrestrained adrenaline and exaggerated stunts making it difficult for any continuing sequel to match it unless the creators upgraded the storytelling parts of this clumsily custom built machine. The latest in the Fast & Furious series, eloquently named Fast & Furious 6, remains consistent to fan expectations with its fondness for stunt driven spectacle yet it exists in a plot that thinks it's far superior than it is in reality, showcasing screenwriter Chris Morgan's wrongful assumption that more dramatic breathing room between implausible action sequences gives your writing more credibility. There is an existential quandary that lives within Fast & Furious 6 as an attempt at seriousness, either in the renewed relationships or predictable plot twists, in an environment of ridiculousness practically derails this speeding vehicle from its intention on being unadulterated fun. On face and in execution the Fast & Furious films are reminiscent of experiencing a live action version of an anime cartoon (a point of view a friend of mine has reinforced) with its cartoonish embellishment of its physical environment but with far dumber plot lines and exceedingly bland dialogue so when there's less of the latter it's for the better. As guilty pleasures go there are few as technically executed as the Fast & Furious franchise and though the sixth installment showcases some of the series dumbest dialogue exchanges through purely rigid performances it remains a consistent entertainment outlet for those who have been initially conned by the fast and furious appeal.<br/><br/>Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-yG; more reviews: generationfilm.net"

","Directed by Justin Lin. Starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Dwayne Johnson, Luke Evans, Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Gal Gadot, Gina Carano, Jordana Brewster, Shea Whigham, Elsa Pataky, John Ortiz, Joe Taslim. (PG-13)<br/><br/>Using the thinnest strands of logic possible, Johnson recruits Diesel, Walker, and crew into carrying out a dangerous mission to take down a merc outfit led by former SAS officer Evans; Diesel also discovers that his girlfriend (Rodriguez) is still alive, despite being killed off in ""Fast & Furious"" (which was the fourth one in the series, so they say). Perhaps the dumbest outing yet (who's keeping track?) but also perhaps the most fried-brain-cell entertaining just for taking place in a parallel dimension where motivation, physics, logistics, and coherence are outlawed under penalty of death--or vehicular repossession, which would be a worse fate for these gearheads. The action is, as one would expect, even more outrageously insane than ever before, throwing in a smashed car tethered to a tank as it rolls down the highway and an out-and-out assault on a quadjet as it barrels down the world's longest runway. Dialogue is thuddingly awful (and sometimes barely even intelligible), performances marginally competent at best, blah blah blah, who cares; it's all about testosterone, adrenaline, shiny cars, flexed muscles, and impossible stunts. Hard to call any of this nonsense ""exciting"" (certainly not ""pulse-pounding""), but there's cheesy fun to be had, even if one is a little ashamed about it afterward. Title onscreen is (inexplicably) just ""Furious 6.""<br/><br/>51/100"
"Robert_duder","8","1","2","27 April 2019"," Keeps on keeping on
","This is my first time through the Fast and Furious franchise. I eat all my words I ever said about the series. I scoffed at how popular it was and now I get it. In fact, this is one of the best action franchises to have come along. Fast 6 returns to true form with breathtaking action, stunts, heists, car chases and a climatic battle against a massive airplane. The series has come a far cry from it's street racing days but maybe that's okay and it works for this series too. Vin Diesel still proves he's got it at least in this franchise and he commands the team effortlessly. Paul Walker is a little more subtly a lead than he was in previous instalments but he still does a good job. For such an ensemble cast, everyone has their moment and everyone is important to ""the family"" Justin Lin is an incredible action director. Do you have to suspend belief? Sure sometimes like most great action films but he knows what we want to see to be purely entertained. The villain in Fast 6 was a little underwhelming (perhaps on purpose - stay tuned for future instalments) but he wasn't as strong as some of the others in previous films. Dwayne Johnson returns as well and whereas in the last film he and Vin were enemies of sorts now they're working together and this adds a whole new level of action and excitement to the film. This franchise holds it's own and you won't be disappointed in this sixth part. 8/10"

","I think the true enjoyment of Fast & Furious 6 depends on an emotional investment with the characters that I just don't have, even after watching all of the previous movies. The story was convoluted, the acting was wooden and the car chases felt lackluster. I can see why others may like it, but I didn't. Although that could just be because this film featured WAY too much Letty. Who knows?"

","In society, you make a lot of decisions, there are right choices and the wrong choices. In this Fast and Furious 6, you'll see a difference between the right choice and the bad choice. If you join the good side, you will end up being a good one, and have a good family. If you choose to go to the bad side, then you will only earn a lot of money, but you'll still lose them at last, and you will die.

","After their successful heist in Brazil which netted them $100 million dollars, ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) and his team have dispersed all over the world to enjoy life. Then one day ""Agent Luke Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) appears on Dominic's doorstep and informs him that his former girlfriend, ""Letty"" (Michelle Rodriguez) is very much alive and working with an infamous criminal named ""Shaw"" (Luke Evans) on a mission to steal a very lethal military weapon which he can sell to the highest bidder. Wanting to prevent that at all costs Hobbs asks Dominic to reassemble his team in order to stop Shaw and in return all of them-to include Letty--will receive full pardons. Wanting very much to help Letty out Dominic agrees to his terms. But as good as Dominic's team is they soon find out that taking out Shaw and his team is much more difficult than they ever imagined. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film started out real well and definitely had the potential to be something very special. Unfortunately, the director (Justin Lin) once again got carried away and threw in some extremely preposterous stunts which ruined everything. Now I have no doubt that some viewers want action above everything else but there are others who also want some semblance of realism as well. Apparently Justin Lin doesn't understand that. Be that as it may I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly below average."
"ryanskywalker-87402","7","1","2","20 April 2017"," Cars vs Planes:Dawn of repeatedly saying family.
","I've said it many times before, but one of the main reasons why the F&F movies failed to reach mass appeal before Fast Five was because of their villains. They were always forced to take on low end drug dealers and people who have little to do with their line of work; driving cars really fast and stealing things. With Fast & Furious 6, the team gets to take on Owen Shaw & his own crew, who are equally as good at doing crazy stuff on wheels.<br/><br/>Dom regathers his team, including Brian, Han, Gisele, Roman, and Tej, after Hobbs comes to him with an offer he can't refuse. The chance to save Letty from Shaw and take him down, in exchange for full pardons all the way around. After quite a few films on the run and unable to return to his home in Los Angeles, there's no way he could turn down this opportunity, even if it meant going up against his former girlfriend thought dead, Letty. <br/><br/>Fast & Furious 6 has even more muscle, explosions, faster cars, and just downright insanity. But it isn't as clean cut or polished as Fast Five. Granted, a movie like this doesn't necessarily need to have a concise story or developed characters, but they've done a much better job at doing those things within the last few films. The 6th film feels a little slower and maybe even a little too long, with the end product still putting a huge smile on my face. But when comparing the two, a second watch definitely exposes some of this film's minor flaws.<br/><br/>The one thing this film, and pretty much all of the films since 4, is that each keeps topping itself. Just when you think they couldn't top stealing a vault and dragging across the streets of Brazil, they take down planes with cars. The tone deafness of the series is gone and the new breed of F&F is here to stay. The crazy thing is, you buy into all of it. I bought into the family from the beginning and I one-hundred-percent buy into the series embracing it's goofiness. The film also manages to implement more humor into the 6th film which is something the franchise has been missing. Or at least, humor that actually makes people laugh. I won't count those horrible attempts at humor in the 2nd film.<br/><br/>What makes this film stick out his that it's the first time the crew gets to go up against an entirely new crew with the same set of skills. Luke Evans is great as Owen Shaw, The Rock has never been better, and who doesn't love watching Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson crack one- liners at each other. Better yet, every word out of Vin's mouth is a one-liner. Overall, the ante is once against raised and the series punches its way through another smash hit. Fast & Furious 6 is an insane thrill ride from the beginning to end."

","This film tells the story of a gang of notorious criminals, who is asked by a government agent to track down and take down a dangerous criminal. The leader of the gang, Dominic Toretto, faces unexpected obstacles as this mission involves his missing girlfriend.<br/><br/>It is amazing how every ""The Fast and the Furious"" films outdo itself. I thought the fifth one is pretty amazing, but ""Fast and Furious 6"" just outshines the previous ones again. The action sequences here are simple jaw dropping. The sky is the limit when it comes to action scenes. You think you have seen the most daredevil scenes? They push the limit even more just a few minutes later. I thought the really intense central London car chase scene was the climactic finale, but the film didn't end. There was still 30 minutes to go because the real finale involves many cars, a plane and many fights. The whole airplane scene is simply beyond my imagination. It is so good. Now that I have finally watched all 1-7 films, I am anticipating the 8th one."

","After the events in the previous film Dom, Brian and the rest of the team have retired from their lives on the wrong side of the law. Then Hobbs comes round asking for help bringing down a gang who recently attacked a military convoy in Moscow and stole a component of a weapons system. He persuades Dom to take the job by showing him a picture of Letty, his presumed dead former girlfriend, who is now working for the gang lead by Owen Shaw, a former Major in the SAS. Dom, Brian and their team assemble in London, where Shaw's gang are now located. Here is becomes apparent that Letty is indeed alive but she has no memory of her life before the accident that everybody thought killed her. After a number of incidents in London the action moves to Spain where Shaw steals the final component in the system; the team will have to take some of their greatest risks yet if they are to stop him getting away with it.<br/><br/>If you are looking for realism then this isn't the film for you but if you want great, almost non-stop, action then you could do a lot worse. Vin Diesel and Brian O'Conner continue to impress as Dom and Brian and it was a lot of fun having these characters work with, rather than against, Dwayne Johnson's Hobbs. It was great to see Michelle Rodriguez return as Letty; having her character suffer from amnesia may be a bit of a cliché but it works as a means of explaining why she never contacted Dom and justifies having her working for the bad guys. As one would expect there is lots of great over-the-top-action; this includes explosions, gunfights and the inevitable chases one of which involves a tank! The film also goes back to its roots with a street race between Dom and Letty; they aren't trying to kill each other; just be the fastest round the course. Overall I'd recommend this to all fans of mindless action; it might not be realistic but the action is great and the whole film is a lot of fun."
"The-Sarkologist","7","1","2","12 December 2016"," This Time They're in London
","It seems as if these movies are getting better and better as time goes on (though not so good that they warrant anything more than a seven – they are mindless actions movies. In a way it seems like ages since I watched the first couple of movies and also, in a way, they simply seem to be nothing like the ones that are being churned out now. In fact, it seems that ever since Justin Lin took the helm the movies have simply gone from being rather dull cop movies to being a full blown, fully intense, action movie. Mind you, with this one having a tank roaring down a motorway it does make me wander how Lin is going to top the previous editions in numbers 8 and 9 (IMDB suggested that after number 8 there are another three movies but I suspect that this is a typo).<br/><br/>Anyway, after striking it rich in Rio by stealing a hundred million dollars off of a drug lord, the crew have all gone their separate ways. However Hobbs as been tipped off that Vincent's girlfriend isn't actually dead, and in fact involved with some rather despicable characters that make Toretto, O'Conner and their team look like angels (and since they are the heroes of the film you could suggest that they are, but they are more like anti-heroes than anything else). Anyway Hobbs gets in contact them because he realises that the best way to catch a crook is with a crook, and of course Toretto is the first that comes to mind.<br/><br/>Number six is set in London, which is a good thing because I have been to London – three times. Okay, I can hardly call myself an expert on the city, but I do have this attachment to the place, and do enjoy watching movies set there, even if they do stupid things, like having a drag race through the centre of the city, pass Picadilly Circus and finishing up at Battersea when it is impossible it escape the stop start traffic unless it is 6:00 am on a Sunday morning (okay, it isn't that bad, but try driving along Euston road and see how long it takes you to get from Islington and out of the city).<br/><br/>In a way this film seems to deal more with a collection of anti-heroes, and sort of exposes Vin Diesel's roleplaying past – having people with different talents working together as part of a team is something that is central to most, if not all, roleplaying games, and they tend to work a lot better if you aren't constrained by a government organisation. Okay, Diesel and Walker are still the major characters, and also the precision drivers, and they still have a single drag race in the film (though there are plenty of car chases, including one with a tank), but we are now moving on to much bigger things – in fact no more drug lords because now we are up against mercenaries who are doing things that your average drug-lord isn't getting involved in. In the end, expect a pretty wild ride, but nothing incredibly deep."

","There was once a time when this franchise retained a shred of realism. At the climax of the first film, The Fast and the Furious (2001), there is a moment in which a character must make a life-or- death leap from a moving truck into a moving car, both travelling at super-high speed along a straight road. Following the series' and its characters transition from lovable rogue criminals who dabbled in robberies and drag racing, into a super-group of international ass-kicking Robin Hood types, such distractions as the laws of physics are no longer an issue. Yes, this is the daftest entry yet, but the series shows no signs of fatigue, and, judging by the ever- increasing box office receipts, it won't be throwing in the towel any time soon.<br/><br/>After reaping the rewards of their multi-million dollar heist in the previous film, Fast Five (2011), the Fast & Furious gang are scattered and enjoying living the high life. Dom (Vin Diesel) is shacked up with Elena (Elsa Pataky), and Brian (Paul Walker) has seen the birth of his son Jack with Mia (Jordana Brewster). Han (Sung Kang) is in Hong Kong with Gisele (Gal Gadot), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Taj (Ludacris) are indulging in a life of private plans, expensive suits, and an entourage of babes. However, their retirement is interrupted by the arrival of D.S.S. agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), who brings Dom the shocking news that we were teased with in the post-credits scene of the fifth movie.<br/><br/>Dom's former girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), believed to have been murdered in the fourth movie, Fast & Furious (2009), is in fact alive and kicking, and working with international terrorist Shaw (Luke Evans), a Brit whose criminal philosophies come into direct contrast with that of Dom's. To Shaw, his team are little more than moveable pieces to be manipulated and sacrificed for his own gain, while Dom believes in the sanctity of 'family'. After a thrilling set-piece involving Shaw escaping in a custom-made racing car through the streets of London (clearly the film-makers have never seen the traffic in the capital), Dom comes across Letty for the first time, who in return shoots Dom without blinking. It appears amnesia is to blame.<br/><br/>You have to hand it to long-serving franchise helmer Justin Lin, who is given the task of increasing the ante with every film, and always having to involve cars. And what better road vehicle to employ to increase the carnage than a tank? We get that and a plane, in what feels like the longest runway take-off ever seen on screen. As long as the plane is still on the ground, it doesn't stand a chance against Dom and co. With their evolution from petty criminals into fully-fledged heroes comes an inexplicable ability for hand-to-hand fighting. We get Letty take on series newcomer Riley (Gina Carano from 2011's Haywire) with roundhouse kicks and wrestling moves, and a slow-motion leaping headbutt from Diesel in what proves the film's giddiest, must ludicrous moment. And with the series finally catching up to the events seen in Tokyo Drift (2006), we are offered a glimpse at the next film's antagonist, which, I'm rather ashamed to say, is an exciting moment indeed.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

The dude is like a tagline machine, spitting out one butch statement after another, he's a walking action figure.<br/><br/>So virtually everybody is dragged back into the frey both goodies and baddies, the casting continuity is actually impressive. I think we all know now that Rodriguez is the big surprise reentry here as it turns out she wasn't killed in number four. Nope she has been brought back to allow the franchise to continue even further. In all complete and utter honesty most of this film is totally mundane and routine, there is nothing here that is fresh or exciting. We are shown what really happened to Letty although I can't believe she simply wasn't just shot in the head to make sure. Carano gets a good fight sequence...naturally, the underground is shown along with some other landmarks...naturally, and of course we are given one obligatory street race. <br/><br/>London and no traffic?? nah! but wait! what was that moment when O'Connor knocks that bug device off the front of his BMW by skidding past a concrete pillar? How the hell did he even know where it was? its size? width? how on earth did he manage to gauge that move without slamming into the pillar or just missing the bug completely?? I know these films are not to be taken seriously but its moments like that that just make it laughable, a joke.<br/><br/>The cars this time are more unique with a few more British models (of course), bored with large numbers of imports we now get some curious models. The Dodge Charger Daytona and its long pointed body with huge spoiler fin, a British Ford Escort, the Jenson Interceptor, a Ford Anvil Mustang, a Plymouth Barracuda and an Alfa Romeo are all used. <br/><br/>The film grows tiresome right up until a fast paced chase sequence in Spain down a highway. Starting off kinda generic but quickly turning into something much more interesting as they end up chasing a tank. The sequence unfortunately ends on a highly absurd set piece requiring CGI assistance which spoils the moment but it is fun (how many innocent people were killed on that highway?!!). Just when you think that's that bugger me we get another good sequence, saved the best stuff for last it seems. This time the team are chasing (always chasing) a large cargo aircraft which is stuffed with yet more cars. So guess what? yep we get lots of cars everywhere...silly stunts, CGI stunts explosions...utterly impossible feats, Dwayne 'my t- shirts are really tight' Johnson fighting an even bigger meathead, more girl fights, heroic deaths and the longest damn take off in the world. Seriously how long does it take that plane to lift? and how long is that runway??<br/><br/>At first I was really not going along with this whole idea, a sixth film! Then as I started to watch I realised hey I was right! this is just complete rehash. Its only when we get to the last half hour or so of the film that things get exciting with those two chase sequences, up to then its seriously average. I like how they have engineered the plot from part three and the franchise as a whole into a bigger picture, all these films are prequels and the finale here does tie that up nicely. The only thing is before that they do tie up the whole franchise very nicely with a good ending for all the characters involved. I did get the feeling this was the perfect moment to finish this for good, end it now with a solid bookend. The fact they are pushing it further is really milking it and really pushing their luck...if you ask me.<br/><br/>This was gonna be a low score but the last two sequences in the finale saved this films life big time, almost a fail, how much longer can it hold out?<br/><br/>6/10"
"LloydBayer","6","1","2","8 September 2013"," Dom is at it again
","Having resurrected the series after the critically panned sequel – 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS - returning director Justin Lin rigs this sixth installment with an action packed cocktail of nitrous oxide and adrenalin; a perfectly blended chemical compound that will have you laughing out loud even as you clench your toes through the film's high-octane action sequences.<br/><br/>Picking up where FAST 5 ended, US Diplomatic Security Service Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) grants fugitives Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and former FBI Agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) a full pardon if they help him take down criminal mastermind Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Toretto is of course uninterested, until Hobbs reveals that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is alive but working for Shaw. A far as the synopsis goes, that's all you need to know, because that's all there is to it. To be fair, the FAST & FURIOUS saga has always been about high speed races and chases and less about character development or a mindboggling story. And Like the preceding films, the background story in this sixth installment is literally in the back seat, with emphasis on the ride rather than the destination. Neither is FURIOUS 6 the type of film inclined towards rocket scientists or viewers searching for logic. George Smiley burrowing after a Soviet spy within MI6? No. Regular doses of humour, peppered with death-defying stunts? Yes, and there is a truck load of it and it comes at you just as the title promises. This, essentially, is what makes FURIOUS 6 subjectively indulgent, with or without the popcorn. However, there is food for thought and fans of the series could be split debating whether or not this film is the best in the series. <br/><br/>Although Lin injects a fresh canister of cinematic nitro, this latest episode lacks a worthy antagonist even though this film has the largest character ensemble in the series. On that note, characters don't die and dead ones are brought back. While there is a timeline-unknotting-explanation for that, the fact remains that Shaw is heavily outnumbered, and it shows. After five globetrotting adventures, Dom's 'family' has increased in size with many characters reappearing from previous films. In addition, Hobbs is no longer an advisory and along with his team of Special Forces sharp-shooters, becomes Dom's souped-up armory on wheels. There are also issues with continuity amid rip-off moments from iconic action films (think Lethal WEAPON 3). Through all the vehicular carnage, characters can take a beating, and still appear unfazed and unharmed. This carries on till the final skirmish onboard a cargo plane on a take-off run, on what has to be the world's longest runway! Real pilots in the audience would probably wet themselves laughing. <br/><br/>But despite its flaws, some even absurd, FAST & FURIOUS 6 is a high energy action movie and competently made. Fans are treated to having Rodriguez back and there is a whole subplot about her 'new' character. Tyrese Gibson is also back but this time, more than ever, serves one real purpose and that is to shoot out some well-timed one-liners. As a summer opener, it not only revs up the fun-o-meter but also hurtles past the competition as a lucrative action film franchise. Bruce Willis - kindly heed that last line. While it is unusual for sequels to get better with each release, the FAST & FURIOUS franchise seems to mature with age and there is a very strong suggestion of a seventh installment. An end credits scene confirms this with the introduction of a new character. Pay attention to the film's baldness joke and you might just figure out who joins the cast in the next movie. If you do, you might also win premier passes for FAST & FURIOUS 7!"

","The series that just can't quit - ""Fast & The Furious 6"" is about as preposterous as they come (and I've seen Pacific Rim!), but all is forgiven when there's so much idiotic car chase action and nice scenery.<br/><br/>Like the souped-up muscle cars in the movie, it's noisy and it all goes by very fast, and a few hours later, I couldn't quite connect what the whole James Bond plot was about, or really care. <br/><br/>It does have at least 4 good action set pieces, and by good I mean physics-defying, Wile E. Coyote-type - but the film is somehow cheerfully silly/good none-the-less. <br/><br/>A brainless $3 matinée, well-priced."
"lasttimeisaw","6","1","2","31 July 2013"," Fast & Furious 6
","Watched this one in the local multiplex, honestly I am not an avid fanboy of this money-maker franchise, I am even not an advocate of racing vehicles, but the turning point comes when FAST FIVE (2011, 7/10) surprisingly catapults itself into a new level of sensory entertainment with its roller coaster ride and triumphantly revives the series' mass appeal to a younger generation and has grossed a series-high income means it has yet overstayed its welcome. <br/><br/>Still helmed by Justin Lin, this 6th sequel reunites all the cast, including one of the ""original four"" Michelle Rodriguez, whose wacky insomnia and vague backstory stirs the most untenable veneer of the plot if one can excuse the physics-defying action sequences as an utmost drawing power to allure new genre lovers and retain its core audiences. So a large drawback of this one is it is solely made for one's eyes only, one should completely ignore what is the convoluted plot going on by the villain and his cohorts and plainly indulge oneself in the great stunt work to find it is worth your ticket. <br/><br/>Unequivocally it is a tough job for any writer to create new blood for the franchise since it allows very limited leeway to inspire from the original cast, and due to the aesthetic fatigue, sooner or later, a younger cast must be mustered so as to invigorate a healthy metabolism for the faded set pieces. In this one, the newcomer is a strapping Luke Evans as the main villain, whose temperament presages a brighter future as a leading man candidate in world cinema, but unfortunately this film is not his breakthrough, at most a stepping stone permits him to be seen by more people and hence enlarges his fan base. <br/><br/>Everyone else is pigeonholed with their respective task, Johnson bullies scumbags, Diesel emotionlessly sweet-talks with his comeback battle-axe, Walker retreats into a family man, Gibson and Ludicrous are the pair of cutups, the ass-kicking martial pro Carano is here for girl fights while Kang and Gadot cannot run away from their functional exit, which plausibly introduce another bankable name as the next villain for the next chapter, due next year and will be transferred to be under the reign of horror-genre whiz James Wan, let's pray for a miracle to sustain its longevity and if we are lucky enough, a better one next time!"

","How should I start off this wonderful review? Hmm... Maybe I should start off by saying this movie is probably the best one yet in the ""Fast and Furious"" serious! Maybe I could even say this movie is the best movie of 2013! This movie is what some people like me like to call diversified, I mean it has a little bit of action, comedy, and a slight bit of romance. There's this special type of bond that Paul Walker and Vin Diesel have when they are acting together, it's like they bring out the best of each other and when you have two good actors that can do something like that, it helps the other actors in the movie step their game up. Ide also like to give congrats to the director of the film Justin Lin for another job well done. He never fails to amaze me with greatness. To sum this whole thing up this movie is great and should be seen by any and everybody!"

The plot has something to do with preventing some international bad guys from getting the final piece to some dreaded weapons system, and...oh who cares? <br/><br/>What's great about FF 6 is, like it's last couple of predecessors, it doesn't take itself too seriously..at least not too often..or get too distracted with silly things like a story. There are a few obligatory moments of feigned drama, but it's once you get past those and get to the racing that the movie really gets fun (there's one bad-ass racing sequence in particular, through the streets of London). Racing, shootouts, cool cars and hot babes bending over..what else do you need?<br/><br/>Stay tuned for FF 7."

","Wouldn't it be cool to be part of a group who after a brawl is left unscathed? They're like men taking stem cell capsules. FAST AND FURIOUS 6 was indeed fast it will make your neurons hyperventilate and furious because there is no stopping them. Yes my friends there is a 7th installment. It is one movie that you forget about the plot and concentrate instead in keeping your eyeballs intact, afraid that you'll have nystagmus in the end. It's high octane energy coupled with Vin Diesel flaccid drama, Tyrese effortless comedy and bits of love stories keep you at the edge of your seats. I am not in the position to fully evaluate the chronicity of action sequences per installment and chose which is way better because I have only seen two but nonetheless it gave me joy watching posh cars gone bad and enjoyed the death defying stunts. And what more to keep the franchise alive by surprisingly casting Jason Statham in the prequel. And I thought there's a movie remix entitled: THE FURIOUS TRANSPORTER. Since Jason Statham is one of my favorite actors but not to the point of idolatry, I will watch the sequel. When are they going to end this drama? Until they'll ran out of cars and use tricycles instead? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go and inquire about their uber duper strength. Until the next fuel hike!"

"zardoz-13","8","1","2","2 June 2013"," As ""Fast and Furious"" As Ever!!!
","The latest installment in the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise ""Fast and Furious 6"" (*** OUT OF ***) resembles a James Bond extravaganza more than a urban epic about illegal street racing. Some cinematic franchises live and some die, and I'm still surprised that this one didn't collapse when Vin Diesel refused to star in John Singleton's ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" Afterward, the second sequel ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006) looked like a surefire blow-out. Channing Tatum slipped behind the wheel for Asian antics, but Vin Diesel graced the end credits scene, imparting his official blessing. Diesel reprised his role as streetwise Dominic Toretto in ""Fast and Furious"" (2009) and teamed up again with FBI Agent Bryan O'Connor (Paul Walker). You can always tell a franchise by the number of characters that each entry cuts loose, and the ""Fast and the Furious"" has been conservative. Dom's girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) died in this outing, and our heroes exacted maximum vengeance on the villain. ""Fast Five"" (2011) reunited Dom and Bryan along with everybody else. Our heroes went to Rio de Janeiro and stole a bank vault with enough loot in it to relax. In a tacked on, end credits scene, the filmmakers revealed that Letty hadn't died! The franchise sacrificed one obnoxious character, Vince (Matt Schulze), who radiated all the charisma of a zombie. ""Five Fast"" introduced U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), and provided our heroes somebody to elude. Hobbs returns for the sixth ""Fast and Furious"" opus, and Letty reappears. The revelation that Letty suffered from a bout of amnesia after a near-death experience sounds like something from the Universal Pictures' franchise ""Bourne Identity."" Incidentally, Universal also produces ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise. Until ""Fast 5,"" the ""Fast and the Furious"" movies didn't knock off any of their own like the ""Rocky"" movies. ""Fast and Furious 6,"" however, doubles the toll, shuffling off two additions going as far back as ""Tokyo Drift."" Of course, we won't know for sure if they're kaput until ""Fast and Furious 7"" comes out.<br/><br/>When ""Fast and Furious 6"" opens, Dom (Vin Diesel of ""Riddick"") and Elena (Elsa Pataky) are living in the Canary Islands with Brian (Paul Walker of ""Pleasantville"") and his new wife, Domini's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster of ""D.E.B.S.""), who has just had a baby boy. Nobody can extradite them. Eventually, Hobbs shows up and hands Dom an envelope with surveillance photos of Letty. Initially, Dom wants to make it a one-man mission to rescue Letty alone, but Hobbs halts him in his tracks. Not only does Hobbs need Dom, but he also needs Dom's team. Mia insists Brian accompany her big brother while Dom's new girlfriend Elena urges him to find out if Letty is really alive. Meantime, word reaches Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson of ""Baby Boy""), who skipped both ""Tokyo Drift"" and ""Fast and Furious."" Gibson served as the comic relief in the last two, and he conjures up laughs galore in ""Fast and Furious 6."" Computer whiz kid Tej Parker (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges of ""Four Brothers') fields the same phone call that Roman received and that Han Lue (Sung Kang of ""Better Luck Tomorrow"") and his girlfriend forever Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot of ""Fast and Furious"") are handed when the Tokyo Police surround them. Before you can say no way, they are back together, and Hobbs explains that Letty is part of a high tech gang of criminals headed up by a notorious former British S.A.S. Officer, Major Owen Shaw (Luke Evans of ""Immortals"") who behaves like an adversary from a 007 adventure. Happily, ""Cellular"" scenarist Chris Morgan is back for his fourth ""Fast and Furious"" along with helmer Justin Lin. These two have turned the franchise around and taken it beyond what anybody could have imagined after ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" Shaw is no slouch as villains go, and he keeps Hobbs and our heroes hopping through hoops. Interestingly, when our heroes fall back on surveillance cameras to track Shaw through London, they complain about how you cannot spit in London without a camera catching you in the act. Shaw is the kind of villain who maintains complete control and rarely makes a mistake. Clearly, he isn't prepared when Letty spots Dom and wounds him with a bullet in the shoulder. Our heroine cannot remember Dom because she woke up with no memory in a hospital after her accident in ""Fast and Furious."" This is when Shaw added her to his crew. Shaw lives by a code that he calls 'precision,' and he boots those off his crew when they don't measure up to his high standards. Cyber-terrorist that he is, Shaw is searching for a microchip which will enable him shut down make all U.S. military computers for 24 hours. Naturally, Dom and company demand nothing less than full pardons to help out Hobbs. <br/><br/>Nothing about this franchise is remotely realistic, and director Justin Lin embraces ""the ridiculousness"" to forge greater suspense and tension. As Dom tells Letty at one point when he saves her life during an incredible stunt, you have to take everything on faith. As it turns out, not only do the filmmakers take everything on faith, but the audiences also seem to be doing the same. In the last ""Fast and Furious"" thriller, our heroes dragged a safe through exotic downtown Rio. Just about everything that unfolds in this outrageously entertaining but hopelessly predictable nail-biter is larger-than-life. A duel with a modern army tank on a high-rise bridge jammed with civilian traffic and a spectacular nighttime encounter between our tenacious heroes and a gigantic cargo jet that is reminiscent of the flaming demise of the Hindenburg airship make this movie worth the price of admission. Anybody who wants to take a break from reality will enjoy this fast-paced melodrama with one or two surprises."

Totally combined package of guns, blood, bullets, cars, and everything you can imagine in a Vin Diesel + Dwayne Johnson kind movies. And for action, I should say they have really worked hard.

","I must say this is a saga I like. I liked the first installment, hated the two and third movies (awful) and was positively surprised by the next three, in fact, these are the best, specially the sixth. It is not an epic saga, like ""Star wars"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Mission: impossible"" and ""007"", but it is very enjoyable and worth watching for the action fans like me. Justin Lin managed to revitalize the saga with the fourth part of it after those two piece of rubbish. In fact, the six one fixed in some way the third one (I should say it gives some sense to the third movie at the end). He really knows how to deal with action. It is true the action scenes are inverosimile, but they agree with the movie's tone. The car chases, gunshots and body fights are spectacular and one of the main attraction in the movie. The pace is another strong point. It never made me bored in spite of its more-than-two-hour-duration and poor performances. It begins by introducing the characters and their situation and then, the action begins with many explosions, chases, shots, twists, etc. The sceneography is very nice, the best in the saga: the Canary Islands, London and L.A. The soundtrack is very good and proper, too (listen to the song ""We own it""). The cast is attractive: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, The Rock, Elsa Pataky, Ludicrous, Gina Carano, Luke Evans, Jason Statham... Except the last two, these are not very good as actors, but are very appropriate for this kind of movies and deliver fun (not deep and dramatic) performance. This is not about character development at all, however it is true there is an evolution in the main character's lifes, which is good indeed. Vin Diesel is one of the least expressive actors in Hollywood's history (The Rock acts better even though he is not a real actor but a wrestling factor, unlike Vin). Paul Walker is dull and they should dress him better to take advantage of his beauty. Fortunately, Elsa's character is unimportant and the script contains many jokes. Anyway, in this aspect, this is the best movie in the saga because the cast contains both Jason Statham and Luke Evans. They are evil characters. The first only appears for a few seconds but very intensely. Luke Evans as the main villain plays a very believable and tough role which represents an added value for the movie. In conclusion, the worst in the movie are its lack of originality, rather flat characters and dull performances from many actors. The best thing is that it gives sense to the threequel, the pace, the capacity of entertaining, the cast, the action scenes (specially the first car chase in London), the sceneography (London is the city I visited I like the most), the main villain, Statham's cameo and the cars. I recommend it to the fans of this saga. 8."

","I don't want to go into too much detail because I hate when reviews contain spoilers and I want to make sure I don't do that. To keep this short and too the point this is probably the best movie in the series so far. If you've been a fan since the first film you will definitely enjoy this one as they go back to more of the street racing and such that was so prevalent in the first film. There are a few twists and surprises to this one, and yes a few scenes where you sit back and say ""Not possible"" or ""Only in a movie"" but what would an action movie be without completely impossible scenes at times? <br/><br/>Truth be told, go see it, I highly, HIGHLY doubt you will leave feeling like you wasted your time or your money...and make sure you stay past the initial credits."

","Yes, I am aware of the fact I have written ""The Best One Yet!"" and only gave it a seven out of ten. Yes, I loved the movie but it did not exceed all my expectations. <br/><br/>The length, well, it was very long. I wouldn't be bothered about the length but this film did not amaze me, and I wasn't prepared to see more. <br/><br/>The plot. I liked it, but there was a flaw. Yes, it was about cars and racing, but unlike all the other ones, this had the least of it. It definitely shouldn't have been titled ""Fast and Furious 6"", it should be ""Chasing Shaw"", which includes a hint of cars, but the main idea of this film. <br/><br/>The acting. It was good. But, it didn't make me feel like I was there, to be honest, I felt the only scenes that blew my mind were the very visual ones that included stunts, action, or humor, but otherwise I felt it was to..to self-centered on the plot, (MUCH different than what I expected) where the characters weren't able to do what they were meant to, and it made a big impact on the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Fast & Furious 6 was an outstanding film with some flaws that definitely effect my opinion, but yet I do encourage you to see the film yourself. Most people liked it much more than I did, and with the box office total just for the past few days, I think that you would like it as well as mostly everyone else."

","Very enjoyable Fast and Furious that won't disappoint the fans. Tons of action which looks great especially in Imax, and all the favorite gang is there.<br/><br/>Highly recommended if you like this type of film and especially if you're an FF fan.<br/><br/>What I didn't like (warning - MASSIVE SPOILERS):<br/><br/>The ending was pretty sad in the bottom line. The bad guy basically got away (he got kicked off the plane but there's every reason to assume he survived). Han and Gisele both died, each on a separate occasion. Dom and Elena broke up once Letty got back into the picture (still not remembering anything about their past together).<br/><br/>Yes I know, Hollywood movies are mocked for their uncompromising happy endings, so what was this, an attempt not to be a Hollywood movie? LOL. If you are an FF fan who relates to the characters, it just sucks to see favorite heroes die or break up like that.<br/><br/>Yes I know, probably the actors didn't sign up for the next sequel so they had to ditch the characters. But I'd rather they ditched them in a happy ending way. How about Han hooking up with Elena for example ;)<br/><br/>So that's what I didn't like. Everything else was great.<br/><br/>Go watch in Imax!

"rivertam26","9","1","2","27 May 2013"," More Furious than ever!
","I don't think there has ever been a franchise in which the sixth entry has been it's best. I also don't think there has ever been a franchise where it really started getting good with the fourth. But here it is Furious 6 is one of the most entertaining action films I've ever seen. I won't lie and say that the series isn't a pure unadulterated guilty pleasure but make no mistake there is quality here. Director Justin Lin seems to be a master of orchestrating grand action set pieces, family melodrama thats actually engaging and a group of actors that let's face it are coasting on pure charisma and presence in these films at least. It's also surprising to see a franchise whose numbers have grown critically with each installment reaching an all time high with almost 80% positive on rotten tomatoes. And it's completely deserving. Picking up where the super entertaining Fast Five left off we find out automotive heroes enjoying their riches when Hobbs played by the king of likable himself the Rock tracks down Toretto (Diesel) for help with a very attractive international terrorist played by sexy Luke Evans the twist that was displayed in the last film is played as he tells him that the supposedly dead Letty played by Micelle Rodriguez with fierce sneer is alive and kicking. He of course immediately gathers up the gang and they go after her. What unfolds is a bit ridiculous which should be expected but it's also explosive. From the film's twists to the utter charm oozing off these actors to the one of a kind testosterone fueled adrenaline pumping action sequences this is one hell of a ride. There's even a few big surprises especially towards the end. With this entry they prove the formula isn't a fluke and I look forward to loads of more vehicular carnage for years to come. Gone are odd character moments and insipid car themed dialogue and what's replaced them is something you shouldn't feel guilty about loving cause it's awesome! 4.5/5"

","Just came back from watching the 6th installment of the fast and furious franchise and it lives up to it's expectations and then some. The film brings the old crew back together for a final job to stop a criminal only they can stop and of course The Rock approaches them for this final task. There is plenty of action, a few racing scenes and as you can expect cars being destroyed and hand to hand combat taking place. The film offers more action then Fast 5 but I enjoyed them equally. There is also some scenes that will make you laugh thanks to the character that Tyrese Gibson plays. Just when you think the film is over it is not and you are given one final encore. When the film finally does end you will see a message stating not to attempt the stunts in the movie and then you are shown a race taking place in Tokoyo with an unexpected surprise waiting for you if no one has ruined it yet. The film is a little over 2 hours but enjoyed every minute."

","What an addition to the already top class franchise! This is Paul Walker's best performance of all the parts..Vin Diesel plays Dom well,as always and Dwayne Johnson is the quirky,smart,big cop.Luke Evans plays Shaw so well,he's one of the best villains of the series. The entire star cast looks well adapted to their respective character which makes the plot more believable. The action sequences are crazy! Letty returns,makes it even crazier. Inspite of such a crowded star cast,there's no confusion whatsoever throughout the movie. Gal Gadot's tragic end is touching..so is Han's. Overall,the movie may not have such a strong storyline,but it more than makes up for it with it's soul,it's 12 year old core,superb action,great actors,crazy stunts and of course,that background score. Also,it's wonderful how the value of family is showcased. For me,its super-hit,adrenaline packed entertainment!"

","*contains spoiler* I can't wait for the movie to be released since the first time I heard that Fast and Furious 6 is going to be released and on production. Since Fast 5 is awesome, I expect more from Fast 6, and I am not disappointed, the movie is even more awesome than the previous one, at least I think it is. It is a great addition to the Fast and Furious franchise. More amazing fight scenes, a car that honestly first time i looked at it i think ""wow bat mobile"", funny scenes...and a TANK! Yes, a tank. Though, there's a scene when i thought ""is that even possible?!"", the 'catching scene'. However, you will not be disappointed. And the very last scene, Jason Statham..I can't wait for Fast 7.<br/><br/>Joe Taslim, playing as Jah, he is an actor from Indonesia, and Indonesians are all eager to watch this movie, we are all surprised (those who have watched it) that Joe said two words, yes even two words, we are all excited, in Indonesian language. And for your information which is not exactly necessary, but those two words are ""hantam mereka"" which is subtitled as ""i need your help"" is kinda wrong. It's actually like ""hit/beat/smash them"". Congratulations to Joe Taslim, it's really huge to be in this movie. (excuse my English)"

","This is one of those rare occasions when a franchise goes from being okay to being absolutely awesome. 12 years ago, I would have never expected this series to make it this far and not only that, to evolve into what it is today. Furious 6 does not pretend to be anything else but a high octane summer action movie and it does it better than any other movie this year so far.<br/><br/>In Furious 6 agent Hobbs request the help of Dominic and his crew to find a dangerous mercenary in exchange for full pardon, but also to find Dominic's believed deceased girlfriend, Letty. <br/><br/>This movie almost feels like a testosterone 007 movie. The series takes us to Spain and England. The chase sequences are just amazing, the stuns are great, and the cars, well; it's a Fast and Furious film. The acting it's what it is, but the thematic of family and friendship are believable and heartwarming. The main villain this time around is pretty solid and does feel like a true challenge for the protagonists. This movie was so well made and so fun to watch that after watching the surprise revelation at the ending credits I can't wait to see the next one. Furious 6 has it all, action, comedy, women, and a lot of insane cars. This is what true blockbuster movies are all about. I highly recommended."

","Fast & Furious 6 Review : A team of lethally skilled mercenary drivers led up by a criminal master mind Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) attacks and rob some parts of a satellite from a military convoy in Spain now Agent Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) is given a responsibility to hunt them down but given that they are fast he needs a team to catch them and that's where comes in our Daredevil Duos Dominick Torreto (Vin Diesel) & Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and their team. Apparently at the end of Fast 5 they are ultra-rich retired international criminals sipping beer in Spain living life peacefully until hobbs recruit them. The team come together ones again but this time to rescue the old gf of Dom. Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who presumed to be dead but revealed to be still alive with total memory loss and works for the bad guys now. As the story goes on you'ii be thrilled with awesome car chases, explosions, action, humor etc.. at one point as Roman says they are hunting their evil twins! as the movie come to its end Gisele (Gal Gadot) sacrifices her life to save Han (Sung Kang) and all bad guys are dead and Letty is now good girl and all goes well!!<br/><br/>Now Han goes to Tokyo to keep his promise to Gisele where all events from The Third Franchise of the series The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) happens so we can assume Tokyo Drift is chronologically the final chapter in the current series. And guess what they show the events of Tokyo Drift where Han dies of car crash. I was thinking they are showing how Han survived that crash and lived but they were showing the plot of the next film and Jason Statham one of my favourite action hero is the bad guy who killed Han and is the villain of Fast & Furious 7!<br/><br/>Fast & Furious 6 Or ""Furious 6"" is a must watch movie for all! My Rating For Furious 6 is 5/5! Just so excited for next Film! Loved it!"

","This was by far the best of the Fast & Furious series! It had a very good storyline, a great villain, and the action was non-stop from start to finish. Can't wait to add the Blu-Ray to my collection when it come out! The humor is just the right amount without overshadowing the plot. Somehow, they continue to seamlessly weave the story lines of all previous f&f's together so that it all comes together with a big aha! Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel (wow!) are both very good in their respective roles. There really is no supporting cast in this movie because everyone carries off their roles like lead actors. Kudos to the franchise for a great summer kickoff! Based on this latest release, I can't wait to see what's next!"
"Jay-Klee","8","1","2","27 May 2013"," Firing on all cylinders!
","I haven't always had a love affair with the F&F series. I thought the first one was pretty dumb, hated the second, and never saw the third. The fourth drew me in - I rented it at some point and found it really entertaining. Then, they brought in The Rock for the fifth, and I knew I had to see it. Justin Lin made a near perfect action movie with Fast Five, including one of the best action movie sequences (as unbelievable as it may be) of all time with the safe steal. That heightened my expectations for Fast & Furious 6.<br/><br/>Let's get this out of the way first - this movie has a terrible, terrible script. The dialogue is beyond horrible, to the point of eye rolling, and there are plot holes galore. However, you don't go into a F&F movie expecting to see a great script or natural dialogue - you go in to see over the top action set pieces, fast cars, and butt kicking...and on those notes, it hits on all cylinders.<br/><br/>There isn't anything in this movie that tops the stolen safe from Fast Five, but a scene featuring a tank on a freeway comes pretty damn close. The finale is also really intense, but I wish it would have been shot during the day instead of night, because a lot of what's going on is hard to see. I understand it was probably done for editing purposes, but a lot of it was just so confusing during the end. We get to see a lot of classic cars, testosterone, and explosions - overall, it's just a really fun movie, as ridiculous as it may be at points.<br/><br/>Don't get out of your seat right after the movie ends. There's a scene at the end that is surprising and amazing."
"arsiniryan","9","1","2","26 May 2013"," In Response to carl-walster's Review
","I composed this originally in response to carl-walster's review of the movie. But I figured, since I've written much, I might as well post it for others to read.<br/><br/>I'd like to comment on your review of the movie Furious 6. I really enjoyed the film so I would to give you reasons for your ""whys"".<br/><br/>Riley fought Letty even if nobody else was looking so that if ever she successfully captured the latter, Hobbs would trust her more (remember that Hobbs and Riley just met at the start of the movie). Besides, Letty couldn't have known that Riley was working for Shaw. <br/><br/>And about Shaw sending Riley ""to her death"", he didn't specifically send her to chase after Letty. It just happened that Riley went after Letty. Besides, Shaw was portrayed as someone who didn't care about his team personally.<br/><br/>About your doubt about Dom's car going at high speed then drove into the plane without shooting forward, the TV series Mythbusters had proved that the physics of that scene was accurate. If you think about it, the plane was also moving so the momentum of the car (a term you mentioned in your review) did not actually diminish in an instant; it was still moving when in got to the plane (from the perspective of someone outside the plane).<br/><br/>Then about the part where people were crushed by the tank and no one seemed fazed by it, it was not shown in the film (for obvious reasons) but surely ambulances came afterwards.<br/><br/>I do agree though that the Military should have involved themselves in some of the situations but still there are lots of reasons I can make up why they were not there.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding my disagreement with you, I also don't understand why Hobbs let Shaw get away when they have him to trade for Mia. He did not know she was going to be in the getaway plane. There would be no point in chasing Shaw again and capturing him if Mia was not there.<br/><br/>However, movies should be rated, first and foremost, on their entertainment value and not for the logic behind the scenes. And I was very much entertained by the movie. It did not deserve a 5/10 rating."
"YasheshJ","7","1","2","26 May 2013"," As if swanky cars weren't enough, Fast and Furious now have 'Tank' rampaging the roads—and, you are in for one hell of a ride!
","Yipin (Justin) Lin nails another F&F movie. The 6th installment doesn't just pick the tempo where Fast 5 concluded; it gets bigger too, and straightaway—no lag on plot development or character insights as it is already all set. From scene one you have fast cars in action, trailblazing through some beautiful locales.<br/><br/>F&F also provides what was amiss in Fast 5—a real villain of credibility in Shaw (Luke Evans), well supported by his sidekicks who match (even betters) Dom's crew blow-by-blow, i.e., until the climax of course.<br/><br/>Action in the film, as it was supposed to, overshadows all other aspect of the film but comedy, overall acting, editing, camera work, special effects, etc. gel well in this in this high octane showdown.<br/><br/>All in all, a perfect summer blockbuster for action buffs.<br/><br/>If the sneak-peek of F&F is anything to go by then the F&F 7 is going to be even 'massiver'—the newest addition (current tycoon of action films) to cast/franchise certainly indicates so! What more. Being a huge fan of Diesel's 'Riddick', I hope the success of F&F avails him enough riches to decently market/promote another potent, niche-focused, action/adventure franchise of his.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","While it doesn't quite reaches the dizzying height of FAST FIVE in term of action sequences, FAST & FURIOUS 6 is surprisingly more fun and more entertaining than the previous five movies have come before.<br/><br/>Just how far one can go with a franchise like THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS that originally centered on illegal street racing? In 2011, director Justin Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan are smart enough to revitalize the series in FAST FIVE by tweaking the formula with a heist-movie undertone. Now, in this sixth installment, Lin and his company has upped their ante by turning FAST & FURIOUS 6 into a MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE-like international intrigue filled with vehicular mayhem. It's hugely ridiculous, alright but FAST & FURIOUS 6 has no doubt exceeded my expectation for being the best movie in the series I've ever seen so far.<br/><br/>Chris Morgan's script has considerably improved this time around. All the returning cast shows more colors and winning chemistry and the jokes are funnier (especially involving Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges). While Justin Lin can't really matches the height of FAST FIVE's action scenes, they still delivers nonetheless with each set-pieces are outrageously silly but hugely entertaining than the last.<br/><br/>Better or improved as it may be, there are still rough patches within Chris Morgan's sometimes long-winded script -- particularly involving the convoluted revelation of Letty's back-from-the-death scenario. At times, Justin Lin tends to get overwhelmed with his hyper-kinetic direction. Some of the action scenes -- particularly hand-to-hand combat -- are mostly shot in rapid zooms and tight angles. Even the first two chase sequences during the night are sometimes hard to decipher what is really happening.<br/><br/>Despite some of its flaws, FAST & FURIOUS 6 remains a solid action-movie blockbuster that both fans and action fans will find this a true crowd-pleaser. Likewise, don't leave the cinema yet once the credits roll. There is a mid-credit teaser that ties back the event of 2006's THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT and a revelation of a certain iconic actor who will be appeared in next July's FAST & FURIOUS 7 (which will be directed by SAW helmer James Wan)."

","Well Toretto went for the right thing as far as I am concerned. Those black pants with the white design were worth the fight!! I couldn't help noticing all those Land Rovers travelling at break neck speeds. Way back when I purchased a surplus British Land Rover Series IIA. With Fairey Hubs/Overdrive the best you could ever do was about 50MPH. But I guess with a V8 engine you can really push it now. Despite all the pyrotechnics, I think the storyline was quite believable and the actors were well chosen. Michelle Rodriguez is striking not so much for the tough fight scenes but more so for a moral toughness. I bet she is like that in real life. The other characters were well played and fit their roles. Even though intellectually you know that the scenes can't possibly be real, your body believes it. The tank and huge aircraft scenes were scary beyond belief. I can't figure out what type of tank that was, sort of a cross between a Chieftain & AMX."

","This is not just a sequel, but it's a back to back sequel that goes back to all the five previous films. As we all know, Furious 6 stars the same cast from Fast Five (except Don Omar & Tego Calderon) and adds up new characters in the franchise who are Shaw (Luke Evans), Jah (Joe Taslim), Riley (Gina Carano) and brings back Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was last seen in Fast & Furious (2009).<br/><br/>This is definitely fast and furious if you compare this one to the other films. This is not about street racing. This is not about running away. And this is definitely not about another heist. Chris Morgan has sat down and written a predictable and strong script that drags ''The Fast And The Furious'' franchise more audience. But what we all should not forget is that this film is like a meal that has all types of delicious tastes. It has speed cars, amazing action sequences, sexy ladies, jokes that'll make you laugh for a while and at the end a surprise. Simply said, it's the action packed blockbuster of the year! <br/><br/>It's actually pretty cool to see Dominic (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker) and the rest of the crew take side with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). When you leave the theater, it will give you a different, but satisfied feeling. Probably because all the actors in this film have important roles that just turn out to be bigger and bigger for each and every sequel. It's not just about Dom and Brian, but about everyone. Without one of all these characters, Furious 6 would have been a mess. That says how important each and every character is.<br/><br/>Furious 6 is not a fun ride like Fast Five, but it is a serious ride. This is not the film you want to miss at the theater. Book the tickets as soon as possible, buy a pop-corn and soda and enjoy this ride. This is way better than what you think/expect.<br/><br/>Dear Justin Lin, Thank you for the 4 fantastic films that you've directed in The Fast And The Furious saga. You will definitely be missed in the next film."

This film makes Iron Man 3 look like garbage. I mean that. This is without a doubt the action film of the summer, and is going to be very difficult to top.

Maybe 10 is a very high note, but thinking on the kind of movie we decide to see, is what it deserves. The movie have a lot of jokes that really work well with the plot. It's hard to get that combination (plot-jokes) work properly but this is one of that rare cases. About the action, the scenes looks very natural maybe some annoying close ups but overall very good job with chasing scenes.

","The last one was good, because a lot of action at the rest of the plot, but this one connected all the lost cable that bring us the 3 movie (Tokyo drift). Is sad to see how they traded one for one, I mean the lost of the girl in the last part, but that was necessary, but the ending of this movie is going to make another epic fast and furious. I like how the director make this movie, a lot of action, a little of drama, a little of sad part, even race like the old times in the first movie. Something that i did not saw was Tego Calderon and Don Omar. But Vin Diesel told that in the next movie will be in Puerto Rico( or almost some part of it) so the next one will be a revenge, plus a add to the family of toreto, the protagonist of the Tokyo drift. Is logical he is going to revenge his friend Hank. So if you are reading this go see the movie, and prepare to be 2 hours of action and in the last minute of the movie don't go , sit and watch the last part."
"notaufo","7","1","2","23 May 2013"," Simple, kinda solid and a hole lot of crazy action... Needs more Diesel!
","My first thought of all this was, when I came outside of the movie theater: ""Man it totally dig this movie. I can't even really explain out why but I guess I could try""<br/><br/>Good sides : Rock + Diesel = Win Rock + Diesel + working together = Epic Win All crew together + Michelle = Definitely win Tank in fast lane + Cars hanging from airplane like Christmas tree ornaments = Priceless Over the top action - you know what I am talking about =D But it's in the right place at least here at this film. So much action sequences made air so concentrated with testosterone you could actually hang hatchet in thin airspace.'No metaphor here' Car chase sections = extremely well made. It's so nice to see on screen some nicely filmed scenes than relaying heavily on CG(Yeah they use CG too I know I know).<br/><br/>Bad sides: Story - you know they are 'like living like kings, but something is missing, so we should put our lives on line'. Okay it's not this film's biggest flaw. ""Huge spoiler starts"" Silliness - Luke Evan tells them to release him and give him the chip because he has Jordana hostage and they actually do it and like 5 minutes later they are trying to arrest him. Yeah I know I'm not telling everything I felt like that was the ""facepalmness"" moment in whole film. Amnesia - well I actually was hoping for the most part of film that 'she' was faking it but even if she would it wouldn't make much sense.<br/><br/>Neutral(I'm not sure if it's bad or good) - 'The true end' with Statham and Han's death. It's nice to know there's going to next movie but if that was the best way? ""Huge spoiler ends""<br/><br/>Conclusion: All in all a great fast popcorn-flicky film. Really feel that tank chase should have been longer and film itself should have been longer in order to explain some things a little bit better. + Some extra funny moments Franchise is doing great I feel that one of following 7,8,9 part will be so great that I will sleep with it's DVD under my pillow and just next to my teddy bear."

When a franchise stretches up to the sixth movie, it's generally bad news and F&F6 is no exception. First the good things, which are few and not very important: the cars are nice, some special effects and scenes are very well done and some actors do a decent job. Everything else is bad, and I will be picking exclusively on DWAYNE THE ROCK JOHNSON (just because I hate him). I mean, this guy hasn't participated in a single good scene ever (let alone a decent movie). I know he's big, and that he's now part of the F&F's roster (something fans of the movie tend to consider sacred and often use to justify the quality of this film), but still, it's not worth it. Toretto's character grew old long time ago, as well as his relationship with Letty and his friends. Honestly WE JUST DON'T CARE ANYMORE. Either come up with something different or let the franchise die, which is something you should have done after the first movie honestly.

","At the end of part 5, the F&F crew split $100million between them; somehow, a share of that haul bought Roman (Tyrese Gibson) a lear jet, a luxury yacht and a penthouse apartment, with cash to spare. Talk about getting the most from your money. Still, this is one of the least unbelievable things in a film that doesn't just ask the viewer to suspend disbelief, but rather grabs them by the neck and demands that they do so or else.<br/><br/>This chapter in the dumb but entertaining blockbuster franchise sees Dom (Vin Diesel) reassembling his crew to help special agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) stop an international criminal from obtaining the components to build a bomb that will be worth billions to the wrong people. To paraphrase one of the characters, it's some '007-type s**t', but taken to extremes, with action set-pieces that not only defy logic, but also the laws of physics.<br/><br/>For some viewers, it will all be a step too far, although judging by the film's cumulative worldwide gross, this is exactly what many want in a summer blockbuster. Me? I fall somewhere in the middle: there are moments that are extremely well handled (Gina Carano's fist fight with Michelle Rodriguez is excellent); a few scenes are exhilarating popcorn nonsense that I cannot help but enjoy for their sheer audacity (the tank crushing cars on a Spanish highway); but others push credibility beyond even what I can accept in a silly summer action flick (the ridiculous finale on the world's longest runway).<br/><br/>That said, I'd much rather watch this than another Michael Bay Transformers film.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for Carano (who should have nabbed the Wonder Woman gig instead of Gal Gadot)."

","Unlike the review written by Steve Pulaski, I'm not going to get into homo eroticism and other such psydointellecual tripe, this movie is just a bad Robert Ludlum knockoff. In fact, most of his stuff is pretty horrible to begin with (not to mention his ghost written post death, Matt Damen dreck). There's nothing fast or furious about this movie. What few chase scenes there are in this movie are all hacked to pieces. The shots of the actors faces are too numerous and are nothing more than filler. One ""Bullitt"" or ""The Vanishing Point"" is worth a thousand ""Fast and Furious 6"". But considering how much money this movie made, how can you argue with it. The ""down low "" culture of 15 year olds has taken over. The good old days of car chases is dead and buried. Man buns and Taliban beards now rule."

","It did not disappoint. If you are familiar with the franchise and who isn't. It's everything you come to expect. Just more of it. Not looking for no deep meaning, just fun. Some of the stunts are unbelievable but I expect spectacular from this franchise. I don't know how much longer they can keep it up and keep something that fans will spend their money for. I loved the comic relief. Hope there's more of that in the next movie. Good to know people are still making movies just for fun. Every film does not have to have social commentary just great cgi! Don't get me wrong there is a plot & a story. Same basically as all the others in the franchise and for subsequent movies in the Fast and Furious line."
"prestonwardcondra","8","1","3","9 August 2015"," I liked it but, it's definitely not for everyone.
","I'll do a quick synopsis of this movie given the fact that, reviews range in different lengths on this website. Fast & Furious 6 is a pretty good movie, despite some glaring issues.<br/><br/>The biggest of which I'll get out of the way. There is no sense of realism to Fast and Furious 6 and the same can be said for the rest of the franchise. Zero. <br/><br/>The biggest head-tilter of which was when Dom (Vin Diesel) jumps from a car onto a bridge to catch Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) with nothing to support his fall. He just magically jumps 50 feet across a bridge and catches her onto on-coming traffic, escaping with only a few minor cuts and bruises. The whole scene was put in cheap slow motion effect. You'll no doubt go ""as if..."" after watching that part.<br/><br/>It's worth noting though the effects have gotten drastically better when you compare it to the first Fast and Furious movie that was released back in 2001. It's like night and day when you draw a comparison to movies released in 2001 and 2013.<br/><br/>Despite it's faults, I recommend at least renting the movie and giving it a shot."
"joshuadrake-39480","7","1","3","23 April 2015"," The sixth film has arrived!
","Fast & Furious 6 is the sequel to Fast Five (2011) and the sixth installment of the FAST & THE FURIOUS franchise. This film was in development by February 2010 as the first film in the series to move away from the underground car-racing theme of the previous films in the series which was considered to have placed a barrier on audience numbers. The film was released on May 24th, 2013 and grossed over $780 million dollars worldwide.<br/><br/>The plot follows Dominic Toretto and his crew who has retired following their successful heist in the fifth film, but remain wanted fugitives until they return to the USA at the end of this film. USS Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs offers to clear their records and allow them to return home in exchange for helping him to take down a skilled mercenary organization led by Owen Shaw, one member of which Toretto's presumed-dead lover Letty Ortiz. They save Letty, but Mia is kidnapped by Shaw's team and this leads into a super-intense conclusion.<br/><br/>The story is really well-thought out, but there are a few flaws but that does not stop this movie from being really good. Some of the dialog does not make any sense, but some of the jokes and dialog by the cast makes a lot of sense in some of the movie really cool. A few lines are also really quotable lines especially with our main antagonist when he reminds Dom and the crew saying, ""This code you live by, is the very reason why you weren't even in the game."" The action is a little over-the-top but it stills keeps me interested. However, the second car chase in the middle of the film was way too destructive in this film, but I really liked it though. But did you really had to try and kill Letty by throwing her off a tank? No. I will admit, the ending 12 or 14 minute climactic car-chase sequence is pretty awesome with a mix of CGI, pre-visualization, stunt work and live-action footage.<br/><br/>The acting is a little confusing, but I will give credit to our main actors: Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs, Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto, Sung Kang and Gal Gadot as Han Seoul-Oh and Gisele Yashar, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous as Roman Peace and Tej Parker and of course, Elsa Pataky, Chris Hemsworth's real life wife, as Elena Neves. They all do a good job. John Ortiz returns as Braga and he does a good job, but he is only in the prison scenes. Gina Carano plays Riley and she does a great job as a villain, at the end, but even then she's a mixed-martial arts fighter and her performance is over-the-top in a few areas, but she keeps me interested in her character until she is killed by Letty.<br/><br/>Our villain is British newcomer, Luke Evans as the role of Owen Shaw, the brother of the next villain, who is revealed as Han's killer at the end of this film in a post-credits scene that sets up FURIOUS 7 fantastically as the evil Deckard Shaw, who calls Dominic with a threatening message: ""Dominic Toretto, you don't know me. But you're about to."" The music is composed by Lucas Vidal and I am confused because I like Brian Tyler's musical score for the other films in the series, even Furious 7. I don't like half of Vidal's score, but I am glad some of Brian Tyler's music is present in this film.<br/><br/>Also, I am very sad to see Gisele die. That part when Gal Gadot's character sacrifices herself to save Sung Kang's character, Han was a little bit over-the-top. Also, we see Han die again and this was shown in Tokyo Drift, the third Fast and Furious film, that was released in 2006.<br/><br/>So, overall, with FAST SIX or FAST & FURIOUS 6, I both love it and hate it. The movie does a few things right, but the whole idea of kidnapping Mia was a little bit crazy, but this is FAST and FURIOUS, so I'll give credit to the director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan for coming up with a great climax. I give it a 7.9 out of 10. It's not the best Fast and the Furious film ever, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse. And I do mean worse, I'm referring to the fourth film, simply titled Fast and Furious, which was released in 2009."
"nunophoenix-683-948557","6","1","3","8 December 2014"," Not worth all the hype
","Following the success of Fast Five, the sixth installment of one of the longest running and most profitable movie franchises ever had some pretty big shoes to fill in, however, this was not accomplished this time. To keep the series going and attract the audience the franchise was turned into an action series with some car chases here and there to please everyone, at the expense of almost everything else.<br/><br/>Despite this change the fifth movie was somewhat original and brought something new, while remaining faithful to the basics that made this franchise known all around the world. Personally I think the ""it's an action movie, what would you expect?"" type of arguments are just lame excuses to cover up the flaws, and Furious 6 has a lot. From a poorly written script with a character that is brought from the dead and magically learns how to fight UFC style, despite serious injuries and an amnesia (no, couldn't have learned it with the other guy, they weren't that close...) to the action scenes themselves there's nothing new to see here, except more of the same mindless action sequences and even more unrealistic stunts (yap, too much, even for this series). For a vast majority this will be enough, for everyone else it won't. The writers could have made a better job IMO by keeping Dom in his new relationship (which was more than just a mere ""rebound"" apparently...) and not using constantly the ""got to get rid of a certain character to complete the trilogy"" philosophy. Fast Five still remains the best. so far."
"sn319","8","1","3","6 December 2014"," Turn Off Your Brain and Enjoy the Ride
","Almost as if some sort of divine intervention took place, this Fast movie is the best in the franchise, combining a lot of high-octane, ridiculous action with a decent plot, bad guy, and the entertaining character interactions of the previous film. Instead of boring us with attempts at story and character this one understands that the Fast series should be popcorn films and assaults us with nonstop action from start to finish. None of the middle slump I complained about in the other movies, this one is paced well.<br/><br/>Federal agent Hobbes tasks Dom and the team with one final mission; to take down a world class driver connected to the cartel from Fast and Furious, and who also has Letty driving with him. Since she's supposed to be dead, this interests Dom immensely and leads to a reunion from the previous film. Taking down the bad guys won't be as easy as before and the team races through the streets of London and Spain to stop a super weapon from being placed in the wrong hands.<br/><br/>It's a James Bond level plot with Schwarzenegger style action. The focus is not on racing but on driving fast and causing a lot of explosions. It's dumb, that's for sure, but it's also exceptionally fun. The tank scene gets a groan for physics but a hurray for still managing to be kind of awesome. The final scene has the longest runway on the planet combined with the stupidest take down of a cargo plane in film history but it's still cool. Turn off your brain, sit back, and enjoy it. That's all you can do.<br/><br/>As a movie it's the most fun of the series, the best as far as action goes, and I have to say it's the most entertained I've been since starting the franchise. A lot of people hate this one because of the focus not being on where the series started but I think it's better this way and the product is a lot more enjoyable. It's not a film for everyone but if you love big, dumb action movies, this one is a true treat."

Dom, Brian, Mia, Letty, Han, Gisele, Hobbs, Roman and Tej. Technically, Hobbs isn't in the gang, but still. But the end... Tears!!!!!!!<br/><br/>In this movie, Dom is living a pretty simple life, in a non extradition country. With his girlfriend, Mia and Brian and their new baby. But when Hobbs finds him and shows him a photo of his deceased girlfriend, Letty, working with a very dangerous guy, he decides to go after her. The whole gang comes along to try and save her. She had lost her memory and didn't even know that they guy she's chasing after, used to be her boyfriend. At the end, Han is a car crash and dies. Wait... this happened in Tokyo Drift. It did indeed. You're not wrong. But the order of the movies doesn't go, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (seven is coming out soon), the order actually goes, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7. And it makes much more sense now. Because in Tokyo Drift, after Han died, we saw Dom say that they used to roll together, but we had no idea that Dom even knew him. That's because at that point he didn't, but now, thanks to the new order, he did. I can't wait to see Fast and Furious 7. But poor Han. And poor Gisele, she died. But good news, Letty and Dom got back together. Hobbs let everyone go free, thanks to them helping him track down and kill a dangerous guy, and also a girl who was working both sides. And Dom even got his beloved house in Los Angeles back. The end of the movie is Han dying, but before that is everyone having a lovely Sunday BBQ.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10."

","It's amazing how we are now six films in this lucrative franchise, and each film gets better and better. It truly amazes me what the filmmakers are able to come up with to please the audience and fans of The Fast and the Furious. Fast & Furious 6 continues on the track Fast Five took and it introduces us a bigger, badder villain, the cast reunited one again, a trip to London, and some high-octane action sequences involving a plane and a tank. If you don't think they outdid themselves with stunts from the previous film, you're about to be amazed.<br/><br/>Justin Lin's film takes place after the events of Fast Five as the crew have retired after their heist, though they are still wanted. However, Hobbs offers them all full pardons if they help him take down a skilled mercenary named Owen Shaw whose gang of members include the presumed-dead Letty.<br/><br/>The acting is really good and everyone has really matured from the first film, so that was a plus to see. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are like brothers and are the faces of the franchise, but they did a very good job once again. Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, and Sung Kang are all welcome members of the crew. Dwayne Johnson comes back and does not hold back as Hobbs. Michelle Rodriguez makes a welcome return, though her acting seems a little fishy. Luke Evans makes a potent villain and is leagues above the villain from the previous movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Fast & Furious 6 is an awesome, high-energy, action-packed extravaganza and it will certainly blow your mind away. I liked how they tell more of a story here backed by some realistic dramatic moments. This film is not all about the action, but about being a family. I also like the montage in the beginning as it shows how the characters have changed from Film 1. If the post-credits scene is any indication, I'm definitely looking forward to Fast 7. And finally, R.I.P Paul Walker! I rate this film 9/10."

","Fast and Furious 6 is the 6th movie of the successful series by Justin Lin. With a budget of 160 Mio.

These are the reasons why the F&F audience is amazed since 2001. Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel fulfill the broad spectrum of the F&F viewers' expectations. But is it as good as expected? Fast Five has been criticized a lot because of the giant lack of realism, physics were not taken seriously and the majority of the dialogues seemed too artificial and not proper. F&F 6 did not improve this. Fast Five has been also criticized because the focus was on the action instead of the cars and tuning. This has been changed, which brings the series back to its roots. Real F&F fans will be just as entertained as by the previous movies. <br/><br/>The soundtrack by 2 Chainz and Wiz Khalifa contains hip hop with a touch of electro. This is the secret recipe of F&F.<br/><br/>The list of the used automobiles reaches from the Ford Escort RS 2000 (1974), over some classics like the Aston Martin DB7 (1994) to modern sport cars like the Dodge Charger SRT-8 (2012).<br/><br/>Fast and Furious 6 is a good movie. After the Fast-Five-disappointment the series comes back to its roots. The realism has some flaws but just the average action movie mistakes which are nothing special these days.

","This is a good movie. It is pretty much what you would expect from a Fast & Furious movie. It could have been a great movie but it is unfortunately dragged down by some of the not too unusual Hollywood stupidity and arrogance towards the viewers.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson are perfect in their roles as old-fashioned, hard-hitting, fast-driving macho guys. Michel Rodriquez is doing a decent enough job as well but then I do like Michel Rodriquez so These guys are making a lot of the movie for me. The rest is not bad but more like filling out some empty space compared to Vin and Dwayne.<br/><br/>This is of course a movie about fast driving, action and special effects. In those areas it does not disappoint. There are lots of fast driving and lots of action and special effects. Not all of it is entirely realistic of course. This is rather expected and I can live with it as long as it doesn't go to far into the realm of ludicrously unrealistic which it, sadly, did towards the end. Although the effects and fights themselves were quite cool the entire flight escape scene was just ludicrous. They were driving at take-off speed, both on the ground and in the air, for how long? 20 minutes? That must have been the worlds longest runway. This is what I call Hollywood arrogance towards the viewers. Do they really think the viewers are so stupid that they will just buy this? Or is it that they themselves are so utterly stupid that they do not realize how utterly wrong the entire thing is? For me this really dragged down an otherwise great movie.<br/><br/>Otherwise the movie is a nice blend between macho talk, action, lots of fast driving, some humor, some more action, some more fast driving and lots of chars getting smashed. In short all the things that make up a good fun action movie. The story itself? Well, as far as I am concerned, fairly standard issue which held the action together reasonably although the basic idea and technical aspects, especially this ""EMP chip"", where not very believable.<br/><br/>On the whole, it was a good and enjoyable movie which good have been great if it were not dragged down by Hollywood stupidity."

But the action in this film has been ramped up so much it's an adrenaline rush 80% of the time.<br/><br/>Action in the Fast flicks have always been incredible, but here, it is several notches over that. After the movie, you simply cannot imagine how the stunts are done. All I did most of the time was sit slack-jawed watching all the vehicular action unfold on screen. And this time, there are more than just cars, and much, much more than just car racing.<br/><br/>And as is the trend now, the film ends with a teaser for Fast 7.

","Fast and Furious 6 for better or for worse is unapologetically dumb, overly masculine, and juvenilely cartoonish piece of summer popcorn fluff that mostly makes up for its flaws with some immensely well crafted action sequences. <br/><br/>The story: If you haven't been doing your homework for the previous, I can't believe it, five installments in the seemingly immortal Fast and Furious franchise, you have no need to feel guilty. These films are about fast cars, half naked, sun brazed models, exotic locals, fast paced racing. and at their core, the value of ""family"". Giggle. No but Fast 5 flipped the franchise around and turned it into more of a heist-action series, and thats where Fast 6 picks up. After cashing in the big bucks in Rio, tough guy street racer Dom (Vin Disel), his cop turned teammate Brian (Paul Walker), and the rest of their diverse gang of engine junky pals have settled down. That is until federal agent and mutual friend Hobbes (Dwane Johnson) needs them to stop another gang of vehicle revving baddies who want to...uh...I'll try and remember... acquire a computer chip? Something involving cyber terrorism, I think. It doesn't matter. What's important in this movie is that things blow up and rubber gets burned. <br/><br/>The good: Justin Lin's direction and execution of the action by FAR is the highlight of this picture. The action sequences are fluidly shot, fairly intense, well paced, and pretty freaking fantastic. Actually, the final one is so great, that it ranks up as one of the best action set pieces I've seen in a while. Though some have ridiculous moments or endings, the ""bridge-tank showdown"" in particular, that bend the laws of physics into levels of absurdity, it does partially establish that the characters are almost like superheros, so many of the instances of car hopping and plane jumping can be excused. The special effects are very solid, except some very brief moments of CGI vehicle jumping. It has a nice glossy, summer movie look to it, and has a fairly decent mixture of shaky and refreshingly wide shots. Some of the cast are fine, and have some chuckle worthy moments of comic relief, even if some of the jokes fall flat. It also is nice to see the range of diversity in the cast if not all of the participants are skilled line readers. <br/><br/>The bad: The plot and stupidity. Now the story in this movie is so flat that I forgot about what the team and baddies were fighting for all along, and I have a feeling that the actors and director might have in a sense as well. I know that you aren't supposed to walk into these types of movies looking for a complex narrative, but still it couldn't hurt to add an ounce more of intelligence and cleverness. The dialogue does have some moments of humor, but still the mixture of stilted and clichéd lines and flat acting can leave a laughable, almost cringe-worthy effect at times on the viewer. This especially occurs in the monotonous and shallow conversations about ""family"" that keep showing up in these movies, and oddly try to hammer the message in, but after a while it's like beating a dead horse. The pacing, which is great in the first half, does become choppy by the second, and annoyingly slows down to become more serious. The fine actors are passable, but the others need work. I'm glad that some of these new faces and different ethnic types of actors have their spotlight moments in the film, but still seem more skilled at kicking ass then delivering quips. I don't want to sound to harsh, and it wasn't horribly distracting either. I also understand that you must have your suspension of disbelief on full blast throughout, but there are some moments of impossible physics that are just unbelievable. Some of the jokes miss more than they hit, but I respect them for trying. Also, I wish that the films tone didn't become try to become so serious, because when it does that, the film almost unintentionally becomes campy and laughable. A little does of more self aware and breezy humor could have done it better. <br/><br/>My take: Fast 6 is nothing more than dumb while slickly made entertainment but I can say that it is another step in the right direction for the once sinking series. See it alone for the final action sequence, which is really spectacular, and I say you will have a decent if unintelligent time. <br/><br/>Be sure to stick around for it's post credit scene, hilarious and bad-ass at the same time!"

","If you want mindless action, there are many better movies to watch. This movie is aimed at the youth market, primarily boys who play video games. The script is off-putting for several reasons: 1. the franchise has gone past the street racing story that made the first several installments fun to watch. The sixth film has become more James Bond than East L.A. The world must be saved from evil geniuses who will possess Doomsday military hardware unless Dom and his crew stop them. This premise takes the story away from California and off to Moscow, Macau, London, and Spain where the team works with a unit of the U.S. government. 2. The dialog is leaden. The main characters speak in philosophical nuggets. As one might expect from the spy genre, they did not scrimp on special effects, explosions or computer graphics. Because of the number of sequels, the dialog is filled with nostalgic references to the past. One should have seen the prior films in order to understand all the references. The sappy references to the past are overdone. <br/><br/>Dom's men live by a code - something about keeping the family together. The team is not only saving the world, they are saving Letty who is in the clutches of the evil geniuses who will destroy the world. Apparently, she didn't die in a prior sequel, but she does suffer from amnesia. These are the standard plot devises of soap opera fare. The film runs a little long, but there is no stretch of film that rings true. <br/><br/>Boys who love video games might like this film, but the story is lame and the massive expense for special effects could have supported the making of a dozen good movies.

The car chasing scene between DK and Han on the road of Tokyo and 'Jason Statham' appearance at the end of this film is not only surprising to the audience but also provides clear picture of what's happening and creating exciting new plot for this movie sequel which is also the sequel to The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift."

Then it was a ""Huh?"" moment. Mainly a ""Huh, why aren't they both suffering shattered bones?"" moment, in fact.<br/><br/>Later on, they indulged themselves ever more. The runway sequence went on for far, far too long. I don't mean that it was boring, just that there isn't a paved runway that long anywhere in the damn world! The bad guy drives onto the runway and, thirteen minutes and five seconds later, the chase concludes on the same runway. I'm going to be generous and say they were going only about fifty mph (the drama suggests far faster speeds). That gives a runway length of ten point something miles. Edwards Airforce base's longest runway is seven and a half miles long and it isn't paved. So where this foolishness is supposed to take place I have no idea.<br/><br/>I wouldn't mind, but the runway scene is blatantly overlong. Even knowing nothing about airports or the like, it leaves you wondering about it.<br/><br/>Character-wise, I get that Dom loved Letty and thought she was dead, so he moved on with the Brazilian chick, Elena. But character-wise, is it so hard to think he might find it just a little bit more difficult to dump Elena in favour of Letty again when he finds out she's still alive? I'd have been happier if his character had stayed with Elena. Letty had lost her memory, so she had nothing more than vague feelings to go on to tell her that he was anything special to her. A perfect opportunity to have things work out without making it the usual saccharin-fest, everything works out in the end type of deal that Hollywood is so fond of.<br/><br/>All this ending left me was feeling that Dom had shafted Elena (and not in the fun way, either!). No amount of ""She's okay with all this"" convinced me otherwise. It all smacks of ""Let's get Michelle Rodriguez back in the franchise 'cos it needs a boost."" followed by ""Wait! What about that other chick Dom was going out with at the end of the last movie?"" and then blank looks all around until ""We'll hand-wave their relationship away!"" Still, I suppose it was better than ""Let's kill her off to clear the way for Dom to get Letty back!"" All in all, though, a disappointment at several points. In between, it was fun and entertaining. However, it did leave a sense of dissatisfaction due to the nonsense scattered throughout.<br/><br/>Here's hoping they don't try and top the action in this one next time around.<br/><br/>It seems like even numbered Fast movies are not the best of the bunch."

","This was one of the most action-packed movies I've ever seen. And no, I'm not an adolescent.<br/><br/>Those reviewers who complained about the contrivances or plot-holes, apparently didn't get the point. In this kind of sub-genre, you have to be willing to sit back with your popcorn and allow some inconsistencies or fallacies. The action makes up for it more than enough. The acting was decent; and aside from the moderate cheesiness, which was actually less than in certain James Bond flicks, I couldn't see anything to complain about. In my opinion this film deserves its high rating and is worthy of a second watch. It's one of the very few movies which I've ever rated 9/10. <br/><br/>To say it once more: the action was fantastic, breathtaking, exhilarating and really fun!"

","Expectations were high after the inexplicably positive reaction to Fast Five. That film, was completely over the top and thoroughly cool. It seemed as though the Fast franchise was on the precipice of becoming the perfect example of straight-up popcorn cinema; unabashed, silly, and awesome. The ads for Furious 6 gave the impression we were gonna be taken to yet another level this time, (did they frickin' crash a plane with a harpoon!!?) Things were about to get even more insaner-er, i mean we talking' VE-hicular warfare. What's left to say?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Fast 6 is not even awesome for what it is. Yes we get a couple pretty sweet moments here and again; the highway-tank battle being the prime example. But who would've thought the sludge weighing a movie like this down would be too...much....talking. I'm serious, there's about 35 minutes of setup which covers precisely the same material the trailer compressed into about 25 seconds. This is not good for a movie like this. But this wouldn't even be much of a problem if all those interaction/""character development"" scenes were remotely interesting...or good. They are not. <br/><br/>The first half is snore inducing, and the characters are not only unlikable, but shallow...no, I mean like even for this kind of film. A good example of this is the movie introduces another hotshot, car-driving crew, and one of the characters has to outright spell out how they are the evil dopplegangers of our favorite nice, team of criminals. The other crew of characters, even for the one-dimensional stereotypes they are, are somehow flat. There's literally not one memorable thing about any one of them.<br/><br/>Another issue the movie struggles with is focus. We've got Toretto with his whole ""get Letty back"" plot line, we've got the Rock doing his thing, and then there's this whole subplot with Paul Walker's cop past coming back for him in prison as he's ambushed by some dudes he put away, all of which could've been an entirely separate movie. The film jumps and cuts back and forth between so many different ideas, it loses all sense of direction. And the one- liners...OMG! Suffice to say, the one-liners on the trailer are the absolute best the film has. As I said, there's a couple amusing set-piece moments, but hardly enough to offset the dullness and trudgy pace.<br/><br/>Undemanding viewers may derive some pleasure out of Fast and Furious 6 on a completely brainless, intentionally dumb and juvenile level. But Fast Five showed us we can do better.<br/><br/>6.0/10"

","Fast and Furious 6 is quite on par with the rest of the movies in the series. Not the best, but definitely not the worst. The first hour and a half were quite good, and I didn't understand what the other reviewers were complaining about. It felt just like the other movies, and some parts were even better. But the last two action sequences were exaggerated.<br/><br/>The good about Fast and Furious 6: All the members of the team were busy and had their parts. This is the first time that they were actually matched with a tough rivals. Luke Evans played his character well, and he had a crew that was physically tough, sophisticated and well equipped. The return of Letty is good thing as well. Michelle Rodriguez was perfect.<br/><br/>The bad: The exaggerated last action sequences. It's not that Fast 5 had a credible last scene. It didn't have, but I didn't think about it when I was watching it. It was just fun. Here I found myself thinking 'this is too much'. Another think is Hobbs. I liked him in the fifth movie. Here I find him slightly annoying. And some fights in the end felt redundant. I think that if the director have settled on more casual action, instead of choosing the bigger but much less credible action, it would be better."
"dinuks","5","1","3","10 June 2013"," Seems like the director took his hands off the wheel...
","It seems that nowadays directors are trying to out-do each other with the most number of unbelievable action scenes and unnecessary plot-twists. It's like the 80s all over again. Fast and Furious is transitioning into Die Hard. <br/><br/>The good part is that it was enjoyable, with a lot of good comedy. The rest though, left something to be desired. Reviewers Carl-Walster and Justin Curtis do a great job of pointing out everything that's wrong with the movie. Apart from what they've said already, why would a supposedly calculating criminal mastermind like Shaw suddenly go on a murderous rampage crushing innocent people on a highway? <br/><br/>Somewhere late into the movie they had decided that they needed another plot-twist, and turned Gina Carano's character, who was a good cop throughout the whole movie, into a dirty cop at the last minute. <br/><br/>While this movie packs excitement and is still a fun night out, it's a disappointment for F&F fans. All in all I wish Rob Cohen would come back to this franchise and take it back to the roots.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the sequel with Jason Statham. But that's from a horror movie director, so I'm not having high expectations."
"wj826117","1","1","3","5 June 2013"," CGI...Meh.....story...Meh....Script....Meh Spoiler alert!
","This movie honestly made me furious!! Story- the story was awful! even though for a action movie like this, story is really secondary, but the problem is they came changing what has happened in the past just to create crappy twists. A Twist would only work if it surprises the audience but at the same time can be accepted as it make logical sense. However, all these stupid twists that made no sense and threw alway all the story viewers watched and believed in previous episodes without logical explanations is a real put off. For example we all expected and knew Letty was dead, and now they bring her back in with crappy explanation by the plot. And ever since 2006 when Tokyo drift came out, viewers believed Han was killed by that crazy jap guy, and now they are changing that too just to bring in Jason Statham?, I m sure there are many other ways to include him in the plot. There are many other stupid twists but I am sure viewers get my point.<br/><br/>Action and stunts- For movies like this, the action and stunts can be as crazy and unrealistic as possible and no many people would complain, but the important thing is that it has to look REAL. Fast 6 used way too much CGIs and it looked awful. If we look back in to most of the previous episodes, none of them were short of crazy stunts but at least they look real such as Fast two when Paul walker drove the car into the boat, or fast 5 when Paul walker and Vin diesel drove the car off the cliff and landed into the sea, i am not sure if those stunts were really made but aleast they look as if they did and that is what satisfy me for movie likes this. CGI is fine for movies like avengers where the plot is based on a fantasy world, but i am sure for most people that follows the FnFurious serious, they watch it because they like action and cars and wanted to see crazy Stuff they don't see in real life, but to see how the movie overly use CGIs makes me feel being cheated on and was a big disappointment to me.<br/><br/>Script- Horrible, but not as bad as the two points discussed above so not going to get into it.<br/><br/>Lastly, was anyone put off by the overly exposed product placement of Corona beer?"
"arnieiam","6","1","3","4 June 2013"," Watch it with half the brain you used to watch Fast Five with
","Oh wow, this is what you call jumping the shark. It all started in 2001 with a low budget film about the street racing subculture. Now its become an action film franchise with over the top machismo. Each film progressively chipped away more logic and physics.<br/><br/>Now I actually liked Fast Five because it actually had a believable premise given the context. Yes it was cheesy and over testosteroned but it actually had a well paced plot. However the cast has ballooned to a very large size, this film's become very unfocused. So much so that every character is now laughably one dimensional. There are numerous contrived plot points and no character ever questions anything. The Rock's character is after a bad guy but since the bad guy uses cars, oh, I need Vin Diesel AND HIS TEAM for this. And yeah, everyone is willing no question.<br/><br/>I thought that Fast Five actually concluded the characters story arcs but they wanted to due a fan service by resurrecting Michelle Rodriguez. And it was done in the most contrived fashion as possible by giving her amnesia.<br/><br/>The film did have some pretty good set pieces but sadly you saw all these action sequences in the trailer. And thats because the film slows down in the second act and it tries to liven up by even putting in a street race in the middle of a surprisingly empty London. And that's weird seeing how each film's plot revolves around how many car stunts they can put in.<br/><br/>And the action scenes really make the vault drag in Fast Five physically plausible. There is so much flying around and defying gravity, I'll bet you'll see less in the upcoming Superman film. And the physics of this film is so inconsistent. In the tank scene we see the villain engage in casual murder by pancaking all the cars in a highway yet it seems to have trouble crushing Tyrese's car. Also the plane scene in the climax; that must be the longest runway in the world.<br/><br/>I can see why Justin Lin took this franchise to that many films, because the initial ones weren't that profitable. However at over 2 hours long, you start wondering how you could take any of the cheesy dialogue that fills this film seriously.<br/><br/>Oh well, its pure popcorn pleasure. It knows what it does, even though you'll be palming your forehead at many instances."

Then after the take out a tank Letty almost falls to her death until Dom rams his car into the bride wall and somehow catapults himself out of the car and caches her smashing the windshield of a car on the other side. First off when a car hit the wall earlier it went through the wall falling to its doom and now it can withstand impact. Then Dom somehow doesn't get hurt from crashing into the wall or landing straight on his back at full force.<br/><br/>The last part of the movie is just as bad because they are trying to stop a plane on a never ending runway. All they had to do was destroy the engines with the cable guns and the plane couldn't take off. There were more problems with the logic of this movie, but I'm done thinking about it. Pretty much there were times i enjoyed it, but some of the lack of logic pulled me out of the movie."

","A slight improvement over Fast Five in that there is a lot less dialogue in this movie, which has never been the series' strong point. Unfortunately, the plot is so uninteresting and undeveloped that any screenwriter could have just written: ""We need some explosions, some car collisions, a threat to the main characters and just for fun let's have a character with amnesia. From what I remember, the screenwriter and the director have been the same, the last three movies. Maybe they were getting bored of the whole thing.<br/><br/>Paul Walker's part is totally superfluous and Vin Diesel's is just here to look sad and concerned. Dwayne Johnson gets most of the inane dialogue and Tyrese acts like an idiot most of the running time.<br/><br/>So, what we have is millions of dollars wasted on what could have been just as well an animated feature.

"intp","5","1","4","5 July 2015"," Fun for a while, but the ending killed it for me
","I thought this was a reasonably fun movie for the most part, despite the fact that the events in it were utterly ludicrous. The stunts were, for the most part, fairly enjoyable to watch, ridiculous as they were, and the acting and the characters weren't bad at all. I liked the fact that the 'good' guys, while crooks, at least had a code and acted like a family.<br/><br/>But what ruined it utterly for me was the totally gratuitous ending. After every other member of the 'good' side survives repeated and, quite frankly, impossible brushes with death, they just gratuitously kill off Gal Gadot's character??? Just utterly stupid. It probably wouldn't have bothered me so much if at least some of the other 'good' characters had died as well, but no-- just the hot foreign chick, who I guess was 'expendable' from the point of view of the filmmakers.<br/><br/>The sole reason I rented this (I had not seen the previous five installments) was to see Gal Gadot, who I had not previously seen in a film, because I was curious to see if she could pull off her upcoming Wonder Woman role. Here, she quickly sold me on her beauty, charm, wit, and physical talent, and I think she'll do fine as Wonder Woman. But why did they kill her character off??? In such a totally pointless way? Then, seconds later, Vin Diesel casually walks away from a flaming wreck of a plane-- uh, yeah, that makes sense.<br/><br/>I downgraded my ranking from what probably would have been a 5 or a 6 (for the fun factor, despite being ridiculously unrealistic) because of that lousy ending.<br/><br/>Edit: I have since read via internet that Gal Gadot's character kind of 'had' to be killed off to make this story consistent with a previous movie, ""Tokyo Drift"" (which is set after the events of this movie) where her boyfriend (Han, played by Sung Kang) had already died. As a result, I upgraded my rating from 3 to 5."

Her acting was below par and the few words she did say could have easily been said by anyone with a brain cell, Seccondly at first I found it hard to pick up the storyline. Usually in these films I able to catch on very well to the storyline but this was not the case. As the story progressed it was more understandable. One thing that really got on my nerves was near the end when that woman died(I cannot remember her name) I feel that the other characters didn't pay as much attention to her death where as if it would have been O'Connor or Toretto (not sure if I spell-ed those rights) it would have been such a massive deal.

I really can't appreciate un-realistic action films these days. In the past movies at least it 'could have' happened, now we just see things that couldn't happen in any universe. Weakness of mind; and relying too much on digital effects. Even though this movie was okay overall. You can't expect too much from the F&F people, but I've seen the others (except Tokyo Drift) and they are an OK waste of time. But the cop car race scene; to take that long in racing a 1/4 mile would mean they were going 15MPH. Duh. (if that's from Fast Five, Sry). But the ending with the airplane is so stupid. Someone did the math and even if you include all the break-away and same-time scenes, the runway would have to have been about 19 Miles long. Duh. The longest runway in the world is only about 3.5miles in China). And any pilot will tell you a large plane like that cannot do a land/takeoff anyway... Need I say more?

","As movies go I am NOT a ""Fast and Furious"" type of viewer. The stories are thin, the car and motorcycle chases, the explosions, the fights are the things that they showcase. Especially the car chase scenes. And of course, Paul Walker died in a sports car accident on city streets. <br/><br/>I was a Paul Walker fan. My first encounter was his role in ""Pleasantville"" where he was perfect for the role. He has received much unfair criticism as just a pretty face that couldn't act. But if you see all his roles and observe fairly, he was also a fine actor. And by what I am able to learn, a very nice human being.<br/><br/>This 6th edition of the ""F&F"" franchise has a host of stars. Vin Diesel is Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker is Brian O'Conner, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is the lawman, Hobbs. And Michelle Rodriguez is Letty, who had been one of them, but seems to have turned to the bad guys.<br/><br/>The thread of a story is preventing the bad guys from stealing and using a potentially devastating new piece of software, and also getting Letty back.<br/><br/>Another of my favorites is MMA star Gina Carano, I hope she continues to get good roles. <br/><br/>The picture and sound on BluRay are first-rate, and the climax which involves a very large Russian transport plane trying to take off with cars dangling from it is very impressive.

","The movie is silly! The action is ridiculous! But you'll either love it or hate it. And if by now you're not sure which side you're on ... It's especially funny for me, because I'm not even into cars! But the movie and the characters we learned to love (yes even Paul Walkers ex-cop turned many other things) are there. And judging by the general vote here on IMDb, this might easily be one of the highest rated sequels and surely the highest rated entry number 6! <br/><br/>There are a few things that even the fun part of the movie can't disguise. One of them being the relationship between Diesels character and the woman he's with. It's too convenient, not that anyone would start asking about things like that. There is also a love scene in the trailer of the movie that did not make it into the final theatrical version of the movie. It seemed too sexy anyways for a PG-13 movie.<br/><br/>There is also a time-line thing that you have to be aware of. It's a bit complicated I guess, so while you don't have to have watched the other movies, some of them will make more sense (I think), after watching this. Especially the last one Michelle Rodriguez did (not Fast 5!). Although don't try to understand what happened there and how it's possible or anyone would think that ... well again, try not to over-think it! It's supposed to be fun! As are the action scenes! Realistic? Hell no!"

","A Superman II opening recap for the four people who had never seen any of the previous films, yet actually bought a ticket to a sixth installment of a series, only proves how incredibly silly these films are. And truth be told, I finally gave up ""critiquing"" the franchise and had fun with the nonsense known as Fast Five. I had fun, here as well.<br/><br/>Furious 6 – with all the name changes, I can't wait to see what they'll call part VII, is just as silly and over-the-top as the other entries, but at least they don't pretend to be anything but a big-budgeted Grindhouse movie. That trend began with #5 and that's probably why I enjoyed both of those and rank them the best of the series.<br/><br/>Really, the paper-thin plot is incidental to the number chase and fight scenes. But, just for fun, the faux pas Ocean's Eleven crew is reassembled in order to take down an even worse bad guy and in return, they get pardons in order to return home to the US.<br/><br/>Seriously, that's all you need to know about the script. And chances are, anyone who bought a ticket to this had no intention of finding any depth here. Just fast cars, beautiful women and muscular men doing macho thingsyou know, the norm. And you'll get all that in spades, even though it slows down for a tremendous amount of the film.<br/><br/>When the heat is on, it's great, no-brainer, entertainment, despite the incredibly ridiculous stunts at times (Vin Diesel's mid air rescue was about as real as Jason Statham's over-the-bay car bomb heroics in Transporter 2.) There were a lot of ""Wow. Really?"" moments I had, but more stuff I had fun watching, such as when they introduced some huge dude towards the end, I knew instantly he was going to be The Rock's match. When that came to pass, albeit a far-too-quick scene, it was enjoyable.<br/><br/>It's best just to sit back and enjoy. I mean, when I was a kid, the man in the rubber Godzilla suit looked just as realistic as these guys."

","""You don't turn your back on family, even when they do."" Are the words spoken by Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and becomes the motto of Fast 6. Justin Lin creates another adrenaline-filled, action packed movie once again. We see all sorts of familiar faces, but we're also introduced to a few new characters as well. Characters including the new mastermind, Owen Shaw (Evens). Shaw leads his team of thieves as they try to get their hands on a Nightshade device that is capable of blocking out communication signals for up to 24 hours. This device is worth billions of dollars to the right buyer and Shaw knows it. Feeling threatened by the capabilities of this device, Hobbs goes to Toretto and his gang for help on keeping it out of Shaw's hands. They agree to work for Hobbs under 1 condition: Amnesty, so they can return back to their home in the U.S. The film is full of action packed stunts that aren't the most believable, but they will keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. Fast 6 was a very entertaining movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It has fast cars that will amaze the children, nice looking women that will keep the men satisfied, and even a little romance for the ladies. It also has some humor and expresses the importance of family and what a family can overcome for one another in a fun, action packed way."
"de-vaughn-elledge","6","1","4","29 May 2013"," Disappointed by this installment of the series
","I haven't been this disappointed with the Fast and Furious series in a long time. <br/><br/>The movie was slow and it seemed the action was to over the top with no plot or driver to make it interesting.<br/><br/>The end of the movie *spoiler alert* was the most disappoint in my opinion.<br/><br/>I couldn't by into the almost footnote less death of one of the main supporting characters. They didn't search for her in the aftermath, nothing she is just.. dead.<br/><br/>I couldn't understand how any plane could.<br/><br/>1) Fly into a foreign country. 2) Attempt a touch and go at a NATO base which is basically another countries military airport in another country. 3) How long was that run way?? 20 Miles? Even the runway the shuttle lands on at NASA was shorter that this mythical runway. 4) Mia's capture and the return of Torreto's GF both of these events could have been done better.<br/><br/>Now I can understand the need to play out the Han character and tie in his death with the other movie FF2. I also like the cliffhanger they left for FF7, you know there is going to be one. <br/><br/>I just believe that there was a lot there that should have been organized better. I liked the action in the movie. Yet, at the end of the movie most of it was unbelievable. <br/><br/>Its just for me, the amount of unbelievable action and the lack of plot substance took away from the film. I hope FF7 will be better."
"jcmbruce","4","1","4","25 May 2013"," Disappointing
","I get movies are about entertaining the audience, I do, but I also hope to be entertained with talented casts and a good plot. The movie had some great ideas, but jus failed at portraying any realism. Many times throughout the film, the scenes were loosely connected and highly unrealistic with the main characters performing death defying acts alike an xmen or avengers...not car tuners. After a few of those, the film lost my attention. I just kept muttering, 'of course'. Also, some car scenes were forced in mindlessly having very little to do with what was happening. The movie twists and curveballs could've been better if they didn't flat out lie to the viewers. At the end, after learning the truth, a lot of scenes didn't make sense...not even a little. Then, there's the ending. Um, yeah, that could happen. I still gave the movie a 4 for the action and muscle car sound clips. This franchise always does those things well:)"
"yaldish","6","1","4","24 May 2013"," It is what it is - 5,9/10
","Fast & Furious 6, what can I say? I mean, my expectations were really low and boy were they met. I'm not saying the type of low like ""This is going to be bad"", more like ""Hmm, I might give this a shot"". The director Justin Lin doesn't try to do anything else other than sticking to the trashy film that it is, and I would give him and the movie credit for that. But more? Nope, I think people are giving it too much credit for that. Sure, there were some ""good"" trashy action set-pieces in there, some muscle(cars), a tank, big guns, and... Nothing more. Maybe Vin Diesel flying across a very big gap between two bridges to save Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and landing on a car breaking the laws of physics - why? Because ""She is family, and family stick together, you don't turn your back on them even if they do"", or something. One thing maybe worth mentioning are the physical performances by everyone in the movie, especially the ladies.<br/><br/>Everything ""good"" that was in the movie was already in the trailer, so what I ended up doing was just waiting for the scenes to pass by. There was a sequence in it where they had to drive after an airplane, and then they actually brought it down with some hooks and whatnot. That sequence goes on for about 15 minutes, which means that the runway must've been very, very long. And of course after that sequence they get to the end of the runway. A lot of innocent people also died in the scene with the tank (where it just runs over random cars with unimportant people in them).<br/><br/>A lot of people did laugh, and they laughed a lot. The only thing that made me chuckle was probably The Rock himself just him being there. The only time I actually laughed was when the title ""Furious 6"" (If you have seen the movie you'll know which one I mean) came up because some guy in the back shouted ""6 Furious"". And I am not joking when I tell you that it was the only time during the movie that I actually laughed.<br/><br/>This movie left me very uninterested and bored because of the plot, story, badly written characters and the dumb dialogues. I couldn't enjoy the big action set-pieces because I was so bored. So in general, this is a boring movie in every kind of way. And the fact that people in the audience gave a it big round of applause after the movie ended just made me wanna stick my head in the sand."
"3xHCCH","8","1","4","24 May 2013"," My First F&F Film and I Liked It!
","I have not seen a single installment of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, one of only a few, I am sure. I never got around to watching the first one at all, consequently I never did get to watch the second, nor any of the five. There was very big buzz about the last one ""Fast Five,"" but unfortunately I was not able to catch it. Now, this time, since Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez made the effort to come over to our country and grace this film's Premiere here last week (the first Hollywood premiere in Manila). I made it a point to watch ""F&F 6"", and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>Now I see what the fuss was all about, and why this franchise has lasted this long and still goes strong. The car chase scenes, on which this franchise's fame lay, were amazingly planned, executed, shot and edited. There was that chase scene on the freeway with a tank, ending with a superhuman midair rescue you simply have got to see. As if that is not enough, the entire last sequence was about cars trying to get a Russian cargo plane from taking off, all the while fighting off the enemies mostly mano a mano. I commend director Justin Lin for these ace pieces of action direction.<br/><br/>In between these big action sequences, there are the scenes of the team led by Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) talk about about being a family and never leaving anybody out. Among the members of the gang, Tyrese Gibson stood out as the loquacious Roman, the film's main source of comic relief. His funny one-liners also came fast and furiously hilarious. <br/><br/>Matching big and beefy Vin Diesel is big and beefy Dwayne Johnson. The Rock plays a cop, Agent Hobbs, who sought help from Dom's and his team in apprehending another team of mercenary drivers doing terrorist errands led by Owen Shaw (played by Luke Evans). In return for their help, they asked Hobbs to work for their amnesty so they can all go back to the States, instead of hiding in countries without extradition as they are now. The unexpected return of Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was apparently thought to have been killed in a previous episode but now was working with the enemy, provides dramatic focus for the characters, particularly Dom. <br/><br/>Overall this is one very entertaining and exhilarating film, which I understood and appreciated well even if I have not seen any of the previous films. Well, I am sure fans who have seen all the movies will love it even more than I did since they have known and loved all these characters already. The top-notch action sequences left nothing to be desired, really breath-taking. These heart-stopping stunts are all admittedly downright ridiculous and impossible, but that was why they were all so awesome to watch."
"aldri-feb","6","1","4","23 May 2013"," Just for entertainment, nothing more
","There is nothing I could say about ""Fast and Furious 6"" besides a fun movie with dumb storyline. I must admit that the action scenes in this movie is bigger and cooler than other previous series but in storyline, ""Fast Five"" is much better. ""Furious Six"" undeniably has more action sequences, car crashing and bigger explosions which is fun to see in the summer season. It's what all ""Fast and Furious"" fans expected to be. Besides that massive action stuff, there's nothing left you could expect from this movie. The quality of storyline is so bad and dumb that makes this movie goes nowhere and no different from their previous franchise. The more you think, the more you feel silly about this movie. For example, the scenes when Brian pretending goes to jail for searching information about Letty that even their team and Toretto himself had already known about it before Brian told them, so what does he go to jail for? <br/><br/>The cast in ""Furious Six"" are also flat and standard. As Indonesian people, I'm really proud of Joe Taslim for his first Hollywood movie debut. I know that he doesn't speak much but it's just enjoyable to see him fighting and taking quite important role. Overall, ""Furious Six"" is kind of good movie to see this summer and one of the great one from the series. But if you're searching for a good quality movie with strong storyline, it's not that kind of movie."

","pretty good movie that would force you to sit straight and upright through the whole nine yards when it played on. yes, rarely a title possessed franchise could be this good, there were TV episode-like movies like 007 or mission impossible, but some of them just felt weak, either affected by weak screenplays, bad directors or newly replaced main characters, but fast and furious seems to not only be able to maintain the quality of each one, it is actually getting better and better. the last Brazilian heist was a rarely accomplishment with bolder and crazier scenario but turned out to be very thrilling. if you think dragging and pulling a huge bank vault around citywide in a firefight is crazy, watch this new one, tank, cargo plan, fast cars....you might need to take some tranquilizers to calm down your nerves and resettle your blood pressure after you back home from the theater. <br/><br/>and again, you'll see some highly unlikely scenes in this movie like any other fast and furious movies: after digged a Russian made high power military standard bullet out of his right front should-chest area, the guy never needed to recuperated and didn't need any blood infusion, just wrapped up and beating his opponents like nothing happened. an at least over several tons super tank could drive as fast as all the fast cars and crashed them like eggs. the high speed of the tank on the freeway was some scene that i simply could not believe at all. then the firefight on the runway inside a cargo plane. well, since it carried out so over-the-top crazy, i have nothing to say no more. this is indeed a crazy movie but nobody won't dislike it."
"emeraldorc","7","2","14","9 June 2013"," It did not let the franchise down, Fun, action, speed...
","First of all, to all the critics. The director never claimed he was making an intelligent, thought provoking movie, he promised an action packed movie made with cars. If you want a thought provoking, artistic film, go see Stoker or Gatsby. Now to my review. <br/><br/>The film still centres around the main characters from the last film with a welcome addition of Luke Evans (Jason Shaw) and the return of Michelle Rodriguez (Lettie)and surprisingly Gina Carano (Riley). <br/><br/>The bad thing about the film was its blatant attempt to insult the intelligence of viewers with its obvious disregard for reality, I mean how long was that runway? What kind of FBI powers allow you to stab two people in solitary and get out of the US and back to Spain without attracting attention? These holes are evident all over the plot. This was not the case with the other films in the franchise. The film was loaded with every stereotype available from the silly English westend salesman to the ""all Black people love bling"" story. This was a poor attempt at humor, my guess is, this was targeted at the growing British underclass as the film setting was London. I am sure US viewers would find it simply old fashioned and distasteful. <br/><br/>The good things pretty much allow you to ignore the bad. The performances from Luke Evans (Zeus in the Immortals) was amazing and convincing, a real baddie, something the franchise hasn't really had. The action scenes were truly explosive, great car chases and quality fight scenes, Justin Lin clearly paid more attention to these than to any other aspect of the film. There was definitely less skin on show so it was a welcome change for the older crowd who are not raging with hormones. <br/><br/>If you want to see an action flick that keeps you on the edge of your seat with an almost predictable ending, then you won't be disappointed. The franchise is set already for the sequel in 2014 with Jason Statham, my guess, it will go down hill from there, this is the point when decreasing returns to scale kicks in. All in all a great watch and for £9.50, it will be dollars well spent."

Would have been nice to have the entire film made here and based in Scotland or at least part of it as long as Glasgow and Scotland was recognised. Pity Americans would not help Scotland be recognised and give us some respect. Though it was nice to see my cities streets it was also a shame that Glasgow was never mentioned and a lot of people around the world would not have even known that it was Scotland. America gives Ireland respect and constantly uses Irish references in TV and movies but rarely does Scotland get a mention even though many of our people immigrated to USA and helped build the country. Give us some respect USA we will never get it from the English who just use us for what they need but surely you can give us some respect. Think Scotland and think Scottish."
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","5","20 January 2016"," Brash, noisy, silly...and quite entertaining
","FAST & FURIOUS 6 is a step up from its predecessor, FAST FIVE, which had the genius idea of adding Dwayne Johnson to the cast, but otherwise was a bit too soulless and flashy for its own good. Despite the lengthy running time, this one knuckles down straight away with a thriller-focused storyline in which Toretto and his team and allies travel to London to take down a master criminal by the name of Shaw. The hook is that the once-thought-dead Michelle Rodriguez is now working for Shaw's team.<br/><br/>Inevitably, the plotting of FAST & FURIOUS 6 doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and instead it's all about the action. If you like seeing fast cars tearing up the streets of the British capital, then this is the film for you. You can easily play a drinking game and down a shot every time a London double decker bus appears in a shot; you'll be passed out by the time the credits roll.<br/><br/>This film is brash, noisy, and quite exciting. It still suffers from being exceptionally cheesy during some of the really big action scenes, like the bits with the tank and the plane, but overall it holds together pretty well and offers basic entertainment value, which is what this series is all about anyway. The established stars of the franchise like Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are rather muted and subdued here, content to let newcomers like Luke Evans, Gina Carano, and a returning Johnson garner all of the attention, and I was pleased to see more minor roles for cult favourites like Clare Paget (BLACK SAILS) and Joe Taslim (THE RAID). FAST & FURIOUS 6 isn't a perfect film by any means, but it achieves what it aims to do and with one hell of a teaser during the end credits I can't wait to see the next one."
"StevePulaski","8","1","5","17 December 2015"," A franchise that has over-corrected enough to finally get back on track
","Fast & Furious 6 picks up on our trusted gang of gearhead criminals following the heist they pulled off in Rio de Janeiro that took place in Fast Five. Now, all of Dom Toretto's (Vin Diesel) crew are fugitives, including the retired FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster), Dom's sister with whom he now has a child. The family are now living in Rio de Janeiro off of the $100 million sum of cash they stole and are trying to maintain normalcy into adulthood. One day, the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), who previously tried to stop Dom and his gang's efforts to pull off the heist, has discovered potentially revolutionary information on Dom's allegedly deceased girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who was seen alive and taken by a vicious British Special Forces officer named Owen Shaw (Luke Evans).<br/><br/>The bottom line is Shaw needs to be taken down and Hobbs knows that Dom, Brian, and Mia, despite being a family, have the skill-set and power to take down Shaw. Hobbs agrees to allow them entry into the United States once again on a citizen status rather than fugitive one, to which they accept. Reassembling their team of Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Han (Sang Kung), and Tej (Ludicrous), the gang looks to take down yet another criminal mastermind no international organization in the world can touch and only a group of skilled racers can infiltrate.<br/><br/>Fast Five was a film that bothered me in numerous respects, but mostly because it seemed that it did nothing more than sell out the core principles of what its franchise was founded upon in order to pull in a greater audience. The sad part was, through all the physics-defying flashiness and stunt chases, even the core fanbase of the series fell for its tricks, and the film went on to be declared the best in the franchise by many critics and audiences. Having said all that, going into Fast & Furious 6 knowing that this new gritty, crime-drama style the series has been implementing since Fast & Furious, the fourth installment, was still going to be in effect, I was about as hesitant as ever.<br/><br/>I emerge from the film with the confidence in saying that Fast & Furious 6 is the best film in the series since 2 Fast 2 Furious, a film that for all its issues, is still a fine piece of action-comedy during a year where that genre thrived (the underrated Hollywood Homicide, for one, also came out that same year). This is a film that has it both ways: it's a slick and stylish film predicated upon car racing and vehicular muscle and a strong crime-drama that keeps its characters in perspective through all its gritty style.<br/><br/>Fast & Furious 6 touches more on pathos than the previous installments; it cuts through the blatant homoerotic relation the male characters have with other male characters and the fetishization of their vehicles to reveal a deep humanity in regards to relationships. Consider when Dom finds out the high possibility his girlfriend he believed to be deceased is now still alive and, despite being incredulously so, she doesn't remember him at all upon seeing him again. These scenes are revealing because, for once, behind all the glitz and glamour of this franchise, these characters, in addition to the audience, can step back and see the individuals behind the wheel as people (the humans crushed in the scene that takes place on a highway, involving a tank going the wrong way and demolishing every car in its path don't get the same luxury of being humanized, but an installment in this series has yet to be perfect). The emotions don't run saccharine-thick, but they are present, and unless you've let the macho physiques of Diesel and Johnson get the best of you throughout the course of this film and the last, you should at least be able to respect the film's intentions and see what it's doing.<br/><br/>Then there's the fact that this film, unlike the last three before it, is plain fun. The characters are more unified in this film, working together and asserting their own personalities rather than just ostensibly working off of one another in a contrived manner in Fast Five. The conversational banter between characters here is also, for the first time since 2 Fast 2 Furious, strong in a way that's witty and enjoyable, though not overdone like in the aforementioned film. Finally, the film's slickness and gritty story doesn't become a downbeat array of fistfights and shootouts like in Fast Five. Everything feels, even for a Hollywood action film, delicately handled and even modeled in a way that emphasized slowburn pacing with humans at the core.<br/><br/>Fast & Furious 6 still finds itself overwrought in terms of further distancing itself from the downhome realism in the first film to the point where its inclusion is about as minuscule as a spec of dust on one's rearview mirror. Having said that, when it comes to The Fast and the Furious franchise rebranding itself, this is a more assured and capable spectacle that doesn't feel like it's pandering or selling out, but truly embracing the souls many of us have followed for over twelve years now. Director Justin Lin and screenwriter Chris Morgan, who have handled the directing and writing jobs, respectively, for every installment in the franchise since Tokyo Drift, have finally come to the point where they're not only respecting those involved in the projects, but also the audience.<br/><br/>Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sang Kung, and Luke Evans. Directed by: Justin Lin."

","This is a grand and extravagant looking production. The exotic locations are good. The car vs car action is what you'd expect and doesn't disappoint. Things go even further with tanks and planes. The car race in London was a bit artificially sped up. Who knew tanks could drive so fast. The attempts at humor are weak and mostly unfunny. But who care if some things are unreal thats part of the charm.<br/><br/>Sadly the cast has aged. Paul is looking older = needs to stay out of the sun. Vin looks a little flabby. The Rock looked a bit too pumped up. Doesn't he know steroids are out now. The long drawn out obsession with Michelle Rodriguez's character is a bit tiresome. Jordanna is looking a bit gaunt. Luke Evans as the villain is a bit forgettable.<br/><br/>Can there be too much action in a movie like this? In a way yes. The punching and fighting has come to equal the vehicular action. Enough of the fighting and punching back and forth! I know they had to use Gina Carano's skills but it felt like overkill. You can see that in any other action movie.

The first when they are chasing the tank and Dom jumps from his moving car, over a huge drop, catches Lettie and lands on another car without a scratch - pretty stupid. The other is the final scene where the cars are some how keeping up with a huge military plane that is taking off and the run-way goes on for about 30 miles - ridiculous.<br/><br/>Apart from this its the same old stuff, not really a boring moment, action packed and entertaining. Shame its gone away from the cars and the racing which is why I loved the FF franchise in the first place. No decent cars in this one and there are no F1 cars in the film, as someone said there was in their review.<br/><br/>Think they will have finally milked all they can from the 7th and apparently last film."
"bryank-04844","7","1","13","23 August 2015"," 'Fast & Furious 6′ is a ridiculous action spectacle that will garner more chuckles and applause for fan favorites than it delivers genuine thrills.
","With more than $1.5 billion in previous sales, Universal rolls out a sixth entry to one of its biggest film franchises this week. Despite awful dialogue and numerous over- the-top, zany action sequences that are more comical than suspenseful, 'Fast & Furious 6′ will probably push that amount even further. That being said, the movie delivers what its audience has wanted since the first entry. That is, all of the original actors are back this time, even Michelle Rodriguez. I have no doubt this will score big at the box office. At least, Universal seems to think so. The studio has already greenlit Part 7, which will be released next July and promises even more stars and bigger action.<br/><br/>Director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan, who have immersed themselves in this fuel injected world for the last four films, have not let up with this one. It has to be difficult coming up with different and fresh situations for these characters to dive into movie after movie. Luckily for us, Lin and Morgan do a decent job here of not making us feel like we're watching the same thing over and over. This time around, instead of all the gun violence of previous entries, we receive a healthy dose of fight choreography, including MMA, wrestling and Thai martial arts. If it wasn't enough for the gang to race and chase exotic cars, Lin adds a giant military tank and large cargo aircraft to the mix. But with Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson all working together this time, there isn't anything they can't do, no matter how far- fetched the situation.<br/><br/>As we have come to know these characters over the past twelve years, they come from modest means with a big criminal history. However, they scored $100 million in the last film, which led them to live lavish lives around the world. That changes when Hobbs (Johnson) shows up at Dom's (Diesel) new place on some remote island and asks to make a deal to help capture a criminal. In return, he and all his friends will be pardoned. The movie starts out very quickly with the entire group coming back together for this job, including Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang) and Gisele (Gal Gadot).<br/><br/>The bad guy they're after is a British terrorist called Shaw (Luke Evans), who wants to acquire a weapon that can destroy an entire country and eventually the planet. The gang, along with Hobbs and his partner Riley (Gina Carano), have their first encounter with him during a chase through the streets of London. They all have nice BMWs this time around, while Shaw drives a custom-built Formula 1 race car that seems to be capable of doing everything the Batmobile can. A few chases later lead to a climax with a tank and a cargo plane that should appease the masses.<br/><br/>The action itself is not executed well. The chase sequences and bigger action scenes are choppy, too quick and poorly staged. Due to the poor angles and fast cuts, not once did I think that the cars were traveling faster than the speed limit. On the other hand, the martial arts fighting is far superior to any of the car chases. I could feel every hit and fall. It's brutal, but not bloody. I hope that Part 7 has more of this fight choreography, because it definitely works.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a subplot follows Letty's (Rodriguez) return to the series. Last time we saw her, she was thought dead, but that's not the case here. She survived and is part of Shaw's team. She also has no memory of her past life or friends. This gives Dom and his crew a reason to take this mission and take down Shaw, which ultimately sets up Letty for future sequels.<br/><br/>'Fast & Furious 6′ is a ridiculous action spectacle that will garner more chuckles and applause for fan favorites than it delivers genuine thrills. The acting is at time atrocious and the dialogue is just below that, but hey, this is a movie about cool cars and violence, which it delivers in truck loads during its 133-minute silly yet fun run-time. Don't forget to stay seated during the credits for a special peek at the seventh installment that shows a big action icon joining the franchise."

","The sixth chapter of the ""Fast and Furiou"" saga continues the concept of the last two chapters, so it's configured as a generic action movie without the concentration on street racers like in the firsts movie. This means that, as all the chapters after the third, risk to make the saga just an action saga like another million in the world. Infact, in this sixth episode, in which a kind of Avengers of racers have to defeat his nemesis made by analogue criminal group (and the trait d'union is Letty on the other side because of her amnesy), races are introduced just as a spectacular element, useless for the plot, as in the fifth. The scenes with supercars are simply fights against police, and could be done also with normal cars. Moreover, the dialogues are full of infodumps and unmotivated rhetoric (especially the family one, sometimes really annoying), the characters few analyzed. In conclusion, an action movie sometimes funny sometimes bad done, anonymous as a lot of other films of this genre. You can also not call it ""Fast and furious"", like you could for the previous movie."

","'Fast Five' was a franchise high, transforming a forgettable street-racing montage into an action extravaganza that disregards all laws of physics. This sequel doesn't add too much to Hollywood's popular soap-opera, but it didn't need to. ""Family"" and absurd set pieces is what you want, and Lin certainly delivers them. Just a shame the fluffiness in between marks for some dangerous pacing issues. More swerve-inducing than a learner driver thinking they could outrace Dominic Toretto! The infamous team of criminals are recruited by the beefcake that is Luke Hobbs, in an attempt to retrieve a world-threatening component back from another team of criminals. Oh, and Letty is alive working for the opposing team. So it just got personal!<br/><br/>This sixth instalment waves the usual traits found in this franchise right in your face. Babes in skimpy attire almost pleasuring themselves on top of muscle cars before a street race? Check. Vin Diesel grumbling his way through dialogue? Definitely. ""Family"" being the most commonly used word in the third screenplay? Probably. And enough delirious action set pieces that forces you to question every physic known to man? Absolutely. Pushing aside CGI Dom launching himself through the air to catch Letty across a bridge and landing safely on the bonnet of a car, it's just an enjoyable action film that knows exactly what it is. Audiences came for outrageous and memorable set pieces, Lin delivered them. Viewers wanted interactions between their favourite character, Lin granted them to us.<br/><br/>This is the pivotal instalment that solidified the direction of the franchise, so it made perfect sense not to change up the overall tone. That being said, some captivating substance in between the blistering action would've been appreciated. It's just heavy-handed storytelling, spelling out the plot with magnetic letters one may find on their fridge door, and some forced humorous moments for Gibson's character. Not nearly as tantalising as a tank decimating oncoming traffic or cinema's longest runway in existence (nearly fifteen minutes of full throttle acceleration). Consequently, this does produce several lulling moments, perhaps forcing you to look at your watch. The cast are all enjoying themselves and rarely push their talent, although Evans was probably the first memorable antagonist in the entire series, but they didn't need to in all honesty.<br/><br/>The high-octane gear changing speaks for itself. There's enough diesel in this sequel to produce a rip-roaring fun action blockbuster, if you can get passed the inconsistent pacing in its elongated runtime. Oh, and Rita Ora..."

","The high octane franchise has been a mixed bag over the years, it doesn't look to be stopping any time soon, even with this sixth entry, which got low ratings by critics, directed by Justin Lin (The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast & Furious 4 and 5, Star Trek Beyond). Basically in Brazil, following the successful Rio heist, Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his professional criminal crew have fled around the world. Dom is living with new love interest Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky), a former police officer; Dom's friend, former FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), is with Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), and their son Jack; Gisele Yashar (Wonder Woman's Gal Gadot) and Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang) are living together; and Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej Parker (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) are living in luxury. Meanwhile DSS (Diplomatic Security Service) agents Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and Riley Hicks (Gina Carano) are investigating a crew that have destroyed a Russian military convoy, led by former British SAS Major and special ops soldier Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Hobbs wants Dom and his crew to help capture Shaw, Dom is initially uninterested, but then he is shown a photograph of his former lover, supposedly long-dead Leticia ""Letty"" Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) (the twist end after the credits of F&F5), Dom and his crew accept the mission, on the condition that they are all pardoned for their crimes. In London, England, Shaw's hideout is staked out, but it turns out to be a trap, distracting the team and the police, while he carries out an Interpol building heist. The hideout is detonated, disabling most of the police, Shaw manages to escape a pursuit, in an indestructible car, and when Letty arrives to to help Shaw, she sees Dom momentarily, before shooting him without hesitation. Back at headquarters, Hobbs explains that Shaw is stealing components to create a deadly device, intending to sell it to the highest bidder, Shaw meanwhile investigates opposing group, discovering Letty's relationship with Dom, but she is suffering from amnesia and has no memory of the past. Dom's crew learn that Shaw is connected to drug lord Arturo Braga, who was imprisoned by Brian, returning to Los Angeles, as a prisoner, Brian questions Braga, who says Letty survived the explosion that seemingly killed her, Shaw took her after discovering her amnesia, Brian is then released with the help of the FBI. Dom manages to reunite with Letty, he challenges her to a street racing competition, and returns her cross necklace he had kept, after she leaves, Dom refuses Shaw's offer of a chance to walk away, threatening his family if he does not. Tej tracks Shaw's next attack to a Spanish NATO base, his crew plan to assault a highway military convoy carrying a computer chip that will complete his deadly device. Dom's crew interferes, while Shaw, accompanied by Letty, commandeers a tank, destroying cars en route, Brian and Roman manage to flip the tank, Letty is thrown out, Dom risks his own life to save her. Shaw and his crew are captured, but it is revealed Mia has been kidnapped, and that Hobbs' partner Riley is a covert accomplice to Shaw, Hobbs is forced to release them, but Letty chooses to stay with Dom. Shaw's team and kidnapped Mia have boarded a large moving aircraft on a runway, Dom's crew gives chase; Dom, Letty and Brian board the craft, Brian rescues Mia, while the plane is tether to the rest of the team's vehicles to stop take-off. Gisele sacrifices herself to save Han, Letty kills Riley and gets to safety, Dom pursues Shaw and the computer chip, Shaw is thrown from the plane and seriously injured as it crashes into the ground, and Dom drives a car out of the exploding craft. Dom gives the chip to Hobbs, this secures the pardons for all the team, they all return to Los Angeles and their lives, Hobbs and Elena become partners, and she accepts that Dom loves Letty. In the post-credits sequence, Han is involved in a car crash in Tokyo, Japan, the driver (Jason Statham) walks away from the scene after leaving Letty's cross necklace at the scene, then calls Dom to say ""You don't know me. You're about to."", before Han is killed when the car explodes. Also starring Clara Paget as Vegh, Kim Kold as Klaus, David Ajala as Ivory, Thure Lindhardt as Firuz and singer Rita Ora as Race Caller. Like most of the films in the series the storyline is not necessarily what you pay attention to, that is biggest problem with this one, it is not well executed, it is too much style over substance, the chases and explosions with cool cars are all fine, but there are preposterous things going on throughout (London with no traffic?), and the banter inbetween falls flat, it was a little boring, a fair but also disappointing action thriller. Okay!"

","Warning, this may contain Spoilers: This was the biggest and the best one of the franchise. The cast is amazing, each actor shines brightly in their roles. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Dwayne Johnson, Gina Carano. The action is fantastic. Aside from the action, the film has a nice sense of humour producing a few big laughs over the course of the movie. The film is fast paced and doesn't slow down. The film has an awesome set of fight scenes. The Gina Carano and Michelle Rodriguez fighting scenes is one of the film's best parts. They both show impressive skills. The main villain is good, well played by Luke Evans. The death of Paul Walker was very sad, I miss that guy. The director of Furious 6, Justin Lin. He really makes this his best action film ever. Watching this movie on the day it was released in cinemas in my country, it was one of the most awesome cinematic experiences of my life. It is a movie that knows what it is and remains that way from beginning to end. It is a movie that every one should watch. It is lots of fun."

","OK Listen ... For a minute there this franchise was getting dull. But i must admit that number 5 was really good but baby this one right here. This installment of number 6. Whomever new they enlisted to the writing and stunts or whatever, added some really great aspect to this installment. This one was really enjoyable because of the scale of the stunts and the action in addition to the return of the originals minus Vince. I have to put this in here ... My very best scene is when Giselle let go of Han to fall back so she could shoot. She sacrificed herself for the game and her man. That hits was the absolute coldest. I love that scene more than I love all the other fantastic scenes in this installment. I don't even know where to begin to tell you the truth there was so much action. Oh and I have to admit that Roman Pierce brings a factor to this franchise that was absolutely needed. The humor he brings is much needed and it elevates the whole concept because it/he makes it more relatable. The only thing that concerns me is the fact that Kurt Russell was brought into this installment only to be seen once. What was that all about. He looked to be a good fit, being that I'm old school and I thoroughly enjoy seeing him on screen. The same with D. Hansu ... I think he also would have been a great addition. And as we all watched Nathan definitely was a great asset to the installment. Though his roll was short lived as well. Wondering if the big names were included to ensure the public flocked to see the newer installment. Overall, I enjoyed this one number 6 and now I'm loading number 7 as my wheels are turning, madly trying to grasp or wrap around what could possibly be to come in the 8th & 9th installments. I don't know at this point but I surely will come around to see. Toodles ... I give it 8 stars, the most stars I've given any of the previous installments. I'll say just buckle up and enjoy this ride"

"CleveMan66","7","0","3","24 February 2015"," ""Fast & Furious 6"" is a crowd-pleaser which will leave the crowd anxious for more.
","""Fast and Furious 6"" is everything fans of the franchise have come to expect and should probably please most fans of action movies, regardless of whether they've ever driven fast or been furious before. I admit that I came late to this party. The older I get, the less interested I am in movies that seem to exist just to blow things up (which is why I can't stand the ""Transformers"" films), but the previous ""Fast and Furious"" movie looked so good, I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did. It was a lot of fun - and so is the most recent sequel.<br/><br/>In this latest entry in the series, the gang is talked into trying to bring down another gang out to steal a highly sensitive computer chip. They're also trying to rescue a character who supposedly died earlier in the series. As the stakes between the dueling gangs of drivers rise, so does the adrenalin. The action and the stunts are bigger and more spectacular than in the previous film, which is no small accomplishment. Of course, in this series, you have to keep pushing the ""I believe"" button, but if your button is still functional by the end of the film, you will have had a great time. You'll also be looking forward to the next installment. The last scene in this film feels like the first scene from the next one was slipped into the credits by accident - and the apparent villain in that scene is one most action movie fans will recognize and be anxious to see join this increasingly popular franchise. I give ""Fast and Furious 6"" a ""B+"" with the possibility of an even higher grade for the next one, based on the last scene of this one."

","By this point in any movie franchise, if a series of films all related and connected to each other reach beyond two sequels, there must be a loyal following behind it. That also means something is being done right to the franchise (for some). Now although Universal's The Fast and the Furious (2001) feature film debut and subsequent sequels all do not have glowingly positive and overwhelming reviews, the production managed to find its demographic. When The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) came out with writer Chris Morgan and director Justin Lin handling the project, who would've suspected that they would have collaborated for three more films in the franchise. Amazingly even with writer Chris Morgan back tracking by introducing a later sequel earlier, the franchise persuaded its loyal fans to stick to it and keep following the later entries.<br/><br/>After breaking free of the law and living in a secluded life from trouble, newly appointed father Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), wife Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) finally could enjoy the time they always wanted together. Or so they thought; Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) returns to Toretto showing him recent pictures of what Dominic thought was his dead girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguiez) who turns out is working for a group deadly mercenaries headed by a man named Shaw (Luke Evans). Upon this newly discovered information, Hobbs and Toretto agree that if Hobbs gets Shaw, Toretto will get Letty. So in order to capture Shaw, Toretto regroups once more with the crew he gathered from Fast Five (2011) in hopes reclaiming Letty and helping Hobbs out. For what started all the way back in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), Chris Morgan's screenplay finally,....finally realigns itself to the timeline it initially broke from. Out of all things, this was one of the most crucial things that needed to be fixed and by golly it's wonderful to see everything add up again.<br/><br/>But aside from this, Morgan shows that he had an appreciation and respect for the films he did not write for earlier because of how he treats the characters. Dominic Toretto's underlining factor to why he's so good is because of the family he has. In the early entries it was about racing, hot girls, slick cars and understanding one's place among all that. Later on, it turned into revenge and then fleeing the law. Now, it's just about family. It doesn't get anymore selfless than that and it feels more genuine than ever among all the previously established characters (including the recently new ones). Now everyone works together for a common cause. There's no second-guessing this anymore and that's just the writing alone. The fact that this is written into the script and the actors can pull it off without having to act as so much as being themselves is also a plus. The installments before this did have emotion and arguments related to family matters, but this film feels authentic in every sense of the word when it comes to feelings.<br/><br/>Every actor plays off each other like it was another day in the life of the job they do daily. There's no tension at any point between any of Toretto's crew because they know what makes each other tick and that makes it all the more preferable to see when it comes to interactions. Luke Evans also feels like the most formidable villain Toretto and O'Conner have ever come up against. Not only is he smart, agile and callous but also tends to be one step ahead of Toretto and Co., even Hobbs. For once, Toretto can't keep up and to see him challenged is definitely a new thing. The action that ignites between Toretto and Shaw's gang is much more interesting to watch this time too. Although it is still way over the top (if not more than before) and the physics behind such reactions remain unlikely, the sequences feel much more creative this time. This is probably due to that this particular plot is no longer a heist; it's more of a rescue.<br/><br/>However that still does not go over easy when people go flying into things or roll around in cars and handle walking it off only with a few scratches. Some of these particular events are simply impossible for the human body to withstand at once or all in one day. Sometimes it feels almost like a superhero movie because of how invulnerable some of these characters are portrayed. Again though, it's only for certain scenes. Stephen F. Windon again gives his audience the usual airy and spacious cinematography that almost every other entry in the franchise has received. Lots of road and aerial views for audiences to see how big of an issue these chase scenes get. The music is a puzzling choice however. Instead of Brian Tyler scoring the film, this time composer Lucas Vidal is doing the job. This is Vidal's only mainstream film score and to be honest it sounds a lot like Tyler's anonymous music. I guess Tyler was over scheduled for other films this time. Nothing sounds that much different though; it does sound good but not memorable in any way. It's just there like all the other scores to this franchise. All in all though it is still one of the better films.<br/><br/>Justin Lin's latest entry contains lots of the same generic music and over-the-top action that feels physically flawed, yet it entertains better with Luke Evans' imposing presence and a story that is more about unity than it is about who has the faster car. Also after watching this, the confusing timeline will finally come into place."

","Carrying on the story from Fast Five, Dwayne Johnson's scene stealing federal agent reunites the heist team to take out a team of mercenaries. Those who saw Fast Five will have sensible expectations: Not that much plot of depth, loads of ridiculous set pieces, endless explosions and a total disregard of the laws of physics. However, if you thought F&F5 was silly, wait until you see this. Dwayne Johnson and other characters jump from a speeding car onto another without a scratch. A dangerous car race is held in London which would never be able to go ahead. Some preposterous set piece involving a tank. For 15 minutes, a massive set piece on a plane takes place while the plane and several cars hurtle down a runway. For 15 minutes. Empire did the calculations: The runway is 27 miles long. The longest runway in the world is 3.5 miles long. Just go with it. F&F6 has the subtlety of a truck ploughing through an explosives factory, but that's part of the fun. Stupidity has rarely been cooler.<br/><br/>However, this is a step down from number 5. It's once again too long, Vin Diesel is still a hugely dull lead and the script is weaker this time. There are plenty of humorous moments, but the script goes the motions and the humour is turned down this time. The plot can be convoluted some times as well. Those flaws do not spoil the experience and it's difficult not to be entertained as explosive set piece after explosive set piece lights up the screen. This is a very entertaining action film which also feels like it means well and genuinely just wants to be a great time. While in general it will be called a guilty pleasure, there is no shame in enjoying it. Justin Lin proves himself a good action director again, while the characters are still all likable and fun to watch. Dwayne Johnson is once again the highlight of the film and there are a couple of effective main character deaths towards the end. It's completely and utterly bonkers and in terms of action cinema this is definitely a good action film, and even though no runway is that long, the plane set piece is a blast.<br/><br/>7/10"

That scene must have been in excess of 15 minutes, and they were moving at a relatively fast pace nearly the entire scene. What?!?<br/><br/>This movie, as breathtaking and stunning as some of the chase scenes were, did not pass even my liberal plausibility test.

It's great to see such great work from a group of people counting to provide such great work. It's so sad to hear that Walker is gone and to see the reaction of all the other actors shows that this Franchise Is more than just about collecting money and making movie after movie.

","We all know up to now Fast & Furious has been one of the most successful movie franchises. I remember the time when I watched the first part of Fast & Furious. I really fell in love with this movie! I loved every single detail about it: story line, actors (that was when I knew about Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and got addicted to them), cars, but mostly car races. Then there was the second part of Fast & Furious that was not less interesting and exciting. I thought there wouldn't be any continuation, but deep inside hoped for that. And then, some years later, Universal Pictures announced the release of Fast & Furious 3, then 4, and 5. I was anxious to see those parts and loved them. But, frankly speaking, already starting with Fast & Furious 4 I was getting bored. There were less and less new things in the movie and it looked like this franchise started to be exhausted. With the release of the 5th part, honestly, I hoped it would be the end. But, as you know, this year we saw Fast & Furious 6.<br/><br/>I admit, I expected too much from this part. I believed the director and producer would add some new things, new intrigues, but in reality everything was the same, just like in previous series. Here the story repeats again: in order to get freedom and clear his crew's criminal records Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has to cooperate with the agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to help him to take down a criminal organization led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and in which Dom's presumed-dead ex-girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is involved. Of course, there are fights with superman deeds (for example, when Dom saves Letty from falling out of the track), a bit of car races, shoot-outs, some humor scenes. Everything is just like in previous parts. But at the same time there are some attempts, unexpected though, to insert into the story line moral and human notions, such as love, feeling, freedom, betrayal, friendship. I can't say it worked. For me it looked a bit awkward. Imagine the scene where the fight is at its highest point and suddenly a jockstrap declares his love to the girl (the moment when Dom is talking to Letty when he finally meets her). And there are lots of such scenes. What I am trying to say is that for many people Fast & Furious is an action movie where people are not only used, but they require action, a lot of action. And now the director in order to prolong the existence of this franchise tries to turn it in some kind of soap opera by adding all this moral and emotional elements that don't match at all even with the characters. When you expect tough races and fights, but instead you get gentleness and tears – this is a bit confusing and disappointing and even boring.<br/><br/>Well, my general opinion is that Fast & Furious has exhausted. It doesn't have anything new to suggest to its audience. Now, this movie is not about the cars and action, but about the morality. So, if you want to see a film full of fights and intrigues, you'd better chose something different. And I don't think the 7th part will be different, don't have any expectations from it. But we will see"

","Fast and Furious 6.Well the movie carries one hell of a explosive punch. The Stunts are top notch. The Acting is petty good. If you are a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise you'll consider this one of the best in the series. If you are not a fan you won't be pleased . simple as that. I like this franchise. Right from the first one to this one. I consider them to be examples of high action and adventure done in a classic way. The story is simple. Supercop Hobbs is chasing a criminal named Shaw. Shaw uses a crew like Dom's to perform impossible robberies. Shaw is the master of the roads. Hobbs finds out that Shaw's Second in Command is Dom's lost love Letty long presumed dead. When Shaw and his crew steal a high tech Chip. Hobbes goes to Rio and recruits Dom and his team with a promise of a full pardon for them. So they can return Home. Dom pulls his team together and they get to work bring down Shaw. The theme of Fast and Furious that has been constant is family. And it is strongly put into play with this film. As Dom tells Brian. ""You don't turn your back on family. Even when they turn their back on you."" For Brian it's about getting a dangerous criminal off the streets and returning home. For Dom it's about putting his family together and resuming his life back in L.A. But it's also for Dom about the truth. nothing else matters. The film is sleek . And well done ,It's done with a style and flair you will enjoy. That is if you are a fan. If you're not a fan well check this film out anyways. It's also one hell of a crime noir film . You can forget the cars and you still have a well written well acted crime film. Vin Diesal gives a pretty sharp performance as Dom as always. Paul Walker provides the moral compass of the family. And Dwayne Johnson Provides the spark that gets them into action. Each actor in this film knows his or her job. The film ties in Fast and Furious :Tokyo drift. And it sets up the next one. The series as a whole fits into one whole story. A very impressive feat. Like I said if you're a fan of the franchise you'll enjoy it. If you're not Fan well give it a chance anyways. If you want to be surprised."

","The original F&F1 sparked the import scene in North America, with at the time seemingly accurate depictions of street cars and performance modifications. The movie was a car film in and out and as another user stated each movie has been getting progressively worse, this evident with the sixth instalment of the fast and the furious.<br/><br/>Fast and the furious movies need Performance import cars that the common man can relate too, anything else could be lacking and the film would be just as nostalgic as the first movie. It really is sad to see where it came from and where it is now, I will not be watching the seventh if that so happens and I advise everyone from doing the same. Unless you couldn't give two flux about cars then watch it for Vin diesels boobs and a bullshit storyline.<br/><br/>Bring back the nostalgia and RIP Paul Walker."
"RevRonster","8","0","3","3 December 2013"," They're not deep but they're fun movies...
","I'll just say it; I think these movies are just fun. I never really tire of them. Sure, some of the action is ridiculous—stupid even—and the characters are one-dimensional. Sure, some of the acting is hammy and cheesy and much of what happens not just laughs in the face of physics but actually punches physics in the gut before it runs away with its girlfriend only to leave her behind at the first gas station it comes across BUT, despite all these factors, these movies are massive guilty pleasures for me and ""Fast and Furious 6"" is just another fun addition.<br/><br/>I watch these movies because they are just action, octane and testosterone thrown into a blender and set to puree. The fast cars, the exciting action and the pointless, impossibly attractive women who seem to inhabit this clearly fictional world are all here and why this movie is not watched for narrative, character nuances or even plot or story. ""Furious 6"" appeals to the primitive desire to see things blow up and see cars go super fastand that's why I think these movies are fun.<br/><br/>My only complaint was the decision to bring Michelle Rodriguez back to the franchise (I think she's a terrible actress who can't play the one character she is constantly typecast into playing) and the decision to add Gina Carano to the cast (like Rodriguez, Carano can't act to save her life; the exception being she is a million times worse than Rodriguez); however, the presence of The Rock (let's face it, the dude just bleeds cool) and a decent antagonist in the form of Luke Evans, my complaints are non-existenceplus, more cars drive fast and things go boom, so ignoring Rodriguez and Carano is easy.<br/><br/>""Fast & Furious 6"" is just a wild, action-packed thrill ride that keeps reminding us why these movies make money.<br/><br/>Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies! So much so that I write a blog where I review whatever movie I am currently watching.

","First thing to know if you're new to the Fast and Furious movies is that there are some unrealistic action sequences. So if you have a problem with that don't waste your time. But if you can sit back and enjoy a good action movie without giving to much credit to those scenes then you're up for a kick ass time with Fast and Furious 6. The characters are very good and keeping ""The Rock"" on the movie is very positive. I think he makes a great duo with Vin Diesel. The story isn't very elaborate, and that's the way it should be in this type of movie, but it deliver's. Fast and Furious 6 is one of the best action movies around these days, so give it a shot. 7 out of 10 !"
"bob the moo","Null","0","4","14 September 2013"," Knows its audience and works well as a result
","There is something for films that know their place in life. Sometime blockbusters will try and dress themselves up as something more worthy or important than they are but with this sixth film there is no risk of that accusation being made about the Fast & Furious franchise, because this film certainly is no under no illusions about what it needs to do. As a result we get a very simple crowd pleasing film with plenty of big ridiculous action, very easy characters and plotting and plenty to look at. This isn't to say that it isn't nonsense or that it performs in any way other than the very limited parameters it sets for itself, but at least it is honest with itself and the viewers.<br/><br/>To speak of the strengths first, the action is not only well executed but it is also enjoyably silly in how OTT it is. At times it hurts itself by trying to make a serious moment out of a ridiculous one (such as Dominic's mid-air Matrix moment with Letty) but mostly it goes big and doesn't do anything to hide that it is just having fun and we should too. The plot really only exists to create some frame for the action and to be honest the film could have benefited from losing 20 minutes of plotting and making more room for more of what it does best. There are too many scenes of discussion between characters; in a normal film I may complain about action pushing these out, but here I think more should have been cut as really I cared for nobody and it added nothing. The plot is also full of nonsense; the 25 mile long runway is the one that people mention, but there is loads of stuff that makes no sense but mostly, like the runway, you go with it because it is dumb fun.<br/><br/>The cast are best when they remember this too – but too often the material pushes them to try and ""act"" and few of them can. Diesel continues to lack charisma but in a way it is nice he has found something to do. Likewise Walker, not a man with much range, he seems very at home in this franchise and he is pretty I guess. Johnson is a walking mountain who has a lot of charisma and presence even though his character makes no sense. Gibson is fun, Luda is so-so and Kang is fine but oddly tragic throughout. In terms of the female roles, although there was still some gratuitous shots of models, there seemed to be fewer and less of a sense of objectifying. Rodriguez is OK but I liked the presence of Carano – not much of an actress but good physical presence. Gadot is gorgeous while Brewster is wisely left out of it as the abundance of character baggage is obvious.<br/><br/>This is not a good film by any means – it is ridiculous in its action and really doesn't care about the plot at all, but if you feel the same way then there is much to enjoy. It could easily have lost 20 minutes of narrative and be been for it, but when the action is going on it is very easy to switch off the brain and enjoy it. Yes it is aiming its sights low and simple, but sometimes it is nice when a film is honest with you and then delivers all it promises."

","I'll be honest I had never previously seen a Fast and Furious film before - shameful I know. However, despite not knowing the characters etc. I personally thought that the film was awful in many ways. the fakeness of it was unreal and having lived in London all my life its amazing to see scenes where there are no other vehicles around and so on. However, even allowing for the truly ridiculous events, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. There was never a dull moment and it was pretty unpredictable.<br/><br/>Overall, although I thought that this was a pretty poor film I found it fairly entertaining and would recommend watching it and to be honest, even if you don't fancy it, just joking about the fake and stupid scenes and parts of the plot with my mates was enough for me to enjoy the film."

Why spend all their time customising and tuning the cars if they could easily steal a tiny little cop car :). This is the case in loads of pursuits in movies and it really annoys me. On the other hand, Furious 6 has a nice storyline, and the London surroundings give movie a nice Classy touch to it...

I love the cars, i love the car chases, races, crashes and all the actors in the series so far.<br/><br/>I was little bit disappointed when they bring back Han from dead in Fast & Furious (2009). But after watching this it makes perfect sense on how he died and make perfect sense about the order of the movie series.(despite the release dates)<br/><br/>i am not going to talk about other movies in the series, but let me first tell you generally why i think this series is so good. 1) this is pure action 2) this is about family values, love, Friendship, standing up for your loved once rather than backstabbing 3) this is about trust, broken promises, letting go, forgiving, payback 4) this is about living your dreams 5) or i forgot the best, man this is purely about cars.. cars cars cars.. there are lot of things i can think about this movie, but i let you decide.<br/><br/>Lets talk about Fast & Furious 6 the latest. although my favorite one is 2 fast furious i have to agree myself that this is the best movie in the series so far. it has great effects, awesome fight scenes, adrenaline packed car races, destructive car crashes, good sense of humor and a great twist and a great ending and also a great post credits scene which gives a perfect clearance to the confusions about Hans death and also signal you about the plot of the next franchise. what else do you need from a movie? also another thing i noted is they update there cars very well, they don't use old grandma type cars in the movie.<br/><br/>one last point, this is not the movie for twilight, harry potter, notebook fans, this is not for Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Robert Pattinson fans also.<br/><br/>If you loved Transporter,Expendables,Bad Boys,Danny Oceans,Rambo,Terminator,National treasure,Hancock,Lethal Weapon type movies.... yeah this is the movie for you, this is the series for you.

"chrichtonsworld","8","0","2","24 July 2013"," Damn it's furious!
","Sometimes you wonder why people watch movies in the first place. More and more I hear people bitch and moan and are critical for all the wrong reasons. Normally I encourage criticism but in this case I honestly feel the need to smack around to slap some sense back in to them. First of all The Fast and the Furious was never a film with cinematic values so high that it would challenge you or change your mindset. That it did rock some people's world was because of it's awesomeness. I know someone who got into auto tuning because of it. All his well earned money went into his car. Must have driven some parents or wives completely insane.That the Fast and The Furious had impact is a given. But let's get real. It wasn't really an intelligent movie. It was just fun and pure adrenalin. The fourth entry in the franchise for me was a sign that they needed to stop because it was nowhere near fast or furious. The fifth changed my mind and now this latest part rocked my world again. So how come a lot of people seem to be very critical all of a sudden? Exactly what were they expecting? Fast and Furious 6 is a non stop no nonsense high octane blockbuster action movie that delivers! This sixth entry is pure fan service. It has a little of everything from all the parts in the franchise. OK,there is less racing and more brutal and over the top stunts and action. How is that seen as a problem? Isn't that what we expect from a blockbuster? Hell yes! Complaining about plot and character development. Are you kidding? Sorry for getting worked up here. But see I enjoyed this film from beginning till end in such a way that I am actually looking forward to the seventh entry. I was so against any sequel made after the first two but have become a believer. Which is very rare I might add. Are there really no points I am critical about? Sure I have some points. But they aren't huge enough because this film is never pretentious. It knows it is being ridiculous and revels in it. There are many little nods back and forth to the other parts which makes it fun for the fans who have seen every part. It is also one of the few sequels where it is required to have seen previous parts otherwise you will just scratch your head and don't get the jokes (which I assume is a large group of the reviewers who complained about this one). Do yourself a favour don't act like a grandpa or grandma and let go of if a certain event is possible or not. It's a movie not reality. Fast and Furious 6 is a movie that is one of the best action movies in a long time so go watch it."
"chaos-rampant","Null","0","2","21 July 2013"," Exciting mechanics
","We don't watch these for the superb insights, do we? The storytelling is mechanical and simple, recycled from spare parts of other movies, here a dark caper that owes both to Bond and Nolan. The plan is to know enough at any given moment, and very crisply, to know where we are in the larger vista, except the parts moved by the villain which carry the surprises.<br/><br/>It's all so we can lunge ahead with what we came to see: motion mechanics.<br/><br/>This is my go-to franchise for expertly calibrated precision in the cinematic engine. I'm not even a gearhead, the whole world with its thuggish posing is far from my sensibility. I just like to watch. The container may be simple and dumb but the pure energy it creates in the eye excites me to no end, this is stuff I want to see. Expert work in the edits, impacts, gravity. Just so you know, the editing team is headed by a guy who has worked for Bay, John Woo in M:I 2, and Tony Scott. <br/><br/>To have these astounding stunts, it means we're going to have corresponding leaps in story logic. We do, some truly mind-numbing ones. Remember the opening of Goldeneye with Bond diving off the cliff after that plane? We have several more ridiculous stunts here—the pinnacle is perhaps the one where Diesel flies several feet in the air from a speeding car, catches in mid-air his loved one who is about to plunge to her death, and they roll together on the opposite side of the highway. (This connection between visual and logical leaps is metaphysical, but more on that in other comments)<br/><br/>It's ludicrous of course, but I can buy it because it is the pinnacle of a very clearly mapped urge to have her back. <br/><br/>And this is also why the stunts work so well; it's the same very clearly mapped linear narrative space, usually streets and cars snaking after each other, within that linear action space we have constant explosions in the eye—Tony Scott terrain, Unstoppable being the appex. French Connection is the template of this thing, with its big chase in three linear vistas, a film I like more because it carries the same 'real' gravity to the cop story, whereas this is M:I crazy. Which is why the finale with the plane fizzles into noise, it's just messy visual information, the sort that Bay deals in."

","I had a great evening watching Furious, I'm not really into street racing - but this film is more about the fighting and the bravado - and faux 'coolness'. The Rock seems to have somehow bulked up EVEN MORE for this role (it didn't look healthy - but I couldn't stop staring at his arms!) and his screen presence made Vin Diesel look like an ant, but Dwayne was fun to watch - if a little overly serious for such a silly film.<br/><br/>Anyway, the runway scene has been discussed at length already - how about the bit when a car on one carriageway attached to a tank on the other side by a wire manages to pass by several concrete pillars without knocking them over (the wire actually passed through the pillars???) is totally impossible physics but you forgive it cos it's an ACTION film.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge F&F fan because I have a modicum of common sense, so probably why I'm not upset that they didn't try to make another Tokyo Drift and tried something different in this film.<br/><br/>Gotta say by far my favourite bit was where for some unknown but brilliant reason the director had Vin and Rock have a conversation at the end where they stand at different distances from the camera and both appear to grow and shrink as the angle changes. You'll know when you watch it what bit I'm talking about - right after one of the 'crew' comments that Vin's two wives are ""sexy as hell"" (or was that ""sexy as a hill""?).<br/><br/>Honestly - we watched that bit a second time over and laughed up some beer. It's hilarious! More of that in F7, PLEASE...!<br/><br/>The ending is awful, considering all the squished Spanish people and mourning families of innocent military henchmen Vin and Dwayne et.al leave in their wake.<br/><br/>7/10 for the fun of watching high budget nonsense - and the perspective scene :-D"

I will not spoil it for others, go see it and decide for yourself. However, I still give the movie a good review because it met my expectations: Good Action Flick, It gives you more insight on the character Hans and I felt it tied up some of the past fast and furious films together. The other fast and furious films now make more sense as an extended story after watching this latest one. The ending of the movie definitely set the franchise up for more films and I hope they continue to do good on building the storyline. Now to the critics, It is very terrible that i have read some reviews and see some people say i would give the movie a 6 but to balance the reviews that are higher than they should be I'm going to give it a 1. That is the most retarded crap i ever heard and it is those people that are making the review system faulty. Rate the movie based on how you really feel about it. You are not helping anyone make an educated decision on taking a chance to go and see the film.

The plots of the 6th are awesome but also not perfect just like its brothers, however, this kind of movies aim at showing us the dazzled cars and driving skills. There is not a big flaw I can easily find during the whole projecting, maybe it is because I paid most of my attention to the sexy girls, the cars and the extremely cool driving.<br/><br/>At least, one thing I am sure is that this kind of film would not step into the academic awards, but it can be popular among the world, can attract plenty of fans following the series year by year. That's it, no need for anything else.<br/><br/>For the last point I mentioned at the beginning - friendship, it is the most valuable element in this kind of movie, it's not surprise that the film like this can also teach us something important. It can be a inspiration for those directors struggling in making junk every day. So, just ust think about it dude."

","Fast and Furious 6<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>130 mins/ 12<br/><br/>Cast: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Jordana Brewster, Luke Evans, Michelle Rodriguez, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Gal Gadot<br/><br/>Director: Justin Lin<br/><br/>Plot: After discovering Letty is still alive, Dom and Brian help Hobbs take down the criminal she is now working for.<br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: The Fast and Furious franchise has come a long way since the first instalment back in 2001. That film was all about cars and racing and its first three sequels followed suit. That all changed with Fast Five in 2011, which was more of a heist film and involved more action and less racing to attract a larger audience. This was welcomed back then, but with Fast and Furious 6, director Justin Lin has made the action bigger; but not necessarily better. Earlier this year, I said A Good Day to Die Hard had over the top action but this film is over the over the top. It is however, unlike that Die Hard, stylish and enjoyable. And although the actual concept of Vin Diesel jumping in the air and while still in the air, head-butting a man twice the size of him, is cool, you can't help thinking it is completely unnecessary and ridiculous. The action scenes themselves had such good editing and precision that it was hard to concentrate on them and it certainly hurt my eyes.<br/><br/>The plot itself is a bad one. The idea to resurrect Letty considering she had a funeral and burial in Fast and Furious 4 is totally absurd. It does however not distract too much from Luke Evans' villain Shaw. His character is certainly the most memorable of all previous Fast and Furious bad guys and the Welshman plays it sinister and cold , bringing a fresh air to the scene as the film's only new principal character. Paul Walker's acting has come a long way and along with Diesel, shows off great emotional acting skills which have previously (although attempted particularly by Walker) failed to impress. Tyrese Gibson gets some very funny lines in this one and his chemistry with Ludicrous is nothing short of both brilliant and hilarious. Dwayne Johnson is once again robbed of his hard man status as baby oil and 'Captain America' jokes are made at him constantly.<br/><br/>Not only is the action unrealistic here, but the setting itself. Set partly in London, the film depicts London as a street-racing city with races taking place straight through the centre of it. I can assure you that no street racing anywhere near this scale takes place in London and although I don't mind them smashing it to pieces, I wish they could put some realism into it. Another realism point is that if 200 people were watching 3 policemen being beaten up by a criminal, would one of them help them? Apparently not. <br/><br/>Fast and Furious 6, although terribly unrealistic, even for an action film, is lots of fun and certainly enjoyable. And to add to the excitement, it gives us a brilliant hint to what Fast and Furious 7 will be like on its release in just over a year."
"siderite","8","0","6","5 July 2013"," I wanted to hate the movie, but I've enjoyed it quite a bit
","There have been interesting Furious films, there have been really bad ones and there have been good ones. The sixth part of the franchise is immensely ambitious in terms of special effects and body count, it features all the actors in the previous films, cool machines, scary villain (British, of course) and, against my better judgement, was fun! So in terms of car chase films, it was one of the better ones.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean it was perfect. High speed chases through London, tanks killing tens of people by driving over cars, the damn American movie arithmetic that counts a victory the saving of a main character over a lesser one and the huge amount of physical violence that has to not show blood in order to be OK... all of these made me cringe at times. Also some one liners, but that was to be expected.<br/><br/>So it is a viewer choice if the movie is good or not. Mainly it is a gang fight between ""professional criminals"", only some are uselessly cruel while the others are ""family"". I am not going to even go into tribal irony here, but you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Bottom line: rated it above average for a movie of its kind. The music was not memorable in any way, as in other films. The chases were flamboyant, but not really focused on driver skill except a few of them. Simple, high budget movie, lacking substance, but fun."

","First Good Furious since the original or maybe Tokyo Drift. They got away with things in this movie that movies haven't gotten away with since the 80s.. Team switching, amnesia, super people that never get hurt... all topped off with the sort of things u want to see in any action movie; kick ass cars, bad ass martial arts, devious villain, awesome cheesy lines. The Old Gang are back and they are great.. Vin was spot on, but the coup de gras was The Rock. Johnson is great in everything but he was born for this role. I think the goal of this movie was fun. Felt like an Arnie movie without Arnie. Every time you think the movie is about to wrap up more captivating twists come at you like bullets. i hope this isn't the last and the furious. let Justin Lin make the next one."

","As of July 4 this movie with a budget of 160 million already grossed 233 million representing 73 million in profit and counting (as per IMDb) This is not an Oscar or Golden Globe candidate.

The more absurd the better.<br/><br/>Gibson was actually funny, they are selling this film globally so the humor has to be plain and simple, not intelligent or too steeped in Americana or British ness.<br/><br/>The goal is to keep ages 7-14 mostly boys entertained for the 2 hours or so. Have you hanged out with this demographic recently.<br/><br/>Quit whining about Johnson. He is not fat and works out unlike the rest of us. Ditto for the rest of the actors. I find them all humble actually.<br/><br/>The studios have to make money somewhere to support all the sappy Oscar candidate drama.<br/><br/>It is what it is. If you want ""so called high art"" go to a freaking film festival or a musical.<br/><br/>If Quentin directed this there would be more blood, more cuss words but probably won't have as fantastic car chases and would be R (I love Quentin BTW) If you want intelligence you need to appreciate the planning involved, to be on budget, to be safe and make a profit.

","Between exiting the cinema after watching the enthralling fifth entry of this fender-bending franchise and entering to watch the latest installment, most viewers would have asked an important question: has the series reached its zenith? Suffice to say, the answer to any such query is a resounding no!<br/><br/>Fast & Furious 6, unabashedly and unreservedly, is the best iteration of the series yet. Like its predecessor, the film follows soon after events that took place in Rio de Janeiro. The crew is all displaced in non- extradition safe havens. However, after hunting the team for the length of Fast Five, DSS Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) enlists their help. The crew must apprehend a skilled group of mercenaries, led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), in exchange for full pardons. Undertaking the mission would also allow Dom the chance to reunite with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who has resurfaced and is now aiding and abetting Shaw.<br/><br/>Helming his fourth consecutive entry of the series, director Justin Lin has gone from strength to strength. Lin has ameliorated as an orchestrator with the progression of each film since he joined the venture with Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Fast 6 is grander in both scope and scale compared to its precursor. Simply put, Lin has crafted a machine running at optimal efficiency.<br/><br/>Moreover, Lin has at his disposal an impressive ensemble, each given their moment to shine. Vin Diesel portrays Dom with ease, while Tyrese Gibson, who plays Roman Pearce, is also prominent, providing a welcome comedic element to proceedings. The banter and camaraderie shared by the characters in general is evident throughout. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, now a bona fide action star, impresses yet again with his charismatic screen presence. While Fast 6 is essentially another testosterone fueled caper, the females are also part of the action, whether it includes a physical confrontation or getting behind the wheel.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Lin employs creativity and variety in a number of breathtaking action sequences. The flamboyant exhibition of mayhem includes vehicles such as cars, tanks and even an aircraft. The hexad episode in the series also contains exquisite cinematography. Similar to his fascination with the landscape of Rio in part five, Lin captures the vibrancy of London. The movie also benefits from a cohesive screenplay, enabling Lin to delve straight into the action, since establishing characters in unwarranted. In addition, the editing of the film is also top notch.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Fast 6 also ties up loose ends in the franchise, such as a significant link with the anachronistic Tokyo Drift, which may have been perceived as a spin off until now. The significance of family is an underlying theme throughout the film and Lin manages to create an emotional bond with the characters as well. Fast Five may have raised the bar, setting high expectations for the future of the franchise, but Fast & Furious 6 is able to exceed those expectations emphatically. <br/><br/>The aforementioned cast and crew ensure there are no signs of franchise fatigue. While sequels predominantly experience a decline in quality, Fast 6 proves to be an exception, perhaps similar to the Harry Potter series in its progression. All in all, Fast & Furious 6 proves that the series is operating at full throttle in the fast lane, with plenty of gas still left in the tank."

","I am a huge fan of The Fast and The Furious Series. The movie was very good because 'Epic' bits to parts of the film where it seemed unrealistic.<br/><br/>I feel that Fast Five seemed a bit better because it seemed more realistic. In the ending moments there was a runway scene which went on for ages another was that Dom acted like Superman about 5/7th of the way through the film. <br/><br/>It was a very good film and no wonder it is the 2nd Highest Grossing Film of 2013. The story line of the film was very good as we knew towards the start that they had to take down as 'Bad Person'. Music by Lucas Vidal was very good, especially 'We Own It' and 'Bandoleros'. Justin Lin has been a very good Director for the main part of the Series except for Tokyo Drift which has been the worst in the series and will be sad that James Wan takes over to direct the 7th one, however we can only hope that he takes the series to even greater heights for the Big Finale. <br/><br/>Being the 14th Highest Grossing Movie Franchise of all time the Studio, Universal needed to make sure it met the criteria and I feel this film checked all the boxes..."

","Okay when the original ""fast and the furious"" came out i thought it was decent the acting was decent, but really, now i think that the only reason why we all go to see this series is for the women and car races. But now i feel that the series is losing its fire just like ""paranormal activity"" only Idiots and dumb people would go see that series and waste money. Anyways now the ""fast and the furious"" series is more like a adventure movie were either they get screwed over or they have to do a job for the government.<br/><br/>I think the reason why they decided to add Statham in the mix with D'wane Johnson was to try and revive a dead story line that they screwed up on by making ""Tokyo drift"", and decided to run a prequel off that though it does end by them going to Tokyo but if the studios decide to make more i think nobody will go and see it due to the lack of interest they might have in the story if it continues"
"williamhume","9","0","1","21 June 2013"," Furious Frenzy
","My mind almost exploded many times throughout this movie. Myself as well as most of the folks at Universal I'm sure are surprised this franchise has made it to the sixth installment. There is now a huge ensemble of characters from various films to keep track of as well as new ones being introduced, so it comes as a huge compliment to say I was never confused throughout 'Furious 6' (the opening title). I have not been this giddy while watching a movie in theatres since 'Transformers'. It's probably Tyrese.<br/><br/>Granted, these are two franchises who have hardly ever tried to court realism. This movie is so Ludicrous that the audience I was with was laughing at what was being portrayed on screen. 'To think this series used to centre around street racing', I thought as a cargo plane is coming down on a military base rife with explosions.<br/><br/>This move is accomplished several times throughout the movie. It is no less thrilling the fourth time.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel is passable, Paul Walker is the same as usual (kinda boring). The screen time is well divided among the entire cast with everyone getting their own moments. Tyrese has become the series comic relief which I don't mind. The fights, chases and races are superbly choreographed, top notch and the best part is the movie seems pretty self-aware. It irks me to find out that the next installment will be without its main director (Justin Lin, on board since the third).<br/><br/>There are a few faults with the movie of course as no movie is without them. The decisions made by some of the characters make almost no sense. The plausibility angle is stretched beyond breaking point, even for the series. It wasn't revealed what the McGuffin that was driving the plot was until the last 30 minutes. I imagine the writers getting so far ahead of themselves that they resorted to one upmanship handing over the script of the last scene trying to screw each other over.<br/><br/>This is just me nitpicking though, because in a way I found it all just so confounding what was happening on screen that I couldn't help but be engaged. A series that is able to get this far while standing on its shaky and genre shifting pillars deserves to be commended. See it in theatres!<br/><br/>Rating: +3<br/><br/>-3 -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3"

","Dispense With Credible Story, Quality ActingAdd More Cow Bell (i.e. cars in this case) Heck yeah, this is F&F6 and we don't need no stinkin' realism to muck-up the fine action. Do we? Apparently not as Vin Diesel and Paul Walker trade leads In a most curvaceous alpine-ish mountain road which is, perhaps, somewhere in Italy near the Alps in order to claim first at the cloistered whatever (a monastery?) where Paul's other half is giving birth to his son. Wow, mindless racing where any minute you could be killed if you went over a curve? But hell yes its worth it if GT-R was ahead of the Detroit combobulation called a Challenger. Definitely worth the risk your infant child will become fatherless, no doubt! I'm rambling, but this movie starts out absolutely inane in every way.<br/><br/>I love to be entertained with smart action such as fantastic car chases, but I abhor movie scripts that are so ""dumbed-down"" as to make such demands, uh, like erasing a lifetime of education in order to ""buy-in"" to all the BS. I also love comic-strip characters done right movie-wise, but supposedly (yeah, lol!) real-life ex-cons co-opted for an elite squad of a Seal Team 6 vehicular assault ""black-ops"" teamWell, you need some damn fine writing to pull this off. Sorry, but this is a real mess. The dialog seems as if a fifth-grader wrote , edited, and gave it the ""hell yeah"" I like it ""thumbs-up"". It is so poor as to be laughable. I didn't skip the premise, but actually waited until now to say it is among the most inane senseless movie concepts I've ever seen brought to screen with what appears to be a huge budget. P.T. Barnum's axiom of suckers must be like Moore's Lawit just goes on and on.<br/><br/>It's not something to be particularly proud of, but the actors/actresses approach this stuff like it has merit. I'll give them some credit for that. With the infantile silly crap they've been given to work with they give it 110%. It can't save this morass of embarrassmentsexcept for the over-the –top car chases. That is the raisin De ete for this whole thing and they've really tried to meld reality with digital ""we'll do anything we damn well please"" craftsmanship. This is where the franchise clearly goes from trying to have a foot in reality and stepping deeply into this is a comic-strip come to life movie which gives us total creative control. So, if you can last long enough through the interspersed crap of this mess and get to the several car chases sandwiched insidePlus, get into your no need for reality ""I'm watching an excellent comic-strip brought to life"" mode, then you can actually see some art and some value in FF6.<br/><br/>What I've asked of you is pretty big bill of goods. Your time is probably much more valuable and why should anyone ask you to dumb yourself downRight? Well, surprisingly I'm going to tell you for the car chase scenes you just might want to tryOtherwise, skip this dreck. I fear for several of these actors/actresses futuresI hope they got a slice of the pie cause we all know there's a huge number of folks who love this fifth-grader with unlimited wallet stuff out there. It'll be a big opening a big following 3 or 4 weeks, a big pay-per-view, and another life on DVD/Blu-Ray. It's still crap though."

Not only is no human being up to this task, but it is really easy to picture the screenwriter dissolving in gales of laughter after a night of heavy drinking as he, she, or it could not soberly type up such a crazy sequence of illogical, unmotivated, and physically impossible events. Though it's a known fact that every Hollywood or Hong Kong ""action"" movie will feature a few of these ""clunker"" scenes in which the movie goer (if they're not passed out drunk, which is hard to do in most theaters) will scratch their head and say to themselves or their party, ""Did THAT just happen?!,"" (and the F&F series is more guilty of such viewer abuse than most), NEVER BEFORE has such a load of c@#$% been piled up in one scene!"

Vin Diesel and The Rock are fun to watch, but you can only take so many physically impossible car stunts and physiologically impossible fights. I picture this film being used as a cure for ADHD the way the character in A Clockwork Orange was cured of violence. ""Oh, look, something shi- Nooo! Not the London street race scene again!"" Supervillain Owen Stark is collecting the components for a superweapon that can black out a whole country. Why the components are scattered instead of assembled is never made clear. The last item is a computer chip which, instead of being hidden in a desk drawer or just smashed with a hammer, is transported to a new location in a heavy carrier containing, for some reason, a tank. Stark and his baddies steal the tank and smash a lot of cars. They are captured but it can't be that easy, can it? No, it's not. They've had other henchmen take the wife of one of Vin Diesel's guys hostage. So now we have another car chase, plus a plane chase, plus boarding the plane through the loading ramp, plus three or four simultaneous fights, followed by a plane crash. Oh, look for a Jason Statham crossover next time."
"garyguitarking","9","0","1","12 June 2013"," Faster than Five
","This movie was by far the best installment of the series. Dwayne Johnson does an excellent job returning as Hobbs to rival the size of Vin Deisal in a battle of bravado. Seeing them as allies truly makes one feel invincible. The only issue with the movie is that the villain, Shaw, is slightly less believable than previous villains. The actors voice is perhaps, too mild to pass as pure evil and the evil plans really aren't going anywhere. Perhaps this was a build up character for the evil brother of Shaw who is to become the villain of Fast 7. Other than this minor flaw, the cars, the women, the actors, the action, the romance, unexpected deaths, and the drama add up to make Furious 6 a 9 star movie for me."

","Thoroughly enjoyed this film. Totally unbelievable at times, but it's a movie for entertainment purposes. Not a documentary.<br/><br/>I had never seen a F&F movie, so I got the DVDs (except for the Tokyo one; heard it was not so hot). I enjoyed 1, 2, 4 and 5 so I was expecting to enjoy 6. Did I ever. I love the fast cars, the sorta over-the-top machismo of the guys and the idea of family. Taking the movies from the racing scene to heists, etc. is an interesting maturing of the franchise. How many race motives can you come up with to stay interesting and relevant? Getting into the heist-action is a good turn, I think. The guys/girls are growing up and it's nice to see some change while keeping in the great fast car scenes. Dwayne Johnson is too much (in a good way) and he seems like more of a caricature of a man. He's just so dang big and ""hulking"" over anyone else. But that just adds to the fun of the movie.<br/><br/>The photography is so good - to my eye it's flawless (and I'm always on the lookout for those details about the scene that are missed between ""cut"" and ""action""). The character development is maturing, too, as we get to know these guys through the years. The funny lines are good and some are so small & quick, you might miss 'em.<br/><br/>Looking forward to 7 - I love it when you get involved in a movie franchise where you look forward to seeing your ""friends"" again. This is one of those for me."

","This will contain some spoilers.<br/><br/>I thought this was a good movie but not great. I definitely liked Fast Five MUCH better. I thought this movie was VERY HIGHLY predictable. I had Hobbs' new partner tagged as a traitor from the second she came on screen, that one was WAY too easy to see. Also, the second that Dom and Brian left Mia alone with the baby, it was obvious that Shaw was going after her to use as a hostage (that was easy to see as well). I thought it was also easy to see that one of the team was going to die, although I did have Han pegged as the obvious choice, I didn't see Han AND Gisele both dying. I liked the action and the stunts, even if they were sometimes ridiculous (it IS a Fast & Furious movie, the stunts are always going to be ridiculous).

It's worth seeing again and then buying the DVD for your own personal movie library when it comes out for purchase. Even with the enormously long unending runway which, for me, slightly diminished the realism of the story, I still enjoyed the movie greatly.

If you look for story then look elsewhere.<br/><br/>This movie is no longer related much to cars and engines like its predecessor but rather concentrated in action/ gun fight/ bombing. Through there are many cars chasing scenes it not really about the car anymore. (Don't they like assemble car anymore? all they do is went out to buy one) <br/><br/>While the movie was really fun to watch many things that went on in here are just pure ridiculous that it turn to be so funny. It reminds me of watching Indian movie that no matter how beaten up or shot at - the guy is all he seem to get little bleeding at the side of his mouth. He is untouchable!!! And in the end anything will be alright. Even the dead are now undead (remind me the like of American soap opera like The Bold and the Beautiful)<br/><br/>Another good thing about this movie is the set, it is freakishly huge!!! Involve the use of tank/plane/bike and so on. It is fun to watch that they don't seem to hold back the budget and bring about everything that they wish to get. <br/><br/>Anyway while they did managed to make a really fun movie to watch the story and how unrealistic everything is just pure ridiculous.

","After having watched the trailer to the new addition in this exciting, edge of the seat action, it immediately went on my list of 'Must watch' titles. 2013 had a lot of interesting films coming out, but after the post credit scene of Fast Five, which according to me was the perfect action film that would appeal to almost everyone, with its great cast, heart pumping car races and solid plot, I obviously had big expectations for this one...<br/><br/>But having said that, the first half of the film was a bit of a let down. I understand that they wanted to re-establish the characters, and try and emphasize on the concept of 'we don't turn our backs on family', but I'm not sure that's what audience usually expect in the Fast and Furious franchise. And the villain gang, despite it's potential, weren't established properly, and we didn't get much of a chance to create an opinion on them. <br/><br/>With the slight disappointment of the first half, there came the second, which made up for all the lack of cars and speed up until that point. And it was completely worth it. Here, I can say that the trailer didn't show all the best parts, and there was way more to 'They got a tank' and the super cool scene with the car bursting out from the plane. <br/><br/>As far as the cast goes, Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson were great playing their tough guy roles and they did fairly succeed in their attempt to match the Dom-Hobbs face off from the predecessor. Michelle Rodriguez reminded us what we felt was missing in the series after she was assumed dead. <br/><br/>All in all, it was good fun, and does prove to be entertaining despite it's flaws; as far as you don't compare it to its predecessor. And watch out, for this one has a surprise ending as well, and you will not be disappointed (This time placed before the entire end credits, so you shouldn't miss it, like you probably did in Fast Five...not unlike me)"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","8 June 2013"," More of the same
","Having dropped ""furious"" in the title, calling it ""Fast 5"" last time around, it's back to the original title ""Fast & furious 6"". As everybody knows, the franchise has evolved from car racing to heist action. Or those who have forgotten, number five started with Mai and Brian waylaying a prisoner truck to rescue her brother Dominic. The rest of the action took place in Rio, where they assembled the rest of the team – Letty, Roman, Han, Gisele and Tej - to pull off big job. Never mind what – that is of the least importance. What is important was the introduction of super cop Hobbs, feeding a climatic titanic struggle.<br/><br/>Staged in London, number six brings Dom and Hobb together against a new villain Shaw, in a league way above what they have encountered before. Hobb wants Dom's entire team, promising them amnesty, i.e. freedom to access any part of the world again. The line up has changed somewhat. Mai is now a mother and stays home. Letty, who died last time, comes back to life but is on the other side, having lost all her memory. A new addition is Riley, and Interpol sidekick to Hobb. There are a few baddies on the villain's team not worth mentioning in detail.<br/><br/>As my summary line suggests, it's more of the same. So, again, the plot is unimportant.

","FAST AND FURIOUS 6 is the sixth film in the Fast & Furious franchise. It's directed by Justin Lin, starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez and MANY more.<br/><br/>The film starts off with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) approaching Dom (Vin Diesel) about a case involving Shaw (Luke Evans) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who was assumed dead in the 4th segment of the series.<br/><br/>NOTE: This review is written by a Fast & Furious fan.<br/><br/>SO, the trailer of Fast & Furious 6 was everywhere by the time it came out and it literally caught everyone's attention, whether they were a fan or not. I, as usual, booked my ticket for the movie and hoped for the best... which isn't what I got.<br/><br/>Now this is quite hard to explain, so I'll do my best. According to me, this film is great, no doubt. It has the fast cars, the hot chicks, the action, yet it is quite forgettable. Now, I've seen Fast & Furious 6 twice, so far, and I've tried my best to engross myself into the film, but FF6 fails to do that for me. It's like, a chase sequence will take place, and 20 minutes later, you try your best to remember what happened during that very sequence. So, to me, it has all the elements of a Fast & Furious film, yet, it fails to captivate and by the time you leave the cinema and reach home, the film just remains faintly in your head.<br/><br/>Second problem of the film is: WHERE ARE THE CHASE SCENES? Oh my God, this is what makes a Fast & Furious film, and yet there were only 4 of them in this one. Alright, one involves a tank, and another involves an airplane, yet it does not suffice, compared to the earlier Fast Five which had plenty of chase scenes to get you engrossed in the film.<br/><br/>But apart from the flaws, Fast & Furious 6 does have some enjoyable parts, like whenever there is an action or chase scene, it is quite fun. The comedy is quite entertaining at times and the post-credits scene is quite a cliff-hanger, involving a star who is going to make a great villain to Fast & Furious 7.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I feel Fast & Furious 6 is half-baked. Honestly, from a Fast & Furious fan, its quite sad to say this, but FF6 doesn't hold a chance compared to Fast Five. It is fun at times, yet its extremely forgettable which makes it quite difficult to focus your attention on the screen.<br/><br/>FAST & FURIOUS 6: 6/10"
"artistgp","6","0","1","7 June 2013"," Some thoughts...
","I'll refrain from breaking down the entire film for you given that you've either seen it or are curious about watching it. So instead I'll just hit what I considered a few of the movies strong points and not so strong points.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: The tank scene was surprisingly awesome to watch. I didn't expect the carnage they actually showed in the film, given it was a popcorn movie. The hand to hand fight scenes were also quite well done (most notably in the train station). Obviously the movie had tons of car chases that were well handled.<br/><br/>THE BAD: The story was very weak. So tell me again why Diesel's team is the only group of people that can take down this bad guy? It's like they predicted that there would be tons of car chases. Why would you even assume that? Besides lots of plot issues the dialogue itself was a bit hard to get through. I will say that Tyrese's character was the high point of the film for me. Thank goodness he had his little quirk. <br/><br/>It was definitely nothing special, but if you like the franchise you'll enjoy the movie. Not one I would necessarily recommend tho."

","This movie was painstakingly average. It seems to be intended for people who do not notice or don't mind how inconsistent and cheesy it can be at times. A good action show tries to portray fictional realism in an attempt to evoke a certain reaction from the audience--the feeling of ""If this situation were actually happening in real life, I feel like this is just how it would play out"". The scenes that specifically bothered me were: the scene with the tank on the highway; am I really supposed to believe that people are so incapable as to not be able to avoid an army tank that only took up a third of the road, when they were in much smaller and faster vehicles? Most of them just B-lined it right into the centre of the tank and to their deaths. That's just ridiculous, man. Also, the scene on the military runway with the airplane;the woman who died-the Asian guy's woman-didn't need two hands to shoot that tiny gun she had, so I was just like ""Yeah, OK"". The other thing is that the scene was around half an hour long, all the while they were speeding along at somewhere between 200-300 miles per hour. I'm sure the runway was 100-150 miles long. Something so blatantly improbable would have bothered me in elementary school. Also, when the antagonist said if I see you guys behind me I'll call them and have them kill your wife and daughter, so let me go and my team. Then as soon as they leave they jam the signals so he can't call and they start the chase. How about just jamming the signals and NOT letting them leave. They just made a pathetic excuse to slip in another chase. ~Forest Gump Voice~ And that's all I have to say about that."

","Having successfully pulled off what was thought to be their last job in Rio, the colorful crew—or family—of street racers, carjackers, et al have gone their separate ways and are living in luxury. They're unexpectedly drawn back into the past when Agent Hobbs tracks them down and offers them a deal: full pardons and a return to their home country if they can help track down Owen Shaw—an elusive mercenary/criminal mastermind/evil genius type whose skills and savvy match their own. Although initially reluctant, the crew reassembles when the job becomes personal. In this type of film it's futile to stop and criticize the far-fetched logic, absurd action sequences, weak acting, and threadbare story which is nothing more than a ploy to pull viewers along a supercharged ride, so if you can turn your brain off for the sufficient running time then the film delivers exactly what you'd expect. Lots of high-octane action scenes, stunts, and fatal escapes, but it's been seen so many times over that it's easily forgettable. **"

","First after watching Fast Five I was very excited about the movie but sadly it did not live up to my expectations.<br/><br/>The first half is okay and offers nothing new. Some scenes are incredibly ruined by shaky cameras during the whole movie. The comic scenes and sound design is cool.<br/><br/>The tank scene is beautifully taken and Vin Diesel stunt is awesome and over the top.<br/><br/>The final chase scene is quite long and due to darkness it is completely wasted. No one cares when Gal Gadot dies! <br/><br/>Finally Jason Statham entry to the franchise is awesome move. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is watchable but not remember-able like Fast Five.

","Who would have thought back in 2001 that The Fast and the Furious would somehow because a movie series that would last to six movies with a seventh on the way? Even more surprising the Fast and Furious series has become of the premier action series and being one of Universal Studios' biggest cashcows.<br/><br/>After the Rio heist all of Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew have gone their separate ways and now multi-millionaires. But despite longing for a quiet life they are brought back into action when Diplomatic Security Service Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) gets the crew to help him stop a former British SAS officer turned mercenary Owen Shaw (Luke Shaw) who has been target military convoys in Europe to make a tech bomb. Hobbs has a big incentive for Toretto to go back into action by having proof his girlfriend and long-time love Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) is still alive and working for Shaw. With the crew in London car chases and fighting eschews.<br/><br/>The appeal of The Fast and Furious films since Justin Lin has taken over the direction of the series has been his championing of practical effects. Whilst there is some CGI (which isn't particularly good) Fast 6 is still a feat of stunt work, fight sequences and in camera effects. Lin does know how to direct an action sequences, giving us an excellent car chase in London, the tank chase in its full ridiculousness and the final sequence involving a military transport plane (even if it takes place on the world's longest runway). Gina Carano and Joe Taslim from Haywire and The Raid were both added to the cast, bringing their fighting talents to the series and they are fine additions. Taslim has an excellent fight with Tyrese Gibson and Sung Kang in Waterloo Station (though it wasn't really filmed in Waterloo Station). I was disappointed by the fight between Carano and Rodriguez but that is because of the fight was shown in the trailers and it was intercut to much with the Taslim fight.<br/><br/>Fast and Furious 6 has a massive cast with some members getting more attention then others. The big winners were Diesel and Johnson; both are massive screen presence with charisma and have the action chops. Johnson steals the shows once again, being a mass of muscle with one-liners and plenty of action ability: it is impressive the casting director was able to find a man bigger then The Rock so the pair could fight. Walker is his usual bland self and Joanna Bowster gets the shaft again, this time holding the baby. Carano is a woman of action and little words and Gibson is the comic relief to the point he was a bit annoying.<br/><br/>A problem with the series has been the villains have been lacklustre. Evans is a man who is servable in the role and he is the best villain so far simply because he does feel more of a threat because he is a man of action himself, getting involved in the frontline, being a driver and a skilled martial artist: it is better then a middle aged crime lord with a load of heavies. But Fast 7 will have a better a villain with the post credit scene setting up the sequel.<br/><br/>Whilst the action seemed like a step up from the Fast Five, the story is so much sillier. The Fast and Furious series has never been know for being strong storytelling but at least with Fast Five it felt a believable that these characters would attempt a massive heist, but Fast and Furious 6 was much more of a stretch just to reunite the team and get them working with Hobbs who has quickly become a fans favourite. The crew has shown to be expert investigators suddenly. We have American characters going round the more seedy side of London; they would be very noticeable very quickly. And as a Brit I do take it personally when the film used outdated stereotypes of British people like the snotty salesman.<br/><br/>Like Fast Five, Fast and Furious 6 is long and baggy, but this problem felt more prominent as the film tried to give anyone a moment to shine and there were sequences that could have been cut. One example is when O'Conner goes undercover in a prison in Los Angeles which was just a plot cul-de-sac and reference more to Fast and Furious (which was a forgettable entry). It needed a re-write to just tighten thinks up because the running time could have been under two hours. Fast and Furious 6 is surprising convoluted for what is supposed to be a simple action flick.<br/><br/>Funs of the series with be very satisfied with the sixth entry and on an action level it is solid. It is good to see practical effects in an action film. But it mindless and silly and it unlikely to appeal to detectors. Still the seventh film should be interesting just because of the villain."
"rothj06","6","0","2","2 June 2013"," Auto fans will be disappointed
","I'm a huge fan of the F&F franchise, but this movie has taken the series 180 degrees in the wrong direction. The film is a great movie-going experience and worth every cent of the ticket price for a good time....but hardcore fans and auto enthusiasts like myself are going to be really disappointed with the film. <br/><br/>The production team spent a lot of time assembling some spectacular cars and used them very little. The current-gen Nissan GT-R is only seen for the first forty seconds or so of the movie. The cool, custom built ""flip cars"" are only used for one of the heist scenes despite being an important plot line for the film. But the major disappointment is the Mk1 Euro Escort, which we see glimpses of many times in the film, which only appears for about three or four minutes in a driving sequence, despite being one of the leading ""cars"" featured in the ads. And there is absolutely no explanation or feasible plot as to why Letty is driving around and smashing stuff up in an extremely rare, hand-manufactured, limited production Jensen Interceptor (which is really cool, but why does she have it?)<br/><br/>Advertising branding was a big turn-off as well - Paul Walker is seen wearing Carhartt shirts during half the movie, and both Snap-On Tools and Dodge must have paid big bucks to have their products front and center in so many of the scenes. It was distracting - what happened to the young crew of tuners from California who defined the car culture and lifestyle??? I like the new direction that the franchise is taking, but seriously...none of these guys would have been seen buying & racing Spykers, Paganis, and Lambos when they were busy talking trash on Ferraris and building Supras in the first film. I think the franchise has lost its way."

","Never have been a fan of this series, but after seeing the trailers and hearing some positive things, I decided to give this one a shot. And ya know what? I actually had a pretty fun time. I like the direction Justin Lin took with this one just making it big and stupid, but totally self-aware of what it is. The action set-pieces are an absolute blast to watch with each one topping the previous one before it. The last 2 scenes are worth the price of admission alone. I also enjoyed the chemistry between all the actors which added a surprising amount of laughs to the film. Still, the film has plenty of flaws that the series has shared. There is a bit too much down time in the middle where the film starts to drag when it begins to build on it's incredibly thin story. There's also some moments of dialogue that are so poorly written it's hard not to notice them. Overall, while it's not great by any means, I would defiantly say that this is my favorite of the series so far (although that's not saying much). Nothing special or all that memorable, but as a summer popcorn flick, it gets the job done. Fans of the series will most likely love it while even the non-fans will still be able to have some fun with it. I do have to admit though after the post-credit scene, I would be lying if I said I wasn't incredibly excited for the 7th installment!"
"ankitbahri","7","0","1","31 May 2013"," Worth a watch for Dom and Brian
","The movie is a fast paced action packed movie, as expected!<br/><br/>Fast 5 ended with Letty being shown as alive, so obviously the curiosity was high regarding the suspense. The second thing to look forward to was the partnership between Dom and Hobbs.<br/><br/>The suspense regarding Letty was nicely built up but probably ended up being weak in the end. Dom and Hobbs, together had a nice going with muscles and bashing all around. They find an able enemy in Klaus and Shaw.<br/><br/>For me, the revelation of this movie was the chief villain Shaw, played by Luke Evans. He brings a certain arrogance, suave and menace, as expected from any villain who would be fighting against the likes of Dom. He does a good job. <br/><br/>The movie has nice suspense in between and the end. It does go a little slow in between but that is a relief as it will gave u time to catch your breath amongst all the fast paced action with cars speeding and flying all around. <br/><br/>The movie does not fail with the core of the movie, car racing! New cars, new stunts and new tactics. Some of the scenes, although, were blown out of proportion! <br/><br/>Overall Justin Lin and Chris Morgan do good justice to the series.<br/><br/>And yes! The movie does answer the question whether there'll be another one in the series. Go watch it for the answer, mine got ruined because of the social websites, go and watch it before someone spoils it for u (if it still hasn't happened already!)"

","Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his friends are chillin' all over the globe, enjoying la dolce vita, after their successful heist in Fast Five (2011). However they're also longing to return home to America. Agent Hobbs (The Rock) offers them the opportunity to do just that: A clean slate in exchange for one last job. The mission includes taking down a villainous character (Luke Evans) in London, finding Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and driving fast cars, while doing crazy stunts, shooting and beating people up and stuff.<br/><br/>Justin Lin's fourth entry in the franchise is mostly successful, thanks to an amiable cast, a cheesy, but sweet writing and some breathtaking action set pieces. The characters mostly derive from the actor's screen persona, which is not a bad thing per se, but some of the acting is stale and the screenplay doesn't really allow for much room for them to breathe and develop in a satisfying way. The action is very intense and interestingly shot in some instances, though you can sustain tension only so long, and so the last act results a bit too long. The film in general could use some leaner editing. Some scenes are basically useless, like Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) going to prison. Gina Carano's wrestling skills are impressive, but her character's twist at the end is completely pointless.<br/><br/>Personally, I am biased to like this film, for purely nostalgic reasons: I grew up with this franchise. The film had me from the very beginning with the great opening title montage. In my estimation this is one of the few interesting franchises out there today. Borrowing too much from last year's box office hits The Avengers (exploiting the team of ""superheroes"" aspect, featuring a ""similar"" villain and also copying structural elements) and The Dark Knight franchise (the villain seems to be driving something out of a Christopher Nolan film); Furious 6 could have been better by doing its own thing like in the previous installment. The villain and his motivations are dubious and weakly executed. The result is a formulaic story. To its credit Furious 6 has a good sense of humor, but also a beautiful message about the importance of family. What I disliked was how some characters were treated, namely Roman (Tyrese Gibson) being reduced to comic relief, Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) hardly given anything to do and Elena (Elsa Pataky) completely ignored up until the end. The potential conflict between Dom's new girlfriend Giselle (Gal Gadot) and Letty also remained unexplored. The film ends on an upbeat note, but I just have a hard time buying that Brian is a father now. Stay tuned for more action to come – #7 was already announced.<br/><br/>Verdict: Recommended. Especially if you're an action junkie, love the Fast & Furious franchise or just enjoy having Corona with your buddies and turn off your brain for 2 hours."
"RolloTomasi","3","0","1","30 May 2013"," This series and I--we go way back. Sort of.
","This franchise has been providing big dumb entertainment for 12 years now. And I've been there nearly every step of the way. It all started summer of 2001, when the original came out. I was never one for a car chase or caper film, but something caught my eye about it from the trailer. So I bought my ticket. Sat there, thinking often man this is really dumb. But the action sequences (then directed by Rob Cohen) really gave it muscle. It had this infectious energy that I enjoyed. By the time the end scene (the train scene) came around, I was kind of hooked. I knew they'd make more of these. Unable to wait till the inevitable sequel came out, I ran out and saw 2Fast 2Furious.<br/><br/>Well no. No I didn't. It's the only one of these I haven't seen in fact.<br/><br/>Later they broke off with this sort of spin-off with ""Tokyo Drift"" stuck to the end. Good for it, thought I. Its theater run came and went, too, without me. This despite the fact that I saw nearly every movie that came out at that time. My time then was more...spacious back then than it is now. Later it would be shown on cable and I caught it then. The reappearance of Dom at the end intrigued me. I thought, you see what they did there? They tossed out some bait to see what they'd catch. And you know what? What they did there may have been the most important moment in the franchise's unlikely history. They enclosed the franchise back into its star. The animal was at that moment named. Now we have something..<br/><br/>When it came to Fast & Furious I actually rented the video as a new release. I was that eager to see it. I enjoyed it even though it was seen on my miserable 32"" non-HD television. I remember a fuel truck rolling over in the Dominican Republic and an epic car chase through a drug running tunnel on the US.-Mexico border. And Letty being a double agent in a drug cartel. I must have enjoyed it enough to go out and...ACTUALLY SEE FAST FIVE IN THE THEATER. For the first time since the first F&F film, I was sitting in a theater watching one! They won me back! (applause) It only took ten years but they did it.<br/><br/>While Fast Five's success paved the way for Furious 6 (and 7 and probably 8, 9...), Furious 6 is not the film that 5 is. What made Fast 5 so great was that it is a caper film. It also seemed to send the franchise in a slightly more serious direction by raising the stakes in the form of Hobbs (And what other franchise could ever see adding Dwayne Johnson as a path to seriousness?) But even though Fast Five marks the franchise's serious turn, it's also funny, which legitimized its utter ridiculousness. <br/><br/>Furious 6 really wants to be funny, too. It's kind of like Fast 5's wannabe jealous unfunny brother. Same writers, same director, most of the same cast. And somehow, very different films. It's as if the writers have become boxed in by their own formula. And the script has its issues, for instance:<br/><br/>Why does Riley, if she's actually with Shaw, chase after Letty in the notoriously brutal girl fight? Did they only decide during the later stages of writing that Riley was a mole and just didn't want to ditch the first Riley/Letty fight? It didn't make sense.<br/><br/>In the tank scene, on the Spanish highway, they kill the tank by attaching a cable to Roman's mangled car. But wouldn't the ultra-strong cable just rip through the car? Let alone turn the tank upside down? <br/><br/>Just how long are NATO runways? The climactic scene in the cargo plane must have been set on one that was 200 miles long. <br/><br/>I still like this franchise and will be interested to see more. Jason Statham should be able to infuse it yet again with new energy. They could even get rid of Hobbs (killed in a blaze of glory? Yeah that'd be a good story point). One spot on the crew vacated by Han and Gisele with Sean Boswell (which many of the F&F forums already seem to be discussing)."

","Overall its a disappointing movie in the franchise. The 6 movies have had a mixed bag, with tokyo drift being the best in my opinion. The cinematography and vibrant colours mixed with the culture has more to offer.<br/><br/>But moving onto ""Fast & Furious 6"" There really is no acting in this movie. I wasn't expecting much from Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Vin Diesel, but expected more from Paul Walker (Brian). Also, some the scenes seem to be edited so much as to piece together scenes that don't mix well. On the other hand, most of the action scenes make you feel like you're chasing Shaw yourself which for me adds to the action impact. While the plot is very silly, it will get a few laughs out of you (yes it seems more of an action comedy). And the movie keeps you on the end of your seats. So if you're a fan of this franchise, or any action franchise, see it. If you're more into drama or comedy (although this movie has some of each), I suggest you see something else."

","Let's get it out of the way, ""Furious 6"" is an insanely stupid movie. The acting is horrendous, the writing is worse, and the plot is thinner than a playing card. However, despite all of these flaws, this film is immensely entertaining. It's fast, full of energy, and one liners that will have you rolling on the floor. It's a film that knows exactly what it is and what it wants to achieve. It isn't afraid to mix over the top action with sappy melodrama. The film has its own unique style and is filled with what young people today refer to as ""swag."" Justin Lin has done wonders with this franchise. The racing/car chase sequences are well shot and edited. The audience really feels apart of the experience. Along with the fast and adrenaline infused car sequences, this film has the best hand to hand combat so far this year. The fights are well choreographed, shot, and edited to a point were I almost feel every punch and kick being thrown. There are some ridiculous set pieces in this film, but they are exciting and entertaining as heck. I was literally at the edge of my seat even when my brain was telling me that what is happening is totally idiotic.<br/><br/>I feel that I don't really have to talk about the actors or characters at this point. Mainly due to the fact that they've been around for so long and also because they're not the main reason for why we go see these films. I know they have a special place in our hearts now, but they aren't all too interesting or filled with enough depth to go into detail. However, I do love how we feel apart of their family.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Furious 6"" is a very entertaining and fun film. The plot, writing, and characters may be dumb, but hey, this series is like family and no matter how stupid or dumb it can be, we love it no matter what. Especially when we have physics defying stunts, a great soundtrack, and The Rock. I give it 3.5/5, a popcorn flick that knows exactly what the audience wants."

","First of all, this movie is quite awesome, but not as good as Fast 5 which IMO is the best of all FF franchise. The plot is more simple with a predictable twist in the end. The story also serves for wrapping up all the FF series for a grand finale in FF7 so it loads with lots character and effort to tie those loose ends (but not convincing enough) in previous sequel and rearrange the series in order so we can see now that FF3 is actually the FF6. So no wonder, there are some unnecessary scenes (ie Connor meets Braga in jail) which make less portion of actions scenes.<br/><br/>The FF team become more solid in this sequel, everyone has a good portion to show their character and role in the movie. I think Han & Gisele relationship here somehow is more subtle & memorable than ""it'a all about family"" excuses that Dom and others bragging about throughout the film.<br/><br/>However, the villain team is under my expectation. They are not as Hobbs, Braga or others picture them to be. They don't look scary, mean or dangerous to me, they just look tense and a bit nervous, except Shaw and that big Russian guy. While Shaw indeed is a cool and thinker mastermind, it's hard to believe that he is as powerful as Braga said. He doesn't have that powerful and dominant charm/aura.<br/><br/>So 7 out of 10 from me."

","Wow. Fast 6. Six! And there's gonna be a seventh one too! <br/><br/>The fast and furious franchise has never been a real favorite of mine. Since I'm in 8th grade however, I do enjoy a good turn- your-brain-off film that is oozing male testosterone from every corner, whether it's big guns, explosions, hot chicks, or body builders crashing into each other with cars. Despite all this, I've never really been a fan of the franchise until it's 5th release. Directed by Justin Lin, it was the first well shot, well paced flick of the franchise. Although it was dumb, I had a ton of fun with it. <br/><br/>So this new one was what I needed to kick off the summer blockbuster season. And it did just that. It was still pretty stupid. The acting, overall, was pretty bad too, but there were surprisingly some pretty great performances and dialogue between some of the main characters, which was actually somewhat enjoyable and funny. Probably funnier than the actual ""comedy"" opening right alongside this one, The Hangover Part 3. <br/><br/>The thing I enjoy most about these films, though, is the stunt work combined with pretty decent special effects. These movies are so over the top but the it's good to know that although the plot to these things aren't well thought out, the technical aspect of it all is stellar, and some of these scenes, especially with some friends, can be a blast once you see them. <br/><br/>This movie gets so over the top that it takes away from what I liked about fast five so much: how tension built up to the unbelievable action sequence at the end. This time around, Lin puts in so much action that there's literally no room to breathe. This is why I'm still debating whether fast five or fast six was better. Fast Six definitely had a better clan, but the steady pacing in five makes me like the 2011 release a little more. <br/><br/>It still does not change the fact that fast Six is so fun to watch. I'd say, ignore the critics and take this movie for what it is: dumb manliness portrayed on film. <br/><br/>This movie is loads of fun. 73/100"
"the_pious_satan","6","0","1","25 May 2013"," Go watch it and get your testosterone pumped.
","Its understandable why people will go and watch this movie. I have been watching the fast and furious series since its inception. Of the 6 movies made, some where adrenaline pumping, exciting and some were plain old lame. This one stands somewhere in the middle. <br/><br/>The opening sequence of the movie is brilliant, and it sets the mood for the movie. It gets you all excited. And then 15 minutes in to the film, you realize you're drifting father away from the storyline (because it doesn't have one). You get eager to get on with to the parts with all the action, but alas! it doesn't come. <br/><br/>The locations in the movie are breathtaking and so are the cars. The cars! From the M5, 69 Mustang to the Daytona (albeit not the original). Oh, and don't forget the tank. They blew up a tank! The chase sequences are brilliant, as usual. But here's what bothers me. Every time the actors shift their gears you realize that they're driving an automatic. So many gear changes in an automatic? Amateurish. <br/><br/>The acting is mediocre. I believe Dwayne Jhonson had only one motive for the movie, to look big - he does. Its daunting to see him on the screen. Justin Lin (director) was not able to put him on screen with 2 other actors, because they just wouldn't fit the screen! As for the rest, Paul Walker & Vin Diesel put up good performances, Ludicrous & Tyrese Gibson are the comic relief and the female actors are a little more than eye candy. <br/><br/>The plot is as boring and nonchalant as a B grade Hollywood flick. All throughout the movie you keep telling yourself that the movie is about to explode. But it doesn't.<br/><br/>The music is good and in lieu with the flow of the movie. The direction is nothing out of the ordinary, and you don't expect it to be for a movie like this. <br/><br/>The ending sequence is quite thrilling to say the least and the gang take out an army cargo airplane. But all throughout the sequence you keep asking yourself, when does the runway end?!<br/><br/>All in all, a good entertainer. Post credits you're in for a surprise as The Man is introduced in to the franchise. Be sure to go and watch movie after having a couple of beers."

","I used to scoff at this franchise. ""It's just 2 hours of souped-up Hondas and rap music."" I said, feeling rather smug. But a funny thing happened. They tweaked the formula, and suddenly a franchise of over-glorified music videos became entertaining popcorn flicks. No, the plots aren't great, the dialog is cliché and the acting won't win any awards (unless you count The Razzies), but I can't recall having more fun watching a straight-up action movie in a long, long time. A lot of it doesn't make any sense if you think about it too hard, but then again it's a Summer action movie. You're not SUPPOSED to think too hard. My advice; Buckle-up and enjoy. 'Fast & The Furious 6' is a good time."

","Fast and Furious has become the most awkwardly successful franchise in the history of film, and the sixth installment just adds to the insanity. Since when does a Part 6 to ANY film find any success or quality? This is an underrated first in cinematic history (Star Wars: Return of the Jedi does not count) as this testosterone-laden monolith of an action flick delivers the women, cars, action, comedy, and themes of family that has become a staple to the franchise since its subtle revival in Fast and Furious.<br/><br/>If you have enjoyed this new direction of the Fast/Furious series then there will be nothing here that will disappoint you, from the stunts to the direction to the manly cast that makes the male viewers watching this look like Steve Urkel. The plot is a simple stop-that-man tale that involves the entire cast from Fast Five as well as a couple familiar faces from previous installments, which explains the opening sequence playing out like a flashback. The rest of the movie plays out like an extremely expensive music video with likable characters and high octane action sequences attached.<br/><br/>What keeps the motors of this movie (and franchise overall) running is the very likable cast of characters and the connection they've developed with the dedicated fanbase. Even though certain characters like Brian and Mia (Paul Walker shines but is limited) have taken less screen time and we have more focus on Dom and Luke (Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson), they each have their moments to shine and get the audience excited. The writing doesn't totally excel but it goes straight to the point of the conflict at hand and what is at stake.<br/><br/>But the cars and what happens to them is the heart and soul of Fast 6. Justin Lin is improving as an action director as he delivers the sequences with precise camera movement, surprisingly crisp cinematography, and enough space so that you can see the sheer scale of the mayhem occurring. While Fast Five still has the ultimate action sequence in the past half-decade, the latter action scenes will leave you breathless guaranteed.<br/><br/>This is a very you-get-what-you-paid for film, as it doesn't quite take the franchise to the next level, but maintains delivering what you've come to expect out of these films. The beautiful women will be here, as well as the buff men, the tough-as-nails action, the beautiful cars, the good soundtrack, and a pace that matches that of a car---once the engines are running it truly takes off. While there is no evolution, there is plenty of entertainment to go around for everybody willing to watch.<br/><br/>And do stay tuned for the credits. Just when you think that eventual next installment might be overkill, you will leave the theater excited."

","What has beautiful women, fast cars, comedy, and action? No I'm not talking about a college spring break in Miami, Florida; I'm talking about the latest installment in the Fast and Furious Franchise. Last night two of my buddies and I had the privilege of seeing an early showing of Furious 6, and like always I have plenty to say. Let's get started.<br/><br/>For those who saw Fast Five, you know that Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) were expecting their first child, Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew were all millionaires and Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) was ""searching"" for them. Number six picks up pretty much two months later, showing how the heist crew, minus the two demolition experts, are enjoying their well-earned rewards. In F&F world though, nothing every remains quiet for long as a ghost from the past, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) stirs the embers of intrigue and revenge in Dom resulting in the team coming together to find her. Now let's start the review.<br/><br/>The opening of this movie is a bit slow at the beginning, but provides enough laughs and information to refresh old fans memory of the plot, while making a small foundation for those new to the series. After a ridiculous interrogation scene, a rushed planning scenes, and some more jokes later, bam we get to our first action scene. Now you might be thinking, oh great another loud sequence of cars rushing through the road sending pedestrians and bystanders dodging to the sides. For the most part you are right, but this time they are chasing after a band of mercenaries led by Luke Evans attempting to steal some government secret weapon component. While this goal is not the most unique, it's at least a slight change up to the typical motives behind the adrenaline pumping, engine roaring speed fest that we've seen for the last thirteen years. The stunts are still impressive, the cars so sleek and beautiful it hurts, and the music so aggressive that it blends into an exciting ride. Of course this wouldn't be worthy of being an F&F movie if there was only one chase scene right Don't worry number six has a few more car scenes that continue to show off the world of stunt driving, CGI and mediocre plots centered around finding ways to make cars go fast.<br/><br/>One should note though that the action isn't just limited to cars. Nope F&F6 opens has taken the liberty to add more diversity in their butt kicking arsenal. With the Rock taking more screen time, fans get to see a few more fist fights and body slamming that allows you to see what the Rock is cooking. When Johnson isn't putting the hurt on someone, the rest of the gang takes their shots at either putting a cap in someone, or pulling out some martial arts skills to defeat their opponents. Some of these fights rock, while others are merely meant to have you laughing as the heroes throw out witty banter. Despite some of the ridiculousness and over the top stunts, the action will still have action fans on the edge of their seats, hooting for their favorite characters.<br/><br/>Putting the action aside though, the movie does have other qualities that help balance things out. For one thing the comedy in this movie is still strong, especially when Roman (Tyrese Gibson) takes the stage. The feisty, self-involved, ladies' man is the center of the comedic pillar pulling all the other characters in to a friendly rivalry that symbolizes the brotherhood between the team. From my standpoint, I think Gibson must make these jokes daily, as the acting made it seem that it was just an ordinary day, especially when going toe to toe with Tej (Ludacris).<br/><br/>For me the comedy also helped make up for some of the plot holes this movie had. The lack of reasoning behind Evans attacks left me feeling as this guy was just crazy. The plot revolving around Dom and Letty though was the better developed of the story, with much of the movie focusing on the internal struggles occurring between the two. While the romance is not my favorite part, the movie does a good job not rubbing love in my face, and actually uses the plot to bring in other ghosts from the pasts to strengthen the movie. Laughs and love aside, the movie also does a nice job keeping you on your toes as to who will survive the ordeal. Many times there are close calls where you are not sure if someone will live, and yes there are even some deaths that upset my friends, despite how predictable it was. All in all though, the plot isn't the worst thing I've seen, it just was lacking in some areas that I felt failed where the fifth one succeeded. Luckily we still have a nice balance of characters/actors in the movie, with the exception of a few who took a major back seat to Dom and Letty, (i.e. Mia, Tej, and Elena). While the action was impressive, the camera work still had a few spastic moments that were either a bit dizzying or a bit annoying. As for the villain, again the guy had skills and a lethal team, but they failed to really build him up or give him some pizazz to make him stand out as a great bad guy. Regardless F&F6 is a good movie and keeps the series alive for at least one more movie to come, watch the credits. Acting is just like before, the action is still rip roaring fun, and the comedy is golden to keep you laughing the whole time. Yet some weaknesses in plot and centering on Letty/Dom hindered this movie to make it less enjoyable for me. My scores are below: Action/Crime/Thriller: 7.5 Movie: 7.0"
"dmurilloroman","9","0","1","24 May 2013"," Not Out of Milk Just Yet
","This movie has all the elements going for it than the previous film, much more emotionally involving because it's moral of family really reaching the audience. This flick consists of intense stunts that will stun the audience as well as surprisingly more exciting stunt driving. Humour wise, they solidified Tyrese Gibson as their comedic symbol churning up most of the laughs. The intro credit scene is as always attention grabbing, with a scene after the ending credits to predict another sequel. This franchise still seems fresh due to all the Fast and Furious films not having generic plots, it is not out of originality/milk yet. There are twists that will for sure surprise you and the performances are in no way stale for a pretty dumb action flick. Even though you've seen all the trailers there are still unexpected shocks. The music score is extremely modern and ""hip"" that brings every scene alive, I already have some of the soundtracks in my play list. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson again reassures the public for the 4th time this year that he is a force to be reckoned with action star. With a very epic climax it truly delivers high octane entertainment to all of it's hardcore fans. This is an extremely satisfying pre-summer flick that still has a kick-ass future ahead of it."

","Fast & Furious 6 (2013)<br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>The sixth film in the franchise pretty much picks up where the last one ended. Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) agree to get the gang back together when they learn that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is alive and working with a terrorist who plans on stealing a chip that could be worth billions to the right person. Along with Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) the group does what they have to get things done. I must admit that I went through the previous five movies for the first time just months before this came out. After the awful third one and a bland fourth one, I really wasn't expecting too much but then FAST FIVE turned out to be one of the best action movies in a while and this one here isn't a letdown. Much like that one, director Justin Lin goes all out and really delivers non-stop action but also blends in a story that we can enjoy with characters that we care for. There's no question out there but this series really has turned into the perfect example of how to do an action picture right. Diesel, Walker, Johnson and the gang are all back in perfect form as their characters. It was nice seeing Rodriguez back in action, although I guess some will debate her being back. What really makes this film so memorable are the various action and stunt sequences, which are just as good as the previous film. This includes a terrific bit at the end, which I'm not going to completely ruin but you've seen clips of the tank sequence on the film's trailer. Seeing this play out was just another level of imagination that makes this series stand out. Then, just when you think the film is coming to an end, we're given a twist that really works and then an even bigger bang that ranks as one of the most action-packed sequences in the history of film. Hey, I watch more movies from all eras than anyone I know but what we got here was just amazing with so many action scenes playing out at the same time. FAST & FURIOUS 6 is another great summer movie and I really can't wait to see where the series goes from here."

","¨You don't turn your back on family, even when they do.¨<br/><br/>Fast and Furious 6 and The Hangover Part 3 were both released today in what looks to be a tight box office race for the Memorial Day weekend. If you would have asked me a couple of years ago which film I would prefer to see, I would have definitely chosen to go see The Hangover Part 3 because I loved the first movie and thought it was a great comedy; I also enjoyed The Fast and The Furious film but wasn't too pleased with the following three sequels. Then in 2011 when both Fast Five and The Hangover Part 2 came out, things completely changed for me. I was hooked with The Fast and Furious franchise while part two of The Hangover was a major letdown. That is why this weekend I decided to go for Fast and Furious 6 without a doubt, and I wasn't disappointed. This might not be as good as the last film (which I think is the best in the franchise), but it lived up to expectations and was highly entertaining. This is Justin Lin's fourth time in the director's chair in this franchise and he seems to have had a great effect on these movies converting them into entertaining thrillers with some great action scenes. Screenwriter, Chris Morgan, is also back for the fourth time and he has managed to actually put some brains to these fast car races and create better characters. He's developed these characters very well and made them interesting, and has also done a decent job at creating some memorable villains. The film is fast paced, has several thrills, great car chases, and some decent character development. Of course there are several flaws as well: unbelievable and laughable scenes involving guys jumping off moving vehicles and landing safely all the time, and some very predictable moments and foreseeable twists. I still had a fun time with this film and laughed more than I thought I would. <br/><br/>If you thought that Toretto (Vin Diesel) and O'Conner (Paul Walker) were retired after their latest heist in Rio, then you were wrong because Detective Hobbs (Dwayne ¨The Rock¨ Johnson) has an interesting proposition for them. He is pursuing some dangerous criminal mercenary drivers led by Shaw (Luke Evans) who have been creating chaos all over Europe. In order to stop them, Hobbs knows that he will need the help of Toretto. Hobbs discovers that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Toretto's former love interest, is alive and working for Shaw, and therefore convinces Toretto to help him. The rest of his crew decides to come out of retirement as well and try to bring Letty back home with them. In exchange, Hobbs promises these men full pardon, and they accept without hesitation because they are tired of running and not being able to return home. Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris ¨Ludicrous¨ Bridges), Han (Sung Kang), and Gisele (Gal Gadot) are all back in order to help Toretto and O'Conner to stop the ruthless criminals pursuing them from London to Spain, but Shaw and his men seem to be always a step ahead of them. <br/><br/>This sixth film in the franchise seems to tie some loose ends from the third and fourth installment in a very thrilling and entertaining way. The franchise has really picked up and it seems to have a lot of life left in it. It even ends with a cliffhanger, so it is certain that the seventh film will be coming out soon as well. Most everyone in the franchise is back again (only missing Tego Calderon and Don Omar) and the interaction between these characters is very entertaining. Ludicrous and Tyrese pretty much steal all the laughs in the scenes they are together in, while Gadot and Kang bring in the romantic touch. Toretto and O'Conner have put aside their differences from the first films and their bond is pretty strong now as they are family. Despite some of the insane and absurd action scenes, this film stands above most other action films thanks to a strong performance from the cast. This film is really a lot of fun as long as you don't think too hard of all the physical impossibilities of what they are achieving. The franchise just continues to grow faster and faster, and it works really well for a summer blockbuster movie. Fans won't be disappointed, it is a very satisfying film. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"regula1","7","0","1","24 May 2013"," Good action movie, but doesn't fully live up to its past
","I am a a big fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, I own them all. Typically I rank them according to my beliefs as to how well they were done. In my mind, from best to worst: 5,4,1,3, and 2. When I look at Fast 6, I would have to put it somewhere between 4 and 1.<br/><br/>Here's why I think this: the Fast and Furious franchise was based on the premise of fast, gorgeous cars and the shades of gray between good and bad, mostly marketed towards the gear head segment of the population. With Fast 5, we see that they are now trying to re-brand the franchise as a heist series with cars as the central method for pulling off these heists. <br/><br/>Fast 5 did this spectacularly in my opinion, but Fast 6 was a step down. First of all, the cars were not given as much emphasis as even Fast 5 did. The fact that many of the driving sequences in this movie happen at night and the cars are mainly painted dark colors shows a distinct movement away from the car culture that made the series so popular.<br/><br/>Secondly, this movie seems to try too hard to be funny at times. In the previous movie, there was a definite light-heartedness about the characters and their banter, but in Fast 6 the humor is not that funny and tends to be forced into inappropriate times and places.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you go to this movie expecting it to be a perfect continuation of the excellence of the previous movie you will be disappointed. However, if you go to see beautiful cars crash, things blow up, and epic fistfights this is the summer movie for you."

I admit these films are jammed full of cheesy lines, unrealistic stunts, and flaws, but this does not take away from the 'fun' of the film; in fact it really adds to it. <br/><br/>The story, although shamelessly far-fetched, lifts this franchise off into a whole other level. As well, this instalment to the series, finally ties up the lose ends between Tokyo Drift and the rest of the films.

","Well today i watched Fast & Furious 6 and I'll give you a quick review about the movie. Been watching all fast n furious series, and these are my thoughts about their 6th movie:<br/><br/>1. The story? Kinda twisted and unpredictable. The plot seems a bit forced to fit the criteria of an action movie. But after all, it kept me on my seat. The idea to bring someone from the dead, is not really good, though. Some plot holes were found. 8.1/10.0<br/><br/>2. The character? I was hoping that there would be another character to join the team. For those of you who haven't watched the previous sequel, will find it a little hard to understand the characters in this one. Same old Dom, same old O'Connor and Mia, same old Tej and Romey Rome, and so on. But one thing that i find interesting from the characters is the existence of a new ""super""villain, Shaw. If you are a Fast n Furious series fan, you're going to like him. 7.5/10.0<br/><br/>3. The actors? hmm... not much of improvement here. But they were all good. 7.0/10.0<br/><br/>4. The action? More cars, more explosions, more actions than the previous movie. I found some glitches in the movie that i find a rather disturbing. Glitches here means the nonsense level of this movie is beyond average at some point. 9.0/10.0<br/><br/>Sum up: So where are the upgrades? Everywhere! This is definitely better than the previous movie. The car chase, the action, the nonsense, the shootings, the fighting, the story, the actors are all upgraded. If you are a hardcore action movie lover, then you're going to have a good time watching this movie. Maybe it's a little bit forced, maybe it's a little bit ridiculous in some part, but one thing you have to remember: This is an action movie, so f* that. That is the X Factor of an action movie. All in all, Fast & Furious 6, is definitely entertaining. Final score: 8.4/10.0<br/><br/>P.S. : Don't leave the theater too soon. They gave me a surprise after the credit!"

","Fast & Furious 6 stars Vin Diesel (The Chronicles of Riddick), Dwayne Johnson (G.I. Joe: Retaliation), and Paul Walker (Fast & Furious).<br/><br/>In this one, Agent Hobbs (Johnson) recruits Dominic Torreto (Diesel) and his gang to help track down a criminal named Owen Shaw, played by Luke Evans (The Raven). Shaw specializes in ""vehicular warfare"". Obviously, there would be none better to handle the case than the Fast and Furious crew.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of this series, then surely you have come to expect the cheesy lines, bad acting, and far-fetched, if not, impossible, action sequences. These are the main reasons why I myself am not a fan. Without giving away too much, I do feel the need to mention a scene that takes place on a runway. After a while, I thought, this runway has to be about 30 miles long in order to accomplish all that is taking place. It was laughable.<br/><br/>Okay, now that I have that out of my system, I'll try to focus on the positives.<br/><br/>The cars are awesome and there are some exciting chase scenes, big stunts, and some decent action and fight sequences. There is also some good comic relief, most of which came from the characters played by Tyrese Gibson (Four Brothers) and Ludicrous (2 Fast 2 Furious). I thought that Luke Evans, by far, gave the best performance in the movie --- and come on, who doesn't like to see Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson kick some ass?<br/><br/>Look, the fans of this series will love this movie and I think it's going to be a big box office hit.

","For what I'm about to say, please remember that I gave the movie 7 stars and I really did enjoy it. That being said...<br/><br/>Argh, you directors/screenwriters etc make me so angry! It's always the same with you people. You just don't know where to draw the line. Why do always seem to HAVE TO top the previous film in terms of action scenes? Would it kill you to just create thrilling, SLIGHTLY over the top action scenes, instead of these stupidly overdone action highlights? Those scenes are singlehandedly responsible for the movie being 'good' rather than 'great'.<br/><br/>I'm talking of course about scenes like Dom and Letty flying through the air (I'd say a solid 25 meters) only to land on the windshield of a car. What's up gravity? No severe injuries? So what a car is like an air cushion or something? Then you have your shamelessly overdone end scene. The plane rolls and rolls - they fight, shoot, fire spearguns at the thing, ans then fight some more - but how long does it take a plane to finally go up in the air? How long is that runway??? 20km? The moment of take-off usually takes a few seconds. This plane, however, stays in a quasi-take-off-state for a good 3 minutes.<br/><br/>It's. Just. So. Painful. To. Watch.<br/><br/>Hollywood, you don't need the impossible to impress me. I love car chases, well-choreographed fight scenes, humor and good characters. Fast 6 has all of that! My advice for 7? Keep up the (really) great work and lose the stupid bull***!!! The movie will be better for it!"
