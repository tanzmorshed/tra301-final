"dylanhook","10","96","102","21 August 2012"," Definitely one of the best animated films I've seen...a guy's review
","Let me start by saying that I'm an 18 year old male, and was kinda dragged into watching this by my girlfriend, who is a big fan of the Disney princess movies. I finally gave in the other day, and I've very glad that I did. <br/><br/>The movie looked gorgeous, the animation was spot on; all while holding on to the classic Disney feel. <br/><br/>The main characters are extremely likable. Repunzel is your typical Disney princess style character: sweet, funny, etc. Eugene, aka Flynn Rider, kinda stole the show for me, but maybe that's because I'm slightly gender biased. Nonetheless, you can't deny his wit and humor. Maximus the horse fills the role of animal sidekick perfectly; just as good as Donkey was to Shrek even though he doesn't talk. <br/><br/>While the plot is relatively predictable, it was still quite an enjoyable movie. I didn't find myself to be bored at only of the parts, and I was laughing a lot more than I had expected to. This movie is an instant classic, and a near perfect example of what animated fairy tales should be like if they want to appeal to a wide range of viewers, not just tween girls. The ending was sweet and should leave everybody happy. <br/><br/>I think there's enough fun in this movie for all ages, including an 18 year old guy like me."
"SGuy157","9","46","48","5 January 2011"," Couldn't Have Been Better
","I will start off by simply saying that this movie is excellent. No, the word excellent doesn't even describe this movie well enough, because it is better than excellent. I could not take my eyes away movie for the hour and a half of the film. Even if the movie was seven hours long my eyes would still be glued to the screen for the whole time. Along with Up, this has to be the best animated movie ever made.<br/><br/>The animation was outstanding, and I was amazed at all of the little details in all of the characters, objects, and backgrounds in every frame of every scene. The film is full of breathtaking and amazing images. The scene with all of the floating lanterns was one of the most beautiful things I have seen in a movie. Nothing could have been done to improve the amazing visuals and animation used.<br/><br/>Before first seeing the movie, I hadn't realized that it was a musical, so that was a pleasant surprise for me. I have heard people say that the movie was great while the music was only average or not that good. I, on the other hand, thought that the music was wonderful and fit perfectly with what was happening, whether it be the action and fighting scenes or the calmer scenes like the lantern scene.<br/><br/>Also, this movie actually made me laugh, and I don't laugh much during most animated movies. Personally, I thought that the dialogue was great and all of the characters worked well together. I especially loved the relationship with Rapunzel and Flynn, because it could be comical at one point and then touching at the next. And not only was the dialogue be used for comedy, but it also was used to create beautiful and touching scenes. Even thinking about the line were Flynn told Rapunzel she was his new dream and when she told him that he was hers gives me chills.<br/><br/>I really hope that this movie gets an Oscar. True, Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon were both outstanding movies, but I think Tangled is the most deserving in the animated film category. Every aspect of the film was perfect. The animation, the story, and the score all were excellent and when combined they made a movie that couldn't have been better.<br/><br/>Congratulations Disney, you've got me tangled. I wish I could see it again, but unfortunately I think I'll just have to wait until it comes out onto DVD. I hope to see more movies like this in the future.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, I'm a guy. A teenage guy. So really this movie should appeal to all audiences. If you love a good movie that is charming, funny, beautiful, and touching, then go see the movie Tangled. You won't be disappointed."
"hayonthego","10","363","413","24 November 2010"," Incredibly fun movie
","I will start by saying that I am a 62 year old grandfather of three (9, 8, and 5) who has no connection to Disney in any way. I took the grandkids today to see this movie and they loved it, as did I. The 3D is worth going to. There is enough silliness, adventure, and romance to allow boys and girls of almost all ages to love this show. There were some funny lines in the show that kids would not understand, but adults would enjoy. I heard a gentleman laughing throughout the whole show. I am not around teenagers, so I am not sure how a teenager would respond to this show. The storyline was different but predictable. That should not discourage anyone from going to this show. I would rate it as one of the best, if not the best animation show I have ever seen. This show is a winner as a family show."
"celtic_dove","10","40","42","20 January 2011"," Excellent!!
","After seeing the previews I thought it'd be a light hearted and fun movie to watch but it just exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>The humor is only slightly outranked by the facial expressions, particularly those of Rider. <br/><br/>Maximum was hilarious. <br/><br/>A horse with a mind of his own that can do quite a number of 'stunts'.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie not only to adults but for young children as well. It's fast, exiting and very entertaining.<br/><br/>I didn't find any parts to be 'slow going' and it certainly put a new slant on the old story of Rapunzel.<br/><br/>A real 'feel good happy' type of movie."
"gccc44-957-592405","10","43","46","22 January 2011"," Very good movie in every aspect
","This movie hits the mark on all levels. It is beautifully illustrated and the story is simple, yet works and keeps your interest. I'm not a big song guy..... but the songs in this movie are very good. Either very funny or, when the love songs begin, nicely done with some good lyrics and music. It's a '10' all the way across the board. In keeping with the Disney animators reputation for hiding phallic symbols, this has maybe the most blatant one of all. When the mother is standing near the window, her shadow is unmistakably harder than Chinese arithmetic. Keep an eye out for it..... But, this movie really is well done. The song and visuals in the tavern with all the thug characters is pretty funny. Definitely see this one!!"

","A wonderful movie! I had forgotten all about Tangled, and am so glad I got to see it on the big screen. A great story with fun characters and beautiful animation that still looks new."
"jergasmic","10","316","368","24 November 2010"," A New Classic.
","I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'. <br/><br/>This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture. <br/><br/>The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.<br/><br/>I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear. <br/><br/>This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies. <br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it."
"blackmambamark","8","187","217","28 November 2010"," Disney, where have you been all this time?
","Honestly, when is the last time you saw a decent Disney Animated feature? No no, PIXAR does not count. I'm talking about just a regular ol' straight laced Disney flick. If your like me, I'm sure your answer falls somewhere in the mid 90's. But isn't that a shame? What happened to the totally awesome Disney movies? If your excuse is because of technology, i assure you that your wrong. You can make a great animated movie without resorting to actual hand drawn art. But where is that old feeling we all use to share? Well i can tell you this much....i already knew that Disney had something special here, mainly because the VP of PIXAR jumped ship and decided to fund this project. The first time anyone from PIXAR has ever done so, let alone the freakin VP. So needless to say, Disney finally had enough, and pulled out all the stops for this one.<br/><br/>I kid you not when i say this....""Tangled"" is easily the best Disney Animated feature i have seen since ""Aladdin"".....yes, it is that good. They finally let go of trying to find something new and different and settled with what was working for them almost 20 years ago. It's a princess tale that easily falls into the same category with the classics. So wait, does that mean i'm comparing it to the likes of ""Snow White"" ""Cinderella"" and ""Sleeping Beauty""? You damn right i am! Sure the storyline is cliché' and relative to other Disney classics, but it felt so good to see and feel something that helped recall your childhood. But other than those minor speed bumps, the movie is spot on. The animation is spectacular, and you would be a fool not to see it in 3D. The musical sequences didn't seem forced and were never boring. And i can almost guarantee you that it will snag the best song award at the Oscars. I'm just glad that they didn't work the story around the music, which is what a lot of animated features tend to slip up on. But this one did an amazing job of hybriding them together.<br/><br/>Bottom Line, ladies and gentleman, this is the Disney picture you have been waiting for. It will definitely win your heart and please audiences both young and old."
"slcjared","10","326","386","23 October 2010"," My Favorite Disney Movie
","I saw the finished movie at the screening before the wrap party. The movie works on every level. The Characters, the animation, the story, the score, the romance, and it's all very cute as well (in a way Disney can apparently still pull off). <br/><br/>The one thing that I didn't get into was the songs (Except maybe the ""Mother Knows Best"" reprise). They were a little weak melodically and you won't be singing them for weeks like I do ""Part of Your World"" every time I watch the ""Little Mermaid."" However, the songs are good enough not to bring the movie down. There are so many touching scenes in this movie and you will love all of the characters by the end and have an amazing time in the process. <br/><br/>It is definitely worth seeing in the theater, as this is probably the prettiest computer animated movie I've seen. I just can't wait to see it in stereo!<br/><br/>(BTW, I'm a 30 year old male who grew up with Disney. And I feel like I'm being objective when I say this movie works as a movie and not as a movie exclusively for 10 year old girls.)"
"cbluvsact","10","37","40","9 January 2011"," Get your butt to the theater and see this movie!
","I have seen this movie 3 times as of today, and possibly 4 as of next week, if that gives anyone a good idea of what a fantastic movie this is. Tangled is now my favorite of the 50 Disney animated movies out there, or any animated movie for that matter. Despite fans of the classic Disney princess being down on the CGI animation, I to the contrary found that this was a vast improvement. The scenery and basic concepts were still classic Disney, but the CGI made them movie vivid and realistic but in a cute animated way. The characters were all very deep, and all added their own humorous aspects to the movie. Repunzel was a bad ass without being violent, and more lovable than the rest of the princesses combined. The prince was actually a bandit role (Flynn) and way more dimensional than previous princes. He was a main part of the movie, and he added a great contrast to Repunzel's naive heroine. I left having a crush on Flynn, and wanting to go to the pet store to buy a pet chameleon. I predict that at the end of the movie you will leave feeling lighter at heart, and transported back to being a wide eyed youngster. Well, I did anyway."
"intelearts","10","29","31","9 January 2011"," My 354th Review: Excellent entertainment - really
","With jaw-dropping graphics and an abundance of heart this is simply what you would wish for in a fairy tale: memorable, magical, and magnificent.<br/><br/>We cannot remember the last time we saw a film that was simply so entertaining - there is almost nothing to complain about here in any way and much to praise from values to comedy to several scenes that were genuinely moving - this really is one of the best movies of the year and deserves its massive box office success.<br/><br/>If perhaps you are reluctant to see it as you think it will just rehash old Disney ideas or be unsuitable for small children I would say those are always my first concerns, but here for the first time in a very long time I can honestly say that here we have a film that holds its own integrity and so, even with the villain's death, you don't feel that it was put in to scare.<br/><br/>All in all, a magical, hilarious, witty, and very well thought through movie that deserves the Oscar that is surely coming to it - simply the best animated movie of the year as, more even than Toy Story 3, it rises beyond animation to make a wonderful heart-filled adventure that makes for very satisfying viewing indeed.<br/><br/>Thank you, Disney."

","While updating our own profile on Facebook we came across a great link posted by Apollo Cinema Burnley for some free preview tickets for the new film Tangled 3D a film based on the story of Rapunzel which has been sprinkled with a little Disney Magic.<br/><br/>Having a six year old as an excuse to see all the Disney films is great , but recently seeing Toy Story 3 3D and Shrek Happily ever after in 3D I left feeling that the movie makers still had some way to go with a 3d film . <br/><br/>Viewing some trailers for tangled it looked like it was going to be a funny film but was the trailers packet with the best bits? With a big smile on my face I can honestly say read on :)<br/><br/>When the screening started 3D glasses at the ready for us all, the Sony dog I think is great and hoped that Tangled would be more like this where you could reach out and grab things, fingers crossed<br/><br/>From the start I was hooked and from the absolute silence in the cinema it seemed everyone else was too. For the next hour and a half I was taken on a none stop roller coaster that just kept getting better. The 3D was amazing and at one point my son really did reach out to grab something out of the film . <br/><br/>The story is fantastic with every character capturing your imagination and throwing you into the film wondering what's coming next . A Disney film wouldn't be a Disney film without a bit of singing and dancing and this film has just the right amount , this coupled with the already great story leaves me to think it will become one of the Disney classics it really was brilliant.<br/><br/>I would recommend going seeing this, it put a smile on my face and my son loved it, its one of the best films I've seen for ages that we could all sit and watch together.<br/><br/>Review by The Local Explorer"
"choclate_bouy","10","35","38","25 July 2012"," Heart Warming And visually stunning!
","Tangled is a master piece from Disney.From story to animation every little thing was amazing and spectacular to watch. From past few years Disney was was struggling,but i think they have recovered by making this Oscar deserving animation.It's a family entertainment with a very strong story line and the execution was just perfect.Hat's off to the director and the writer and i expect more from Disney now that they will make such masterpieces again.This is probably the prettiest computer animated movie I've seen.Tangled had everything, and much more. The only way to truly experience this spectacular viewing is to see it for yourself! It spoke volumes to me, and on so many different levels! Rating 10/10 :D .A must watch :)"
"maestro-20","9","210","250","25 November 2010"," Disney's back with their fairytale
","I was apprehensive, to say the least, when I went to see Tangled, after the disappointment that was Princess and the Frog. First, Disney's back with CGI animation, which hasn't really worked that great except, maybe to some extent, Bolt. Second, the trailers made it look really slapstick -- I'm rather wary of today's animation features that try too hard to be hip and fast-paced and silly.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, there were slapstick and broad humor sure to make little kiddos laugh. But I was surprised by the sophistication as well. The screwball comedy between the hero and heroine is very well done; adults can appreciate that. The sidekicks, in particular the Max and Pascal, are hilarious. The hero and heroine are very likable and not flat. And there's a sense of sadness/wistfulness throughout the whole show that the adults will understand.<br/><br/>But what really is great is the animation. This is Pixar-worthy great. In fact, after a while I forgot it was CGI (which tends to be a bit stiff and crude when it comes to character animation). The human characters have that hand-drawn quality even though they're CG. In fact, they're more expressive than the hand-drawn characters in Princess and the Frog. The backgrounds are gorgeous (I can count every blade of grass). And there's an iconic scene where the kingdom rouses from darkness to light with thousands of floating lanterns -- it really is magical. It reminds me of classics such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty.<br/><br/>Best of all, the movie is not just all laughs and slapstick. It has heart too. Even the minor characters such as the King and Queen -- you can feel the emotions. And the romance is believable and not cheesy.<br/><br/>Like I said, I was very pleasantly surprised. It's something that is worthy of Pixar, and I'm glad to see Disney back on their game. While Princess and the Frog was a missed opportunity, Tangled is almost perfect."
"pat_nasi_buzz","10","34","37","12 January 2012"," Tangled
","Taking place in a land far, far away, Tangled tells us about an evil witch named Gothel. By consuming a special flower, she was able to live forever. One day, the queen who ruled that land couldn't give birth, so she needed a special flower in order to have a baby. The king ordered his servants to trace the location of the flower, and gave it to his wife. In short, the baby was successfully born, but Gothel got angry and decided to take revenge, so she kidnapped the baby, aiming for her magic hair which she could use for eternal life. Rapunzel, the baby, grew up with her fake mother's (Gothel) lies, telling her that outside the tower was full of dangerous things. There was a handsome thief who managed to steal the Princess' tiara. He hid in Rapunzel's tower and then they met for the very first time. Mother Gothel tried to separate them but she failed. And the two of them finally saw the floating lantern, which was her biggest dream ever.<br/><br/>Rapunzel is in an active yet wishy-washy girl, but she has a good heart. The thief, Flynn, is a handsome, playboy, and attractive guy. Mother Gothel is an antagonist. She loves Rapunzel, but is too obsessed with her hair.<br/><br/>At first Rapunzel and Flynn didn't a smooth conversation and they didn't trust each other. As time went by, they fell in love. The conversations encourage for the viewers to support their dreams.<br/><br/>The moral of this story is if we a have a dream, we have to make an effort and attempt to achieve it and never give up.<br/><br/>Despite knowing the fact that it's a movie with an happy ending, we still watched it and we enjoyed it because of the excellent animation, good songs, and last but not least, because of Rapunzel herself is very entertaining; the long hair itself attracts us."
"Ian_Po24","10","184","219","26 November 2010"," Awe-Inspiring!
","Not often does a movie bring tears in my eye, and this one truly turned on the waterworks. Maybe because I am going through my own hard times, or because I had just read a throughly heartbreaking the night before, but regardless, Tangled currently stands as one of the greatest animated films I have ever seen. <br/><br/>To put it in a few words, Tangled had everything, and much more. The only way to truly experience this spectacular viewing is to see it for yourself! It spoke volumes to me, and on so many different levels! <br/><br/>As a 19 year old male, the typical blood and guts, Saving Private Ryan movie goer, I went into the theater expecting to be bored out of my mind. Truth me told, I was not ecstatic during some of the singing scenes, but I was throughly amazed by almost every other scene in this film. It reminds me greatly of Enchanted, or even The Princess Bride. Romantic love stories, with quite a struggle, and great humor! <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to everyone, young and old! You have not lived until this movie can touch your heart, as it has mine. I look forward to seeing this amazing movie again, hopefully in theaters before I buy it as soon as it becomes available on DVD, where I can watch it over and over!"

Perhaps I my self simply have a natural predilection toward parental defiance or maybe its just any work John Lasseter touches turns to pure gold.<br/><br/>Every person I know who has seen this work of art was completely blown away and I salute everyone online for their in-kind expressions.<br/><br/>I am a bit disappointed in the ""so called"" professional film critics as they dare to call this film anything but pure awe inspiring magic, but they shall have their own table reserved in the internet café of hell to express that inspiration lacking torture they receive.<br/><br/>Best wishes my fellow film lovers, May the magic on the screen inspire you to great things"

A clumsy nod to Disney tradition.<br/><br/>The music often feels equally stilted.<br/><br/>In stark contrast to some surprisingly polished and intricate action sequences.<br/><br/>The romance provides heartwarming and heartwrenching moments.<br/><br/>The cast is superb.

"TheLittleSongbird","10","32","35","30 January 2011"," Disney's best film in a long time!
","I am a huge Disney and animation fan, and was really interested in seeing Tangled. For me Disney have so many classics under their wing, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Bambi, Pinocchio, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin especially. For over a decade, the past Disney films ranged from very enjoyable(Emperor's New Groove) to truly disappointing(Chicken Little)- The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Tarzan were the last ones to truly blow me away- until now.<br/><br/>While Tangled had me interested, I didn't like how the film was advertised. The trailer looked as though the film would be a Dreamworks knock-off, and I didn't think much of the title either. I needn't have worried, Tangled was wonderful and Disney's best film in a while(I know I said that about last year's Princess and the Frog, yes I actually liked that too, but after seeing Tangled I've changed my mind). The film is so much better than its advertising suggested, it is not a knock-off of Dreamworks and more importantly it not only has the Disney magic but it has something for both kids and adults.<br/><br/>What wowed me immediately about Tangled was the animation. It is simply gorgeous. The colours look beautiful, the backgrounds are stunning especially that surrounding Rapunzel's tower and the characters are very well modelled. The real revelations are with Rapunzel's hair, which is a masterstroke and also the floating lanterns, a scene of true beauty and very touching. Alan Menken's music was a surprise and in a good way. For me, this was his best score since The Hunchback of Notre Dame(that score is amazing), I was especially taken with the Kingdom Dance.<br/><br/>The songs are also not bad at all, they are not quite instant classics like Colours of the Wind, Beauty and the Beast, When You Wish Upon a Star, Heigh Ho, Part of Your World, Circle of Life, Hellfire, Under the Sea, Whole New World and Bells of Notre Dame are, but they are listenable with beautiful melodies and surprisingly decent lyrics. The best for me were the stunning I See the Light and the goosebump-inducing Mother Knows Best.<br/><br/>The writing is another strong asset. Tangled has some truly excellent writing, particularly with Flynn and Rapunzel, it is funny, witty and even touching. The storytelling is polished and is snappily paced, with the action sequences lively and the ending fitting well with the rest of the movie. When I saw the trailer I was expecting a story scattered with pop-culture references and almost laughter-free dialogue, but actually the storytelling does have a classic feel to it and some scenes like the aforementioned floating lanterns give the film its magic.<br/><br/>I also loved Tangled's characters. Rapunzel is one sassy heroine and is also someone young girls in particular can relate to. Flynn is a charming, dashing and charismatic hero too, and his interaction with Rapunzel alone gives Tangled its spark. Mother Gothel is another strong character, in her character you can see shades of both Lady Tremaine and Frollo, and on top of that she is a very intriguing villainess. Even more surprising were the comic relief characters. There have been animated films/Disney films where the comedy either works like a glove(Emperor's New Groove), is either hit or miss(I say this with a heavy heart, Hunchback of Notre Dame) or doesn't work at all(Chicken Little). Here the comedy works perfectly, hilarious without being too over-the-top. Pascal is both hilarious and cute and Maximus the horse is a sheer delight in everything he does.<br/><br/>The voice acting also adds a lot to the film. Mandy Moore is a perfect choice for Rapunzel, she has a pleasant speaking voice and a beautiful singing voice. I loved the charisma Zachary Levi brings to Flynn, his voice is one of the main reasons why Flynn is as likable as he is, while Donna Murphy is perfect as Mother Gothel.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this was a wonderful film and I recommend it heartily for both kids and adults. For Disney fans too, I think you will be delighted, if you want humour, adventure, beautiful animation, good music, classic storytelling, witty scripting and likable characters, Tangled is a perfect match. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"guzmandelia56","10","30","33","10 January 2011"," Disney's return to greatness...
","In the course of the last decade Disney had suffered a severe decline in quality. They lost that heart, magic and soul that once made them the rulers of animation. Move to 2008 and Bolt brought a ray of hope. Then in 2009 The princess and the frog marked their return to fairy tales. Enter 2010 with Tangled a fantastic movie that has all the elements to be a classic and a great movie for years to come. The story is very simple yet the movie never loses it pace. The animation is gorgeous and the music may not be epic but is everything you can expect from Alan Menken. In overall a great movie worthy of all the attention it can get. Lets hope that Disney continues this way."
"jns1014-1","10","128","154","22 November 2010"," great movie for entire family - a MUST SEE!!
","We took our two kids (4 and 6)to see a preview of this days before the official release. In short, it was one of the best Disney films yet. Everyone simply loved it. The 3-D effects were noticeable and wonderful. We got a kick watching our 4-year-old raise his hands as if to catch some of the action float off the screen. There were tears, and much laughter, as is Disney's style. The story of Rapunzel is very well told here, with great villains, heroes and wonderfully entertaining scene-stealers, like the non-verbal horse, Maximus. The music is very theatrical and very typical of the usual Alan Menken genius (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Little Mermaid, etc.). This movie is very entertaining for adults, and the kids will absolutely go crazy for it! Treat your family this season to a great movie! You won't be disappointed."

Walt Disney himself even tried to create a compelling story for the story Rapunzel but it never took off (Similar to the little mermaid)<br/><br/>And many years later the Disney company decided to take it of the shelf and give it another go. And they succeeded.<br/><br/>Rapunzel is a smart, artistic and Naive girl who is locked up in the tower all her her life. Always wondering when will her life Begin..... Turning 18 she dreams to see the ""Stars"" that appear every year on her birthday. But her Mother, Gothel refuses to let her go outside for Rapunzel's Safety. Stuck in the tower Rapunzel still wonders what life is like out there.<br/><br/>But through lucky circumstances a charming thief wonders into her tower. Surprised, Rapunzel seizes this chance with him and makes a deal for him to take her to see the Stars.<br/><br/>And so she and Pascal flies out of her tower to explore the new world around her. <br/><br/>There are no pop culture references and is not bound to the laws of reality. (Such as people questioning about the weight of her hair....)<br/><br/>People always compare the music to Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Little Mermaid. The music might not be as memorable. But it is still beautiful music and Alan Menken (Who did A lot of the Disney renaissance music) Did a Great job for it. It helps to set the mood.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful! Excellent detail, fluent movement of the characters (Maximus especially and the massive effort to do Rapunzel's Hair).<br/><br/>The villain Mother Gothel might be just a villain but she is more complicated than any other Disney villain. In the film you can question if she loves Rapunzel as an Object or as a real daughter.<br/><br/>Rapunzel in other hand is a great female heroin. Loving her mother so....and does what she says. But eventually explores outside of her tower and when she finds the truth she does not take it lightly. In the film she's the one calling the shots, not the male protagonist. <br/><br/>The story was great and you can connect with the characters. (But I think the climax should have a bit more action in it) The story is Disney Generic but that's why we love it.....<br/><br/>If Tangled is successful enough they might combat the story of ""The Snow Queen"""
"neonboy619","10","45","52","26 November 2010"," A True Return to Disney Classics
","Tangled continues in Disney's animation legacy of timeless classics. Being Disney's first fairy tale outing done in CGI, it's easy to have doubts. The marketing for this film didn't really do Tangled any favors either. Originally titled Rapunzel, the name change to Tangled and the shift of focus onto the male co-star Flynn Ryder in the merchandising was done as a way to try to get more boys into the theater. Despite this faulty marketing move, Tangled is very much Rapunzel's story and Rapunzel is the star of this instant classic. Sticking very close to the roots of the original German Rapunzel fairy tale, Tangled's story is one about overprotective parental figures and the need to want to break free. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel and sings for her. Yup, this a musical. This is a big grand musical in the classical Disney style with songs by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater. Alan Menken was the one who brought Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Enchanted to life; to name only a few. Moore really gets to the heart of Rapunzel and truly owns the part, but the real surprise is Donna Murphy as our main villain Mother Gothel. A true hero is measured by it's main villain and Mother Gothel does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Every great Disney classics needs supporting characters. What would Mary Poppins be with Bert and the Banks' Children. What would Belle be without the enchanted objects. Snow White is just a lost girl in the forest without those dwarfs.<br/><br/>An amazing supporting cast of characters that include Rapunzel's color changing chameleon companion Pascal, the scene stealing horse Maximus, and the main male co-star Flynn Ride accompany Rapunzel in her quest. Pascal and Maximus are animal companions but have more in common with Meeko and Percy from Pocohantas than Sebastian and Flounder from Little Mermaid for the fact that they don't talk. While they are without speech, they are fully fleshed out characters and you know exactly what they are trying to convey with their sometimes hilarious reactions. Maximus was especially a personal favorite of mine. Zachary Levi from the TV show Chuck voices and sings for Flynn Rider and it's easy to see why Disney would choose to up sale him in the TV ads. I would have to say that he's one of the most fleshed out Disney heroes since Aladdin. <br/><br/>Tangled is a big grand epic Disney musical done in the classic sense with the modern rendering of CGI animation. This is for sure to be seen for years and years to come and I can't wait to include Tangled in my Disney Collection. I highly recommend this one.<br/><br/>http://neonboy619.blogspot.com"
"iloveUGA123","10","32","36","11 January 2012"," Disney's princess movies are back!!
","I absolutely loved this movie!! Disney originally tried making another princess movie a few years ago, Princess and the Frog. That movie was not good at all!! Disney is known for their amazing princess movies, and that was not one of them, and I have know idea what happened with that movie! Now that Disney has made this movie, they are back on top with their incredible princess movies!! The music was wonderful, and the movie was a little different from their usual princess movies. This one was funner and more modern, but they still had the whole princess feel to it, which is what Disney is known for! Disney's other movies, that don't have music, and aren't a princess movie that have been coming out over the years are good too. They just haven't made a princess movie like this one since The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. I would definitely watching this movie, no matter what age! Especially if you grew up watching their princess movie, I absolutely know that you will love this movie!"
"gonewithscarlett","10","145","179","25 November 2010"," Tangled has that Disney magic!
","I saw Tangled yesterday in 3D, and let me just say, I'm glad I did. When I entered the theater and saw a HUGE line, I immediately noticed that every person in the line was under the age of nine. Now, while I was a little embarrassed, I was still too excited to see the movie to care that much. Tangled's heroine, Rapunzel, is a typical Disney princess. When I say that, I don't mean like Cinderella or Snow White, waiting for her prince to come and get her. I mean like Ariel, Belle, or Jasmine. She's curious about the world, headstrong, passionate, beautiful, and, of course, sweet and kind. Oh, and she's a girl that knows what she wants--to see a spectacular light show in person. But Rapunzel is stuck up in her tower with her mother, Gothel. Now, as the movie shows us, Rapunzel doesn't mind the tower all that much. She really loves Gothel, and she's kind of scared of the world outside. All she wants to do is see thousands of lanterns lit and launched into the sky, which she watches from her window every year on her birthday. This seems like a pretty reasonable request to me. But Gothel doesn't want her daughter to leave the tower for her own selfish, vain reasons (that you have to watch the movie to find out about). So poor, lonely Rapunzel seems doomed to spend the rest of her life trapped in a tower, watching and waiting for someone to come along and save her. And someone does come along! The swashbuckling thief, Flynn Rider, steals a crown and runs for cover before the palace guards can arrest him. He just happens to end up in the secluded spot of the forest that Rapunzel's tower is in. He gets one glance of her hair, then is knocked out with a frying pan and shoved in a closet. After coming to, Rapunzel bargains with her prisoner. She'll give him back the crown if he guides her to the lanterns, then takes her home. Flynn agrees. The music in this film isn't quite up to par with Disney's best (Circle of Life, Part of Your World, etc.), but since it was written by Alan Menken, it's definitely good enough to get into your head--and stay there. The song ""When Will My Life Begin"", sung by Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, is my personal favorite. The pop/country style is modern but fits the story, and the tune is catchy. The other songs are ""Mother Knows Best"", ""I've Got a Dream"", and ""I See the Light"". While Rapunzel and Flynn Rider are great characters, I have to say that a certain Maximus the horse stole the show for me. The speechless character's facial expressions and quirky mannerisms are hilarious. He seems to hate Flynn, but he later proves how lovable and loyal he really is. Pasqual the chameleon also provides some comic relief, but the one to look for is a short, drunk old man wearing only a diaper and wings. He has very limited screen time, but he always says something hilarious. I saw this film in 3D, which, although beautiful, probably wasn't a very different experience than it was in 2D, except for one scene towards the end, when Rapunzel and Flynn are surrounded by thousands of glowing lanterns. It was breathtaking. I rate Tangled a 9.5/10. It's creative, visually astounding, and possesses that Walt Disney magic that is so hard to find lately. But don't just take my word for it. Spend the money—you won't regret it. <br/><br/>P.S. I originally wrote this review on my new blog (througharabbithole.blogspot.com), so I'd love if you'd check it out! This is my only post so far, but more will come."
"rubitony2002","10","26","29","27 December 2010"," The greatest movie ever, but only for Kids from 1 to 100 years old, others look elsewhere.
","I had read the reviews about this movie and so took my 8 year old daughter to see it this evening. Just left the movie theater about 45 minutes ago. Here I am writing my first ever review. I just had to let everyone know how great this movie is. The 3D affects were great. Don't want to spoil it for you but this movie is wonderful in every respect. It kept my undivided attention from start to finish. It made me laugh like I haven't laughed in a long time. This movie is funny, sad, exciting, interesting and many other things I can't describe. I would recommend it to any one. I am 59 years old and really enjoyed it. You won't regret it."
"wovendesires","10","41","48","26 November 2010"," Two words: Simply Amazing
","First let me say that I am not usually the one who give reviews to movies, but this one I felt was necessary. When I went to see Disney's Tangled, I really wasn't expecting much. The previews I saw hadn't appealed to me enough, but a group of friends went to see it and I was dragged there. To put it in simple terms, it was amazing! Not only were the characters believable, but the relationships between them were as well, especially between the hero, heroine and villain. The design was very detailed and beautiful; I personally loved the scene with the lights -if you've seen it, you know what I mean. As for the score, I feel it went back to the classics like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""; the songs were very much like the movies when I was growing up, when Disney was the number one choice for kids. Although in my opinion, Tangled didn't manage to bring a song as memorable as key songs like ""Part of your world"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"", I can't take the ""Healing Song"" out of my mind.<br/><br/>All in all, I believe it was a wonderful movie. It felt like Disney from the good old days. I guess it's a farewell note to all of us who grew up with Disney as they head out of the 'Princess era' and bring forth their new 'boy-oriented' movies. In all true honesty, even though I'm a 25 year old male, I am one who loves the classics, and don't find any interest in movies like the ""Mars needs Moms"" that was announced before the movie started. It's movies like these that made Disney so popular, and even though I understand why they decided to make this change, I feel that what Disney should focus on is bringing more movies like Tangled: with enough story, great characters, a pinch of heart and a general feeling of hope that makes Disney what it has always been: a place for kids to hope and dream."

","I absolutely, totally, and completely loved this movie! This is the best movie since The Lion King! As soon as you watch it, you might as well buy the DVD because you will be wanting to watch it over and over and over again. It's the classical tale of Rapunzel with a twist that is endearing and wonderful. You will be smiling and laughing through the whole thing and maybe even crying. It's a heart warming movie that will have your whole family sucked in from beginning to end. It is for all ages and all ages should see it. It will instantly become one of your favorite Disney movies, if not one of your favorite movies period. I have yet to meet someone who didn't like it. If you are looking for a movie your whole family can watch and cheer you up, this is definitely the film to watch!"
"mattyschreck","10","20","22","29 January 2011"," The new Pixar influence makes this movie fantastic!
","Yes, this is a ""typical"" Disney movie, with singing heroes (and heroines) and villains, saucer-size-eyed characters, cutesy animal companions, and a coming-of-age plot. However, it's also a Pixar movie (genius John Lasseter was Executive Producer) meaning that it is hilarious in most scenes, heart-stoppingly beautiful in the visuals, wittier than 95% of all the other movies out there, and definitely something that can be loved and enjoyed by both little kids and their parents. The plot really has nothing to do with Rapunzel, apart from a woman being imprisoned in a tower, who has (very) long hair. The story Disney has come up with is probably one of the most beautiful they have ever crafted. A princess is abducted by an evil witch while she is still a baby, and grows up completely sheltered by the witch, who needs her magical hair to stay young. Every year on the princess' birthday, the distraught king and queen let beautiful lanterns rise to show her the way home. Of course, the princess, now almost 18, has no idea what they mean but knows that they are important, and wants to see them from up close. A young thief who stumbles upon the tower is just the right companion for her to get out, and from there the plot develops with never-before-seen speed in a Disney movie: just like we are used from Pixar. I don't have kids, but I loved watching this movie in a cinema that was filled with them - as soon as the adorable animal companions (a horse that acts like a dog, and a chameleon very much the same as the cockroach in Wall-E) fell over, the kids were screaming with laughter. And then they would make one of those cleverly animated faces that only adults can understand, and I had to laugh. There are other scenes that will forever stick in my memory: how Rapunzel transforms a tavern full of evil ruffians into a singing mob of people who follow their dreams, how the use of a frying pan in one small scuffle becomes the weapon of choice for a whole kingdom, and more than anything else, when the lanterns are being lit and released into the night sky. I'm a 33-year-old male, but I have to say: that brought tears into my eyes, it was that beautiful and moving.<br/><br/>I don't really understand why this movie hasn't received more attention. I used to be a very strong Disney fan until the company became weird (Pocahontas and later), but having watched Tangled, I can honestly say that this is easily the wittiest, fastest, and possibly even most beautiful Disney film I have ever seen."
"lvilaguillen","10","20","22","14 January 2011"," One word... Disney!
","One word came to my mind when I saw this magnificent work of art: Disney. Then I just knew how was it gonna be... what a beautiful movie! what a great characters! As many of you I'm gonna sound repetitive but... it surely worths it... Disney's classics are back. And there's no Pixar in here... no mates, that was all Disney! What we have here is a real Disney Princess (not like that sad intend to go back in time with The Princess and The Frog), a real one. With a dream, with a lovely voice, and no boundaries! Who wants to go beyond and beyond... and what is most important... she takes us with her! I felt there inside from the very beginning until the end. And of course without adding the fact that there's unexpected parts: no one can say that the end (you know what I mean, not to spoiler you) was expected... TOTALLY AWESOME! (when I've got here in fact I felt like you all were reading my mind!!! All of us where in the same theater, in front of the same screen the whole movie). My speech is intended to transmit all my passion! Would you mind reading?"
"mmmincr","10","36","42","27 November 2010"," Disney at it's best!
","Ever since I saw the previews for this movie, I've been dying to see it. But after having viewed it, it far exceeded my expectations! The characters were completely lovable, especially the chameleon (Pascal) and horse (Maximus), they provided laughs throughout the whole movie, the evil characters were also developed very well. The animation was breathtaking, especially of Rapunzel's hair as well as the lanterns released into the sky (It was absolutely gorgeous!!). I have read other reviews saying that the songs were not so great, but I found them very entertaining. In this movie, the songs do not take such a huge role as in other Disney movies, but they are nevertheless very catchy and well done (I still have them stuck in my head). I would recommend this movie to everyone (all ages), I was in the theater with toddlers who were entertained the whole time, and I even brought along my mom who is in her 50's and she loved it! There is never a dull moment, and you'll find yourself laughing the whole 90 minutes. The romance of Flynn and Rapunzel seems utterly real, due to the wonderful animation and the talented voice actors. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the fact that I can't have a cute little chameleon like Pascal for myself!"
"Blueghost","Null","103","129","24 November 2010"," Excellent family entertainment.
","A few days ago I saw ""Megamind"", and thought it was just okay. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I didn't think it too spectacular. My faith in CGI entertainment was on the wane.<br/><br/>Well, tonight Disney pulled me from that depression, and help reinvigorate my belief in, well, just plain Disney.<br/><br/>What we have here is Rapuntzel turned on her head, with a dash of ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" stirred in to keep our interest.<br/><br/>The film was charming, clever and witty without being too much of either. The comic timing was toned down for the young kiddies in the audience, mostly little girls and some younger boys, but the comedic aspect itself did not lose luster for this. If anything it showed just what good clever comedy was. Note Rapuntzel's improvised weapon, and how she brings it to bear on the baddies in the local tavern. Classic character sketch comedy, and I don't care if I was the only one who noticed it and was laughing. You're supposed to laugh!<br/><br/>The story itself regards fleeing the nest from a ""Mime"" like character, whose interest in our heroine is less than altruistic. The dashing rogue comes in to ground the story and keep Mandy Moore's character from running amuck and falling into despair.<br/><br/>All in all, even though a middle aged dude like myself is no where near the target audience, I enjoyed it immensely. <br/><br/>Some criticisms; the villainess seemed marginally cliché. She had the liberated 70s woman gone bad thing going on for her, but it almost seems like we may have seen this character before. Not sure, really. The horse was extremely likable, but his rider could have played more of a role. In fact the supporting cast almost seemed as if they were denied screen time so we could revel in Rapuntzel's golden locks. For all that, and even though the action did dive into classic Warner Brother's cartoon territory, ""Tangled"" does make a very respectable showing.<br/><br/>That, and it was good to hear the voice of Richard Kiel play a big galoot who turns out to be a good guy. :)<br/><br/>My final note is that there was a very good message for young girls at the end, and in fact anyone with some sense will have caught on to it. It's a message that won't last too long, but hopefully will serve as a reminder to those who paid attention. Remember, hair isn't everything. Regardless of color *wink*<br/><br/>Take the family, but, if you're the father, then please, PLEASE, do not spend countless minutes like the idiot in front of me paying for his four member family with several credit cards while the ticket taker next to him managed to whiz through four or five parties of several members each for the 7:20 showing at the Redwood City theatre on Theatre Row.<br/><br/>Yeah, if you're reading this, you know who you are. Stop being a putz!<br/><br/>Everyone else, go see and enjoy the film :)"

","The first time I watched it, I thought that it was just another Disney cartoon. However, just like many other films (unless it's outright lame and boring), I gave it a benefit of doubt by watching a second time and somehow my impression of the movie improved. And after watching it for the third and fourth time, I realized that I had actually missed out so much on what this movie has to offer.<br/><br/>On the surface, it may look like another fairytale with a twist in it. But open your hearts and put yourselves in the shoes of the characters, and you'll see a whole new perspective.<br/><br/>Plot: A beautiful story of a going-to-be-18-year-old bright and cheerful girl (just like the sun), who has never met a soul and has never been out of the tower before, and yet still dreams and hopes that she could someday realize her dreams while watching the lanterns in the sky on her birthday every year. 10/10 Characters: Rapunzel and Eugene are a perfect match and Pascal and Maximus are also their unbelievably compatible 'sidekicks'. 9/10 Visual: It is recommended to watch this in as high definition as possible and if you can watch it in 3D, please do so. Best part (and probably highlight of the whole movie): the scene where the lanterns were released and both Rapunzel and Eugene(Rider) are in the boat. 10/10 A movie not to be missed no matter what age (unless you hate fairy tales)."

My six year old sisters love the movie, but me and my twenty year old friends absolutely adore it. Tangled is the perfect blend of modern movies and the old princess features that we all know and love. It has something to offer to everyone. The care that went into making this movie is also greatly appreciated. The trailer threw me off at first, and I still believe that the trailer was Disney's biggest mistake. In the effort to appeal to younger audiences, it made the film look cheap and thrown together. I assure you, this is not the case.

"MartinHafer","10","24","27","29 December 2010"," wonderful...
","I was frankly quite amazed by this film. After all, last year Pixar brought us ""Up"" and this year Dreamworks brought us ""How to Train Your Dragon""—there was no way that anyone could produce a CGI film that is every bit as good, could they?! Yet, surprisingly, I adored ""Tangled"" and enjoyed it just as much as these other films—showing that we are in a period of time when amazingly wonderful computer animation has become the norm.<br/><br/>""Tangled"" is wonderful for two main reasons. Foremost, the animation style is so new and vibrant—and looks so much unlike all the other recent CG I films. I read that Disney deliberately tried to create a computer-generated film that looked a lot like a traditionally animated film—and the exquisitely rendered backgrounds attest to the fact that they achieved this goaland more. The other reason I adored it was because the film had a magnificent sense of humor—making a very simple story much, much more enjoyable. The animal friends (the horse and chameleon) were terrific and the film had me laughing repeatedly—particularly with its surprisingly adorable barbarian hoard (who, incidentally, remind me a lot of the Capital One commercials' Vikings). The final reason I loved the film, though it's not as prominent as the other two reasons, is the wonderful love story. The final scene of self-sacrifice by the male hero is touching—and set my tear ducts flowing.<br/><br/>By the way, it turns out the only thing about the film I did NOT love (the similarity of the ending to that of Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"") was NOT the fault of bad writing—it's actually one of the few aspects of the that is from the original fairy tale! This tidbit comes from my amazing older daughter who is a folklore major.<br/><br/>The bottom line—watch this film! You'll be glad you did—and it's much better than it appears to be based on the TV commercials and previews."

Not only does it have cute moments I'm sure the girls will notice but it will also have both kids, teens and even adults of either gender going into giggle fits, and I say this from experience.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something to watch with your family, friends or even with your partner, this is the perfect thing to watch to get a smile on your faces.<br/><br/>I absolutely recommend watching this.

This was such a well put together story by the team of Nathan Greyo and Byron Howard, the same team who brought us another goody from Disney ""Bolt "" They seem to like revolving their stories about young girls who dream of being either stars or princesses. This time they take on the old fairy tale classic Rapunzel with of coarse putting their very own twist on the tale. Disney movies used to turn me off as i just couldn't get by the musical numbers that usually accompanied them however I thank the TV show 'Glee' for turning my taste patterns around, it's not such a bad thing. Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore ) has been held captive due to her long magical locks of hair, in a tower, now a teenager she spends the days trying to keep herself busy amidst her tight surroundings by dreaming of stars and playing with her only friend in life a small chameleon. When a chance and surprising visit from a fleeing thief who only scaled the tower to avoid be captured by the royal guards barges into her life changing it for all the good.

To be honest, as much as it's disturbing, i found her very sexy and i wonder if her genes aren't not rated (look for a C. S.). But, looks don't make soul and her personality is as well very engaging: she dreams, she smiles and she cares! <br/><br/>I don't know the original fairy tale but i really appreciate the lessons of rebellion and emancipation depicted here: As teens, we are torn between fear of parents and joy of disobeying and the solution is to learn how to say ""no"" to our parents. Here, those moments are showed with wisdom and talent.<br/><br/>Finally, my niece was happy because she was lifted by this beautiful pink princess (almost a sister for her) while my nephew got bored because the movie was lacking action and fights! In a decade, i am sure he will change his opinion!"

","I'll never get this magic stuff. If you put a magic flower under a basket, won't it die from lack of light? And if you use it to save the queen in childbirth, why will the baby have magic powers? And why her hair? That's why I flunked out of Hogwarts. But what a fun film. Rapunzel is not just beautiful, she's seriously cute. And unlike the saintly Snow White and Cinderella, she's got a marvelous streak of spitfire in her. There's hilarious slapstick and barbed dialog. The villainess is classic Disney wicked stepmother, smarmy and selfish, whose physical beauty only serves to accentuate the evil within. She meets a most satisfying demise. The lighting of the lanterns, Rapunzel's whole motivation for leaving her tower, is breathtakingly beautiful. And on a technical note, this film got a writeup in Scientific American for advancing the frontiers of animation. Previously, extremely complicated motions of hair or clothing became rigid because the algorithms couldn't handle the complexity. The animators solved that problem. Also, a flood scene is the most lifelike CGI water I've ever seen. My only complaint, which made me consider giving the movie a 9, is that wicked stepmom has a couple of tedious musical numbers that the film could have omitted with no loss."

She strikes a bargain with Flynn, Rapunzel has hidden his stolen goods, and tells him that if he takes her to see a mysterious lights in the sky, Flynn agrees to it, but the question is will they get there?<br/><br/>The most fun animation since Shrek and Toy Story.

","I used IMDb for a long time to find out good movies and read reviews. For these many years I just didn't want to register an account to say anything. But today I did. I registered an account for myself, because... I watched Tangled in the past weekend. I just wanna log on and tell everybody: This is the best animated movie in the past 10 years! Tangled made my entire weekend. Tangle is simply beautiful and touching...My eyes were full of tears a couple of times. I feel like I find back the emotions when I was around 10 and finished watching a Disney movie... Now I am almost 30. The most romantic part of the movie was the princess and Rider sitting in a boat in the middle of a lake and watching the lantern show. I couldn't help but thought about this moment in my mind the entire week... Go to a theater to watch Tangled. It is worth your money."
"misterembryo","10","33","40","29 November 2010"," Belle Who? There's a New Beauty in Town.
","Rather than your ordinary Once Upon a Time, the story of Tangled starts with a voice-over from Flynn Ryder, our egotistical antihero, warning you that this is a story about how he died. This American Beauty style prologue is a clear indication that although it's a Disney movie, this story is not without the darkness of Grimm. As Disney's 50th animated feature film, Disney freaks and general moviegoers alike will be pleased to find that Tangled is worthy of the golden hallmark. It's beautifully animated, full of surprises, and really funny. I'll even go so far as to say it has the power to jerk a few tears.<br/><br/>Disney decided to go with an alternate title instead of sticking to the original Rapunzel. It works because this imaginative retelling seems to be a little more than a story about a girl with long hair. It's also a story about an old woman consumed with a fear of dying. Her name is Gothel, and she's the figure that sets all the action in motion by kidnapping the baby princess at birth. She did this because she's aware of the magical properties that lay hidden in our heroine's golden locks: sing a special song to it, and you can live forever.<br/><br/>Gothel hides Rapunzel away in a tower, raises her as her own, and forbids her from seeing the light of day, urging the world is an evil place. This is creepy within itself, and among all the Disney villains, Gothel is by far one of the creepiest, reminiscent of the mom in Stephen King's Carrie, from the scary way she keeps her daughter sheltered down to the scary way she is ultimately defeated.<br/><br/>Gothel at least had the decency to provide Rapunzel with a library of books. This has kept Rapunzel occupied for all the 18 years she spent in isolation, and has made her apt at a range of activities some of us may never learn: painting, paper mache, charting stars. Still, she longs to see the world, if only to find the source of the floating lanterns: mysterious lights that fill the sky every year on the night of her birthday.<br/><br/>Flynn Ryder's not your average knight-in-shining armor. He's more like Gaston in a Han Solo costume. Poor Flynn is in enough trouble as it is, constantly hounded down for stealing a prized possession from the royal family. Aside from the palace guards, Flynn has to deal with twin goons that resemble Jason Stathem and a tenacious police horse. Next thing you know, Flynn is stuck with a teenage girl in desperate need of rebellion.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi provide the speaking and singing voices for our two protagonists, and do a phenomenal job. The voice acting is pitch perfect, just like the music composed by the legendary Academy Award-winning Alan Menken.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see Rapunzel at Disneyland, not just because she's smoking hot, but also because it'll be entertaining to see eight guards following close behind to accommodate her long head of hair. The 260 million dollar budget makes this the most expensive animated feature to date. Considering the magic it will bring to households 50 more years down the road, Tangled is worth every penny."
"judywalker2","10","146","196","24 November 2010"," What all movies should be.
","Disney is back with Tangled and they have finally found themselves again. First I have to say as much as I loved Tangled it made me sad and angry that Disney could not accomplish the same thing for The Princess and the Frog. Here was there one chance to showcase a Black princess and they missed the mark by a football field. Well so much for that.<br/><br/>Back to Tangled. The animation is more than great. The characters are well drawn and thought out, especially the true villain-the old lady. Disney movies are only as good as their villains and heroines; this movie does a great job at both while also giving you a good hero. It is funny and bright, cute and sad. Everyone should spend an afternoon with Tangled. Though the music is not the ""knock your socks off"" great it is good and goes well with the plot. 10/10"

It is not simply a ""princess movie"", or even a ""Disney princess movie"". Labeling it this way would degrade it. Tangled works on many levels, very well: fantasy, musical, comedy, and drama. And, not to mention, the animation was absolutely stunning! I watched this film three times - once in 3D - and if you want visual brilliance, please see it in 3D.<br/><br/>The animation - incredible. The characters - brilliant, even the ""main animals"" were great. The music - catchy and pleasant.

","This is the best Disney film I have seen. This film is superb on every level. The story is imaginative, well-told, beautifully constructed and perfectly paced. As is a Disney trademark, the music was beautiful, inspiring and woven magically and meaningfully into the story and dialogue. The lyrics were extremely clever and witty. The genius of Alan Menkin (music) and Glen Slater (lyrics) amaze me. When I got home, I immediately went to the internet to learn more about the voices behind Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) and Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy). Their singing were theatrical and outstanding. The voicing and acting were imaginative, moving and fit the story, the characters and the moment perfectly. What more can I say ? As expected, the animation was top notch Disney. Each scene was a spectacle. I'm not that emotional but I think my jaw dropped when I saw the lanterns being launched into the sky. That scene and the context in which it was shown actually brought tears to my eyes it was so beautiful. This is a movie that will appeal to all ages. I want to see it again and can't wait for the DVD. Go see it. You will love it."
"Whowantsliquor","10","49","63","17 November 2010"," An instant Disney classic with wonderful storytelling and music!
","I had the pleasure of seeing an advanced screening of the movie back in October, and I was not at all disappointed in any way! Don't let the trailers and marketing fool you; this movie is anything but a Shrek rip-off like the trailers would lead you to believe. The movie is a straight-up classic animated musical along the league of The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast. Not only does the film stick close to the original Rapunzel fairy tale, it also improves upon it by adding the Disney magic we all know and love, and that's gorgeous art, music and heart (and perhaps some twists in order to make the movie family-appropriate, as we wouldn't want an out-of-wedlock pregnant Disney heroine).<br/><br/>The villain in the movie (Mother Gothel) is a very devious and selfish being, and perhaps the most complex Disney villain next to Frollo. In all, I love her and I think she is very unique! The protagonist, Rapunzel, is a very welcoming addition to the Disney princesses we all know and love. Her best friend, the chameleon Pascal, is hilarious and adorable! Flynn Rider is a smug guy, but charming nonetheless. The horse Maximus steals the show in most of the scenes he's in. In all, the characters in this movie are all extremely lovable! Not to mention the amazing story, visuals, and plot. If anything, this movie would be the one that starts off the new Disney Renaissance, and I'm saying that as someone who watched and loved both Bolt and The Princess and the Frog. I'm a teenager who grew up on classic Disney movies and this film definitely deserves to be one of the five best animated Disney movies ever made!"

"aquariusgirl279","10","18","21","8 December 2010"," Easily my new favorite Disney Prince and Princess, Tangled was amazing!
","I've wanted to see Tangled since I heard about it. I must have heard about it back in July. Maybe earlier. I remember seeing the teaser trailer where it just had the voices and the tower. Rapunzel was always my favorite of the Grimm Fairy Tales. I must be the only person in the world, but back when Less Than Perfect was on, I used to watch it. That's when my love for Zachary Levi began. I always liked him. I thought he was hilarious and Kipp was easily my favorite character. So when he was cast on Chuck, I started watching that show and I'm so glad I did. It's easily one of my favorite shows and it has only made my love for Zachary Levi grow exponentially. So when I heard he was cast as the ""prince"" I was so thrilled beyond belief. I couldn't wait. I remember thinking, ""I have to wait until Thanksgiving?!"" When I saw the first trailer, I legitimately squealed with excitement. Especially because Zachary Levi's character Flynn wasn't a prince, but a handsome and arrogant thief. My favorite kind of guy! Now I've finally seen Tangled and it surpassed my already extremely high expectations. I can't believe I didn't realize it was going to have music (why else would Mandy Moore be cast?) I felt extremely silly and thought, ""Of course. This is a Disney Princess movie."" I thought the movie was phenomenal. I already had incredibly high expectations and the movie was everything I expected and more. I thought it was a very interesting and creative take on Rapunzel. I've read the actual Grimm Fairy Tale, and it's true that it barely follows it. It just basically used the idea. From the first song to the last song, I loved every minute of this highly entertaining tale. Of course Mandy Moore did her own singing and then the first song came and Zachary Levi did his own too. And you know what? He wasn't even half bad. (Just another thing that makes me love him). I wasn't extremely stunned by how amazing he was and I don't really have an ear for music or technology, but it didn't sound like his voice was edited all that much (but that's just me). You know how you hear those girls singing on Disney and it kind of sounds like a robot/computer is singing? Well, it didn't sound like that. And I know Zachary Levi's speaking voice very well (I've been watching him on TV for years) and it sure sounded like him. I was pleasantly surprised. And of course, I'm a sucker for a Disney Princess movie. Rapunzel was very tough, which I liked, kind of like Tiana from Princess and the Frog. And I liked how the romance definitely developed through their adventures. Having read the actual Grimm Fairy Tale in which the prince falls out the window after being tricked by Mother Gothel into coming in and goes blind, I had a guess as to what was going to happen to Flynn after he cut Rapunzels hair. In the original tale, Rapunzel cried on him and his eye sight was restored, leading me to believe that her tears would bring him back to life. I have to admit though, I was a bit nervous as was my friend who didn't know as much about the original tale. Anyway, I should wrap this up. The movie looked gorgeous (wouldn't expect less from Disney), the music was great, I loved the voice acting (anyone else notice Brad Garrett as the guy with the hook hand?!), I loved the storyline, I loved the new princess, I loved the new prince. I loved the new, creative look at a classic fairy (especially turning the prince into a thief; I thought that was brilliant). So if you couldn't tell, I enjoyed the movie. Quite a bit. I would recommend it to anyone. I don't have anything to say about the 3D as I saw it in 2D (3D makes me physically nauseous). But I enjoyed it so much, I've seen in twice and I might go again next week."

"valen060","10","18","21","6 December 2010"," Disney Never Ceases to Amaze Me!!
","Before I begin the review, I must say that Disney has made quite an accomplishment in making this the 50th animated movie in their history since ""Snow White"" back in 1937! What an era that was! <br/><br/>As for the movie, changing the title to ""Tangled"" from ""Rapunzel"" does indeed reach out well with its young audiences. The cast was well-selected, the animation was complex, yet brilliantly crafted, and the song arrangements felt traditional in terms of what the past Disney fairy tale-based films had done before, which captured my attention and kept me interested even more. After all, Mandy Moore did a stunning job providing the speaking and singing voice of Rapunzel herself. The song titled ""I See the Light"" was very noteworthy among them all since I felt a similar, positive feeling as I did with Aladdin's ""A Whole New World.""<br/><br/>I wasn't bored in the least on the storyline, it made me want to see more as the plot began to develop even further. At one point, I couldn't help but feel sorry for the two main characters' (Flynn and Rapunzel) inner struggles and how they really feel about one another, but that's exactly what I was hoping! <br/><br/>Growing up among Disney's most memorable canon animated films throughout its history has been something I've followed since I was born (the late 1980s). I have seen all of the previous 49 animated movies and ""Tangled"" has definitely made itself worthy to reside in its rightful place as the official #50! THIS is a must-see and I think I'll be looking forward into seeing it again and again whenever I choose!"

I went to watch a few other movies that day as well and this is the one movie that stuck out the most. It made me happy and is a great pick me up. The only criticism would be the musical numbers.

I grew up in the Disney Renaissance of the late 80s and early 90s and this is the first movie if have seen since the Fabulous Four that makes me believe Disney still has a place in the film business. <br/><br/>The only down side is the soundtrack. I love Alan Menken-the first play I ever saw as 6 year old was ""Little Shop of Horror"" and the first movie I saw in theaters as two year old was ""The Little Mermaid."" I had high hopes for the soundtrack but there was not another ""Under the Sea"" in the score. <br/><br/>Disney fans and connoisseurs will tell you before a robot brought humans back to earth, before some toys came to life, before a lion became a king, before Aladin unleashed the Genie and before Beauty tamed the Beast there was a Little Mermaid who single-handedly saved the Disney animation studio. I hope in the future we will be saying the same thing about a blonde-haired girl who spent most of her life locked in a tower!<br/><br/>I know this is not really a good review, but for all you Disney skeptics that feel let down from the Princess and the Frog and Meet the Robinsons-this is worth your time!"

","As the father of young girls, I get to see more than my fair share of animated movies and am used to them falling into one of two categories - either quite entertaining and well put together or excruciatingly bad. I can now a third category - brilliant.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful piece of film-making, let alone animation. The story has superb pace, a strong narrative and genuinely engaging characters. It's funny, touching and gripping - and it looks wonderful too.<br/><br/>Of course it has the usual stock Disney characters (feisty, independent princess, cheeky animal sidekick, comedy villains, evil mother figure etc) - but, here's the twist: they actually pull it off this time - the funny characters are funny, the leading man is charming, the princess is hugely likable.<br/><br/>I know Toy Story 3 will win the Oscar - but I'm amazed this hasn't been nominated. TS3 fell into my first category for me (entertaining and well made) but was essentially a rehash of the themes from TS2 and was neither original nor any better than its predecessors. Tangled is simply a better film on almost every level.<br/><br/>Tangled is the first animated film I've seen since Spirited Away where I came out the cinema thinking I'd seen a great film, not just an entertaining one."

","I first saw Tangled in theaters when it came out, and I absolutely loved it! I especially loved the cleverness of Flynn, and the comical jokes he brought to the film. The animation is wonderful too, and it was unlike anything I'd ever seen. One of the high points of the movie for me, though, was the songs. I truly loved all of them, especially ""I See the Light."" In my opinion, it is underrated though, and I personally think it's better than ""Let it Go."" Unfortunately, I feel like Tangled is underrated. I've seen Frozen, which is all everyone ever talks about, and I thought it was good. But now that I've put more thought into it, I feel that Tangled is much better. There are some plot holes in Frozen, with unexplained parts, but Tangled really covers everything, and I laugh at all the jokes every time! All in all, there is some breath-taking animation on display, and the actors brought the characters to life. I enjoy watching this movie every once in a while, as it brings smiles and tears to me!"

","About two minutes into the 3D version of this film, I turned to my friend and said, ""this is AMAZING."" And it really is. The depth of color and the quality of the details are simply stunning. But the beauty of the animation wasn't the only good thing about the movie, just the most obvious. The storytelling was fantastic and fast-paced, weaving an age- old fairytale with a modern reinterpretation of surrounding events. What really makes the film, as far as the characters go, though, is the personalities that Disney assigns to the animals involved. None of these animals ever utters a word, yet they easily steal the show with their clear human emotions and comedic timing. This is definitely a film I recommend, even if you don't have children."

So myself and a group of friends all decided to go indulge in some fun.<br/><br/>Now we are all 16 and probably should know better but we waltzed into that cinema unashamed as parents piled in with their children. The film had us mesmerised. From the start we were aww-ing, aah-ing and laughing. It seemed we were the only one's enjoying the full experience, which actually disappointed me, as no one else seemed to be openly touched by the film.<br/><br/>I am sure the whole audience did enjoy it, however, maybe we were more vocal. <br/><br/>The astoundingly intricate characters were beautifully voiced and animated. Even some of our favourites, Pascal and Maximus, who couldn't speak were just amazingly animated to such a degree that it was crystal clear what they were thinking. They had our row howling with laughter as did the mischievous Flynn Rider who i loved for his rogue-ish quirk and hysterical relationship with Rapunzel, our heroine, who could also hold her own very well. I don't want to spoil anything but her choice of weapon in danger is somewhat pure comic genius and is carried throughout the film.( If you have seen the film you will know what i mean. ;p)<br/><br/>The CGI effects of this film were fantastic and as is mentioned often; the lantern scene had us a bit misty eyed. There was a closeness we obviously felt to the characters that is also aided by our love of Disney classics.<br/><br/>All in all if you haven't seen this film yet i demand you do because it is worth every penny and is simply a most beautiful film with a beautiful story and characters. Don't be afraid to laugh and cry it shows enjoyment! I could praise it for ages but i fear my word limit would be breached. <br/><br/>Disney is back and i am glad, hope it carries on.

"petit76","10","14","17","28 November 2010"," Disney's ultimate comeback !!
","I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'. <br/><br/>This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture. <br/><br/>The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.<br/><br/>I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear. <br/><br/>This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies. <br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it.Evren Buyruk from USA"
"cjd-16","9","20","27","24 November 2010"," A Disney Classic in Every Sense
","Despite the modern-sounding title, ""Tangled"" is perhaps the most classical-styled Disney film since the days of Disney himself.<br/><br/>What really makes this movie feel like a classic is that it digs back, way back, all the way back to Disney's roots, back in the days where the most common main character that you saw in every Disney movie was along the lines of ""A completely innocent main character discovers the world."" I'm talking Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, and Bambi. And now we can add Rapunzel to this list, because this is what Tangled is really about: Rapunzel finally stepping out of her tower after 18 years of experiencing absolutely nothing but her little room at the top, and seeing the whole world in wide-eyed wonderment. To some degree, this makes Tangled feel even more ""Disney"" than even the stellar films of the 90's Disney Renaissance. We fall in love with Rapunzel right from the beginning because we want her, such a kind and loving character, to live her dreams and find beauty in this new world she is experiencing. This aspect of the film is absolutely brilliant. Rapunzel is almost like Snow White in her kindness, and yet she also actually has a real personality! I can't say enough about Rapunzel's character. She is easily near the top of all Disney princesses, mixing the love and kindness of Snow White with the realism and believability of Ariel and Belle.<br/><br/>From a visual standpoint, this is definitely a throwback to the classics as well. The colors are vibrant and lively, and the buildings warm, rounded, cozy, and inviting, as if they themselves have been custom-chosen to convey the sense of wonderment that Rapunzel feels, like she is a child visiting Fantasyland at Disney World for the first time. This adds greatly to the tone of the film, and combines to make the whole world of this movie feel lush, romantic, and inviting. Because of this, the whole thing is a joy to watch even in its imperfect moments. There are some especially amazing scenes, most notably the floating-lanterns scene where the whole kingdom slowly lights up little by little until the whole thing looks like it is glowing from the inside. (It will no doubt be remembered as the ""iconic"" scene from this movie, like the ballroom scene from Beauty and the Beast.) Pretty much, nothing about this movie is ""negative."" It has very strong main characters with some really well-done complex relationships amongst themselves, great sidekicks, some good-natured humor, a great classical song-filled musical score that has had me humming it for the last two days, and the plot is staged without a single thing feeling boring or clichéd. And in that manner, I believe that this is the first Disney film in nearly 15 years that can truly be called a Disney classic.<br/><br/>On the film-geek side of it, there is some amazing technical wizardry going on here. This is the best CGI hair ever put on film thus far. For the first time, we have computer-generated hair that can truly be called ""beautiful."" It shines, it stretches, and has weight that just looks right. Plus just getting the world itself to look warm and inviting is a huge accomplishment, as CGI is generally much more inclined toward producing hard mechanical edges. Great stuff! IMO, this is the biggest step forward in animation since ""Tarzan"" introduced deep-canvas technology.<br/><br/>One other thing that makes this movie just like the best Disney classics is that it works on all levels. For the adults like us, there is some great thematic subtlety going on beneath the surface, touching on classic coming-of-age themes, mother-daughter relationships, and in Flynn's case, how often the over-confident ruffian is really just hiding personal shortcomings and really doesn't know what he wants. Plus the characters really feel like real people, and never just archetypes or caricatures. And for the kids, there is some really good-natured humor that doesn't talk down to them, a great romance story, and the film was near-perfectly-paced, with not a moment of the running-time wasted, and yet still taking time to breathe to let us see some of the acting ""ticks"" that really let us get into the heads of the characters.<br/><br/>The only reason I am giving this a 9 is because of some minor contrivance nitpicks that keep this film just below my favorite Disney movies. The only one that I feel is really worth mentioning is the excessive use of cartoon physics. Flynn and Maximus fall off a 100-ft cliff and emerge completely unscathed. Flynn is catapulted from a wheelbarrow over 50 feet through the air and lands perfectly on a horse. And that horse then jumps over 30 feet off of a rooftop and keeps running unphased. That bugged me, and made it feel slightly like this film was taking place in a cartoon universe rather than the real world like most Disney movies, taking away slightly from its credibility. Also, there was something that kept it from feeling as ""complete"" and ""epic"" as almost every Disney movie feels, but I can't quite put my finger on why. But ultimately, these things were all minor in the grand scope of things. This was really a character-driven movie rather than external-plot-driven, and the characters are absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>So in one department, I felt that this was as much a classic Disney movie as any ever made, and near-perfect. Due to some slight contrivances, I feel like the physical plot was a step below Disney's best, but in general I feel like Tangled is the first Disney movie in over 15 years that can truly be called a masterpiece. I actively loved almost every second of it, and immediately wanted to go back and see it again. In a world populated by movies that are either too silly or too serious, ""Tangled"" is a bright ray of sunshine that is a joy to watch at every second."
"j-hunt01","9","14","18","1 February 2011"," Disney lets their hair down.
","'I don't do back story' claims an arrogant Flynn Rider - the outlawed central male character of Disney's 'Tangled' - when his history is probed by Rapunzel, his equally headstrong female counterpart. Incidentally, 'Tangled' doesn't do back story either, or even side plots for that matter; viewers are brought up to speed in a narrated introduction that gives us the who, what, why, where and when in an account given by the aforementioned criminal, revealing information in a biased light and missing an opportunity to explore the motivations of characters seen in the opening scene. This would be a detriment to many a film in which the tactic would be seen as lazy, however, 'Tangled' is solely focused on the growth of its dynamic duo and every other plot device and supporting character serves only as a catalyst for Flynn and Rapunzel's development. Interaction between other characters, such as the King and Queen who lost their daughter, is limited, but these omissions aren't vital as the emotional investment of the film is purely concentrated on its main characters. In a film about a girl who hasn't set foot outside for eighteen years, Disney appropriately isolate Rapunzel even more in her own story as she ventures beyond her tower for the first time.<br/><br/>Immediately noteworthy is the overall style of the screenplay, which resembles the witty tone and slapstick of a Dreamworks Animation product, particularly that of Shrek. It's refreshing to see Disney dabble in humour like this as Pixar and Dreamworks are both so black and white in their methods that I have never before witnessed a blend of their approaches as I have in 'Tangled', where heavy character work and physical sidekick antics compliment each other consistently, giving the film a real family-friendly consistency. While Disney may have come under fire for marketing the film towards both male and female demographics, dismissing a focus on the princess, the studio proves an unevenly skewed fairy tale can resonate with all audiences. Kidnapped from the palace as a child by an ageing hag, Rapunzel is hidden away so her captor can utilise the magic in the princess' golden locks to restore her youthful beauty whenever need be. As her prisoner grows older and more inquisitive, it becomes increasingly more difficult to suppress her thoughts of leaving; until the day that Flynn Rider, looking for a place to hide from the law, stumbles upon the tower. Joining Flynn on the run from the respective forces of authority ruling over them, Rapunzel is faced with realising her past and understanding the true nature of the world beyond her window. Aided by her pet chameleon, the hilariously silent Pascal, and a grumpy, defected police horse named Maximus, the pair become intertwined in the complexity of each other's situations. Twisting the archetype of the evil stepmother, Disney have shaped an unforgettably manipulative enemy in Rapunzel's keeper, and viewers will hang on every cunning, contradicting word she speaks throughout; the land equivalent of Ursula ('The Little Mermaid'), Disney merchandise in her image won't exactly be flying off the shelves in a hurry.<br/><br/>Five years in development and amassing what is currently believed to be the second highest budget for a feature film ever, the tech of 'Tangled' is justifiably breathtaking. Animating human forms is no longer the issue it once was, with close-ups of Rapunzel and Flynn proudly included now that their faces can express emotions so clearly (fifteen years ago 'Toy Story' routinely depicted characters from the waist down). Their world is picturesque, where each blade of glass falls with weight and water flows according to the laws of physics. Arguably a character in its own right, Rapunzel's hair is lush and textured, and its length is managed in genius and humorous manners. These visuals strengthen many sequences which will no doubt become iconic, particularly a scene set at night where hundreds of glowing fire lanterns illuminate the sky and water. Scored by Alan Menken, who follows a genre-specific approach like the jazz and gospel laden 'The Princess and the Frog', the soundtrack is typically touching, though time will tell if the musical numbers of 'Tangled' will be memorable in years to come; they don't convey the great sense of scale the characters are facing so well as, for example, 'Part of That World' (The Little Mermaid') or 'A Whole New World' ('Aladdin'), where the lyrics encapsulate the concept of the entire movie in a more grandiose way. Described as a combination of medieval music and folk rock, the music is suitably theatrical and at times pantomime, striking a chord with the persevering lightheartedness of the film, while Menken's scoring is rousing and accentuates each character well.<br/><br/>Introducing a lovable family of characters and maintaining a return to form that began with 'The Princess and the Frog' , 'Tangled' is a successful fairy tale adaptation that lets its hair down for the sake of having a good time, proving that the tradition of the classic fairy tale is one that should be fiddled with, rather than forgotten.<br/><br/>9/10"

","(Synopsis) After receiving the healing powers from a magical flower, the baby Princess Rapunzel is kidnapped from the palace in the middle of the night by Mother Gothel. Mother Gothel knows that the flower's magical powers are now growing within the golden hair of Rapunzel, and to stay young, she must lock Rapunzel in her hidden tower. Rapunzel is now a teenager and her hair has grown to a length of 70-feet. The beautiful Rapunzel has been in the tower her entire life, and she is curious of the outside world. One day, the bandit Flynn Rider scales the tower and is taken captive by Rapunzel. Rapunzel strikes a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to travel to the place where the floating lights come from that she has seen every year on her birthday. Rapunzel is about to have the most exciting and magnificent journey of her life.<br/><br/>(My Comment) Tangled is the retelling of the Rapunzel fairy tale. Disney's storytelling version is fantastic and the animation was just spectacular. Rapunzel's long golden hair looks incredibly realistic, and all the characters in the movie are cute and extremely lovable. The animals involved as part of the story were given great personalities (even though they did not speak a word), and the horse Maximus stole all the scenes he was in. There are many tender and touching scenes throughout the movie. Disney's usual touch of magic makes this movie a home run. The movie has romance, humor, and action that will please a wide range of audiences. Both children and adults will enjoy this new Disney classic. (Disney Pictures, Run Time 1:40, Rated PG) (10/10)"
"Hunter-Lostie","10","11","14","1 December 2013"," A beautifully engaging and touching family adventure
","Tangled is loosely based on the well-known fairy tale, Rapunzel. It's be interpreted in so many different ways over the years, that it was about time that Disney had a go! As usual, they didn't disappoint. With its stunning animation, heartwarming story line and lovable characters, Tangled is in many ways, a perfect movie. As a Disney kid, my opinion on most Disney movies is extremely biased, but I can promise you, hand on heart, that Tangled is worth watching. It keeps you entertained from start to finish, and tops it off with a sickly sweet ending, classic Disney style! Take it from someone who has watched this movie more times than most, has read the ""Art Of"" book from cover to cover and has an unhealthy obsession with it. Ignore the hate, and just give it a go, because you won't be left unsatisfied..."

","I have to be honest. I'm a huge Disney fan, so when i first came across the idea for Disney to make a Rapunzel story, I was curious as to how they'd do it. I was incredibly impressed and am now in love with this film. It's quirky enough for children to enjoy, but at the same time there's enough action and dialogue to allow older crowds to enjoy it as well. I loved it. The color and texture of colors were fantastic. I mean, I could honestly sit here and spoil the film for everyone, but I won't. It's definitely worth the watch, so if you have not seen it, I highly recommend it. Even for a Friday night film. Something that I really enjoyed with this film is that, while the story is usually told from the female perspective, the inclusion of a lead male, was impeccable. Rapunzel was evenly matched! Go see it!"

To me, the twist that Disney made in this fairy tale is amazing! I love everything about Tangled... you might even say i have a slight obsession with it... I know all the words, and I have the soundtrack on my iPod. The music is wonderful, Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were the perfect people to play the voices. Tangled was filled with such love, magic, and comedy. It has everything i would ever need in a movie, it's a perfect movie to watch when you're feeling down, or just on a rainy day.

"OneRingToRuleThemAll13","10","11","14","23 March 2012"," One of my favorite Disney movies!! Definitely an instant classic
","First I would like to note that when I saw the previews for this film I was as non-interested as you could get (as other people here have pointed out)! I mean, GET A MARKETING CREW!! Ughhh!! The first trailer/teaser was horrible, and like 50% of the footage shown in the teaser wasn't even included in the final movie. The second trailer was a bit better though.<br/><br/>2 weeks ago I finally gave up (after about 5 times of hearing from my soon-to-be sister-in-law that it was awesome and beautiful), and while I was in the hospital I asked my aunt to rent it for me so we could watch it on my sister's laptop. The first thing that went through my mind when the movie started was ''Huh... I guess this movie is just another attempt at Disney wanting to be cool and romantic while TRYING TO BE FUNNY!! :@@@''. Boy, was I wrong...<br/><br/>This movie is everything you could possibly want from a modern Disney movie (which is saying a LOT since Disney isn't the same as it was in the days of yore). It has lots of action, beautiful CGI animation, great humor, awesome and deeply developed characters (which were voiced really well), and of course what would a traditional Disney movie be without awesome songs (more on that later)???!<br/><br/>The story is (as you most probably know already) centered on a girl named Rapunzel, who after her mother (while still pregnant with Rapunzel) falls gravely ill and is cured by a magical, golden flower, gains beautiful, golden hair which can be used to heal people and give people eternal youth while singing it a special song (yes, it sounds kind of girly, but hey! I'm a 15-year-old boy and I ADORE THIS MOVIE!). <br/><br/>A few days after her birth an old woman (referred to as Mother Gothel in the movie, and had been using the flower to stay young forever for centuries before the flower was used to heal Rapunzel's mother), visits Rapunzel's nursery and tries to cut a strand of Rapunzel's hair and starts singing the song, but is quickly stopped when she realizes that if you cut the hair, it turns brown and loses it's power. Faced with a difficult predicament, Gothel decides to steal the child and raise her as her own in order to stay young forever. I won't spoil anymore, so that you can enjoy the movie for it's amazing story. <br/><br/>The voice-acting in this movie is spot-on (even though only 2 of the people involved in the cast are actually high-profile actors)! Mandy Moore as Rapunzel and Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider (the ''prince'' in the movie and Rapunzel's love interest), really give life to their characters, have great chemistry with each other, and they both sing beautifully. Donna Murphy is also excellent as Gothel, giving her character the necessary sarcasm and fake sweetness which surprisingly flawless skill, considering I'd never heard of her before.<br/><br/>The songs are my favorite part of the movie. They make you feel full of joy in a world that is slowly turning into a world of violence and corruption, and that is something all of us need right now, and is usually not present in today's movies, which are usually full of over- the-top violence, sex and pervasive language. Don't worry, though, as you will not find ANY of those things here. There is one particular song in the movie that is easily one of the best Disney songs out there, and is so romantic and beautiful I just want to dance and smile whenever I hear it :')<br/><br/>All in all, ''Tangled'' is an excellent family movie, and has something in it for everyone (even boys and adults, which at first glance doesn't seem to be the target demographic in these type of film). Keep it up, Disney!!!"
"eschetic-2","9","11","14","28 December 2010"," Even this late, the first genuine adult laugh-out-loud film of the year!
","A few years ago the technical wizardry of SHREK trumped the superior story telling of MONSTERS, INC. at the Oscars, and this may be one of those years. Early buzz has the wistful mixed bag TOY STORY 3 with a lock with Oscar voters who long for their lost childhood despite the monstrous children they show in that film, but the FAR more enjoyable experience, while still not without flaws of pacing, is Disney's deliriously enjoyable semi-musical (wonderful even if surprisingly unobtrusive score by Alan Menken) rethinking of the old Rapunzel legend, TANGLED.<br/><br/>The funny and yes, actually sexy animated leading man and his innocent but capable leading lady anchor a near perfect animated cast. The cavalry horse Maximus who starts as the hero's chief nemesis and winds up his best ally is a brilliant comic creation nearly matched by Rapunzel's faux ""mother,"" a 21st century version of the classic wicked witch. While some of the most popular recent animated features have generated major and minor sequels, this is the first animated film in my experience where I'd love to see these animated characters AS DRAWN and VOICED reused in other, not necessarily related properties as if they were real actors. They're so much fun to spend time with, you want to spend more. If Disney had the good sense to try an animated version of George Bernard Shaw's perennial success ARMS AND THE MAN with the same animated cast they've already developed, I'd be willing to bet it would be just as big a hit.<br/><br/>Great cast, but also a great story told with amazing freshness and insouciance. By elaborating on the well known story of the maid in the tower to create a classic quest to center their refurbished story around, the film makers also opened the door to a dazzling array of fresh comic touches (I'm with Flynn - ""I gotta get me one of these!"" - in loving the possibilities of the rediscovered old kitchen and comic standby, the cast iron skillet) and amusingly twisted sub-characters (yes, even one momentarily covered with the comic rodents that have been a Disney good luck talisman for years) with ""dreams"" similar to but different from Rapunzel's and thus touched on something universal in all of us. We all have dreams that seem unrealistic, but with determination and faith may not be. TANGLED has its heart firmly in the right place as pure entertainment so that it's only afterward that we realize how strongly it was encouraging us in the audience to follow our own dreams, but the joy and the beauty that washes over us while watching it remains with us to inspire long after the credits (which, sad to relate, are the one unimaginatively filmed part of the movie and easily missed) roll.<br/><br/>Of course the more and more ubiquitous new 3D system works beautifully and makes the motion picture experience more than it will inevitably be on the small screen, but the story telling is so good, that when the DVD inevitably comes out, it is one which will have to be on my shelves for regular reviewing whether or not we have 3D technology on our home screens yet.<br/><br/>When the ""previews"" are as good as TANGLED's, you usually think they must have pulled ALL the best parts, but this is one case where a film lives up to it's hype. It really is one of the few ""must sees"" of a pretty good year at the movies. (Sadly, as of January 25, 2011, it appears my prognostication re. TOY STORY 3 was prescient: the Academy chose to only nominate THREE animated films - including the inferior ""How To Train Your Dragon"" as ""Best..."" - in the apparent fear that TANGLED might actually beat TOY STORY 3 as it has at the box office. Inexcusable.)"
"Jerique","9","11","14","28 December 2010"," Wonderfully Cute!
","In the last few days of 2010, I got to see one more final movie and seal the deal on what I think is the best year of movies in over a decade. It was Tangled! I'd see the trailer of the re-imaging of this particular fairytale and thought it'd be cute with the comedic ""she's been grounded...like... forever."" I was also drawn to Tangled for the reason of being a big Mandy Moore fan. However, I did not expect it to be a musical nor to have Alan Menken (a top favourite composer of mine) to be the film's composer.<br/><br/>Beyond being a great score with a few catchy tunes, I did find myself getting annoyed whenever Rapunzel (Moore) would break into song. It was great at first and Donna Murphy's ""Mother Knows Best"" song was great too. But after that, I was kinda hoping for just a regular movie. It was timed great and the animation worked really well to create the horse Maximus and the chameleon Pascal into comedic roles without speaking.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire film, there was not one point where I was disappointed in it or felt that it was awful. I thought the rating of the film was perfect because although it's a kid's film, some of the romance is more aimed for teens and an older audience than a six year old. It's a great film for the year and I think it's one of the best animated films ever to be created. I highly recommend this one."
"zactac","10","9","11","12 October 2011"," May I present the next addition to the Second Disney Renaissance Era.
","While some may not be familiar with the name ""Disney Renaissance"", it was a sort of Disney Golden Age starting with The Little Mermaid in 1989 and ending with Tarzan in 1999. The last ten years has mostly been nothing short of the type of animation you would find on Disney Channel or Toon Disney (now DisneyXD). Disney, for some strange reason, had lost it's creative ability but now these last few years has set the pace for Disney's redemption. Pixar is what has saved Disney's film industry but now thanks to the new Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter, who also worked closely on many Pixar movies, Disney is finding themselves making movies that in a few years time will rival Pixar. Now The Princess and the Frog began this new Renaissance Era and it seems to continue with Tangled.<br/><br/>Now this is also a different rendition of the classic fairy-tale. In Tangled Rapunzel is kidnapped as a baby and hidden in this tower by an evil woman. Her hair actually has some kind of special power that makes her so coveted. Now Rapunzel is growing up and doesn't want to stay in the tower any more. When a thief hides in the tower she knocks him out and hides his prize. She makes him promise to take her out of the tower for a day and then she'll give him back what he wants. Of course something will happen between the two and there is always this climatic battle between good and evil. But I was surprised at how much I liked it. I found the characters real and charming. The songs were definitely catchy and I can still hear them in my head to this day.<br/><br/>There has been much controversy over how the film was made. At first I was skeptical about leaving behind the use of animated drawing but the use of computer animation was maybe the better idea. They make the animation come to life and it pulls you into the movie and that's without the story or characters.<br/><br/>Now as for the story that was, once again, another controversy proved to be a good idea. The filmmakers take the story to new heights and even asks questions only a Pixar film would dare to ask using animation. Mandy Moore (Rapunzel) and Zachary Levi (Flynn Rider) are perfect as the leading characters. They bring humor as well as wit to roles in the most unexpected ways.<br/><br/>Tangled isn't just another animated fairy-tale, it is a statement that Disney is back on there long-awaited top form. The title might be Tangled but Disney's return is as straight-forward as it gets. They've made their statement ""we're back and that is that."" And I can't wait to see what else they bring to the table."

The characters and acting were much more charming than I expected and funny as well. Loved the slapstick and clever humor. Then, it combined that with sweet tear jerking moments coupled with the fascination of the world that only a child can usually experience. But even for adults, the characters and story draw you into those feelings. And I was constantly amazed at the quality and sophistication of the computer animation. There are many clever aspects to this movie beyond the animation. But suffice it to say, it's a great movie worth seeing."

","I was extremely skeptical about seeing this movie for the first time. At 21, I grew up with some really great Disney movies (Pocahontas, Aladdin, Mulan, Hunchback etc.) so lately all of the new releases have been coming up short of my expectations. I was especially disappointed with the Princess and the Frog movie, so I had low hopes for this movie. However, I found myself at redbox renting it none the less. And surprisingly- I LOVED it. I thought it was the perfect blend of new technology and the classic Disney feel; for once 3D-ish animation did not bother me. The storyline was great and some of the songs were very fun (When Will My Life Begin has been playing on my iPod nonstop for a few days). The heroine was a believable character with self-doubt, and the rascal-turned-hero process didn't happen too quickly like there is a tendency to do now. Also, it was nice that Rapunzel didn't fall for the guy the moment she laid eyes on him. There was plenty of well placed comedy, some of which was cliché but not overdone. I would recommend this movie for anyone to see, no matter what their age. There were a lot of good messages in it that are applicable to everyone. Kudos Disney."
"zkonedog","9","4","4","4 March 2017"," A Lot Of Heart (And Hair!) In This One
","The hallmark of Disney animated films (at least of late) has always been their ability to combine humor with heart to produce an entrancing concoction of family entertainment. Simply put, ""Tangled"" succeeds once again in that vein.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Tangled"" tells the basic story of Rapunzel...but with a more modern feel to it. Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) lives in a tower with Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and forbidden to leave. One day, however, the dashing young Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) happens upon the castle and changes Rapunzel's life forever.<br/><br/>Humor-wise, this flick will have young and old alike laughing out loud. Since it is told from the modern perspective (e.g. Rapunzel acts like a current teenager, nothing is ""stuffy"" about the tale, etc.), there is plenty of room for conversational humor and sight gags galore.<br/><br/>Also, a very interesting animation choice produces big results: the decision to make the characters' faces/eyes as wide/expressive as possible. The film is already a visual treat (Blu-Ray highly recommended), but the emotion (and this movie is full of it) strikes a real chord in large part because of those facial features.<br/><br/>Overall, I very much enjoyed ""Tangled"" and would highly recommend it to fans of similar Disney or other animated fare. For years I skipped this effort because I thought it little more than a ""girls movie"", but when watching it with my younger sister it was ME getting emotional...not her!"

"webmaster-736-444741","10","8","10","18 January 2014"," Don't let the perfect rating by me mislead
","I considered giving this movie a 9 so that anyone looking at the rating would be less inclined to see it as from just another person who is easily pleased. Quite the contrary actually. I am almost annoyingly picky about all manner of things, including entertainment. Yet Tangled is simply a perfect 10, no way around it. So ultimately I decided to risk looking easy and give the proper score.<br/><br/>By the way, I can only take so many animated works and in fact rejected the offer of borrowing somebody else's Red Box rental about five days ago (Planes, I think). Correction: I actually watched perhaps five minutes then shut it off. Probably not terrible. But like I said, only so much willingness to view the typical animated story.<br/><br/>Before today, Toy Story and Shrek were both excellent in my book, yet most Disney or similar titles get skipped by me. Not knowing that Tangled fell into that category, I started watching while messing with other matters, then nearly shut 'er off in the first minute upon realizing what was unfolding, a cartoon. A couple of snappy dialog moments led me to holding on for another minute. By that time, I was in for a pound.<br/><br/>No ""review"" other that what is written above because I really dislike being given plot details before watching a movie. The actual previews are the worst, somehow amazingly revealing the entire show in 90 seconds. Written reviews tend to be spoilers for me also, even if technically devoid of officially termed spoiler descriptions. So what you get from me is that the movie includes snappy dialogue, oh, and a few unexpected turns, plus of course likable characters and a bad guy. Take the risk."

This movie was amazing in every aspect. Disney just knows how to bring our inner children out. <br/><br/>The musical composition is outstanding, and Mandy Moore nails the singing of Repunzel perfectly.

"aaronjbong","9","15","22","29 November 2010"," Disney's Comeback On Animated-Musicals
","The Disney Renaissance period was grand to the Disney company. They had made many 2D animated musicals that had turned into all-time classics such as ""The Lion King"" or ""Tarzan"" which are based on stories, legends or maybe fairy tales. But, after 1999, things changed as the movies are no longer based on fairy takes or other stories but rather original ideas. But, 2010 will see the return of animated musicals with ""Tangled"" with the addition of 3D animation and 3D format.<br/><br/>""Tangled"" marks the return of animated musicals and will be based on the fairytale of Rapunzel. But, Disney added some changes and new characters and also removing some things from the original tale into a new tale. It's basically about Rapunzel, a girl who has incredibly long hair with magic powers. When she's still a baby, Mother Gothel kidnapped her forth magic powers and so, Gothel took care of Rapunzel and concealed the truth that Rapunzel's parents were actually the king and queen of the empire.<br/><br/>Unexpectedly, Flynn Rider, a mastermind thief now known as a fugitive was on the run and saw Rapunzel's tower, he climbed up the tower and met Rapunzel. Then, they began to form a relationship and so it becomes a problem for Mother Gothel then, they have fights and so on.<br/><br/>""Tangled"" is actually a great film to begin with. It is enjoyable mostly to girls but it also has an appeal to boys. Jokes here are plenty and everything was really good. The voice performances were also magnificent. <br/><br/>The songs in this film are classical. They are really enjoyable for kids and are memorable . There are many songs here but the division of the songs is quite uneven having Rapunzel owning over 65% of all the songs. <br/><br/>The 3D effects if the film was also satisfying enough. It was quite in depth and the lanterns part in the film was really breathtaking. I was happy enough with the 3D effect. <br/><br/>However, there is a prominent difference from previous animated films which is the length . Mostly range from just 80 minutes to 100 minutes. But, ""Tangled"" is actually 110 minters ling instead, very long for a children's movie. <br/><br/>""Tangled"" is actually a very good film. I would recommend it to everyone and their kids because this movie is truly remarkable. Even though not Disney's best movie, ""Tangled"" is definitely worth seeing it.<br/><br/>Prince AJB's Rating: 90%<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review on ""Tangled"". Hope it's useful!"

"lauraberrill","9","9","12","26 July 2012"," Incredible animated movie. Definitely one of Disney's best.
","Hi there, I haven't wrote a review in quite a long time now, I think almost a year actually, but never mind about that, I've now decided to return to write a review on Disney's remake of the classic fairy tale ""Rapunzel"", but instead of naming the movie ""Rapunzel"" Disney decided to get a bit more creative with the title, so instead they named it: ""Tangled"". <br/><br/>Now to start off, let me just say that this fairy tale (or princess story) Disney movie is quite different than almost all the other ones they've done for three reasons. For a start, it's in CGI rather than being hand drawn, second, like I stated earlier, they decided to get more creative with the title, so instead named ""Tangled"" instead of just ""Rapunzel"", and third, the rating's PG instead of U/G.<br/><br/>Now this isn't a bad thing, it can actually turn out as a good thing, since it makes this move more unique than most other fairy tales Disney has done. Now, I would explain the story, but trust me, it would be way too long for me to explain it, plus I would have enough room for the whole review.<br/><br/>So, what do I think of this animated movie? Well, if it wasn't already obvious, I freaking' love this movie, just like a lot other people do, especially Disney fans, which I am. Seriously, this is way better than the Princess and the Frog last year (in my opinion). Now, I liked that movie too, but I just find this one way better. But now for the voice actors/actresses.<br/><br/>The heroine, Rapunzel, is voiced by Mandy Moore, which is nice. The hero, a charming thief called Flynn Rider, is voiced by Zachary Levi, he also does a good job. And of course, the main villain, an old lady (or witch, if you will), is voiced by Donna Murphy. Coolness! Other voices include Ron Perlman, M.C. Gainey, Jeffrey Tambour and Brad Garret.<br/><br/>And now, finally, time for my final thoughts on this movie.<br/><br/>Tangled is an amazing movie! Hands down one of the best movies of the year. Would highly recommend getting this on DVD, especially if you have kids. I still have it on DVD and I still enjoy it the same. It has excellent animation, quite a few entertaining characters especially the ""animal companions"" (Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, and Maximus, a palace stallion), the songs are all great in my eyes, and not to mention its based on a classic fairy-tale. <br/><br/>By far, one of my favorite Disney movies ever. Oh, and BTW, don't read this if you don't wanna be spoiled, Rapunzel and Flynn both start to fall in love as the movie goes on. Well it IS a Disney movie after all. But anyways, final thoughts, this is an outstanding animated movie. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10 - or - ****1/2 out of *****<br/><br/>Hope you enjoyed this review, which is actually my first proper review. Be sure to check in on my next review, which hopefully should be soon. But until then, see y'all later."
"austin-takahashi","10","9","12","18 January 2012"," Tangled (5 Stars)
","Walt Disney Animation Studios has regained its touch and reclaimed its glory. After a decade of churning out animated flicks that only served as a shadow to the works of Dreamworks, they have finally created something that deserves a place in my heart. Yeah, I agree how the latter part of my previous sentence was covered with cheese. But that's how the movie made me feel – Cheesy. I developed affection for its characters, and I felt the loss in its tragedy. Also, I released a couple of blushes towards its romance. As the loveless chap that I am, I'm usually unaffected by mushy moments in movies, but not this time. ""Tangled"" is just too darn adorable. <br/><br/>Let me share with you a quick story. My childhood was blessed beyond grace, for it was nurtured by a loving, gentle woman: my mother. As amazing as she is, we abide by the truth that nobody's perfect, and my dear mother had poor discernment when it came to animated movies. She was numb to the genre; identifying animated characters as nothing more than plastic objects. So you could tell that I was filled with delight when she informed me that she had enjoyed ""Tangled"". The makers back at Disney must have done something incredibly right. I mean, even I had a special fondness for the movie, where most of it is directed at its young princess. If Rapunzel ever gets thrown into the real world, like Amy Adam's Giselle in ""Enchanted"", I'll be the guy to catch her. And now this movie review has extra cheese.<br/><br/>Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/tangled-movie-review/"

","I was quite skeptical of this because I thought the Golden Year of CG- Animated films ended with a not-so-big-bang with the decent ""Megamind"". After a year which brought you ""How To Train Your Dragon"", ""Toy Story 3"", ""Despicable Me"", and ""Legend Of The Guardians: The Owls Of Ga'Hoole"", can there really be any other CG-Animated films of that caliber?<br/><br/>""Tangled"" miraculously continues and ends that streak (at least for this year alone) with a big bang.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with liking a movie which is out of your personal tastes. Yes, ""Tangled"" may look like a typical kids film on the poster, but I am glad to say that this film is a strong return to form for Disney Animation Studios.<br/><br/>Even if it is CGI and even though the film bases itself around another fairy-tale princess, it is done very well. It is made clear that everyone involved in the film cared about the material and wanted it to reach out to everyone. They succeeded brilliantly. Everything that you loved in an animated Disney film is here in full force. Disney has never been this good since the 90's. Pixar is excluded - they're in a world of their own.<br/><br/>Take for example, the characters and actors. Rapunzel looks cute and adorable, Flynn looks handsome and dashing; and the villains look menacing. Yet, underneath it all, the voice actors bring out the dimensions in the characters. A very versatile Mandy Moore makes Rapunzel a sweet and innocent girl yet one who is full of adventure and determination. Flynn, voiced by ""Chuck""'s own Zachary Levi, shows dry wit and vanity at times, and also self-actualization later on in the film. The other voice actors do their part just fine, especially Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel - a selfish and cruel new addition to the Disney villain club.<br/><br/>While the story/screenplay was written well for what it's worth, the music by Alan Menken truly displays his signature Disney trademarks, the grand music, the catchy songs, the emotional ballads in the middle. I'm not surprised if it gets an Oscar nomination at the very least, knowing Oscar.<br/><br/>Well, there, I've said it. I really enjoyed ""Tangled"", its extremely like-able main characters and it's fantastic visuals enveloping a classic fairy tale, it is a real welcome return to form for Disney, and I really hope it continues to go down this way. This one is a definite must watch for the families, a new ""Princess"" classic for Disney.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 75/100"

First of all, I'd like to state that it looks amazing from the gorgeous colours to the well textured hair. The hair was one of the animaters' finest achievements in this movie, because that's one of the hard things to do in animation.<br/><br/>The songs were okay, I See The Light was the stand-out while the others were well performed and served their purpose even if they weren't among my picks for the best songs by Alan Menken.<br/><br/>The comedy was actually my favorite part, because there are so many hilarious passages in here, and they weren't mostly the spoken jokes, because hands down Maximus is the funniest character from Disney in a long time, maybe since the 90's!<br/><br/>So to sum it up, a fresh take on the well known fairy-tale princess formula with stunning animation and lots of fun for the whole family are guaranteed."
"elisabethnieshalla","10","3","3","24 October 2019"," At Last I See The Light: Discovering the Wonderment of Tangled
","""Flower gleam and glow. Let your powers shine. Make the clock reverse..."" so I can re-watch Tangled over and over again! The girl, the guy, the chameleon sidekick, the comical horse, the evil mother - this film has all the essential aspects that make an incredible Disney princess movie. More than that, however, it offers a fresh plot that takes a heartwarming spin on the beloved classic story of Rapunzel. Even if the average princess movie isn't typically your thing, I encourage you to give Tangled a shot. Its humor, music, and genuine characters may just take you by surprise and capture your heart like they did mine.<br/><br/>It all starts with a single flower. The king and queen of Corona are expecting a child, but when the child's time comes to be born, the queen falls very ill. The only thing that can save her is a magic golden flower. Our villain, Mother Gothel, has been using the flower's healing powers to keep herself young, but she loses her source of life when the flower is picked and taken to heal the queen. However, the baby girl (Rapunzel) is born with beautiful long, blonde hair that has the magical qualities of the flower. So Gothel steals the baby and takes her to a hidden tower where the evil woman raises Rapunzel as her own, using the girl's hair to preserve her own youth. Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom lets up thousands of floating lanterns to remember the lost princess; and every year, the lost princess watches from her tower window and wonders if maybe those lanterns are somehow meant for her.<br/><br/>Our heroine, Rapunzel, is the epitome of beauty and delight. Mother Gothel has kept the free spirit of her ""flower"" caged in the tower for her entire life, but with the princess' eighteenth birthday drawing near, the young girl is ready to take that step of rebellion and adventure. A desperate, love-struck, helpless female victim is something that Rapunzel most definitely is not. She is far above her fellow princesses, such as Cinderella and Snow White, and is a positive influence on little and grown up girls alike. She exudes confidence and loving-kindness that inspires one to see the beauty in every person and in every situation. Her beautiful golden hair is an important part of who she is, but that is not where she places her identity. Although Rapunzel is not perfect, her faults give her character a realness and relatability. She learns from her mistakes and continues to fight for the things that matter most. Rapunzel embodies independence, bravery, adventure, passion, and beauty, and she's not too bad with the frying pan either.<br/><br/>Enter Flynn Rider: a thief who has stolen the princess' crown from the castle and, in his escape, happens upon Rapunzel's dwelling place. He climbs up the tower, and just when he thinks he is out of danger, he is hit on the head with a loud dong. Rapunzel stands stunned with her frying pan in hand. In a moment of pure childlike wonder, she stares at the unconscious intruder. Despite Mother Gothel's strict orders to never leave the tower, Rapunzel orders charismatic Flynn to take her to see the flying lanterns. Together, they face every kind of adventure from dream-filled drunkards to palace guards to a very stubborn horse, and what starts out as an obligation quickly turns into a caring friendship, and eventually a sweet romance. Flynn guides Rapunzel to discover who she truly is, and she helps him see his worth apart from being a criminal.<br/><br/>A believable, powerful, sweet love story in Disney princess movies can prove to be a rare occurrence, but Tangled fulfills this essential quality through Flynn and Rapunzel's romance. Their love comes to fruition in an inexpressibly stunning scene where they are in a boat with the floating lanterns all around them. The magic of the moment is captivating as the lanterns' glittering reflections in the water and their encompassing glow creates a beautiful, magical, and romantic atmosphere. However, a good love story is not without trials. So often, the love story in Disney princess movies is shallow and fails to show the selflessness of love. If you are weary of ""love at first sight"" and desperate female figures being swept off their feet by a rich, handsome prince, then Tangled will surely offer some fresh and enjoyable entertainment. As you will see in the end, their love transcends infatuation and shows that true love requires sacrifice.<br/><br/>It would do the film injustice if I did not also mention the incredible soundtrack that enhances this story. You don't have to be sitting on your couch in front of your television to experience the wonderment of this endearing film, for the lyrics and compositions so appropriately capture the emotions of the moments in which they are sung. Not only are they geniusly written, but for me these songs are the centerpiece of so many precious memories. Whether you're dramatically acting them out in the car with friends or screaming them at the top of your lungs in the dish room at camp, the soundtrack isn't just for the film; it's a soundtrack for your life. From the haunting melody of the ""Healing Incantation"" to the joyous and lighthearted ""I've Got A Dream,"" the music will have you leaving with a smile in your heart and a skip in your step.<br/><br/>At the end of any great movie, justice is served. The ending must be satisfying yet not too predictable. Tangled checks the box for a fantastic ending. It introduces real life themes of death and loss but also of love and sacrifice. As this journey you've gone on with the characters comes to its climax, your mind is spinning trying to determine how it all will end. When I sat in the theater in 2010 watching the film for the first time as a seven-year-old girl, a gasp rose from the audience as the gripping moment came to fruition. This enthralling end will have you on the edge of your seat with suspense and excitement, but you will ultimately walk away with a genuine sense of joy and satisfaction. The conclusion of this story is not completely perfect and happy, but that makes it real, for in life there is always a price to pay for the things most worth having.<br/><br/>Rapunzel's hair and its magical powers seem to be the center of the story. That was why Mother Gothel stole her in the first place and why she was never allowed to leave the tower. In the end, however, it's not about her beautiful magic hair, but about the importance of courage, the steadfastness of a family, and the power of true love. Disney hit the sweet spot with this princess movie. Its heroine, though not without flaws, has a strong, confident, exuberant personality that captures your heart and inspires you to relentlessly chase after your dreams. Rapunzel and Flynn's love story is genuine and believable, a rarity among other Disney princess movies, and the music is music for the soul. Real, raw justice is served that gives you a fulfilled spirit to go out and face the world with courage. The next time you sit down for movie night, I encourage you to give Tangled a chance, for his film isn't just an hour and a half of quality entertainment, it is an endearing story that will leave you changed for the better and for good."
"blackwidowis7cool","8","3","3","12 August 2019"," Cute and catchy
","I must confess that I was a bit unsure about watching Disney's version of the tale of Rapunzel - partially because I secretly enjoyed the original tale and was worried about what they would do with it and also partially due to the fact that I didn't think it would make that great a film. But, I decided to sit down and watch it, anyway.
I had grown used to Disney's new style of story telling - in movies such as Zootopia, Frozen, Wreck-It Ralph, and Big Hero 6, and Brave. I quite love this new style, which felt more...I don't know, real. So, when the movie started, I was quite surprised to find that Tangled wasn't like any of these movies, and was done in old Disney style with narrations, and immediately revealing who the villain is, and several other big reveals right at the start instead of being revealed later in the movie like they do now. It was like a mixture of old Disney classic story telling with a bit of Looney Tunes thrown in.
At first I was unsure how this would play out, but I actually quite enjoy how they told in the old Disney classic way. In fact, without the narration at the start, I don't think some parts of the film (particularly with Mother Gothel and Rapunzel at the start) would have made much sense.
The animation and attention to detail was quite good and very enjoyable. I rather like and appreciate some of the changes made to the story - such as instead of a prince, the movie makers make it a thief called Flynn Rider, a thief that you just can't help but love. Flynn is full of himself, witty, great at thieving, sly, and just a really likeable guy - oh, and Rapunzel's love interest. Zachary Levi does an excellent job with Flynn - made him quite funny. Mandy Moore does a great job as the main character Rapunzel. She is the perfect voice for the naive, outgoing, bubbly, fish-out-of-water character that Rapunzel is. But Rapunzel can also handle herself and her natural charm helps them out of bad situations in hilarious ways.
The songs were quite good and catchy - my personal favourite is I've got a dream. Very hilarious and old-fashioned Disney song. I also loved how Disney made a crack or two at themselves in the movie.
And because it's Disney, we can excuse the implausibility of some of the scenes and some of the all-around cheesy and silly parts - though there was one scene which I thought was a bit overdone and quite stupid. At first it was funny, but as it continued it began to feel stupid and pushed.
The climax was excellent and very tense and emotional. I couldn't help but notice similarities between Tangled and Frozen - such as with Rapunzel and Anna both being outgoing females who are isolated from the world and both going on an adventure and teaming up with rough diamonds like Flynn and Kristoff. Then there's the climax. I noticed quite a few similarities there. I thought it was interesting, considering the fan theory of Tangled and Frozen taking place in the same universe and Elsa, Anna, and Rapunzel being cousins.
Donna Murphy was very, very good as Mother Gothel - Disney's last classic villain. Very evil, conniving, dark villain. Overall it is a great movie - particularly due to the old-fashioned classic storytelling style it was told in. There was a very minor hiccup, but otherwise quite good and I love it. If you like classic Disney movies, then this movie is for you."

","In how many ways and with how many adjectives can I describe how much I enjoyed 'Tangled'?! Oh, my goodness, I absolutely loved it!<br/><br/>The animation is stunning. The voicing was very good. It has an awesome story and a unique retelling of a classic tale. The film also had a very bright and colorful look, enhancing the feel-good vibe. The floating lanterns scene was simply awesome and mesmerizing, actually. Absolutely beautiful!<br/><br/>I enjoyed every single character in the film. I felt the king and queen's sadness, still looking for their lost child years after she was kidnapped. There were some sincere, emotional moments. The horse, Maximus, was my favorite character, and I simply adored the chameleon, too! I want a horse like Maximus! I literally loved every minute of this film.<br/><br/>The original songs were incredible, with clever, appropriate lyrics. ""Skip the drama, stay with Mama."" Ha-ha, so funny!! The only issue with the film was the inconsistency of the length of Rapunzel's hair, but I'll forgive them for the sake of convenience for the character to move about more easily. This is a feel-good movie of note. Spectacular!"
"thom_vd","8","3","3","30 January 2017"," Magical Disney experience filled with beauty and charm
","I'm a big fan of Frozen, so I was very excited to watch this film as well. It blew away my expectations. While it does not have the most complex story in a Disney film, there is just so much to love about it.
Starting off with the characters. Rapunzel is a beautiful and adorable lead; very quirky and funny. Flynn is an equally charming male lead. As far as the villain goes, Gothel is perhaps the strongest villain since Hades in Hercules. She is evil in a completely different way.
The animation is beautiful. There is one scene later on that is just jaw- dropping. Especially on the big screen. The environments are lush and colourful, and the characters are detailed and well animated. The songs are memorable as well. 
All in all it is one of my favourite Disney films just because of the charm and beauty of the whole film. It's such a pleasant watch."

",". . . a horse? Disney's Tangled, directed by Nathan Greno and Bryon Howard, is charming, fun, and humorous, the perfect balance of marvelous music, appealing adventure, and ravishing romance. <br/><br/>As the movie opens up, it starts with Mr. Dreamboat a.k.a. Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi), who narrates our tale and I must say, those ""Hot Guy"" focus groups Disney put together were a great idea. The focus group was a sudden gathering of all the women in the studio where they brought in pictures of the most attractive men they could find because Disney wanted Flynn to be the most handsome male lead that they have ever had and they succeeded. I mean, Flynn Rider is a hilarious hunk, especially for a bandit! This stunning thief tells the tale of the flower that came from the sun with its magical healing powers and about the old hag (Donna Murphy) who covets it before it's found and taken to the sickly queen, pregnant with Rapunzel (played with enlightening enthusiasm by Mandy Moore). After she is born, Mother Gothel snatches the princess out of her crib to lock her in a tower just so the horrid witch can use the rejuvenating powers Rapunzel's hair now holds. And that's all because once the hair is cut, it loses it's power and turns a nice shade of chestnut brown. This is where the magic really happens because the animation is so stunning! Her hair glows with the same brightness as the flower and with a snip, the glow delicately fades away. Not to mention the fact that Disney gives an actual explanation of why her hair is infinitely long because why should the only use for her hair be a rope?<br/><br/>Years later, Rapunzel is singing about chores and crafts and when the heck is she going to be able to finally get out of the house, almost like a regular eighteen-year-old. But often singing. Moore blows us away with her brilliant vocals, singing ""When Will My Life Begin?"", for it's the day before Rapunzel's birthday and she has just one wish; to see the floating lights. We learn, later, these are actually lanterns sent out by the king and queen anticipating their daughter's return home. But Rapunzel's wish is declined by her ""mother"". Everyone saw that coming. What we didn't see coming, though, was after Mother Gothel cautions Rapunzel with a scintillating song ""Mother Knows Best"" and leaves the scene, the attractive criminal who comes along to scale the tower and hide for his life from the palace guards bringing the stolen crown with him. The stolen crown that just so happens to belong to Rapunzel! Here is where we find Disney putting it's own magical twist on this fairytale. Now we are seeing two main characters and Flynn Rider isn't even a prince like in the original Rapunzel story which is, really, kind of refreshing and it certainly holds my attention. Moreover, Flynn Rider is totally awesome for boys to connect with because he's sarcastic and humorous so while Rapunzel is singing about her feelings, Flynn Rider is cracking jokes everyone can enjoy. Disney certainly knows what it's doing. As the story continues, Rapunzel is frightened by this strange man in her prison like home so she uses her trusty frying pan to knock poor Flynn Rider out and stuff him in her closet until she can let Gothel know of her accomplishment. However, when Mother Gothel becomes infuriated with Rapunzel's constant plea to leave, Rapunzel decides to ask for paint as a birthday gift and begrudgingly brushes off the subject so Gothel leaves on a three-day journey for paint. With that, our golden-haired princess convinces Flynn Rider to be her guide to see the floating lanterns. In an attempt to scare Rapunzel back to her tower, Flynn takes her to ""The Snuggly Duckling,"" a pub filled with ruffians and thugs where they recognize Flynn Rider as the wanted thief and fight over him for the prize money. However, Rapunzel surprises everyone by standing up to these bullies and demands that they give her guide back, crying out to them that Flynn is the one she needs to take her to see the floating lanterns, her precious, lifelong dream which leads to another brilliant song involving all of the chummy ruffians who apparently have a soft spot for dreams and the friendly thugs help the lovable couple escape the royal army.<br/><br/>Rapunzel and Flynn finally make it to safety. The adventure continues from there, including an exquisite last song, a hair-raising ending and in the company of Maximus, the stallion who acts more like a dog than an actual horse, provides comic relief and entertainment while interacting with Flynn Rider. Disney's Tangled is a lovely tear jerker and a captivating movie for boys, girls and horses of all ages. Another dazzling movie from Disney, as expected."
"chanrathaaa","10","3","3","19 November 2015"," Tangled was awesome!
","It was awesome! I really love the animation of this movie. Well,this movie can be watch by any ages since it was a family genre. I really love the characters in this movie. Mostly they're all silly and funny,it was very entertaining to watch. There is also adventure in this movie and some sweet and comedy romance.The villain for good too well,mostly Disney villains are well made. The plots was also good and also there are musics too and it was good. I'm glad that I decided to watch this movie. This is one of the best Disney movie that I have seen. I would love to recommend to all ages. <br/><br/>10/10 for this movie. I really like it!"
"FilmFreak94","10","5","6","30 April 2011"," My 2nd favorite animated Disney film
","My history with Tangled is a rocky one. Like many people I was disappointed with the trailer and thought that Disney was trying to copy off the formula that made Shrek famous. The tile change from Rapunzel to Tangled didn't sit well for me at the time either. Before I even saw the film I thought that it would be a huge disaster.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Disney proved me wrong. Tangled is one of the best Disney films I've seen in a very long time. The story is well written and the characters are all very enjoyable(the horse and the chameleon steal the show). The animation for Tangled can only be described in one word... 'beautiful.' Every little detail in this movie, from the backgrounds to the crowds of people, are perfectly animated. The two things that stand out are the floating lanterns scene and Rapunzel's hair. Admitadely, the songs took awhile for me to get used to. It felt as though Alan Menken wasn't really on his A-game when he did Tangled, but that doesn't necessarily mean the songs are awful, you'll just need to listen to them a few times before they really grow on you. <br/><br/>Overall Tangled is by far one of the best films to come out of Disney in a long time. If you have kids or if you're just a fan of animation then you should definitely give Tangled a look."
"wliia","9","5","6","25 January 2011"," Hands down the funniest Disney movie ever made
","If you thought The Emperor's New Groove was the funniest Disney movie ever made, then wait till you see Tangled. It has brilliant comedy and very sweet moments.<br/><br/>In this film, Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) has been keeping Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) in a tower due to Rapunzel's magic hair, that allows Mother Gothel to stay young. When Rapunzel is left alone, a man named Flynn (Zachary Levi) enters her life. They leave the tower to discover the world she never experienced.<br/><br/>What's so great about this movie isn't just because of the music of the relationship between Rapunzel and Flynn, it's the comedy, and this has one of the best comedy characters ever made... Maximus the horse. I won't give away what he does, but you'll be laughing your butt off over his adventures as he searches for Flynn.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic movie, a great ride for both young and old, and some of the best comedy I've ever seen."

"hellraiser7","10","8","11","20 May 2014"," Hair Rasing Adventure
","It has been far too long since we seen another animated fantasy film that Disney is best known for. As a person that has watched these kinds of films since childhood my patience was seriously getting tested. This is one of my favorite animated films because it really helped bring back the old Disney films I knew and loved.<br/><br/>The animation is just superb, you can tell the animators were just at their A game, and the effort shows. From the background really capturing a sort of post medieval pre Renaissance era, as well as just the look of the forests and everything in it. However what impresses me the most is the character animation.<br/><br/>The songs are hit or miss, that's what you get for most musicals. The one song that stands out for me and I feel is the most memorable is ""At last I see the Light"" which is just beautiful, it is a song of course about the romance between both Flynn and Rapunzel but also about discovering your dreams.<br/><br/>However it's the story and characters I really love the best. Supporting character Maxamus is great, he's sort of like Duddley Do Right's horse. Like in that cartoon the horse seems to be doing a better job at exercising authority than Duddley. And I really like the buddy dynamic between both Flynn and Maxamus, there is always something really fun and touching about seeing two characters on different sides of the fence working together and bonding, we see both of them giving each other grief but also getting along and both do come though and work together.<br/><br/>Rapunzel is great (voiced by underrated actress Mandy Moore)she's beautiful inside and out, sweet, funny, has just great charisma, energetic, and ambitious. I just love how much of a free spirit she truly is, despite being locked up in a tower most of her life her spirit will always be free. And she is a bit reluctant at times which is normal, but I like that she does go on and becomes more confidant in her actions which is something I can emphasize with. And also she's she is able to hold her own against danger.<br/><br/>It's interesting just seeing her use non cleche items, from a frying pan which surprisingly becomes useful as a weapon though out the whole film, hey there's no weapon store/pawn shop nearby to buy a sword so it makes sense. But I really love how she uses her hair which is just amazing, you would think anyone with overlong hair would have trouble walking. But here Rapunzel we see her use to it and it's interesting seeing how well she managed maneuvering without any trouble. Her hair is indeed very useful, from acting as a lasso but most importantly she has a magical ability which is her hair is able to glow not just to light the way in the dark, but to heal fatal wounds.<br/><br/>I even like how she seems to have this blissful affect on most people, like in that scene with the Vikings in the bar, it was kinda funny how her charm got them to reveal themselves for not being just stereotypical brute but people with dreams and needs like ourselves. But she's a character also a character that you do feel sympathy for, from the back story which is pretty sad, she's practically been a slave/prisoner most of her life unknowingly; so years of Rapunzel's life have been stolen from her let alone time with her real parents. It's just not right, that all the more gives us reason why we want Rapunzel to win, she's was meant to live free and meant to have real love in her life.<br/><br/>But of course my favorite character is Flynn Rider (played well by Zachary Levi) he sort of reminds me The Prince of Theves character from the TV show ""Hercules the Legendary Journeys"" like that character he's a real con man whom is pretty much looking out for number one and trying to get rich quick. Is a bit shallow since he has a bit of narcissism but in a harmless sense. This is the kind of guy whom would probably be one of the last choices to save the princess but he had the luck of the draw, and hey not all heroes are perfects but sometimes to me their the best kind. He's got great charisma which is fun, clever and funny, just has some of the best lines in the film.<br/><br/>I also like you even feel a slight sense of sympathy for him, because Flynn isn't entirely all cheerful he's been alone most of his life so he's kinda lonely; but worst of all he has no real dreams because he doesn't really know what he wants in his life let alone what he was looking for; despite how many things he stole he still has nothing. But that's because he's been looking for the wrong thing.<br/><br/>I love the chemistry between both Rapunzel and Flynn, it's funny how both of them give each other grief. But then both of them after a long while open up to one another and warm up to each other. I like how both of them bring out something inside each other they never felt before, for Rapunzel it's a sense of adventure and freedom but for Flynn it's unselfishness and warmth. Both are right for each other you know Rapunzel's place isn't in the tower but with Flynn and Flynn has finally found what he was looking for.<br/><br/>If the film has a message it's about not being afraid to make you dreams come true, do everything in your power or what is necessary to make it possible. But most importantly to never stop dreaming and pursuing them.<br/><br/>Just like Rapunzel hair this film glows.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

","There are Disney films you watch as a kid, that you watch it again as an adult several years later, it holds up and sometimes even better. I stopped pretending I ""outgrew"" Disney. I re-watched Disney films last year, starting with Hunchback of Notre Dame, which is awesome.<br/><br/>Tangled is a little different. I was a 17 year old well into High School, so of course I wasn't going to rush to see this film. I pretty much avoided it, but two years and several positive reviews later, I could no longer avoid it. I watched it and...<br/><br/>I LOVED IT! It doesn't matter if it came out when you were in high school, I'm 19 and in college. I saw it last night, and I loved it. I can't explain the film, don't read people's opinions, go watch it, with no word on what everyone else thought. Just watch it and see what you think for yourself, right now! I don't know why I love it but I did. Enough said. <br/><br/>I heard it has some problems, but I ignored those flaws. My two all time favorite films; ""Lord of the Rings"" and the ""Dark Knight"" have flaws and plot holes, do I think less of them for that? Of course not! I kept an open mind for Tangled and got sucked in to this film and loved every minute of what I saw.<br/><br/>I will definitely watch it again. If you think you ""outgrew"" Disney, watch this, and you'll change your mind. Trust me."

After watching part of the movie, I actually came home and finished the rest. A couple of my classmates, also males, admitted they did the same and loved the movie as well. This movie is for any age group, and whether the viewer is a 3 year old girl or a 16 year old boy, they will love it. This is the first movie that has touched me in a long time. It is humorous, action-packed, emotional, and original. The CGI is so realistic and perfect, everything is exactly how one would picture the events as they happen in real life. The characters are witty and funny, all with their own contributions that make the story so great. I cannot describe why, but this movie deeply impacted me. I find clips of the movie popping into my head at random moments, and I think about it repeatedly throughout the day. I have watched it over and over again, never getting tired of it. I really hope that they decide to make a sequel, because this is one of the best movies I have seen, and my peers all agree.

","Being a 26 year old male that usually finds action/scifi type movies more preferable, I did not expect that I would end up liking this film. My dad set up a 3d projector system at home and we've been struggling to find good 3d content, so as a last effort a week ago we purchased Tangled 3D. After watching the film at length, I was pleasantly entertained. A lot of animated children's' films seem rather cheesy to me, but this one was different. I would have to say that the film excelled in character development, and that was what set it apart from many others. The characters have memorable personalities that draw you in, and overall the film evokes a dynamic range of emotional sensationalism from comical, to happy, to sad. At its conclusion, it leaves you with a feel-good type of movie-watching experience. Altogether, the textures and the 3D looked gorgeous on our home 3D system. Overall, definitely a film worth having. You will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Thats it for my 2 cents worth."

","I don't know what you're all talking about! Tangled is an excellent movie, with a deeply touching plot and the most wonderful music (well OK, it's not amazing but still very good) and characters that bring life to the once known as boring fairytale Rapunzel. SouthSideChgo-Disney puts twists in every story! That's why people like it! You should appreciate their creativity! Personally I love the contrast between low-life thief and high-flying princess-it simply shows its not your position that decides your love and personality! I really love Flynn's charming personality and Rapunzel's tough-chic yet sweet style of doing things. Pascal and Maximus are two of the most amusing animal characters I have ever seen. The animation is smooth and gives a real fresh feeling for such an old tale. The original songs are entertaining. It's literally flawless! Tangled certainly beats any other animated Disney movie-a fresh, fun twist on a old, almost gloomy tale. Well done Disney!"

","Tangled's got everything you'd expect from a fairy tale movie. Obviously you've got the Princess, the dashing Prince-like love interest, the evil motherly figure, the quirky townsfolk and of course, the expansive castle. Originally titled 'Rapunzel', it's based on the classic German fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm of a magically long-maned Princess who's locked in a tower by her wicked, selfish 'mother.' Disney apparently changed the title to be more appealing to boys who might be deterred from seeing a Princess flick. They also argued that Rapunzel isn't the only main character in the film, as Flynn Rider is also featured prominently in the film. Instead of a traditional prince, Rider is a thief on the run who stumbled upon her and inadvertently changed her world forever.<br/><br/>Whether or not the title-switch tactic worked, this one was a real winner for Disney. It's grossed more than half a billion dollars worldwide, more than double the cost to make. Yep, 'Tangled' cost $260 million to produce, perhaps a lot of it goes to the 3D rendering, and it shows. The Wiki article mentioned that the filmmakers combined 'the best of both worlds' of CGI technology and traditional hand-drawn animation Disney's famous for and the result is impressive. This is by far one of the most picturesque and colorful animated features I've ever seen and the animation is smooth and seamless. I really was in awe of how gorgeous every scene is, with the night scene of the two main characters on a boat surrounded by lanterns. It was nothing short of magical.<br/><br/>This Princess flick has come a long way from the classics as far as the character goes. Rapunzel is a heck of a lot more assertive and strong but never losing her naiveté and vulnerability. She's bubbly and vivacious but not dim-witted. Her interaction with Flynn from the moment they met is endearing right from the start, but it's refreshing to see that she's not immediately swooning over the guy despite he's the first one she's ever met. Flynn is the typical charming bad boy, self-seeking at first but finds his heart over time. Voiced by Mandy Moore and CHUCK's Zachary Levi, it's a lovely combination that's supported by an equally wonderful supporting cast. In fact, the two non-talking animal characters, Maximus the horse and Pascal the little chameleon are such lovable and memorable creatures, while Tony-award-winning Donna Murphy is excellent in the voice role of villainous Mother Gothel.<br/><br/>As with any Disney's works, especially when 8-time-Oscar-winner Alan Menken is involved, the music is one of the best part of the movie. All the musical segments are lively and just pleasing to the ear, with 'I See The Light' as my absolute favorite, it was such a lovely duet. The lantern scene when the song appears is my favorite as well, yes it's on the schmaltzy side but you'd be hard pressed to deny its charm.<br/><br/>Tangled's plot reminds me a bit of 'Little Mermaid' (a girl longing for freedom and Pascal is like the new Sebastian) and part of 'Sleeping Beauty' (she's separated from her parents all her life), but yet it's still a pretty unique story that kept me laughing and crying throughout. I also like the fact that Disney keeps this one pretty clean and wholesome, as a lot of animated features these days are filled with crude jokes and inappropriate innuendos. By the end I was totally enamored by this movie and the Blu-ray is now on its way from Amazon :) <br/><br/>Disney still reigns when it comes to romantic animated features and this one is definitely a keeper for years to come."

","I've grown up watching Disney movies all my life. So many princess movies I've seen, and Tangled had blown me away. Absolutely loved it. It's not just because I thought Flynn Rider was a gorgeous animated character only, but because the movie itself was great. The storyline was great, and I prefer this over the original Rapunzel storyline. The movie got me teary a bit, but that's just me. I'm quite sensitive to movies like this. I think I've watched it six times now, and I haven't gotten tired of it. The soundtrack is great too! Different varieties of music incorporated into the movie.

","I am one of the few people who has seen and enjoyed every single animated movie ever released by Walt Disney since Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs, but when I saw the trailer for this movie, I put my head in my hands and thought ""Oh, my God, this could be the downfall of animated Disney."" So when I went to the cinema with my mum to see it, I went in with a mixture of hope, excitement and dread. The lights went down, the movie started and an hour and a half later, I waltzed out of the cinema in a blaze of happiness, because I knew that for the 50th time in 73 years, Disney had produced an animated masterpiece. The music and songs, composed by Alan Menken, are as good as any from the Renaissance. The plot, while originally being rather ""Grimm"", is slightly altered in this movie but still true to the story in essentials. The movie, all in all, is a balanced blend of action, comedy and romance and I loved it."

"lisafordeay","10","7","10","5 February 2011"," HANDS down my all time favourite movie ever
","As a lover for fairy tales like The Little Mermaid ,Beauty & the Beast and Aladdin,Disney went downhill with their last movie The Princess & the Frog and since then there wasn't a decent flick since 2007's Enchanted which was my all time favorite animated/live action movie.<br/><br/>Yesterday I went to the cinemas by myself and I saw Tangled. Tangled is an up to date version of the classic Brother Grimns story Rapunzel. The story opens with a male voice telling the tale about a princess who was abducted by an evil woman named Mother Gothel who stoled the baby from her parents as she has healing magic powers that can heal and turn an old person back into their youthful form. <br/><br/>Apparently the princesses's mother was sick and the guards from the palace found a healing flower and that is why Gothel stole the child. Fast forward a few years later and Rapunzel(voiced by MANDY MOORE)wishes to see the lantern lights as they appear every year for her birthday and she was celebrating her 18th birthday but Mother Gothel(voiced by DONNA MURPHY)doesn't want Rapunzel to leave the tower ever. <br/><br/>Meanwhile a dashing rogue thief named Flynn Rider(who's real name is Eugene Fitzherbert)(voiced by Zac Levi)steals a crown from the palace and as he tries to find the perfect hideout for the stolen crown he spots a isolated tower and climbs up to the top,little does he realize he gets hit by a frying pan(yeah a frying pan )from Rapunzel who thinks Flynn is interested in her long 70ft blonde hair which glows when she sings that HEALING INCANTATION song. She hides the satchel where Flynn can't find it and she makes a deal with him that she will give it back to him if he takes her to see the lanterns for her 18th birthday and as she leaves her tower for the first time in 18 years she is about to go on a hair-raising hilarious adventure where she falls in love,and sees the outside world for the first time.<br/><br/>The animation in this film is so exquisite part of you would think its a live action movie and not CGI. The music(done by the brilliant composer of our generation ALAN MENKEN)was brilliant and memorable especially the songs I SEE THE LIGHT(both sung by LEVI & MOORE),WHEN WILL MY LIF E BEGIN,and the villain song MOTHER KNOWS BEST. The story was brilliant yet kind slow enough to follow but as the film progressed I fell head over heels in love with the charcthers and the story I never blinked not once and I never looked at my watch throughout the 1hr and 36 mins. <br/><br/>Mandy Moore was perfect for the voice role of Rapunzel I loved how her charcther progresses throughout the film and I love how she and Flynn(aka Eugene Fitzherbert I think this name is nice btw very Irish indeed)don't see eye to eye but they soon fall for one another when they see the lanterns (which was brilliant I must say I loved that part)and sing the song I SEE THE LIGHT(brilliant love song I can't get the song out of my head).ZAC LEVI was so hilarious in this film ('Her hair glows why does her hair glow' or 'Oh no no no this is not good they just can't get my nose right) I think Eugene Fitzherbert is the hottest Disney charcther alive. <br/><br/>One scene that had me in tears(well almost)was the part where he apparently dies and before that he chops off Rapunzel's 70 ft hair that turns back into brown and he dies. She sings that healing song and her tears brought him back to life. The finale was so cute and heartwarming. <br/><br/>TANGLED is without a doubt one of the best Disney animated films I have ever seen in my entire life since Beauty & the Beast(yes people it was THAT GOOD). Its got romance,memorable music,lovable charcthers,heartwarming ending,hilarious moments from the horse Maximus who had me in tears of laughter and the cute chameleon Pascal who uses his tongue to wake up Eugene when he gets knocked out from the frying pan incident and exquisite animation. I may be 19 going on 20 but this was the best 1 hr and 36 Min's of my life. Simply enchanting.<br/><br/>BEST QUOTE:Eugene Fitzhebert: ""You were my new dream""<br/><br/>Rapunzel:(cries)""And you were mine""<br/><br/>BEST SCENE: The lantern scene was amazing I simply loved it so much.<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>The part where Flynn almost dies and he sacrifice's Rapunzel's hair by chopping it all off. <br/><br/>If you liked Stardust(evil woman wants girl for youth),Anastasia(lost princess falls for a bad boy),Shrek(hilarious adult humor), and The Little mermaid(boat scene)you will love this.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Tangled is an instant classic that should be treasured for the rest of your life.<br/><br/>10/10 Brilliant simply amazing I am in love with this film. Move over Princess & the frog this film is here to stay. But I hope they won't decide to do a sequel as it will ruin the magic in this film."
"neil-476","10","7","10","4 February 2011"," One of Disney's best
","Tangled is advertised as Disney's 50th animated movie. In many respects, it is also the first - the first movie to tell one of the traditional fairy stories (in the way that the classic animated tales, starting with Snow White, did) using the classic type of Disney character design, but to do so using CGI and 3D.<br/><br/>I thought this film was great. It looked like a classic Disney movie, but with the CGI lushness which today's audiences have come to expect. The slender story of Rapunzel is fleshed out nicely with additional story elements, none of which betray an audience expecting a traditional fairy story, and it races along, full of excitement, action, humour, suspense and emotion. And yet there is sufficient in the way of modern sensibilities that a 21st century audience will not feel adrift.<br/><br/>The characters are extremely well realised. All the supporting characters are fun (particular the animal sidekicks and the den of thieves), and the three main characters are exceptionally well done. Villain Mother Gothel is splendidly duplicitous, often funny, great looking, and wonderfully voiced by Donna Murphy. Flynn Rider is a lovable rogue straight out of the textbook, but with sufficient character not to be simply a cardboard cut-out. And Rapunzel herself is beautiful, and heart-achingly human in facing the dilemma of doing what she is driven to do while facing the fact that this is a betrayal of her mother's wishes (essentially the same dilemma Ariel faced in The Little Mermaid, but realised far better - and I thought Mermaid was a nearly perfect film!).<br/><br/>The songs are satisfactory, but Glen Slater is no Howard Ashman - the lyrics are good, but they don't sparkle.<br/><br/>And did I mention that this film looks fabulous? Every aspect of the visuals is perfectly realised, and looks simply stunning. The 3D is ever present but not intrusive. It enhances - sometimes significantly, but not to the extent that the film is poorer for its absence.<br/><br/>If I may get a bit spoilery, there is an element towards the end which reminded me of both Beauty And The Beast and Shrek - one of the characters displays an unexpected element of self-sacrifice and, in so doing, cuts off an escape route, following which something wonderful happens and all ends well. In each of these cases I was aware of being emotionally manipulated. But, by gum, it works! My 9-year old companion was wiping tears away, and so was I, even though I was expecting the miraculous turn-around which followed.<br/><br/>I loved this film."

One day, the tiny world she knows is turned upside down when an intruder enters her tower.<br/><br/>I knew ""Tangled"" would be sweet and happy as it is a Disney film, but still it surpassed all my saccharine expectations. The characters are so adorable, even the minor supporting characters such as the clever chameleon and dog-like horse. Some of the plot is delivered by songs, which adds to the merry atmosphere. There are so many really funny jokes for all ages, basically the whole film made us laugh hard! ""Tangled"" is a great animation, with a sweet story and is very entertaining."
"threedbomb","10","7","10","9 January 2011"," Animation excellence
","This review won't really be useful to many people as I come at this film as an animation student. There have been precious few 2D or 3D animated productions that cam capture your heart and mind. We have the giants like Spirited away and Grave of the Fireflies in the 2D world and really anything from Pixar except Cars to love. Precious few others. Ice Age nailed it but most Dreamworks productions fail to capture the sheer brilliance that can be a character in motion. Despicable Me is another that just brought the characters to life and here with Tangled, we have that same excellence in character animation. Every character from the adorable chameleon to the angry horse are characters you'll love, not because of the story but simply because of the level of animation at play here.<br/><br/>There's an extra level of realism in this movie that you don't normally see too. There are moments during the movie where a characters face isn't seen and you lose sight of the fact it's just stylized 3D animation. The water scenes are particularly stand out brilliant cinematic moments with incredible realism. These scenes must have been globally illuminated to death. I dare not guess how long these frames must have taken to render.<br/><br/>But just like any special effects heavy movie, without a great story and equally great performance, you'll soon tire of it. Tangled doesn't disappoint there. The story is great fun, inventive and very much a wild spin on a very old fairytale. The performances from the real voice actors are devilishly good. It's surprising there weren't more BIG names doing the voices but satisfying to know that this really doesn't matter. The actors aren't phoning in these lines, they are nuanced, operatic and multi layered really helping give the animated characters much more depth.<br/><br/>For me it's the tiny moments that make the movie, not just the great slapstick moments but the way the characters emote. Rapunzel isn't sure of a new character entering the scene? Sure she has that look of trepidation and fear but the emoting is so dynamic and rich that you can almost see the characters thinking their emotions through from moment to moment. It's quite intense and I found myself a number of times being drawn towards the screen, feeling what Rapunzel was feeling. Almost mirroring the emotions as you might do with while talking to a great friend or partner.<br/><br/>So as I said at the beginning, this review probably not going to be so good for the average viewer wanting to find out whether to take the kids to see this but if you appreciate animation as an art form or even appreciate the technical skill involved in animation as pure entertainment. You must see this, you must go and see it again and then you must buy it, download it or otherwise get your hands on this and have it in your collection for happily, ever, after."
"preppy-3","10","7","10","30 December 2010"," GREAT CGI Disney film!
","Disney takes the tale of Repunzel and makes a few changes. Repunzel (voice of Mandy Moore) is taken away from her royal parents at an early age. She was kidnapped by Mother Gothel (voice of Donna Murphy) because Rapunzel's long golden hair helped keep her young (it's complicated but the movie explains it). She keeps Rapunzel in a tower warning her to NEVER go outside. Then robber Flynn Ryder (voice of Zachery Levi) gets into the tower and gets Rapunzel out. Then a series of fantastic (but fun) adventures take place.<br/><br/>First off I should mention I saw this in 2-D NOT 3-D (I refuse to pay $15.50 for an animated feature). Still I LOVED it. It's Disney's first (I think) GCI feature and it works beautifully. The characters look real and the settings are incredible. It's like one of the best Pixar features. The script is fast and funny with jokes that mange to appeal to the kids AND adults equally. The voices match the characters expertly and I got a BIG kick out of Flynn Ryder (obviously modeled after Errol Flynn). There are also two CGI animals--Pascal (a chameleon) and Maximus (a horse)--that are hysterical! They don't talk but their facial expressions alone had me laughing out loud! It IS PG for some (very mild) violence but I don't think it would bother the kids. The little girl sitting behind me couldn't have been more than 6 and it didn't bother her at all! It was fast, funny and full of adventure and humor! I was never bored for one second. A 10 all the way!!!"

Someone was really giving an eye to detail with this character. The movie in 3D was very entertaining and magical. It made me feel as if I was in Disney World. This movie has all the great Disney ingredients: vivid color, action, humor, incredible animation, a wonderful story and a happy ending! The animal characters as well as the human characters are so entertaining and with the 3D you feel they are almost in your lap.

","It was about time that any animation studio would make a film based on one of my favorite fairy-tales Rapunzel, and I was glad Disney is the studio to make it. I had seen the film only last weekend, and I thought it was awesome.<br/><br/>The film goes like this : A magical golden flower, with the power to heal, was born from one ray of sunshine. An nasty woman know as Gothel, uses the flower's power to restore her youth and beauty. While centuries later, a kingdom was built, and just as the king and queen were going to have a baby, the pregnant queen became very ill. The people searched the land for the golden flower. Until the royal army had spotted the flower, and bought it back to the queen. Then a baby girl (Rapunzel), was born to the royal couple, and everyone in the land was happy. All except jealous, spiteful Gothel, who had learned that Rapunzel's golden hair retains the flower's healing abilities as long as it isn't cut, so she kidnaps the child and isolates her in a tower, raising the girl as her own daughter. However, every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom sends thousands of floating lanterns into the sky longing for their lost princess to return.<br/><br/>Eighteen years later, a thief known as Flynn Rider, steals the lost princess' tiara, and escapes the guards. Then he came upon Rapunzel's tower for a hiding place. Once he had scaled the tower, Flynn was held by the girl with the long hair.Rapunzel then strike a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to travel to the place where the floating lights come from that she has seen every year on her birthday.

"Benjamin_406","10","7","10","5 December 2010"," A Genuine Gem Next to the Fab Four of Disney Animation!
","Right after Disney's acquisition of Pixar and ""Meet the Robinsons"", Walt Disney Animation Studios were on the right track of finding its true identity, under the watchful eyes of Ed Catmull and John Lasseter. First, ""Bolt"" and ""the Princess and the Frog"" became better than ""Meet the Robinsons"", earning high level of critical acclaim. Now WDAS' 50th animated feature, ""Tangled"", is not only the best WDAS film of 2007-2010, but, too, a rare film that gets to rank among films from the Disney Renaissance - mainly, ""the Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""the Lion King"".<br/><br/>If you think I'm talking crazy about Tangled's ranks among the Fab Four, then there are things that you might want and need to notice: finding one's true identity as the main story theme, cleverly executed humor, strong and appealing personalities of the characters, immensely fantastic music and songs, infinitely superb character designs (under the supervision of Disney animator Glen Keane), emotion-stirring moments, and MOST IMPORTANTLY the reinventing of everything in the move. As a big plus, stereoscopic 3-D enhances the humor, the action, the magical moments and the tear-jerking moments of the story, most notably the lanterns in the ""I See the Light"" sequence.<br/><br/>There's a special difference between ""the Princess and the Frog"" and ""Tangled"". TPATF emphasizes on elements of Disney tradition (princes and princesses, certain talking animal sidekicks, and toe-tapping songs) over the theme of the story, whereas ""Tangled"" emphasizes on the story's theme over the elements of the film's tradition. That qualifies the film to become an instant animated classic among ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""the Lion King"".<br/><br/>I used to be concerned on Tangled's story structure as below the potential of Toy Story 3's story structure, but after a lot of positive reviews and ratings, I now believe that this deserves to have the insurmountable love, much like the Fab Four."

","Like many of you, I was not expecting much from this movie. Being years ago since I first saw it, I'm not sure what exactly was the cause of my hesitation. This movie proved me wrong.<br/><br/>However, it could very well have been my hesitation and low expectations that led me to enjoy it so much that first time. That does not explain the absolute love I have for this movie in my multiple rewatchings of it.<br/><br/>On the surface, it could be your basic movie. However, it's when you think about it, that's when it snares you. The villain in this movie is so much more frightening because I can relate to the dynamic between her and Rapunzel. The subtle abuse (and it is abuse, even if it is emotional) just chills me to the bone.<br/><br/>This is also the first Disney Princess Movie I can recall (Mulan notwithstanding) where it was not all about the love story. The love story wasn't secondary, but it worked well in tandem with the story that ran parallel with it. (Plus, I'm a huge sucker for stories where the love evolves, almost as I adore Unrequited Love.)<br/><br/>There are so many points I can make about this movie. If I sat here and listed them all, I could probably have it published.<br/><br/>One note, though. While Maximus was awesome, Pascal got on my nerves to no end at first. Over time, he's grown on me."

I think it is a cute movie, and sure it has it's cliché moments, but then again, how many movies are completely 100% original? Do some research and you'll find that almost every movie follows the exact same pattern.<br/><br/>As for some reviews about the body image issue, I believe this movie does more help for girls. At the end when she cute her hair and it turns brown she id STILL looked at as beautiful an officially regains the princess title with her short brown hair. I personally believe that should strengthen a little girl's self conscious. As for people complaining about graphics and the ""unrealistic nature"" it is a kids movie. It is called a cartoon for a reason..and that isn't because it is supposed to look like a real human. The scenery looks pretty real to me, as well as some of the character feature, and although the proportions may be off it still catches peoples' attention.<br/><br/>Overall I love this movie and seriously cannot understand why so many adults are critiquing it so harshly when it is primarily made for kids!

","Disney's fiftieth animated feature is an appropriation of the Rapunzel fairytale. We are told that a magic flower was found to cure a sick queen as she was giving birth to her daughter Rapunzel (Mandy Moore). Gothel (Donna Murphy), an evil old woman, learnt that the healing power of the flower was embodied in Rapunzel's hair. Gothel kidnaps the baby Rapunzel and locks her in a tower for eighteen years, telling her that she is her real mother and ensuring that her long golden hair is never cut to preserve the powers. Every year on Rapunzel's birthday her parents prepare a light show, hoping that she will return. Rapunzel wishes to see the lights for herself and asks her Gothel if she can be let out of the castle. Gothel dismisses the request, stating that it is too dangerous. Meanwhile, a thief named Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) is being hunted for stealing a tiara. During his escape he stumbles upon Rapunzel's hidden tower while Gothel is out. Rapunzel knocks him out and hides the jewel. When he awakens she promises to only tell him where it is as long as he takes her to see the lights in the sky and he reluctantly agrees. <br/><br/>As Pixar have worked to bridge the gap between animation and more humanist narratives, Disney has returned to an old fashioned and exaggerated brand of filmmaking. Tangled feels like the sort of film that Disney would have made back in the early 90s. It's driven more by playful, slapstick humour and action rather than a multilayered plot. Yet the two main characters (voiced very enthusiastically by Levi and Moore) at least have some consciousness about their identities. Rapunzel's ethical dilemma stems from being an adolescent girl on the verge of adulthood. She is divided by feelings of excitement and anxiety to explore the real world. Rider's own identity is eventually revealed to be as fabricated as hers too, lending some minor but welcome variations to the standard Disney coming of age tale. The film is also a musical too but thankfully there are just a few of these needless numbers. Unless you are a fan of Mandy Moore's singing voice these songs just seemed dated. The lyrics are just a little too cute and clean, rather than memorable and edgy. <br/><br/>Tangled is showing in 2D and 3D but the former showcases the film at its most luminous. The visual scheme is continuously bright, making strong use of the primary colours and enriching the film's expansive, green landscapes. In the final quarter of the film there is one sequence that is so charming and quietly beautiful that it will eventually become a signature image of Disney pictures. Interestingly, the film's very warm and cute feel is in many ways representative of Rapunzel's optimism. The colour found when her feet touch the grass for the very first time is contrasted with darker tones to the aesthetics as the danger becomes more immediate. This is no more prominent than in a surprisingly fearless and emotional climax. If the rest of the film had taken more chances with its tone and narrative, Tangled would be far more than what it is: sweet family entertainment."

","'Tangled' is A Must Watch for Kids. The fairytale, the astounding animation, the wonderful 3D effects... it's an ideal baby film. As an adult, I too enjoyed the film, though, not totally.<br/><br/>After watching masterstrokes like 'Up' and 'Toy Story 3' recently, I've raised my expectations way too much from an animation flick. As I had heard the legend of Rapunzel as a kid, 'Tangled' didn't offer much novelty to me. But despite the popular story it adapts, the film holds you, especially in the first hour, which is superb. The only shortcoming in this love-story, is the overdose of Songs. They keep popping up, and one truly wishes if they weren't hammered so many times.<br/><br/>Looking from the point of view kids mainly, I suggest you do make your kids watch 'Tangled', as it will be a dazzling & memorable experience for them. And I'd say for those, who still are a kid at heart, do watch it... the spell-binding animation & 3D effects are sure to keep you energized."
"rkorisky1","10","16","29","13 November 2010"," BEST Disney MOVIE I have EVER seen A+++++
","How many different ways can the story of Rapunzel be told? This movie was AMAZING! I am a dad (in my late 40's), and have been to my share of Disney movies, this was phenomenal! The story, the animation, the music, the characters, the beauty, the comedy, the emotion, etc. were all first rate. Disney really hit the ball out of the park with this movie. This will be an amazing Broadway Show!! If you love Disney, and musicals, this movie is for you. It was the best $8.00 popcorn I ever bought, that's how great this movie was! You will not be disappointed. I do not want to tell you about the movie, but Mandy Moore does a great job. All the voice over artists were incredible. All the characters were unique, and the bar seen is a riot."

","Rapunzel's my favourite princess so when ""Tangled"" was announced there was no question about it: I had to watch it. Even if there was a chance I'd be disappointed I still had to. So I did, and was not at the very least disappointed! I had very little expectations because it was CGI, and that it was very new for Disney to do. I was surprised how much I really liked it. I loved it! I've watched this more than five or ten times (or maybe more...? I'm not quite sure) since it came out and will continue to re-watch many, many more times! :)<br/><br/>This is a very refreshing movie and I recommend it to everyone of every age. It doesn't disappoint."
"TourettesPersonal","9","8","13","13 February 2011"," Return Of Disney Magic
","My first glance of ""Tangled"" I thought it's gonna be an ordinary CGI Disney flick but it turns out to be a magical movie that brings back all the good memories of the old Disney movies. I honestly think ""Tangled"" is more magical than the recent Disney fairy tale movie ""Princess and the Frog"".<br/><br/>The new story of Rapunzel is quite clever & the songs recaptures the magic of Disney. I also liked the character development. Rapunzel is curious and adorable while Flynn Rider is an adventurous and some narcissist like attitude. The voice acting was great but the best performance goes to Donna Murphy the voice of Mother Gothel.<br/><br/>""Tangled"" is disappointing in the trailers but if you see the movie, you could feel the magic and it brings back the childhood days of Disney. My only problem of this movie the intro and the ending is too quick. But it's fun and entertaining for the whole family. ""Tangled"" will not disappoint you."
"bradconnelly23","10","6","9","20 July 2014"," I love this movie
","Honestly you are a complete butt hurt if you don't like this movie. Before I saw this I've never been real impressed with Disney as most of the songs annoy me and they are so cheesy. But this movie is fantastic it has scenes that made me laugh so hard. and I'm a 19 year old. Rider is a great character and easily one of the better princes in Disney's history because his down to earth attitude and not like others who act like people girls only dream of. He actually defines the laws of physics for Disney questioning many things that princesses do and no one questions. Rapunzel is great too she is the better looking princesses and in general shes really funny. Good job Disney you made me love one of your movies. If anyone rates this below an 8 that fine I hate you and you are wrong"
"tedg","Null","7","11","30 December 2010"," Drawing Love
","Sometimes the inner narrative is clear.<br/><br/>The outer narrative is fine enough to sell tickets to parents, thinking this is what their kids want and their kids returning the favor. You'll have to read elsewhere for how well this is done. What fascinates me is how obviously we can see what concerns the animators.<br/><br/>This is marketed not as a film in its own right, but as the 50th Disney animation. It is easy to see it as such, as a narrative about the artists.<br/><br/>Our heroine starts the film with her obsessive two-dimensional drawings, quite literally cartoons like the initial Disney era. In these is a depiction of an event that we discover is her dream, her wish. Following the princess formula, which Disney invented, we hear her ""wish song,"" about this dream. <br/><br/>The dream is fulfilled in ""paintery 3d"" as the main story.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, we are reminded that her memories and the projected cartoon of the entire film has been painted on the walls of her space. There is literally a moment where they start to merge. But in between we have the layer of that cartoon in the ""real world,"" meaning the three dimensional world of the current animation technology. In that layer, we have the quest for the three dimensional experience: the losing of the lantern kites on an anniversary.<br/><br/>When this came for me, I was overwhelmed. This was partially because the ""fold"" worked for me; The watched cartoon was on the walls and the real world was the one I shared with the characters. Disney first did this (to my knowledge) in their dinosaur movie where the ""cartoon"" was in cave paintings.<br/><br/>The ""lights"" was an extraordinarily well done adventure in framing, editing and camera angle selection. There is no Pixar influence here — this is all homegrown Disney and now that Pixar is worn out, we may see a new generation of animated cinema here.<br/><br/>Another reason it worked for me is the simple geometry of romantic imagination. Connection is spatial, extreme spatial experience where the senses and sense are overwhelmed. The lantern scene effectively did that for me and I admire its manipulative construction. This is very much an adult movie and very overtly sexual. The source images are in a space created by a sexually manipulative woman, managing a hidden fecund valley in which an overtly phallic tower houses our future stories.<br/><br/>So it is extremely easy for me to see this as a story about animation, folding and sex. Pure in each regard. It is not about love. It is about drawing love, and much more romantic as a result.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

"danielbiland","8","2","2","19 July 2019"," Good, Very Well Made Film
","This movie may be only a kids movie, but it is very well done and earns some good respect and credit in my book.<br/><br/>First of all, the wit and humor in this film is good; not just for a kids film, but in general. The visual and verbal jokes are clever and land pretty well for me. Second, there is a lot of detail and work put into the animation of the world of the film, and for that this movie deserves credit. There is so much expression in the eyes and face of not only Rapunzel, but also Pascall the chameleon. You can always tell the difference between the genuine emotional expressions of the characters, and the fake ones. That is really impressive for only a kids movie. Third, the romance in this film works really well; they spend a good amount of time developing the chemistry and the relationship of Flynn and Rapunzel which, once again, is really good for a kids movie. It makes the ending scene feel earned because the romance felt so... earned as well.<br/><br/>Fourth, Mother Gothel is a good, very cleverly done villain. This passed way over my head when I first saw the film both in January 2011 (in cinema) and in December 2013, when I was still very young. But when I saw the film when I was 15, I caught on to how the villain is actually a quite well done character. This is because, once again, the movie goes beyond the call of duty with her. You see, they could have just had the Mother try in a forceful way to keep Rapunzel in the tower, but what the writer (Dan Fogelman) did instead was write an emotionally and mentally manipulative villain. A villain who you can still see clearly is the villain because of how manipulative she is, but is still indirect enough to be seen as not a straight-up, violent, confrontational villain like the conventional ones we get in most mainstream films.<br/><br/>Fifth, Alan Menken's score in this film is good- great by kid's movie standards. The score in the Kingdom Dance scene is very well written and composed. Not only that, but the score throughout the whole experience is well made and enjoyable too. I know this point is only subjective to me, but film quality is generally quite subjective for the most part anyway.<br/><br/>Sixth, the attention to detail in this movie is awesome. We get so many subtle details of the characters making decisions in their heads, realizing stuff, and so on. This helps direct and explore the story so much more and makes the story a lot more sophisticated than it seems. Once again the writer and directors are going way beyond the call of duty, and that deserves credit.<br/><br/>Now, despite all the good things about this film, it does have some problems that hold it back . A lot of these are very subjective to me, but I feel I need to list them anyway. First of all, the soundtrack (while overall good) gives me a 'ehh' feeling at quite a few scenes. The score (at these times) gives me a boring, 'kids movie' feel to it that makes me wonder whether the filmmakers want me to even get engaged in or take the film seriously. Take the scene where Maximus finally catches up to Rapunzel and Flynn about halfway through the film. This (from a pure plot perspective) should be a mildly tense scene. But the soundtrack feels so... empty. And since the movie is so comedic up to this point, I don't know what to feel; to laugh, to be engaged, no clue. And so the scene just comes off as awkward to me. Not to mention that the character designs are so strongly simplistic and cartoony that I struggle to take any of this seriously. Now, I know this is meant to be a kids movie, so this might just be a problem with me, but the characters feel so childishly animated and oversimplified that the film feels like a bit of a farce or joke. However, the film takes itself seriously at quite a few points, but I struggle to for the reasons above. This is all just me though, so take it with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>Another problem is that I struggle to tell what a lot of the scenes are trying to be, for a few reasons. Mainly because of the structure of the film. I'll try to explain.
Take the opening of the first scene of Flynn rider for example. The music is pretty good in this scene, but I don't know whether I'm meant to be engaged (by the suspenseful music) or simply watch the characters climb the tower. Since the movie is so comedic so far, I don't know whether to get engaged or not. Also, because the feel of the film is all so goofy and campy just from the cartoony visuals, I can't even tell what it's trying to be. Once again, all this is just me, so don't let it soak in you if this doesn't affect you.<br/><br/>On the whole, Tangled is a very well made, good film that is likely worth a watch if you are interested in a sophisticated children's film, but has some problems for me."

","Everyone knows the story. The girl, Rapunzel, with the golden hair, kept up in a tower. She is only visited by one person who controls her. Of course, unless she were headstrong, nothing would happen in this film. And, of course, she is. Also, we know that to fulfill her dreams a guy is going to show up. This time, however, the rules get changed a bit and the formula is broken as well. I didn't gravitate toward this one as much as previous Disney films, but it was still very good. I think the title is great. I think the plot moves along at a nice pace and Rapunzel is quite interesting. Once again, the animation is superior."
"Sweetigal85","10","2","2","25 June 2017"," The greatest version of Rapunzel EVER
","This movie is simply the greatest version of Rapunzel that has ever been told. As a kid, this was always one of my least favorite stories. It was definitely lacking structure and depth, but Disney imbued their magic into its pages and made it a dazzling work of art.<br/><br/>Rapunzel is a fabulous very first CGI princess and Mandy Moore was an amazing choice, both for her delightfully sweet speaking/singing voice and her general whimsicality. Mandy Moore has now ascended to stardom as one of the legendary Disney Princesses.<br/><br/>From start to finish, it is a feast for the eyes and envelops you completely in the magical story. Rapunzel is the very first Disney princess to possess any kind of magic!!! Yes, magic has been clearly present in every other princess movie, but think about it...none of the princesses ever wielded any form of magic themselves until now. So that makes this movie groundbreaking just for that alone.<br/><br/>In the original, the male love interest was the prince, so I am glad they jazzed this version up and made him a lovable thief instead. Flynn is an amazing character and he and Rapunzel have one of the greatest meet cutes of all time. <br/><br/>It is very Shakespearean that the audience knows that Gothel is NOT Rapunzel's mother and that she does NOT possess this knowledge as we do. We also know that she is the lost princess and that Gothel is stalking her with the Stabbington brothers who are stalking Flynn for revenge. Very poetic and well done.<br/><br/>Every single song was gold. They were catchy and whimsical and the lyrics were apt and beautiful. The animal companions which are usually my least favorite part of every Disney movie were actually terrific in this film. It makes sense that Rapunzel would have flocked to some sort of creature in her lonely tower so Pascal's presence is believable and not just crowbarred in like many others. The horse Maximus is absolutely hilarious and actually serves the plot tremendously.<br/><br/>The redeemable villains were very well done, particularly Flynn's. His backstory as Eugene Fitzherbert is extremely touching as well as his transformation from common thief to Rapunzel's lover.<br/><br/>What is refreshingly different about Flynn and Rapunzel's romance is that they did not have a typical love at first sight reaction like most Disney couples do. True, they were definitely both attracted to each other right away, but love blossomed between them as their epic journey commenced. To me, this makes it all the more meaningful.<br/><br/>The ending was unexpectedly dark and I wish Disney dared to go down paths like this more often. There is always that classic moment in every Disney movie were you are legitimately terrified that the character in peril is really going to die (Whereas in Lion King, they actually DO)It is so beautiful that Rapunzel was actually going to sacrifice the rest of her life to being Gothel's fountain of youth, just to save the man she loved. And Flynn reciprocated this beauty by not allowing her to snuff out her light to restore his. When he says ""But if you do this, you will die."" He surely meant that if she goes through with being Gothel's slave for all eternity, she will cease to be the wonderful soul that she is now. Such torturous treatment would drain her and cause the light in her eyes to wither and die, even if she persisted to live because of the magical flower. So that is why Flynn frees her from her curse and chops of all her precious hair, even though that means sacrificing himself. People argue that he could have let her heal him and THEN chopped off her hair, but he refused to use her for her power just like Gothel and the rest of the world would have wanted to. The rhyme that activates the flower is beautiful and when Rapunzel cries onto Flynn's face, I personally believe that this is the very last of her healing powers leaking out of her now that the power of the golden flower has been severed. Their kiss is beautiful, I absolutely love how Rapunzel seizes the lapels of his shirt and yanks him toward her. The look of delighted surprise on his face when she does this is so adorable. I really love how powerful and forceful Disney princesses have become. And then later on in the end, she dips him instead of him dipping her. I love it! Gothel's demise is poetically and brilliantly executed and it goes to show how sweet Rapunzel is that she still reaches out helplessly toward the despicable woman she loved and knew to be her mother.<br/><br/>My absolute favorite part of the whole movie is when Rapunzel's parents see her again and the mother just knows it is her by looking in her eyes and touching her face. I thought it was really beautiful and interesting that they chose to not have the parents speak at all, they displayed all of their emotions through facial expressions and gestures. My favorite moment is when Rapunzel and her parents drop to the floor in their ecstatic embrace and the queen reaches out her hand to Eugene. He goes to bow to her but she seizes his hand and pulls him into their embrace and thus welcomes him without question into their family because he is the man who returned Rapunzel to them and who loves their daughter. So beautiful! I really stand by that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. It has something for everyone. Love, adventure, betrayal, humor, heart-warming songs. This is definitely one of the funniest Disney movies of all time. The humor between them is very carefully scripted and honestly I think better suits an older crowd. But kids can still appreciate the slapstick with the frying pan haha.<br/><br/>LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!!!"
"dobygp-75820","10","2","2","26 March 2017"," A film to watch again and again.
","This film is wonderful on many different levels. I encourage anyone seeing this film to explore its back story, for its creation is a result not only of the skill of the Disney team, but of history and circumstance. I will comment on what makes it very good, and then what makes it truly amazing.<br/><br/>What makes it very good:<br/><br/>1. It's a tight story with plenty of conflict. Rapunzel has much to overcome to reach both her stated and unstated goals. <br/><br/>2. A luscious overall look - Inspired by a French painting by Fragonard. <br/><br/>3. A beautiful musical score. It's true that you won't remember the songs like you might from ""The Lion King"", but they are still excellent and always pertinent to the story. The underscore is fabulous. <br/><br/>4.

The blending of 2D and 3D animation, led by the legendary Glen Keane, which leads to... <br/><br/>2. Rapunzel. A great movie, like a great book, is about emotions. Through the skill of the animators, we are continually shown the emotions of our blonde protagonist - this is what will lead you to watch the film again and again. In the remarkable campfire sequence, we feel Rapunzel's fear of being judged by Eugene, joy of Eugene's interest in her, protectiveness of her hair, confusion brought about by Gothel's emotional manipulation, fear of judgment once again, despair over not knowing what to do, and finally the irrepressible spirit that is her trademark. All this in just a few minutes of film.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."

"filipemanuelneto","9","2","2","30 November 2016"," One of the best Disney movies in years.
","This film is a reinterpretation of the traditional Rapunzel tale. Far from being just a children's movie, its a film for the whole family and has space for everything: it has songs, a beautiful novel, a well written script, good action sequences, hilarious moments... Basically, is one of the most positive and innovative Disney films in years.<br/><br/>Disney has had serious difficulties in recent years. Difficulties with his rivals (particularly Dreamworks) and some internal problems but, mainly, a kind of existential crisis where the creativity of his team was disappearing and giving us absolutely lamentable films. But this movie was a kind of turnaround, with the studio showing the public that its not yet exhausted. Returning to their own origins, which are the traditional children's tales, Disney artists sought to write a story that appealed to children and adults, and to look at the stories from a more current perspective. Thus, we can find in this film a Rapunzel that is dreamy, imaginative but not naive, shy but full of confidence and personality. After all, if the woman stopped being the weak sex and started to have a strongly active position in our society, why would not that be reflected in children's tales? It was a radical but positive change, which alters our way of seeing the story and allows us to play with it, inserting moments of action or humour.<br/><br/>Rapunzel is on the same level as Flynn, a rogue trickster she knows and who will try to help on her trip, and whom she saves in some situations. Mother Gothel is another important character for being the villain. Her characteristics are selfishness and vanity, but she's also somewhat seductive. In certain scenes, the way she seems to use seduction to achieve what she wants is halfway between the lines. Maximus, the guards' horse, has the mannerisms of a rowdy dog ​​and the intelligence of a human being, and can be highly hilarious.<br/><br/>The moments of action were well heeled, perfectly mixed with comical scenes without exaggeration. The jokes are intelligent, without falling into the temptation of easy laughter or being a goal in themselves. The animations and designs are excellent, with a graphic that reminds us of some of the films of Disney's golden age. The songs are good, they stay in the ear but they are far from the successes of the past."

","The story of a young woman, escapistic and romantic (well, would you expect something else from a girl who was sixteen years locked in a tower?) She quickly gets to the real world, discovers how unpleasant and dirty it is, but in some way ""infects"" the brutal robbers with her naive, blonde and ruddy optimism. There are also conflicts with other not-so- pleasant people (the Horse, and Mother Gothel, of course), but in the end, all that Shrek-like mockery becomes a parody of itself. It does, though, merge very well with romance and all that mi-mi-mi stuff. <br/><br/>So, the film is recommended to be seen both to the viewers who like spiteful twists over traditional fairy tales, and to the ones who just like a good bedtime story. You'll not be disappointed.<br/><br/>And -- Aw for that old man with angelic wings: he's the most fascinating robber ever!"
"wilkoskirachel","10","2","2","3 October 2016"," Tangled Review
","From its original form of 'Rapunzel', Byron Howard and Nathan Greno, the directors of ""Tangled"", have created a new and exciting film that will leave you cheerful and upbeat. ""Tangled"" is about a girl named Rapunzel who is curious and ecstatic to discover the world around her while ironically being locked in a tower her whole life. Through catchy songs and cute animation, ""Tangled"" is a warm, real, and bright movie that will captivate you instantly. Rapunzel has 50-foot-long golden blonde hair with healing powers and a bubbly personality whom everyone loves. The main male protagonist, Flynn Rider, stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower while being pursued by guards for stealing the lost princesses' crown. Upon discovering Flynn, Rapunzel is scared because nobody ever comes up her tower but her mother, leaving her no choice but to defend herself with a frying pan. One of the cute animations of this film is the iconic frying pan because of the surprising handiness but also extraordinary use of the cooking utensil. After striking a deal, the two agree that Flynn would take Rapunzel to see the lights in exchange for his satchel, which holds the valuable crown. This is the satchel in which Rapunzel stole for wager to make Flynn take her to see the lights. On their way to see the lights, the two go on some crazy adventures, and eventually, the two fall in love. The fantastic twists that this movie has is simply astonishing. Rapunzel falling in love with a thief rather than the prince is one of the main differences from the original, along with showing how Rapunzel was kidnapped as a child paralleling ""Sleeping Beauty."" This movie was remade to also show how Rapunzel was physically and mentally trapped, not only by the tower, but because she only had one friend, her chameleon. This could be the mental roadblock which held her back from expanding socially, outside of her mother. This could be why she'd hit people with frying pans in the first place. I won't spoil the ending, but, just know that there are plenty more exciting and astonishing twists that occur in this delightful movie. In this movie, characters give off playful and enticing traits and are animated exactly how they should be. Rapunzel is sweet and innocent, yet unique and curious, with big, green eyes to express this. Flynn is daring and only cares about himself, but throughout the film he develops humble traits and shows his true colors. Flynn's dream in the beginning of the movie is to live on an island by himself with enormous piles of money; He humbles out dramatically growing to care a great deal about Rapunzel and putting his selfish side away for good. The viewers also eventually find out Flynn Riders real name is Eugene Fitzherbert. He goes by Flynn Rider because he believes his name to be embarrassing and dorky; Fortunate for him, Rapunzel loves the name Eugene better than Flynn, making their eventual love story enriched. <br/><br/>All Disney movies give off the 'magical' feeling that almost everyone can relate to. This movie portrays a large range of emotion thanks to the scenery, music, and screenplay of characters. The movie is set in a magnificent kingdom surrounded by beautiful green foliage and dazzling water. The place literally looks magical and not to mention breath taking. Along with the scenery, the music and song choices for this movie are simply brilliant. Like I mentioned about emotion, some songs make you want to get up and dance and others make you feel things like love, especially for Flynn and Rapunzel. Disney movies also end up teaching life lessons or morals, which is why this movie is so different, because I feel it gives the best lesson of them all; No matter who you are or what you do, you can always live your dreams. There is a point in the movie where Flynn and Rapunzel end up in a bar full of thugs; Although scary and intimidating, they all hear about Rapunzel's dream to see the lights, which encourages them to express their dreams as well. They all have dreams of knitting sweaters, becoming concert pianists, and mimes. This goes to show that if thugs can make a 180 flip, then so can anyone."

","The movie is the oldest one u heard when u were small.It has been created several times but maybe this the best. There is innocence ,cruelty and planning in every way.The best character is that of a horse who is the best friend of both leads. The animations are great and so are the voices.I love Walt Disney and watch most of their films.Like all said ,i also was born by hearing this name. It is funny and the best song is ""i have a dream song"".I also like the visuals of the castle and the way she tell that her hair can shine in the dark. There is also an element of suspense but not intensified as we know what the end will be."

","This was so adorable. Quite enjoyable to watch and leaves you in a very good mood. <br/><br/>The real-life lessons: Don't be afraid to go after your dreams, you'll never know what happens. This sounds quite cliché but it is so true. If Rapunzel was scared to go after the dream, if she preferred to stay where was comfortable and she thought was safe, she would have never fallen in love, seen that the world is not scared and realise that she is the lost princess. Just proves that you never know for sure what is a the best for you, it may not be what you believe and as in this case what you believe is good is actually the only bad thing in your life (Rapunzel so called mother). So courage to go after your dreams. and also a very good representation that once you have accomplished a dream, you find a another one. Just wondering after Rapunzel and Flynn Rider got each other (they were each other dreams) what will their next dream be? Another lesson is that things are not always what they seem and so don't assume the worse (even when it really looks like that). Flynn Rider did not leave with the crown as they made Rapunzel believe since it looked quite so. But then again, if things are not what they seem, the person that is being bad represented will do anything to let you know its not what it seemed (Flynn coming back to Rapunzel) (if they can of course because if he was hanged and not saved he would never be able to let Rapunzel know he did not leave her and she would for always believe that). So go after your dreams and don't assumes the worse. <br/><br/>Plausibility: this is a fairytale talking about plausibility is not plausible (see what I did there). <br/><br/>Character analysis: just want to say that I never knew that a course could ever be my favourite character but I just fell in love with Maximus. He was so so so adorable. Mother Gothel was a smart weak woman. She used intrigue and lies to get her way. She made Rapunzel believe that she loved her and wanted her safe so that she would agree in starting in. She did not use evilness, she just manipulated a you woman. She was lets say a modern evil woman. The leads I will not discuss since they were the perfect character with all the right values (implausible but a necessity for movies like this that have a young audience). <br/><br/>Storytelling: I liked that the movie was not evil, Rapunzel saw the lights, the mother only intervened after. It gives you a very warm feeling it does not fill you with anger (as it would for example if Rapunzel did see the lights because of her mother). So very warm and a good watch."
"Vartiainen","Null","2","2","28 June 2016"," Return to form
","Disney's 50th animated canon feature film - though they cheated by retroactively adding Dinosaur into the list - and in many ways a brilliant comeback for the studio.<br/><br/>Tangled, based on the story Rapunzel by Brothers Grimm, feels very familiar if you grew up with the Disney Renaissance films. It's a princess movie, with lots of action, brilliant animation and lots of song numbers. Yet you can definitely see the decade or two that separates it from the Renaissance. Rapunzel is a very different kind of heroine. You can see a lot of Belle and Ariel in her, perhaps even a bit of Mulan, but she is very much a princess for the new century. Very dynamic, very ready with words, very quirky even. The same with our ""prince"", Flynn Rider, who is to Aladdin what Aladdin was to the princes of the 40s and 50s, while still being very kid friendly and accessible. They both have this attitude to them. And while at times it can be a bit heavy-handed, I do admit liking the update. For the most part.<br/><br/>I also really like the villain, Mother Gothel. She's what you would get if you took Lady Tremaine from Cinderella, but made her more subtle. She's very clearly an abusive parent, but you're not quite certain if the abuse is intentional or whether she just doesn't know any other way. Her relationship with Rapunzel is one of the more fascinating parent-child dynamics I've yet seen from Disney.<br/><br/>And overall it's just a fun film, exactly what you should expect from Disney. It can seem a bit calculated from time to time, especially when it comes to the Dreamworks-esque hipness of the main characters, but it's still a good adventure and solid entertainment all around. Recommended for all fans of Disney and good, solid animation.<br/><br/>Though the name of the film should have been Rapunzel! Curse you, overly cautious marketing."

"ElMaruecan82","9","2","2","13 April 2016"," Surprinsgly good and severely underrated: the 50th Disney film might be one of its best...
","When it comes to setting up the story, ""Tangled"" doesn't take chances, it goes straightforwardly to the point like most Disney movies do, and that's the privilege movies based on fairy tales can afford, we expect them to begin by ""Once Upon a Time "".<br/><br/>So, once upon a time <br/><br/> Gothel, a vain woman who found the power of eternal youth in a flower that magically grew out of a sunshine drop. Unfortunately for her, the flower is taken by the Royal guards and is used to cure the Queen right before she gives birth to Rapunzel, a beautiful girl with long glowing hair. Gothel understands the hair have inherited a part of the flower's powers, but when she cuts them, it turns to a plain (and powerless) brown. She then kidnaps Rapunzel and traps her in a tower where she treats her like a mother.<br/><br/>18 years later, Rapunzel grew with such a long and thick head of hair, she can actually hang on them, dangled from them and seize things like a chameleon's tongue, which is a funny coincidence since her pet friend is a charming chameleon named Pascal. Rapunzel is also a beautiful creature (who strangely reminded me of Amanda Seyfried) confident about her hair's healing power but like any girl of her age, she's got fears and issues. For one thing, she never discovered the world, and can only watch the stars that illuminate the sky, ignoring that those that appear every year during her birthday, are sky lanterns launched by the king and the townspeople as a desperate attempt to reach her. There is a lot of glowing in the film, but there's more than yellow brightness to that.<br/><br/>""Tangled"" is the 50th animated Disney film, it is a long way back to ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" but there are similarities despite the seven-decade gap. Like ""Snow White"", it's a story of a fallen princess held prisoner by an abusive 'mother-figure'. And if Snow White found escapism while looking for a Prince, Rapunzel found a prince while looking for escapism. Like ""Snow White"", ""Tangled"" was the most expensive animated movie of its time and the product of a great combination of talent and perfectionism, like ""Snow White"", it's based on a Grimm brothers story, and provides everything children and grown-ups except from fairy tale while translating to the big screen: action, fun, visuals, romance, fantasy, magic, emotions and a memorable villain.<br/><br/>To a certain extent, ""Tangled"" is Disney coming full circle with the very magic that enchanted many generations from all over the word, with a creation made for the 2010's but not so far in spirit, from the enchantment of the old classics. It's a delight to the eyes and it features two irresistible leading protagonists, in charm and personality, a not-so rebellious girl and a not-so unredeemable criminal, named Flynn Rider, a guy actually sensitive about his nose and wrapped up in the conviction that he's the most charming person on Earth. And for a change, the two characters don't really start their relationship through mutual dislike, their encounter is rather funny and uses some slapstick rarely exploited in legitimate Disney features.<br/><br/>It needs to be pointed out that ""Tangled"" belongs to one of the most refreshingly funny Disney movies. Seriously, how many of them feature a horse that is more efficient than his rider and is obsessed to the point you might discuss his psychological sanity or wish he was in the good guys' side? How many feature a frying pan as a deadly weapon and running gag? How many Disney movies feature frightening pub regulars who dream to be pianists or pantomimes', or a giant thug whose secret passion is to collect miniature unicorns? Describing these gags doesn't do them even justice because they work so well on a visual level. But I mention them because they highlight the best thing about ""Tangled"" humor : it's unpredictable even when relying on predictable situations.<br/><br/>Another example is that ""Tangled"" follows a simple and conventional plot-line through the heroin's journey, basically, her discovery of the real world leading to her self-discovery until the final confrontation with the mother (with a few Oedipal undertones). But the plot matters less than the rich gallery of colorful characters it invites us to discover and personality traits of the two heroes that manages to transcend the usual requirements. The 'hero' is handsome but takes himself so seriously that he becomes pathetic, she's a free-spirited, idealistic and barefoot-walking teen who enjoys discovering the real world, but she's also reluctant to disappoint the woman she still believes is her mother. These traits are first mocked until they're exploited for more dramatic effects.<br/><br/>Overall, the dosage is well done and makes the romance between the two outcasts believable. Naturally, some parts get predictable, when Gothel warns Rapunzel about Flynn looking only for the crown he stole, we know there'll be a quid pro quo, where she'd believe Mommy was right, but the conventional stuff is handled pretty quickly and the final third act is surprisingly efficient in its minimalism: no fight scene, no overdose of action and kinetic special effects, a simple display of love gestures and the perfect spectacular ending and feel-good twist. Rapunzel, in the tradition of coming-of-age stories, which are why fairy-tales were made for, was ready to trade her freedom for Flynn's life while Flynn decided his death was worth Rapunzel's freedom.<br/><br/>This is the stuff great romances and fairy tales are made on. There are a few little things to criticize, some songs are less inspired and more forgettable than Menken's usual work, and the title could've been better chosen, ""Rapunzel"" would've done fine actually. Still, I believe ""Tangled"" is one of the best Disney films, one that magnificently reconciles between the old and the new."
"CinemaClown","Null","2","2","10 April 2016"," A Fresh Breath Of Life From The Studio That Had Been Sitting Dormant For Years.
","Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature still carries the label of the most expensive animated film ever made but it is also noteworthy for reversing the odds in the legendary studio's favour for Tangled marks the commencement of Disney's Revival Era and begins the studio's long- awaited resurgence towards its lost glory.<br/><br/>Tangled tells the story of Rapunzel, a young princess whose magical hair have healing properties, for which she was kidnapped by an old witch who then raises her as her own child. Having spent her entire life in an isolated tower, Rapunzel is curious to explore the world outside, and ultimately leaves her home to embark on a magnificent journey of self-discovery.<br/><br/>Co-directed by Nathan Greno & Byron Howard, Tangled features all the hallmarks of a Disney fairy tale yet what eventually separates it from other similar examples is its clever combination of old & new. Despite having a simple structure & treading on familiar routes, there's ample freshness in its story, the characters are beautifully carved and the animation evokes a deep sense of warmth too.<br/><br/>Blending the best of both traditional & computer animation, the 3D images retain the painting-like quality of hand-drawn style with pixel-perfect depth & sharpness of CGI and it is absolutely drop- dead gorgeous to look at, especially that lantern sequence which can easily rival anything that the studio has put up before or since, and its old-fashioned vibe only adds more richness to the story.<br/><br/>Also returning to the fold is Alan Menken who contributes with a mesmerising score & fitting songs and even though they aren't very catchy, they work in the film's favour. Further benefiting the story is its fluid camera-work, tight editing & brisk pace plus the voice cast does a splendid job with their respective characters, the relation dynamics are sensibly explored, and the palace horse Maximus easily stands out.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Tangled is a fresh breath of life from the studio that had been sitting dormant for years and the way Disney manages to turn things around is by going back to its fairy tale roots, albeit with a reinvigorated passion, creative energy & upgraded visual flair. Delightfully refreshing, surprisingly heartfelt & scoring big on quality entertainment, Tangled is one of the finest entries in Disney's repertoire. Definitely recommended."

","Tangled (2010): Dirt: Nathan Greno, Byron Howard / Voices: Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, Donna Murphy, Ron Perlman, Brad Garrett: In the tradition of Hoodwinked here is another animated twisted take on a fairy tale. The theme is authority as Rapunzel is born with hair of healing power due to a rare flower used to heal her mother before her birth. She is kidnapped and raised in isolation within a tower by a woman who uses Rapunzel's singing power to render her youth. Animation is colorful and dazzling and directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard have a field day with tampering with the original concept. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel, sheltered from the outside world by an evil hag. Now eighteen she desires to see the lights that only appear on her birthday. These lights are actually lanterns issued by the King and Queen in hopes that their daughter will one day return. Zachary Levi voices a thief named Eugene whose theft of a crown leads to shelter in the tower before being ambushed by Rapunzel. She makes a deal that will allow him to keep the crown if he will take her to the strange lights. This leads to a tremendous twist ending that honors sacrifice and surprise. Donna Murphy voices the hag whose loss of the age flower led to her kidnapping Rapunzel and corrupting her mind, but her defeat works best due to its method. Ron Perlman is also on board as well as Brad Garrett but many of these roles are cardboard. While it satirizes the fairy tale effectively it also creates humour and adventure to the appeal to families whom will want to get tangled up in it. Score: 9 ½ / 10"

","Children's movies tend to have character's that are not very dimensional -- like UP (absenting the first scene which shows how a lifetime of unexpected events often limits our dreams).<br/><br/>The best of children's films subtly presents more interesting characters that have more that just 1 set of characteristics. Such a film was Tangled.<br/><br/>Rapunzel is astonishing feminine when she cajoles Maximus (the horse) into accepting Flynn Rider as her protector/guide as she makes her way to the festival of the lanterns. She really turns ""it"" on. No guy could resist her combination of innocence and womanliness.<br/><br/>My wife made mention of Flynn Rider before anything else. ""Now there is a man,"" was her brief summary of what she liked about the film. He only appeared as superficially very charming to me. Then I saw her point. He does bear a resemblance to Errol Flynn, who was not only charming, but courageous. He treated everything, good and bad, with a basic delight in life.<br/><br/>It is the horse that is perhaps the most fun in this film. He had absolutely no dialogue whatever, but he understood everything that was said to him. He had a face that was plastic in origin and conveyed all of his responses with facial expressions. Children's films are masters of speechless communication. The Little Mermaid is almost a perfect example of this genre. So towards the end of her negotiations with him, Maximus lowers his head, flattens his ears and closes his eyes. He knows that his honour as a protector of the realm has been challenged. He knows that she is playing the damsel in distress routine and doing it very well. He knows that she is making a request he cannot refuse. He gives in, but it is certainly against his better judgement. So he shakes hands/hooves with Flynn. He has given his word and he will be obedient to that oath. But he doesn't have to like it.<br/><br/>To emphasize the point, he and Flynn exchange shoves and punches on the bridge. They act like a couple of seven year olds. One has to be delighted by such an exchange.<br/><br/>The last of the good guys is Pascal, the mood ring with a tail. He is, I think, a chameleon. He too is wordless, but he is not nearly as well developed as Maximus.<br/><br/>The men at the inn look like they should be bad guys, but they are not. True, they are capable of drawing swords and maybe using them, but they all have a dream and again it is Rapunzel's innocence that they respond to. Each of them reveals in song what they dream of doing should they be free of their image. They like Rapunzel, but they are not sure of Flynn.<br/><br/>The one really ""bad"" guy is Mother Gruthel -- wonderfully voiced by Donna Murphy. She also has the one song that is memorable (Mother Knows Best). She is all oil and false charm and an imitation of motherly love on the outside and all ooze and darkness on the inside. She is a frightening creation.<br/><br/>So there's your cast. It's a delightful movie. You don't have to go see this with a kid as your excuse. Just go see it. It's fun for everyone."

","Tangled is the beginning of what I like to call Disney Resurrection Part 2. After a great decade of films in the 1990's, Disney Animations begun to release lesser quality films....until this film, which is leading the surge of what's to come. This film recaptures the magic of early Disney films and it shows I can renew my faith in Disney. This film is beautifully-animated and has such wonderful songs one can sit back and sing along with.<br/><br/>Bryon Howard's film is about a princess named Rapunzel who has special anti-aging powers because of her hair and is kidnapped by an old witch for her powers and is not allowed to leave her tower. But one day, she comes across a thief named Flynn Rider whose paths were destined to cross.<br/><br/>The voice-cast is not too bad. Hardly anybody too famous here, but they all do their job quite well. Mandy Moore is the biggest name here and she does a great job as Rapunzel. Zachary Levi brings some wit and charm as Flynn Rider.<br/><br/>Overall, Tangled is a great Disney film because it clearly has magic running through its veins. It's beautifully-animated, tells a great story, and it just has you wanting more. It's not the best Disney film, but looking at the films that came a decade before this film, it's a big improvement over those films. I rate this film 9/10."
"rosiethorns88","9","11","22","11 November 2010"," Disney's big 5-0! One that is breaking new grounds, with traditional techniques.
","I was part of a select, lucky crowd attending an early screening of this film at the 2010 Red Stick Animation Festival, where we were treated with the presence of one of Tangeled's animation supervisors, Clay Kaytis.<br/><br/>It was exciting to hear from Kaytis about the film's production such as how Rapunzel's hair had to be customarily animated depending on the scene - some by bone systems and dynamics, others by painstakingly hand animating her long golden locks. What was most thrilling, was to find out that Glen Keane (a legend among modern Disney Animators) would check the 3D animation on Rapunzel and hand draw over her movements as 2D traditional animation where it was necessary to show her 3D animators how to ""make her movements beautiful"" - and it truly shows!<br/><br/>The film's story and characters are also at the same level as its visuals. The premise is great; the short story of the classic tale was fleshed out in an entertaining adventure that can easily stand on its own. The characters are distinct and carry great chemistry - especially between the two leads.<br/><br/>The film's songs are the only things that fall short of the full mark. While they are very tolerable and help carry the storytelling, nothing memorable stands out after the first viewing (with the exception of the Mother Knows Best Reprise - Donna Murphy shines with this one). However, they may require several viewings before I'm completely hooked on them (I'm looking at you, Princess and the Frog) <br/><br/>Tangled is the film that definitely deserves the spot as Walt Disney's 50th Animated Film. Strong plot, lovable characters and lusciously stunning animation - it's a perfect storm of the Walt Disney magic we've been holding our breath for."
"bendy392","9","5","8","7 June 2014"," Never wanted to see this when it came out...and I feel bad.
","Disney's 50th full length animated feature. And with it, they decided to head back to what Disney did best: a fairy tale. This one being based off of the story of Rapunzel. You know, the girl with the God knows how much feet of hair? Yeah, that's the one. Also, this is Disney's first time of putting 2D animation to 3D. If you can tell, the designs of the characters look like they're from 2D. I mean, Rapunzel DOES look a bit like Ariel, doesn't she? Anyway, let's jump into the story.<br/><br/>Once upon a time, there was magic flower that a witch, named Mother Gothel, has been using for centuries to keep herself youthful. Eventually, a kingdom grew and the queen falls ill one day while pregnant. The King's men then find the flower and use it to heal the queen, who then gives birth to a girl, named Rapunzel, who possesses the magic within her golden hair. Gothel realizes that Rapunzel is now her only way to stay young forever and breaks into the castle, kidnaps her and takes her to a tower in the middle of a wilderness, where nobody will find them. Gothel convinces Rapunzel to continue to grow her hair otherwise it'll lose its power. Rapunzel then notices that every year on her birthday, she sees lanterns flying in the sky, which are actually launched by the kingdom so that one day, the lost princess will find her way home. Rapunzel wants to leave the tower and see them, but Mother Gothel constantly forbids her from leaving—that is, until a thief named Flynn Rider, breaks in and Rapunzel convinces him to take her to see the lanterns. From there, it's a grand adventure with colorful characters, comedy and of course—romance.<br/><br/>This story is GENIUS and the characters are so memorable. Rapunzel is very likable. She's smart, funny, adventurous and has a real kind heart. Everyone she meets likes her, including a bunch of ruffians and a mad horse. Also, I think she is one of the best female characters ever created. I mean, yeah, she has her insecure Disney Princess moments, but later near the climax, she stands up to Mother Gothel, who emotionally abused her for so many years, and she SCOLDS her when she learns who she really is. So yeah, I think she's a well written character. Flynn Rider is also likable. Most of the time, he's played for laughs, but aside from being a snarky ladies' man, he has his development. Throughout their adventure, he starts to have feelings for Rapunzel and hell, he ends up saving the day at the end. Also the romance is good. Yeah, it's a typical Disney-not-even-a-week-later-romance, but in the end, you don't really care. In fact, they don't even get married. At the end, he PROPOSES to her. Even the comedy is hilarious. There's a horse named Max, who comically plays the ""Captain Ahab"" character, who is obsessed with hunting Flynn. Whenever you see him and Flynn together, it's just hilarious.<br/><br/>How's the music? While I DON'T think it's the best soundtrack from Disney, it has a beautiful score ""I See the Light"" and I think it's one of Alan Menken's finest work. Even when its playing, the animation is glorious when you see the floating lanterns. And speaking of the animation, another brilliant moment is when you see Rapunzel's parents, who never say a word in this movie, but when they're crying, it's REALLY powerful. You can see the pain in their eyes like they're about to give up on the search for their daughter.<br/><br/>The villain, Mother Gothel, is also a great character. She's cunning and manipulative like pretending to be Rapunzel's mother, but she can also snap at anytime, asserting her psychological abusive relationship with Rapunzel. And at times, she can actually be pretty funny. But aside from that, she can get pretty dark, like when she straight up STABS SOMEONE IN THE BACK. Yeah, blood and everything. How often do Disney villains stab someone in the back?!<br/><br/>So is this movie ENTIRELY flawless? WellI only have two problems with this movie. Flynn Rider's real name is revealed to be Eugene Fitzherbert. Honestly, I don't see a point in him having an alias. When we were introduced to this character, we fell in love with Flynn Rider, not Eugene. In popular media, he's known as Flynn Rider. Hell, people remember him as Flynn Rider. I guess you could argue that him confessing his real name was a sign that he's growing more feelings for Rapunzel, but then again, that's kinda a nitpick. My other problem is the marketing. For example, look at the trailer. The one where it ONLY showed the comedy. That didn't look like a Disney film, it looked like a crappy romantic comedy made from Dreamworks. I'm sad to say I fell for this at first and I didn't bother seeing Tangled until years later and— heh, wasn't that a mistake. Plus, this movie didn't become number 1 at the box office until its SECOND WEEK. The marketing also didn't really say much about the return to the classic Princess fairy tale, they only showed the comedy relief and Flynn Rider being a smartass and that was about it. If the marketing for it was to say that it's one of Disney's finest since ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty & the Beast"", people would be more willing to see it. <br/><br/>I wish that this movie got more attention than most others, but it does have quite an audience. Most say that this movie is far from the films that were made in the Renaissance era, which really shocks me because this one is SO good. The characters are great, the story is great, the villain is great, it's really a gem. I've sat down and watched it numerous times and when it comes again, I will gladly watch it from beginning to end."

","Disney has one of the greatest animation studios around and has fans all around the world. After a long hiatus the studio returned to fairy adaptations. With Tangled they retold the story of Rapunzel and Disney delivered a delightful family film, filled with humour and comedy, brilliant and colourful animation (which is terrific on Blu-ray), action and drama. They is plenty of slapstick reminiscence to the Looney Toons, particularly been the leading male character and the a very determined horse. They are verbal jokes and gags through character interactions. Donna Murphy gave us an interesting villain, someone who is a more subtle and manipulative character on Rapunzel and adds a mother-daughter dynamic. The songs are sadly a little more pop princess and not particularly memorial. The stand out song is 'Mother Knows Best', sounding similar to 'Master of the House' from Les Mis and the visuals match the song well. Good viewing if you want something light-hearted.<br/><br/>On minor nitpick I have is that I thought Rapunzel's mouth was too big."
"jwv-823-79715","9","5","8","10 January 2014"," A great example of the Disney formula of success on its best
","As the film starts, so will I start by saying that I really like the frame narrative. Everybody will be able to connect with it because of its reminiscence with bed-time stories, and it neatly ties the beginning and the ending together.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, there's a great momentum of action, singing and character building. The film succeeds in portraying likable, believable and funny characters that, although they may be cliché-esque types, do convince. The dialogues too may make you suffer from a certain feeling of déjà-vu, but they are witty, and the songs are enjoyable (props to Mandy Moore), with the usual accompanying trademark funny scenes. The voice-acting is top-notch, as are the sound-effects and the soundtrack, which provides just the right tune for just the right occasion. Going on about aesthetics, the animations were colourful and enchanting with jaw-dropping detail (which makes for an awful lot of beautiful screenshots for fans).<br/><br/>The story is no big mystery or surprise, even for those who are not familiar with the fairytale itself. The film however, does a great job of keeping it interesting with several sub-plots and an occasional plot-twist. It is the story about the confrontation between a naive teenager and the world, and also about the adolescent's growing awareness for the other sex. Tangled is a great example of the genius, albeit quite clichéd Disney formula of success on its best. We recognize the story of a sympathetic protagonist searching for freedom, and exploring the world. He or she encounters several evil characters on the journey, but in the end wins out over them, not only because of his or her intelligence and perseverance, but also by charming others with their innocence, likability and lack of prejudice.<br/><br/>This mix of elements forms the basis of the trademark Disney formula, with which Disney here proves they utterly ace the art of pleasing a mass audience, all age categories included."

It is going to be a magical time of your life, get ready to be part of the history. Do you remember how wonderful is Snow White, Cinderella, Princess Aurora the Sleeping Beauty, Ariel the Little Mermaid, beautiful Belle and the Beast, Aladdin's Princess Jasmine, Pocahontas, Mulan and last year's Princess Tiana and her Frog""? It is the time! For long-haired Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) to get out from her hidden tower, to leave her ruthless mother Gothel and has some adventures along with her Prince, errr.. I mean runaway bandit, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi). It is also for the first time, Princess Rapunzel will face unfriendly outside world, but don't worry, she's got her frying pan to protect herself and escorted by a very cool chameleon, Pascal and the white horse with dog's capability, Maximus. The song ""When Will My Life Begin"" reflects that great adventure spirit. The Directors are Nathan Greno and Byron Howard who have ever worked together in dog's tale ""Bolt"" (2008). But I think the person who deserves high appreciation for bringing thiz German fairy tale comes to live is no other than Alan Menken. Menken is the regular Disney's genius Composer who can always provide delightful classic elements into every piece of his magical music or Score. The storyline is so smooth and dynamic. Yeah it is predictable, but at least you could enjoy the joyful comedy, it is always fun to watch how Rapunzel and silly Flynn Rider tease each other. And even though without dialogue, the animal characters which are the chameleon Pascal and the horse Maximus perform successful funny slapstick. For the visual pleasure, the picture is beautifully woven to a higher level, you will be amazed by how realistic each texture and detail it has been made, the hair, the grass bit by bit. The most powerful scene is ""The Floating Lanterns Scene"", when finally Rapunzel and Flynn are in a boat right outside the castle, waiting for the glow flying lanterns to be released. In that romantic moment, you can feel the pure sincerity and so much loves between them through their innocence face expression and breathtaking interaction with the background song ""I See the Light"". That scene simply gives you goosebumps and could easily bring happy tears in your eyes. It is very rare that there is a movie that could touch my heart. Thiz one is definitely the one. Usually if someone asks me, ""Who is your favorite Disney's Princess?"". Most of the times, I would answer, ""Cinderella!"". But after thiz movie, maybe I would give a different answer. By the way, I always love the girl with the long hair ^_^ Disney certainly knows best! <br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","5","8","6 December 2010"," Grab the Pantene Pro-V leave-in conditioner and get tangled in this wonderful Disney movie
","Can you believe it? Disney has reached it's 50th animated film and what way to celebrate a wonderful magical company but with another princess story. We've had the pleasure of adding Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast to the magnificent list of best animated movies of all time despite all virtually having the same story. The reason being is because even though they were all the same story, they all had something different to offer with animation, songs, characters and along with other Disney classics like The Lion King, Aladdin or The Jungle Book(you know there's more titles of course) we've always opened our hearts to these classic stories. Disney takes on an old fairytale of Rapunzel and what way to celebrate but with CGI animation, again. Tangled is a very good film but it's not the instant classic that Disney needed. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, it's got great animation, lots of humor and very lovable characters.<br/><br/>One night, Gothel, an evil selfish old lady kidnaps Princess Rapunzel who has magic gold hair that can keep Gothel looking young and living forever; she isolates the princess in a tower as her own daughter. Eighteen years later, Rapunzel tells Gothel that she wishes to see the floating lights that appear on her birthday every year, but Gothel rejects her by telling Rapunzel that the world is a dangerous place. Meanwhile, the thief Flynn Rider and his twin thugs heist the tiara of the missing princess from the castle. As they flee, Flynn abandons the twins, allowing the pursuing castle guards to capture them. Flynn happens upon Rapunzel's tower to hide in, only to be held captive by Rapunzel and her pet chameleon, Pascal. Rapunzel bargains with Flynn that if he escorts her to the lights and back, she will return the tiara; Flynn agrees. But as they go into the city, Rapunzel starts to feel something familiar as everyone talks about the lost princess that was stolen years ago.<br/><br/>I guess for Disney's 50th animated picture I wanted a little more, look at me, I'm talking like the Disney princess almost singing how I want more. The songs were not too catchy, except for the dream song at the bar, that was very humorous and a good time to watch. Another thing I liked about the film is that it seems like a lot of animated films are relying too much on pop culture for humor and can be too trendy at times, I like that we went back to the old fairy tale. However, couldn't we have done hand drawn animation? I miss that a lot, it has this certain charm and felt like the animators took the time and effort, I know that CGI animation is cheaper and faster, so it can make an audience member feel a little cheated. I also know that 3D is big, but again why always go with trendy? This isn't what Walt Disney intended with his company I'm sure. But still would I recommend Tangled? Absolutely, and I can't wait for the DVD to add to my Disney collection, this was a terrific film for the whole family to enjoy. After all, it has a horse that makes Dirty Harry look like Barney and I feel bad for that chameleon who I guess should have stolen the show but lets face it, that horse deserves a spin off sequel now. Disney, let's get Max his own movie! Well, I hope that Disney takes my tip about the hand drawn animation, let's go back to the good old days.<br/><br/>8/10"

","And a kick-ass one, at that! Tangled is the modern version of the old fairytale classic- Rapunzel. I've forgotten what the original version of Rapunzel was, but I know that it certainly wasn't this one. Disney did a good job in making this movie. They added the plot with the hair and I loved the whole thing with the lanterns! A big plus was that all the songs were catchy! None which I can see as classics, though like ""A Whole New World"" or ""Colors of the Wind"" or etc. But they were still good. Good enough for me to want to have that album.<br/><br/>The plot wasn't exactly A+. It was average. Not that I'm complaining since this movie's target audience ARE for the kids. I didn't hate that evil witch, by the way. I thought she did a pretty good job. I mean, she was willing to go and trek 3 days for paint that Rapunzel wanted? Most evil stepmothers wouldn't do that! (Certainly not like that bitch in Cinderella, OOPS.) But not this woman. She showed that she cared. That's why I wasn't really hoping that she would die. Halfway throughout the movie, I was even thinking of ways on how this movie could end happily, without the witch dying. ""Maybe Rapunzel's real family will let the witch work somewhere in the castle and Rapunzel would sing for her weekly!"" Hey! It seemed like a good idea to me!<br/><br/>The humor was indeed funny. I think both adults and children would enjoy it. I loved Maximus! Max's relationship with Eugene sort of reminded me of Shrek and Donkey. I liked Maximus more, though, since he wasn't annoying. It was a good call for Disney to NOT make the animals talk this time. That gets annoying.<br/><br/>I also liked the big hair change Rapunzel had. This movie proves that hair can really do a lot to a person. With her long blonde hair and gorgeous green eyes, Rapunzel looked like a child with no knowledge of anything. She was a child. But after her hair was cut, she looked like a new person! She looked more mature and a lot more edgy. Eugene did a good job. I teared up in the ending. What can I say? I'm a sucker for family scenes.<br/><br/>This was a great movie. It isn't showing in the Philippines yet, but I think I'll still watch it when it hits theaters next week, even if I already got to watch it. :) Good job, Disney!<br/><br/>1st viewing: January 29, 2011 ; 2nd viewing: February 5, 2011"

"Juja1","9","4","6","20 December 2010"," Very entertaining
","This movie felt like a 9 on the entertainment scale. The movie drew me in and made me laugh many times. First Disney movie I liked since years. The 1 point missing to a full ten goes off for the plot holes (...why is it now necessary to sing in order to activate the flower/hair magic, and then again it isn't? ...how did the horse get the bunch of thieves to follow him, plus place them behind open prison doors? ...why wasn't the princess at least a little sad for her stepmother whom she had loved for so many years?...). I liked the loving attention to detail such as in the art-nouveau style wall paintings and the pub scene. While I love the old hand-drawn Disney Classics such as Djungle Book and Aristocats with wonderful swing music, I could never really connect to any Disney movie since then - did not like the over-polished gaudy-coloured look of Aladdin & Co. and the pop-style songs; found Princess & the frog a bit boring, too full of cliché visual references to old-style Disney which did not work in my opinion, and was put off by the unnatural purple colour in the voodoo scenes. Tangled on the other hand seems to look more forward than back, and at the same I thought this feels more like one of the old movies. Some scenes felt almost like a movie scene with real actors, such as the one in the cave. A turn towards realism goes well with me. As another reviewer remarked there were still other scenes of unlikely physics (surviving a huge fall) which made me stumble a bit, but which I did not mind too much. Rapunzel's big-eyed pink barbie look...well...thank god she acted differently. As for the lantern scene...it was beautifully made though maybe just a bit too much, think I heard some viewers disconnecting due to the sentimental overdose and getting a little impatient, at least when having a 3D lantern shoved into our faces :-)...I got this random thought about masses of waste lanterns littering the woods on the next morning, and then all the time I had to think about this poor guy who according to the newspapers is fighting paper lanterns, because one of them came down on their house and killed his son in the resulting fire. He will probably not enjoy the movie as much as I did."
"Tyndareon","5","6","11","26 June 2015"," They dropped the ball
","This movie for the most part provided solid first class entertainment, it wasn't particularly funny - except for the Horse, that was inspired - but it was lighthearted and fresh.<br/><br/>But then it tries its hand at being manipulative and obscene, in a pathetic attempt to relate to the bratty, spoiled, over-privileged teenagers out there. I am not in that target group, and if I were as sure as hell I hope I would see through this.<br/><br/>One might make a case about concepts like love, and family and parenting being too complicated for the average viewer, let alone as portrayed in a children's movie. But no. Maleficent had the same base story more or less, and it was consistent. <br/><br/>All the lightheartedness in the world will not save your movie if your world is tailored to make sense only to a group who has the slightest - and tenuous at that - grip with reality. If you endeavor to make your resolution be an absolute defeat for the villain, make sure said villain is not an essential part of your world. <br/><br/>For example let's say your plot is about a mother and her disobedient child who gets in trouble all the time, and your intended resolution is to kill it. Well.. You may think you have your bases covered when you reveal that the child was not after all biologically related to the mother, and when you provide her with her ""real"" child, long lost, which is sweet and obedient, as a counterpoint, but guess what, show that movie to a mother and she will rip your eyes out, if only to stop you from creating another abomination and inflicting it upon the world."

","I took my two boys to see this, the older of which was kind of irked at being dragged to a 'princess' movie but I'm happy to report we all enjoyed it. The only reason I'm really writing a review (since its getting enough positive reviews to really cover most of what I liked about it) is to say that there IS a reason to see it besides the 3D effects.<br/><br/>I am not a huge fan of 3D films, in fact, it is rare that I don't find it to be a distraction. Frankly I don't WANT to be tricked into believing I'm actually *in* the film unless I'm at an amusement park, perhaps. I like my distance from the goings-on within the picture.<br/><br/>We saw this without 3D and the breathtaking scenery was more than enough to feed the senses on its own. Don't feel like you need to shell out the extra 8 bucks for 3D (the upgrade in cost per matinée ticket in my neck of the woods) because its perfectly enjoyable without it. <br/><br/>All that being said, it doesn't have quite the clout or likability of the very best Disney when it comes to the songs and pacing, but I would still give this picture a low A, recommend it for family viewing and see it again with a friend if they wanted to. This was far and away better than the Frog Princess, a film which I found terrified my youngest child and bored my older one."
"Kalasin","8","9","19","11 November 2010"," Tangled Gives a Nod to Its Roots
","As a 28 year-old female, I didn't have much in the way of expectations when I went to see Tangled. I hoped for a return to the animated fairytale landscapes of ""Beauty & the Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid,"" with maybe a touch of the hero/heroine dynamic from ""Anastasia."" I found most (if not all) of what I was looking for, plus some food for thought.<br/><br/>Like ""Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas"" (2003), Tangled has a near-tangible philosophical component. The storyline in Disney's latest offering touches on modern themes of over-protective parents, teenage rebellion, ""boys only want one thing,"" friendship/trust, and (most intriguingly) the aftermath of dreams. While the serious matter of 'what if a cherished dream turns out to be not so good after all?' is raised but (disappointingly) swept aside, the characters' answer to the bewildering question of 'once my dream comes true, then what?' more than makes up for it.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely certain this movie can be grouped as a typical Disney ""Princess movie"" due to the talented efforts at making the story equally appeal to those with a Y chromosome, but I thoroughly enjoyed the well-balanced result.<br/><br/>The humor in Tangled is almost entirely based on physical violence. And there was a surprisingly large amount of violence. The laughs were never forced or out-of-place, however parents of young and impressionable children should probably take a moment to explain the dangers of repeated blows to the head. Lately, the makers of family films enjoy slipping adult innuendo into their dialogue and I am happy to note that no such attempts were made here.<br/><br/>While Disney's requisite Cute Animal Sidekick (a chameleon) is present in nearly all scenes, he never steals the show or becomes annoying. The show-stealing, I must add, is all impressively done by Maximus the horse. Rapunzel receives strange looks when others witness her talking to the animals and no animals actually speak. It's a nice tip of the hat to realism, nicely matched by Rapunzel actively starting the village dancing (rather than encountering such a festive organized dance out of thin air).<br/><br/>Making a break from previous fairytale retellings of the 90's and earlier and, possibly, surpassing the vein of more recent additions to the genre (""Shrek"" and ""Enchanted"" must be named); there is a strong teamwork dynamic at work between princess and hero and a refreshing amount of reciprocal rescues. I can already envision co-operative play video game tie-ins as the characters use a length of hair to navigate around obstacles.<br/><br/>The story of Rapunzel is much older than the Brothers Grimm and many a modern child is first introduced to the story through a printed adaptation. Writing for a moment as a children's librarian, I was very glad to see both the male and female lead speak more than once about how books positively influenced their lives. It was a well-placed nod to the value of reading (which is also reflected in other Disney characters -- most notably, Belle). I also have to wonder if the movie's affinity for frying pans has any origin in spunky heroine, Princess Cimorene, from Patricia C. Wrede's Enchanted Forest Chronicles.<br/><br/>As the movie worked up to its climax at the tower, all the myriad endings I've seen to the tale of Rapunzel made my throat close in on itself in anticipation of what might happen next. Disney's Tangled takes a different route from any version I've encountered before and brings the story of Rapunzel and her Rogue to a satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>-1 star for the music being not quite as catchy/haunting as past Disney classics' -1 star for Rapunzel's head being disproportionate to her body and the utter, utter disregard for gravity and the laws of physics. Isaac Newton is rolling in his grave.<br/><br/>+8 stars for being a movie that encourages children of all ages to make their dreams come true"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","5","9","3 November 2013"," Doubt if you must, but Tangled will win you over.
","Although Disney will forever be immortal for their varied peaks of films since 1937, they have been struggling to stand out lately. The word Disney has become synonymous with animation and its easy for Pixar, Fox and Dreamworks to all come under the same label for kids, rather than show themselves as competitors. They thrive on franchises whereas Disney tries to keep its sequels to its straight-to-bargain bin department. These franchise films become events and although I would call Wreck-It Ralph an event movie, the average joe has no idea who made it anyway. So in retrospect, I do feel bad for overlooking Tangled as it belongs in a difficult and murky time for unique animated films, especially as it's CGI as opposed to Disney's previous landmark The Princess and the Frog. But surprisingly, it's a super charming film and it has an broadness that truly does appeal to everyone. I think it's in the sense of humour, it's very quirky and dry, reminding me of the laid-back attitude The Emperor's New Groove and Shrek. There's brilliant running gags and details sprinkled around that land immediately and make it a more involving experience.<br/><br/>The quality in the animation was definitely worth the ballooned budget and more as they can compete with Pixar at this point. However, the storytelling is typical and overfamiliar at this point. Sure, it's Disney's style, but it's nowhere near as refreshing as Wreck-It Ralph for instance. Its biggest mistake was the songs. It could've been okay if they were unique, but they seemed like they were tagged on out of necessity. Too often do they drag the film into melodrama when it actually hits some poignant notes from time to time, but its biggest sin is that they're too plain. I also found myself wanting to know a lot more about the antagonist. She was hundreds of years old and her motivation seemed to only strike in the last twenty. There's something Walt Disney used to say which I wish the makers of Tangled took on board which is a film is only as strong as its antagonist. Sometimes it seems like the good guys will never make it as she's hot on their tails, but then it never follows through until it's hit the point it wants to show. But it's fine, the enjoyable side characters more than make up for her and in the end, Tangled wins you over. Definitely a great attempt at Disney modernising without selling their spirit.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Why is it that ""Tangled"" previously called ""Rapunzel"" managed to do a business of $21.6+ million (*figure taken from IMDb*) in such a competitive environment? Most of us had our hopes on the latest epic of Harry Potter series ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows"" which despite having an advantage managed only a $17 million business. There are several reasons why Tangled became an epic piece. Firstly the introduction of Disney's new application of CGI (computer generated imagery) was a major advantage for the movie. This technology actually helped in creating a more powerful and discrete 3D imagery. Previously Disney used hand drawn animation which although was a success in the 80s but failed to fulfill the standards in the movie ""The princess and the Frog"" which was released earlier.<br/><br/>Another reason for Tangled being a huge success was the characters it had. The storyline although changed from the original ""Rapunzel"" was much more purified and gained an insight to a much more comedic entertainment. (Mandy Moore) did a great job with her character Rapunzel and so did the rogue Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi) whom we know from the great comedy serial ""Chuck"". But most importantly the element that made this animation a real success was the direction and the storyline. The movie captured the attention of the audience from the very start and kept on increasing its grasp with a great climax and finally towards the end captured the complete insight of everyone. It's safe to say that although these are old stories but a little molding can be a great success for animated movies in the future.<br/><br/>If you want to have fun these holidays and really want to have the best then I recommend watching ""Tangled"" because it's worth it.<br/><br/>http://bloggiesinc.com/2010/12/11/tangled-a-huge-success/"
"pwleslie","7","6","12","31 December 2010"," Lovely movie, but not classic
","Disney's Tangled is hands down one of the best films they've met in years. I had tears streaming down my eyes the minute the lanterns starting appearing all the way to the end. The animation is gorgeous and the storyline, for the most part, is pretty solid and believable. The film still, however, has a number of serious flaws.<br/><br/>The sidekicks: While amusing, the sidekicks play a very, very small part in this film. Pascal is cute - and pretty much pointless after that. He doesn't really serve much purpose except as a sort of nice pet-on-the-back. He really isn't even substantial emotional support. Also, the whole chameleon idea in general was pretty bizarre. They obviously just generated a sidekick for the sake of having one. Maximus, while amusing as well, helps out to some extent in the climax, but really isn't even featured that much. More than half of the film he's chasing Flynn, and then Rapunzel treats him nicely and he's just hunky dory for most of the rest. Again, the robo-cop-horse idea itself was... weird. And when he starts acting like a dog, it's... even weirder. It's like they can't decide to make him human-like or canine.<br/><br/>Flynn's name: As I understood it, Flynn revealed his real name towards the end. But when I saw it, he reveals it towards the middle, and Rapunzel calls him by it the *entire rest of the movie*. The name gives him back-story, but it definitely confuses the audience on what to call him. I can't help wondering if it could have been dropped altogether.<br/><br/>When Rapunzel realizes she's a princess: little can be said on this part because it's so confusing. She somehow is able to recollect a memory from when she was barely a toddler. And it's all very sketchy and not totally believable. Also, kind of anti-climatic.<br/><br/>Rapunzel's character design: her eyes definitely change size a few times, and quite honestly she often looks really ridiculous. Her facial features often grew quite out of proportion.<br/><br/>The villain: Donna Murphy plays Mother Gothel very well. And Mother Gothel is definitely a villain. But she really just lacks something that especially the original Gothel had - a kind of maddening obsession, a real sense of threatening power. Gothel is vaguely complicated here because of maternal actions, but not in the way that Frollo of Hunchback is. She has very shallow motivations and really isn't very frightening at all. She's creepy looking, but that's about it.<br/><br/>The music: The music is pleasant, but... in the end none of the songs manage to really grasp you. A lot of them are really pretty, but nothing gorgeous and memorable. This could partially be blamed on Menken's source of inspiration - 60's rock, although even Gothel's villain song falls short. Slater's lyrics weren't a treasure to hear either.<br/><br/>Changes to original: as good and functional as the plot is, it actually would have been better being kept closer to the original. There are just some elements that really made the original shine that have been lost here.<br/><br/>The Pub thugs: As someone else mentioned, the pub thugs really didn't play that significant a part in the movie. They were comedic and played a (contrived) role in the finale. That was it. Essentially, with the exception of the three main human characters and the Stabbington brothers (and Rapunzel's parents of course), all of the characters were really expendable.<br/><br/>The town scene: it was just kind of strange and didn't make sense. Rapunzel just starts dancing with all kind of people, despite never even SEEING so many people before and just suddenly has social skills. And then she's painting stuff and reading mysterious books and... I kind of had no idea what was supposed to be going on. It was all epic and exciting, but still kind of ridiculous.<br/><br/>The action scenes: we all know why they were in there. Disney had to entertain the boys, because boys are only entertained by fighting and violence. What utter nonsense. Quite a few of the scenes were utterly pointless and unnecessary. I understand the need for some action scenes, but there were a few in here that were just present to make attempts at entertaining the male crowd.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Tangled is a really nice movie. I don't feel like it supplants Rapunzel, however. The two are still very different in essence. Also, this is a pretty meager attempt at the complexities of Rapunzel."

So it took me about a week to finally finish this. But after seeing the movie trailer again, I realized that it still has some comedy parts. And I love that part.

","Tangled is above all else a masterpiece of animation and background. I'd never say another thing about cg again if there was a hope that even a quarter of the stuff churned out looked so stunning. It could have been a much worse film in other aspects and I would still be drooling.<br/><br/>Which makes it even better that it doesn't suck as much as the trailers imply. I have no explanation to offer for the crap job done on the marketing other than everyone other than the artists are a bunch of greedy bastards. Anywho, it's a charming story, not nearly as snarky and Shrek-ish as I had feared, filled with some excellent characters. Mother Gothel is an excellent villain, combining charm and evil marvelously. And as for the titularly tangled couple, both are serviceably great in a not-too-terribly-bland way. Maybe a little too quippy for their own good, but oh man, they boast some of the most attractive character design I have ever seen. There seems to be a lot of lifting from anime, with the huge saucer eyes and heart-shaped faces. The voicework was in many cases good, better than I was expecting to say the least. Donna Murphy was, of course, great and I like Zachary Levi well enough from his role as Chuck, but Mandy Moore was the sleeper hit. Frankly, all she had to do was not suck it up and I would have been floored. I still would have liked to see Kristen Chenoweth in the role, but Moore's voice definitely had a stronger note of sincerity and thankfully the nasally pop-tartness was for the most part absent in her singing.<br/><br/>And the songs! Actually, I am afraid to admit I cannot remember a single tune from the show, which I just saw this afternoon. I remember them as pleasant enough at the time and know I liked Mother Knows Best quite well, but they just didn't stick with me. Instead I've been humming True Love's Kiss all evening, being in the spirit of the movie while infinitely more catchy.<br/><br/>So all in all, Tangled was a worthy placeholder in the coveted 50th feature spot. If it had any faults, which were few, they can all be forgiven by the sheer beauty of the artistry, which really is the whole point anyways. At least if you ask me."
"rgcustomer","9","5","10","4 January 2011"," Lasseter's involved? Of course it's great.
","I actually didn't know anything about this film except that it was in 3D and had something to do with Rapunzel, but it had a high IMDb rating, even from old men, so I trusted you guys and I went to see it.<br/><br/>You were right. It's an excellent film. Even if it had no story at all, it is worth seeing for the spectacular art that it is. It does have it's misfires (one small scene with water looks more like cellophane, and a spider web looks like something from a 1990s video game) but these stand out particularly because the rest of it is just so beautiful to look at. I'm fairly sure many of you will shed a tear or two, just from the beauty.<br/><br/>Everyone will comment on the nighttime floating lantern scene, which is truly beautiful. My one concern is that with the similarity to Avatar's wood sprites, this might be becoming a cliché in 3D animated film. Of course, we could do a lot worse than to have such a good cliché.<br/><br/>The villain in this film has a spectacular death scene. Maybe that's playing it up too much, because it's fairly simple, but the imagery is just right. I'm certain this will be remembered.<br/><br/>The actors ... I mean the animated characters are drawn very well. But animating this close to reality is a delicate act. Some things don't work when they get too real, like exaggerated features. There are a few moments when maybe their teeth get too big and the distortion makes you a bit nauseous. Same with the eyes. You kind of wonder why they didn't just use real people. But then it falls back into place again, and it's wonderful. If you thought you might have fallen in love with one of Disney's 2D characters (come on, you know you did) wait till you see this. Flynn (why are all Disney characters recently named Flynn?) may not have the perfect body (it's a kids' show) but it's not bad, and when that face is up in yours in 3D, how can you not want to kiss it? I'm sure Rapunzel is all that too. But that's not how my boat sails.<br/><br/>Is this the first 3D film to include a gay bar? Sure, they don't SAY the Snuggly Duckling is gay bar, but do you need them to? There are no women in it until Rapunzel shows up, and all these very butch men have these very artistic dreams. And it's the Snuggly Duckling. Good for them.<br/><br/>Oh, and it's a musical. Or is it a movie with music? Whatever. The songs are pleasant. I enjoyed them at the time, but I can't say I remember any of them now.<br/><br/>I saw it in 3D, but I suspect it is equally as good in 2D. For Avatar, I would say the 3D is an essential part of the film's immersive experience, whereas for Tangled, it's more of an enhancement. But they have done it right, by building it in from the start.<br/><br/>I should say something about the story. Although based on Rapunzel, this is not the usual Rapunzel story. This version relies on magic, which if it wasn't so well done, I would normally regard as a negative. The ending is also somewhat different, but amounts to the same thing.<br/><br/>I do suffer a twinge of guilt knowing that a quarter of a billion dollars was spent on a kids' film, instead of on, say, healthy food and education. But at least it was done well.<br/><br/>It's a must-see film, certain to please almost anyone."

","One of the best Disney movies I've seen in a long time. Full of cheese, full of charm, personality and witty humour, it was just good old fashion Disney fairy tale fun. I saw Tangled in 2D and there is really no need to seek out the 3D version. Although Tangled is a kid's movie, I can say I was never bored once during the whole movie. Which I can't say about too many movies made for kids. It's the story of the locked in a tower princess called Rapunzel with magical long blonde hair. Great animation, loved the story and the music. The chameleon cracked me up. This is the perfect animated movie for kids, adults and all the family that's sure to live on as one of the studio's better all-around animated movies."
"victoria_oswald","10","4","8","30 September 2014"," Great Movie That is Sure to Keep You Laughing
","Tangled takes the classic Brothers Grimm tale of Rapunzel and adds a classic Disney flavor with just enough comedy, entertainment, romance, and fun to keep every member of the family watching with a smile. The tale holds onto some of its classic roots. Rapunzel is locked in a tower with impossibly long hair, shut off from the rest of the world. Scriptwriter Dan Fogelman takes a different twist on the story when he rewrites the reasons for her captivity and the story that follows afterward. In this story, Rapunzel has magical hair that has the power to keep Mother Gothel young. Gothel takes it upon herself to kidnap Rapunzel and lock her in the tower. When Flynn Rider stumbles into the tower, he and Rapunzel embark on a mission that is bound to change both of them. Tangled takes viewers on a comedic journey with both Rapunzel and Rider that is sure to have any viewer on the edge of their seat, laughing and singing along.<br/><br/>This film incorporates the classic characters of the tale and adds several new and entertaining characters. Maximus, a horse who seems to have the personality of a dog, has a personality that is sure to have everyone cackling. His strong and staunch personality makes up for his lack of dialogue. Rapunzel's chameleon, Pascal, adds a similar taste to the film. His silly and sarcastic personality will be sure to have any kid begging for a pet reptile by the end of the film. Other new, yet notable, characters include a group of men in a small diner who, at first glance, seem to be a bunch of thugs. They appear large and tough but Rapunzel soon has them breaking out in song, adding a comedic scene that everyone is sure to love. Characters in this film are developed well and each adds their own zest to the film. The casting of the main characters, Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider, and Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel, is superb. Each completely takes on the role of their character, making you feel their emotions and empathize with them on a level that is rarely reached in animated films. <br/><br/>The musical numbers in this film worked marvelously with the plot. They fell right into their place and contributed well to the story line. The musical numbers in this film range from the slow and breathtaking I See the Light performed by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi to the fun and foot-tapping I've Got a Dream performed by Mandy Moore, Brad Garrett, Jeffrey Tambor, Zachary Levi, and ensemble. Alan Menken, the composer for Tangled, has won eight Oscars for his work in films such as Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid. Though many cry that the numbers in this film are not as impressive as his previous work, it would be difficult to argue that the music in Tangled do not contribute greatly to the plot. They are performed well by the voices of the characters in the film. One very notable performance by Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel comes toward the beginning of the film when Murphy sings Mother Knows Best in response to Rapunzel's request to leave the tower. Murphy certainly delivered this number with power and emotion and it is sure to be a heart-stopping and memorable part of the movie. The plot and character development provide a story that is certainly worth following. However, the design and cinematography deserve much credit as well. The story circles around the idea of these floating lights that Rapunzel is so desperately yearning to see. Lighting in the film is spectacular. This, of course, is especially evident in the boat scene where Rapunzel and Rider are surrounded by the floating lights and singing a heartwarming musical number. These elements combine to make an incredibly beautiful scene that will have you drying your eyes to watch the rest of the film. Other scenes with notable design and lighting include the saloon where Rider takes Rapunzel toward the beginning of their journey and the scene in the prison where Flynn is held. Rapunzel's tower, hidden away in the forest, also holds a simplistic, yet breathtaking, design.<br/><br/>Tangled certainly offers the traditional tale with a certain twist that viewers are sure to appreciate. Every member of the family is bound to empathize and fall in love with the characters. Casting for this film was on point and provided great emotion to the film. The musical numbers added the perfect amount of gusto to this film. No doubt you will be tapping your feet and singing along by the end of this film."

","Another Disney princess is back and now in 3D. I just watched it last night in 3D. And it was amazing. I would like to give credits to Mandy Moore and Donna Murphy. They were so amazing! This film will make you smile, laugh, cry. I loved every moment of it. The story is simple, they just focused on the magic of Rapunzel's hair, and that's it. I enjoyed the adventure of Eugene and Rapunzel. I loved all the songs! I just can't stop listening to ""when will my life begin"" and ""i see the light"". Amazing songs. It was really way better than the princess and the frog. I think this film is Disney's great come back. And they really have to make up from last Disney princess' film. That is.

"RitikaS","10","4","8","7 February 2011"," ... and Disney does it again!!!
","Quite frankly, when I stepped into the cinema to watch 'Tangled', I didn't know what to expect. But I knew that Disney would have something that would, of course wowed the audience. And they have!!! Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) is a free spirited young girl, with the gift to heal anyone with her magical hair. She wants to be free, since being trapped in a castle by her 'mother' Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy). However, her life turns upside down when a good-looking thief, Flynn Rider (Zachery Levi) stumbles across her castle...<br/><br/>An absolutely wonderful cast, Zachery Levi as the ever charming Flynn Rider and the stunning Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, makes the story come alive and exciting! Mandy Moore, best known for playing Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan in 'A Walk to Remember' has portrayed Rapunzel beautifully and I do not think, that anyone could of done it better. Zachery Levi, also has outdone himself by playing Flynn, or should I say Eugene Fitzherbert. Known for playing Chuck Bartowski in 'Chuck' he really adds to the typical 'Casanova' persona, which really really makes him lovable and makes the women swoon.<br/><br/>Also the directors, Byron Howard and Nathan Greno couldn't of envisioned and shot 'Tangled' in any better way possible. Everything was done to perfection and Howard and Greno made sure that this film was made for a mass audience, ranging from young to old.<br/><br/>So I encourage everyone to take their friends, children and family to watch Disney's 50th venture... a true hit!! Go on... GO!!! please?"
"DICK STEEL","8","4","8","27 November 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Tangled
","There's some controversy over the name change from Rapunzel to Tangled, but in Singapore we probably got the best of both worlds with Rapunzel - A Tangled Tale, highlighting that this was still in essence, a Rapunzel-Rapunzel-Let-Down-Your-Hair tale. The latest offering to add to Disney's growing list of Princess films, and thought to be the last, this 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series sees the Brothers Grimm's tale being given the Disney update, and that means being more child friendly, thought slapped with a PG rating rather than the usual G.<br/><br/>The formula that Disney uses on its chosen princesses from fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Anderson amongst others, seem to come with the requisite beautiful singing voice since breaking out into song about their plight and a duet is the norm, and have this aura that birds, butterflies and bees tend to flock to, possessing this power over animals and assisted by a sidekick from the insect or animal kingdom. There's also the Prince Charming equivalent who will gallop over hills and valleys to save his beloved, before living happily ever after expected ending.<br/><br/>In all counts, Tangled satisfied the above, though there was a moment in the finale which I thought, since it's touted as the last Princess film (though never say never with box office success) that they would go for the jugular and put a new spin on things, but I guess what's formula shouldn't be tweaked unless it's broke. Mandy Moore the singer plays Rapunzel and so automatically gives the character her singing voice as well, being captured by the evil Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and imprisoned in a tower (well, very nicely discouraged from getting out to the big bad world out there), though yearning very much to be part of the world seen through her window, much like The Little Mermaid's Ariel. Her chameleon sidekick and palace horse Maximus, though without a voice, are likely to be the more popular Disney animal sidekicks out there with their timely antics, and if there are soft toys of them, I'm quite sure they will do pretty brisk business.<br/><br/>But what's slightly different here is that the male lead Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi) happens to be a rogue in all sense of the word, a thief who has double-crossed the Stabbington Brothers (Ron Perlman) during a joint heist. Not a prince and hardly the gentleman to begin with, his accidental chance upon Rapunzel doesn't result in an instant love connection, but one that developed over time in their journeys to bring her out of her tower, to somewhere close enough to observe a lantern festival that happens on her birthday, where the royalty of the land commemorates the disappearance of the kingdom's princess (no prizes here of course – most of the time one party amongst the lovebirds has got to be of royal blood). I suppose the character's tapered to be slightly more realistic than the swashbuckling hero according to plan.<br/><br/>Villains wise, Tangled's Mother Gothel is probably more simple in her motivation to keep Rapunzel's magical hair powers all for herself, an elixir for immortality, though her schemes and execution to do so are more complex and cerebral, preferring mind games and manipulation instead to get her wants, rather than magical powers and potions, being the weak old lady she actually is who's cheapskate enough not to go for botox. With no real powers nor weapons to exercise her threat, she's actually quite weak if it boils down to fisticuffs, inflicting injury from the shadows. The Stabbington Brothers also pose no threat as they are only mean looking and ultimately nothing but posers, and the flick also has in its theme to never judge a book by its cover for the dreamers it made out of a tavern full of thugs.<br/><br/>If one were to compare the earlier Disney princesses from what has evolved over the course of time, there's no qualms about the female characters being stronger now than their predecessors. Snow White and Sleeping Beauty had unparalleled rivals in the looks department, but ultimately the docile, demure ladies don't cut it nowadays, especially when they are in comatose in their own films, especially the latter almost throughout. Today's princesses fight against bad authority, and are never flinching if the situation calls for self sacrifice. Alas they still cannot shake off emotional needs of desiring a man in their lives, so not all things are changed for happily ever afters.<br/><br/>Still, Rapunzel is that worthy addition to the Disney stable, and I am wondering just how long it'll take before she could be found on the Disneyland grounds. Recommended for its intended demographics definitely, while accompanying adults may find that this is no longer the same as those we all grew up with."

","Yes ! You read that correctly ! If for nothing else, watch this one to see THE HORSE !!!! His name is MAXIMUS. He is a very large white horse with attitude. He moves like a dog and he seems to think like a dog as well. He snuffs along the trail of the hero.. At one point he even sits on his haunches and when that sweet spot under his chin is scratched, he starts to kick himself with a hind leg. Found him IRRESISTIBLE !!! He and the hero have a brief Wile-E- Coyote / Roadrunner encounter on a tree branch. SUPER ! Oh, Tangled also has a very appealing Lost-Kidnapped Princess as Heroine and a delightful smoldering (his word) thief turned hero. The hero's gang of miss-fit-thief pals is supercalifragilistically amusing. There is a good ensemble song as well. <br/><br/>Almost forgot the Villainess (hissss booooo). She looks a lot like Cher and sings up a storm like a Broadway Diva. Again... TERRIFIC ! Disney required mascot, Pascal (a chameleon) this time around is rather over-shadowed in appeal by Maximus. Remember him ?. He just turns colors and makes hand movements that aren't really clear as he only has two fingers and little hands.<br/><br/>The animation is incredibly well done. There is a frying pan (with a large part in the proceedings)that looks as it it is really there and mighty even be a real frying pan. All the marks and dimples are just right. the scenery and special effects are also ""just right"".<br/><br/>There is a trio of little girls who have their day made when a lady with 70 feet of shining golden hair enters their city.<br/><br/>Little ""bits"" abound in this wonderful and rather neglected film from the Disney Company ... their 50th Animated offering and for me, one of their best."
"kenrothana","9","2","3","22 November 2015"," Most Inspiring Movie Ever!!!
","Tangled is one of the most inspiring movie of all the Disney's movies I've ever watched. It's also Disney's first CGI movie that got a PG rating (Parental Guidance), because the film contain some violent scenes that can be a little intense and frightening for young children, although the ending is very emotional. I remember when I first watched Tangled in a movie theater with my friend. It was about two months ago on my friend's birthday party, we decided to watch a comedian ghost movie together in cinema. And we we're late to see the movie so, our last option was ""Tangled"". I first expected that it was just some fairytale movie like all of the other Disney's princess movies, but when I watched it for about half an hour,I started to like this movie a lot and it turned out better than I expected, Tangled has it all- lovable characters, fantastic songs and a strong message about how life can change if other people believe in you. It was so emotional and I cried a lot especially the lantern scene and the ending scene. The film was no typical love story at all, it was the best movie throughout Disney's history and I'm so glad I get to watched it, although it was a coincidence.<br/><br/>I WOULD highly recommend this movie to every boys, girls, adults and children out there. You won't experience this amazing viewing unless you see it for yourself, I believe that this movie will make your day like it did to mine because this movie really touch my heart. And I look forward to watch this movie again someday."

","A modern twist on the story of Rapunzel, Disney's Tangled shows the wild, adventurous, and changing life of a teenage girl and her prince on a horse. Although it includes many aspects of a ""princess movie"" Tangled steers away from this classic category and opens up the audience to many besides young girls. The adventures of Rapunzel become much more than a search for prince charming and love. The story becomes a search for happiness, including family, love, adventure, and strength.<br/><br/>When Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) finds himself hiding away in Rapunzel's tower and becomes her captive Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) makes a deal with Flynn to take her to see the lights she so greatly wanted to see every year on her birthday in exchange for the crown, which Flynn stole from the kingdom. After Flynn agrees, and a lot of over thinking from Rapunzel, they begin a wild adventure together that can delight and warm the heart of any audience member. The quirky and adventurous Rapunzel will fill the screen with her endurance and strength that only grows throughout the movie. <br/><br/>With outstanding cast members, including Levi and Moore, any audience member can be intrigued and pulled into the Tangled fan club. The modern story of Rapunzel can only be made great with the help of great cast members.

"lee_eisenberg","5","2","3","29 October 2015"," now hair this
","Disney's 50th animated feature is an adaptation of the story of Rapunzel. I thought it neat that Maximus and Pascal put on a performance reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Usually this is the sort of movie that I would spend the whole time heckling like on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", but I didn't heckle ""Tangled"". I guess that Rapunzel's assertive qualities made her more interesting than previous princesses, kind of like Elsa and Anna in ""Frozen"".<br/><br/>And of course I can't resist noting the cast. I only loosely know about Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi. I understand that Donna Murphy is mainly a Broadway star. The rest of the cast catches my attention: Brad Garrett (Everybody Loves Raymond), Ron Perlman (Hellboy), Jeffrey Tambor (Arrested Development) and Richard Kiel (a 7-foot actor best known for a role in the James Bond franchise).<br/><br/>So, it's an OK, enjoyable movie. Not any sort of masterpiece. I will say that Rapunzel herself is a hottie."

"Lejink","7","1","1","9 April 2020"," Goldilocks And Her Free Hairs
","An apt film, as it turned out, to watch in lockdown, this free adaptation of the old fairy tale for me is the way Disney should be going, finding fresh tales to tell from the great collections rather than remaking their classic animations of the past as real-life features.<br/><br/>A winning combination of humour, music and animation, I rate this one of the best Pixar movies I've seen. Personally I do find the depiction of the characters slightly problematic, especially females with their massive eyes and eyelashes just making them, particularly the heroines, too cutesy. Perhaps the same could be said of the heavies whose ugly features are a bit too exaggerated too but I did like the way roguish Flynn / Eugene was shown. As for the backgrounds and individual details, these are pretty wonderful, like the depictions of grass, flowing water and of course Rapunzel's hair. Better yet is the imaginative staging of shots, some taking viewpoints we would now recognise as drone shots while others just demonstrate motion and speed in pleasing and often exhilarating ways, the best of them probably being the flying lanterns, which look like magical dolly mixtures in motion, which, trust me, is a very good thing. I enjoyed the vocal acting, the better for not being done by some megastar who doesn't need the work.<br/><br/>The story follows the classic template for this type of film, a young heroine (or hero), striking out for personal freedom, often to right a great wrong, usually against the advice of those around them. Usually too there is at least one and here in fact two cute animal companions, some romantic interest, a lot of feel-good songs, usually by Alan Menken and of course an evil baddie to pursue and thwart the central character until all is resolved for the inevitable happy ending.<br/><br/>Of course I appreciate that a film like this isn't aimed at the likes of me but I still enjoyed many of the gags, the songs, even if it perhaps lacks a really big number that sticks in the memory and the rollicking story. Sure some of the individual characterisations aren't too different from what we've seen before but this is definitely higher-grade Disney and a good fun movie to watch at a time like this."

This step-by-step change in the relationship and psychological process is the most attractive and most desirable. The section that lights the sky lantern is classic, I have to say. The residents of the city spontaneously prayed for the little princess who had been missing for many years. With the palace as the center, the sky lanterns of the people around them slowly lit up and lifted off. At this time, Rapunzel and Eugene were on the boat in the distant river, watching the sky lanterns of the imperial city lift off a little. Drifting across the river, filling the night sky, dreamlike, moving-both for the beauty of the sky lantern, but also for Rapunzel to achieve their wishes for many years and moved."

","TANGLED<br/><br/>The most important thing in this movie is the storyline where gothel steals rapunzel and that was my favorite part.
Tangled is a Disney movie that talks about a king and a queen, the queen becomes pregnant and sick and only a flower can heal her, all the castle employees go out to find the flower and find it.
The flower is used by a lady called Gothel who uses it to rejuvenate. When they take the flower to the castle and give the drink to the queen, Rapunzel is born, her hair shines. Gothel one day gets into a castle and steals Rapunzel and locks her in a hidden tower.
Rapunzel's hair begins to grow very fast and Gothel locks her up and she cant go out, every afternoon Rapunzel sings to Gothel so that she would rejuvenate herself but Rapunzel doesn't know that she sings for that.
One day a man named Finch comes to the tower and runs away with Rapunzel, many things happen, Gothel goes out to look for her and catch them and Rapunzel to save Finch she cures him with her hair and then cuts it off.
When they manage to escape she realizes that she is a princess, she goes to the castle where her parents are and she gets married to Finch.
The movie makes me feel various emotions and feelings,because you see when Gothel steals rapunzel and keeps her many years and says to her that she was her mother.

","One of the best animated movies that Disney has released this decade, alongside with Moana. It's funny, entertaining, heartwarming and also featuring the most likable Disney princess that Walt Disney Animation Studios have created. Nathan Greno and Byron Howard did a outstanding job on executing almost everything, including the story, which is based from the beloved fairy tale of the Brothers Grimm and of course just like every movie in existence - i do have some problems with it, but it does so many things right that is easy to ignore them and not getting distracted by them. If you haven't seen it, then i recommend it, if love animated movies."

","I couldn't resist! This is a true fairy tail! Also I want to see the 2D animation version!<br/><br/>It was the liberation story for Rapunzel. She was a princess who had been confined in the tower in the deep forest for 18 years because of her magical hair. I liked this distance between nature and civilization, I meant the kingdom. It made me feel like I saw a different world. I feel wonder and dream because there are undeveloped regions like ""Princess Mononoke.""<br/><br/>I was fascinated by unique and cute characters she met on the way. One of them was a one-armed pianist and another was a strange pantomime actor. I really like these playfulness of Disney. My favourite was a big man loves unicorns. I was surprised at the physical ability of Maximus, a horse chased around Eugene, the theif, with insistence.<br/><br/>An action scene in the canyon was intence and worth seeing! I wondered how the location setting was. It looked too clean and tidy though. Was it based on Grand Canyon or any mountain dams?"

Maximus, (the horse), alone, is better than most animated movies."
"ranblackman","8","1","1","10 April 2019"," Likeable
","That's really the best way to describe this movie. With Disney, you usually get movies that can be described this way. Their films, mostly their animated films, have a good streak of fun, cute, funny, and adventure titles that usually feature great theatrical music, and some rather impressive animation to boot.<br/><br/>Most all of this can be said for Tangled, as well as it's an admittedly predictable plot. Yes, we have them all is lost moments and a typical story of someone wanting more out of life. Where this film successes in the chemistry between the two leads. Rapunzel and Flynn are really good together. They bring in plenty of laughs and even some rather touching moments in the end. It is all simple, but there is something in that chemistry for everyone.<br/><br/>That's what I liked about it, even more, there is not too much childishness. It all evens out, and I did have a good time with it and would say to give it a watch if you haven't yet."

","Rapunzel is a noble and a very brave princess. This isn't only about a princess and a thief falling in love, but it is also about following your dreams but respecting your elders as well. Mother Gothel, even though she was a villain, had me laughing. It shows, to other mothers, not Mother Gothel in particular, how much mothers can care for their children. They want to protect them. Especially mothers and fathers. Even though Mother Gothel only loved Rapunzel for her magical, long hair, other mothers probably don't. The songs were touching and fun and exciting, and everything about Tangled was a magical expierence for me."

"TheMovieDiorama","8","1","1","17 March 2018"," Tangled lets its hair down producing yet another Disney classic.
","I've been avoiding this in an attempt to heighten the minimal amount of masculinity that I've acquired throughout my life. Rapunzel on a pink front cover doesn't convey laddish testosterone. So I reluctantly gave in and watched it...and oh boy I'm glad I did. Disney keep astonishing me with their animations, I really shouldn't be surprised anymore. A reinterpretation of the story of Rapunzel, a princess kidnapped and locked in a tower where an evil woman utilises the power of her hair to remain youthful. A nearby thief encounters the tower and is locked in a promise to guide her to the neighbouring kingdom, against the behest of her ""mother"". Tangled singled handedly put Disney's animation catalogue back on track after many lacklustre titles during the mid 00s. Incredibly easy to see why, this animation had it all. Developed memorable characters brimming with personality and harmonious voices, apparently everyone can sing in this kingdom. Ranging from royalty, thugs and peasants to a determined stallion and an expressive chameleon, this array of colourful characters breathe life into the plot. A fleshed out story dealing with dreams, internal conflict and romance. A witty screenplay boosted by sarcastic dialogue that creates plenty of smiles and laughter. Whether it be the various inaccurate wanted posters of Flynn, ""that smoulder"" or the constant requirement and usefulness of the average frying pan, it's these little details of self-awareness that enhances a basic narrative into the realms of memorability. The animation was absolutely stunning, plenty of fluid motion. The scene involving the lifting of lanterns just floored me. Beautifully crafted. The musical numbers were catchy which is all one needs for a Disney musical. Sure, the plot was predictable and the ending was far too rushed (underwhelming demise of the antagonist) but these shortfalls hardly detract from a entertaining animation that the whole family can enjoy. Well, maybe I should tackle 'Frozen' next..."
"rebeccalucy","7","1","1","10 December 2017"," A great Disney film...
","Tangled is a beautifully animated film, the lantern scene being absolutely stunning. It can also be used to create fast paced comedy and action. Flynn Rider is one of the best Disney princes, as he has a fun personality that develops throughout the film. The animation allows for some fun expressions between him and Rapunzel, unlike past ones.<br/><br/>I think the story is very thought out, giving reasons for Rapunzel to grow out her hair and why Mother Gothel wants her in the first place. It could have been really easy to phone in the plot, but a lot of time went into it. Furthermore, Maximus as the comedic relief is great. He doesn't need to talk to be funny, they allow him to have unique expressions. <br/><br/>However, the songs are quite good but don't always further the story. Sometimes they can be a little distracting or take away from the plot. The villain is quite threatening but sometimes needs to be developed a little bit more. In conclusion, a great Disney film with beautiful animation. But could use a little tweaking to make it fantastic!"
"oliviaberrecloth7","8","1","1","31 October 2017"," Really enjoyable.
","Tangled has been one of my favourites for years. It's always up there when I'm asked about my favourite movie. I've rewatched it countless times and enjoyed it. A little ridiculous and unrealistic at times, but that wont affect the rating I give it. The songs are great, well, except one or two, but that seems to happen with every Disney movie I've watched. <br/><br/>The ""I See The Light"" scene is absolutely incredible. So much work and time had gone into Tangled, so much attention to detail. It really is a beautiful movie. Enjoyable for all ages, a fun, entertaining and enjoyable film to watch."
"peaceluver-11155","10","1","1","17 October 2017"," A hair-raising adventure!
","Watching Tangled is like experiencing magic, romance, and all the qualities of childhood wonder unfold with a stellar story line. It has the elements to qualify it as a classic Disney film, such as vibrant, singing characters, intelligent animal sidekicks, and a sweet, naive princess who is swept away from her troubles by a dashingly handsome prince. However, the plot is also heavily modernized, and the characters are much more complex than those of past Disney films. The prince, also known as Flynn Rider, is actually no more than a common thief, whose morals may seem a bit skewed, but deep down has a noble heart. He is also filled with sarcastic one-liners, an apathetic attitude, and enough charm to make a theater full of women swoon. Rapunzel, on the other hand, is not the average damsel-in-distress. She may need Flynn's help navigating her way through the outside world, but it is clear from the moment she struck him on the head with a frying pan that she can easily stand on her own. She has a bright mind and a whole lot of hair on her side, and in many instances, she is actually the one saving Flynn. Tangled is a film worthy of withstanding the test of time because it combines touches of classic and modern magic that are enough to please all audiences.<br/><br/>There is a set formula, tried and true, for a Disney classic. It must have singing. It must have romance. And no matter what, it absolutely must end with ""and they all lived happily ever after."" The soundtrack of this film is a work of art. Songs such as ""When Will My Life Begin"" and ""I've Got a Dream"" are buoyantly upbeat, and the lyrics apply perfectly to the story and the mood. Then there is ""Mother Knows Best,"" sung by the talented Donna Murphy. Her rich voice perfectly matches the condescending approach to Rapunzel's ignorance of the outside world. In addition, Disney's animators pay incredible attention to detail, and whenever Mother Gothel addresses Rapunzel endearingly, she always kisses her magical hair and calls her ""my flower."" On the other hand, Flynn always pushes Rapunzel's hair out her face so he can see her face better. These subtle gestures show that Flynn's love for Rapunzel is different true. Of course, the most beautiful song in this movie is ""I See the Light,"" where Rapunzel and Flynn unofficially devote their new dreams to each other. It encapsulates their emotions and shows how much they have both grown from this magical adventure.<br/><br/>Tangled also has one of the greatest love stories of all time. It begins when the two characters meet. Rapunzel steps into the light, looking all strong and confident, and it is visible in Flynn Rider's expression that he is absolutely taken away by her beauty. This does not mean that their relationship can be described as love at first sight. In fact, Flynn even says, 'the only thing I want with your hair, is to get out of it."" Even after he is unwillingly locked into this promise to take Rapunzel to see the floating lanterns, he tries multiple times to convince her to go back to her tower, allowing him to snake out of their deal. A major turning point is when Rapunzel stops the Vikings from turning in Flynn, and he gets a glimpse at her kind, optimistic heart. This is when he begins to look out for her because he cares. He reveals his deepest secrets to her and she does the same. This unlikely friendship blossoms as they adventure through town together, and the love in Flynn's eyes is clear when Rapunzel turns around with flowers braided into her hair. When they sing ""I See the Light"" together in the picturesque scene, surrounded by hundreds of lights, they finally express their love for one another for the first time. This love is much stronger than that of a princess who meets her prince once, declares it to be love, and instantly marries him. This power couple has been through a lot together; they have seen the worst and the best of each other, and they still love each other, flaws and all. In the end, Rapunzel nobly sacrifices her freedom to save Flynn's life, and Flynn immediately sacrifices his life to grant Rapunzel freedom from the evil Mother Gothel. In the end, of course, they do live happily ever after. The villain is defeated, Rapunzel is reunited with her loving family, and her and Flynn eventually get married.<br/><br/>The most important factor that makes Tangled a wonderful movie is that it sends a positive message to its audience, which mainly consists of children who rely on these films to guide the type of person they'll grow up to be. It teaches them to pursue their dreams passionately. It shows a powerful role model who fights ferociously for what she believes in but still continues to see good in everyone. It proves that true love is about being willing to make sacrifices for one another. For these reasons, Tangled should forever be revered as one of the classics."
"choirina","8","1","1","10 April 2017"," The movie was brilliant.
","I'm a huge fan of this movie, ""Tangle"". If you have any interest in Romance genre, you must fall in love with this movie. This movie is about the love story between a girl who has really long hair and a boy who was a thief. It's a genre of Romance but it also has some parts of fantasy genre. There's no time to be bored. In this movie, there are some amazing songs such as ""When will my life begin"", ""Healing Incantation"" and ""I see the light"". Those songs are really impressive and touching. And they helped me to be immersed in the story. There is an another reason I love the ""Tangled"". There is an adorable lizard whose name is ""Pascal"" in this movie. Actually, he is my favorite character. Even I planned to parcel out a lizard like him. Although, everything of ""Tangled"" is perfect, there is one thing to be desired. The boyfriend of Rapunzel, yujin cut Rapunzel's hair at the finish to save her from Gothel who is a fake mother of her. Frankly speaking, Rapunzel looks better on long, blond hair. Her hair was too gorgeous to miss! Nevertheless, the overall story and character etc was the best that I've ever seen!! He always helps Rapunzel and be with her all the time. Although"
"SquigglyCrunch","8","1","1","24 November 2016"," Fun Characters Accompanied by a Good Story and Soundtrack
","Tangled follows a woman named Rapunzel who is raised in a tower all her life but one day meets a man called Flynn Rider whom she recruits to take her outside the tower. <br/><br/>Quickly I wanted to appreciate this title. I never really thought about it, but it is pretty clever. After having long hair I can relate to it and sympathize with Rapunzel so much more. If having hair only down to my neck gets tangled, I can't imagine her trouble. <br/><br/>The characters are a lot of fun to watch interact with each other or indulge in their own thoughts. Since Rapunzel spends some time alone in the tower, that aspect has to have some focus. She's a super fun character in the movie, and she works really well with Flynn's character, who is also a lot of fun. He's one of the only sane characters in the movie, but he's still kind of insane, so he fit in just fine. These characters were all pretty well-fleshed out and thus, I felt the feels fairly often. In particular I felt tears twice in this movie, even though this was the third time I'd seen it (but the most recent). <br/><br/>The comedy works really well. It fits the movie, and is often situational, so it flows really well. While it isn't an incredibly funny movie, it at least doesn't try to force jokes into the story. It takes them as they come. But the humor wasn't the only thing that made me smile. This is such a fun movie, and I found a smile to be very present throughout it. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is a lot of fun too. The songs aren't gratuitous or overdone, and often serve the purpose of driving the plot or developing a certain aspect of the story, all the while poking fun at itself, specifically in the form of Flynn Rider's character. Plus Disney just got good voices to sing the songs. Unfortunately, sometimes it was a little too obvious that the character's voice actors weren't always singing the songs, but that was only on one occasion. <br/><br/>There was one thing I didn't notice the first couple times I saw this movie, but Disney dares to dip it's foot into the waters of maturity. Without spoilers, it briefly deals with the idea of unhealthy, potentially abusive relationships. It's done mostly through imagery, and isn't blatant, but I definitely noticed it, and I kind of respected it more for that. Plus it just fit the movie as a whole. <br/><br/>If I have but one flaw with this movie, it's the method of Rapunzel's big realization at the end. It makes sense, sure, but it's still a little far fetched. As for the ending itself, it's pretty generic in terms of these kinds of movies, but it's still amusing. <br/><br/>Overall Tangled is a heartfelt, fun movie. The soundtrack is fun, the characters are fun and engaging, and the movie strikes up genuine feelings. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie."
"pieceofthi","8","1","1","30 July 2016"," Tangled has that Disney magic with their fairy-tail
","I saw Tangled yesterday in 3D, and let me just say, I'm glad I did. When I entered the theater and saw a huge line, I immediately noticed that every person in the line was under the age of nine. Now, while I was a little embarrassed, I was still too excited to see the movie to care that much. Tangled's heroine, Rapunzel, is a typical Disney princess. <br/><br/>This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies."
"specismaster","7","1","1","20 December 2010"," Disney returns to form
","I was very pleased with last year's The Princess and the Frog, and this year Disney has again impressed me. Tangled brings back the likes of Glen Keane and Alan Menken in a visually delightful and fun reprise of the sort of films Disney produced twenty years ago, although the dialogue and pacing is noticeably modernized; such is either good or bad, depending on, among other factors, your age. Alan's creative touch in the film's songs is immediately recognizable to older Disney fans, as is, regrettably, the inevitable use of Autotune (although Mandy Moore is a perfect choice for a Disney heroine, as she both acts and sings exquisitely). The two leads speak much as two teenagers today would, although some of Flynn's lines are too corny to tolerate.<br/><br/>No review of this film would be complete without praise for the stunning backgrounds and perfectly calibrated lighting, as well as Rapunzel's incredibly rendered hair; I, not normally a fan of computer animation, was visually satiated throughout the entire picture. The visual style of Tangled was clearly less photorealistic than simply photogenic, which is a sight for sore eyes after an industry-wide bombardment of gaudy effects for the better part of a decade.<br/><br/>In summary, long-time followers of Disney would do well to see Tangled, as would children who have yet to be introduced to the studio's work."

Of course, Rapunzel is able to win the ""bad boy"" and her love makes him renounce thievery at the very end of the movie. Message to young girls: run off with the first guy who winks at you even if he is an outlaw, because he's a fun bad boy that will change all for the better because he met you.

"terephiel","1","32","119","24 November 2010"," A classic tale butchered like Rapunzel's hair.
","When I first heard that Disney was working on an adaptation of ""Rapunzel,"" I was undoubtedly excited. The classic Brothers Grimm tale has always been among my favorite stories, right next to ""Hansel and Gretel,"" ""Prince Swan,"" and ""Brother and Sister."" I was even more enthusiastic when I heard that it was going to be the most beautiful film Disney had ever made. During its ""Rapunzel: Unbraided"" phase, I started becoming apprehensive, clearly fearing (as most others did) that the film was going to be a Dreamworks rip-off.<br/><br/>My fears eventually died down and turned to joy once again when it was retitled ""Rapunzel"" and had the traditional leads of Rapunzel and Prince Bastion. An online interview with one of the animators I read spoke of how Bastion was the classic prince from the fairy tale who had a basset hound that pranced around his heels. More concept artwork emerged, making me count down the days until ""Rapunzel"" finally premiered. I didn't know until much later that Glen Keane suffered a heart attack and passed direction of the film to Nathan Greno and Byron Howard. When they changed the title to ""Tangled"" and changed the prince's name to ""Prince Flynn,"" my feelings wavered a bit, but then I told myself that the changes weren't *that* bad. It was only when they changed Flynn to a common thief named ""Flynn Rider"" whose personality was a blatant rip-off of Prince Naveen's (""The Princess and the Frog"") did I became angry and apprehensive more than ever before.<br/><br/>The marketing did nothing to bolster my confidence in the film, nor did it do so for anyone else. I spoke strong opinions of my utter hatred for ""Tangled,"" but was accused multiple times of judging it before I'd seen it. I went into ""Tangled"" with a grudgingly open mind and came out as disappointed as I always knew I'd be. The animation was beautiful, but it wasn't the ""moving oil painting"" look we'd been promised. I'm also sure other studios could replicate the same look if they wanted to. A lot of the music was just as beautiful, but Rapunzel's opening song ""When Will My Life Begin?"" reminded me of an 80s sitcom for some reason, as well as something out of ""Shrek."" As long as I'm mentioning ""Shrek,"" the second reprisal of said song was eerily similar to the Princess Fiona and bird scene from the first ""Shrek"" film. The only good songs ""Tangled"" had going for it were ""Kingdom Dance"" (a lively medieval tune) and ""I See the Light"" (reminiscent of ""A Whole New World"" from ""Aladdin"").<br/><br/>I didn't laugh at any point because I found the film's humor to be corny and like that of ""Shrek."" Calling the tavern ""The Snuggly Duckling?"" What kind of name is that? The only characters I found I could like were Rapunzel and her chameleon sidekick, Pascal (I finally found out where his name came from, which I thought was very clever). He's the most adorable sidekick to date. Maximus looked like a mash between the horse from ""The Road to El Dorado,"" Samson (""Sleeping Beauty""), and Achilles (""The Hunchback of Notre Dame""). He also acted like Scooby Doo with his sniffing along the ground like a dog. The idea of a ""cop horse"" was also not funny. Mother Gothel looked like a cross between Janet Jackson and Cher, actually creeping me out. Obviously, my biggest complaint was that Flynn was changed from a prince into a thief. The character of Rapunzel's prince is among my favorite in the Brothers Grimm stories, and it ticked me off that they lowered him to such a pitiful and unoriginal character.<br/><br/>Disney can deny it all they want, but they made the changes they did because they didn't think boys would want to watch another ""Princess"" film. Since when did they care what we guys thought? Everything out today is either ""Disney Princess"" or ""Disney Fairies."" If they *really* cared about attracting a male audience, they should have worked on that ""Disney Heroes"" line they had going years ago, or make a film based solely on a male protagonist or a gender-neutral film. They shouldn't have used a beautiful fairy tale like ""Rapunzel"" to do it. And while I'm on the subject, where's the boys' merchandise? I haven't seen a single male-oriented ""Tangled"" toy on the shelves yet! I can only give ""Tangled"" two stars out of ten: one star for good animation, the other for good music. Everything else just ruined this once promising film. If it'd remained more faithful to the original story, then I'm sure this could very well have been Disney's crowning achievement. Their final product can hardly be compared to such classics like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast."" If anything, it's more like ""Shrek"" or ""How to Train Your Dragon."" My hopes have shifted to the company's newest fairy tale film, ""Brave,"" which I hope will make up for what ""Tangled"" lacks. I feel sorry for those who can't see this film for the travesty it really is (which is apparently pretty much everyone)."
"colinrgeorge","5","14","45","1 December 2010"," Disney's Mangled
","This is what you get for not seeing ""The Princess and the Frog."" Disney eschewed its revitalization of traditional animation for this forgettable CG adaptation of Rapunzel, which goes by the nondescript nom de plume: ""Tangled.""<br/><br/>If the recent announcement that the animation giant is placing a moratorium on fairy tale films should come as a surprise to anyone, their position on the matter is telegraphed plainly into the first five minutes of their latest and last: modern audiences won't sit for straight- faced fantasy. The name-change alone underscores the corporation's feelings on the commercial viability of a tradition it once held proud.<br/><br/>That willful dissolution of magic is a slap in the face to ""Snow White"" or ""Sleeping Beauty."" ""Tangled"" begins with striking imagery, but buries it beneath a sour, smarmy voice over by this year's prince-not-so-charming, Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi). As narrator, he cracks jokes at the expense of the archetypical framework—as if he doesn't, and we shouldn't, treat the story with one modicum of seriousness. Being cavalier about your own film isn't a great way to hook your viewers.<br/><br/>Thus ""Tangled"" is a disengaging experience from the outset. It downplays its fairy tale roots, but then never defies them. It disinterests us in its world, and then asks us to spend ninety minutes there. Worse, it suffers from sloppy characterization, including one of the single weakest antagonists in Disney history. Donna Murphy plays Mother Gothel to Mandy Moore's Rapunzel, and neither has a lick of personality. The irksome Flynn is practically the only other human character, with the rest of the world being populated by nameless thugs and townspeople. When so much relies on so few, you'd think more attention would be paid to making them distinct.<br/><br/>Essentially, Repunzel's sole remarkable trait is her magic hair, a plot device that is curiously ignored throughout the film. There are plenty of early gags visualizing how she manipulates it (for instance, in order to lift her mother into the tower), but it's clearly an afterthought as her adventure is set into motion. To illustrate, the princess emerges from a stream without any indication of the added water weight. She never once has her locks stepped on, snagged, or caught in a door. I thought this movie was called ""Tangled!"" Having hair that long would be a major inconvenience, people!<br/><br/>Maybe I'm splitting hairs (ouch); I probably shouldn't have expected anything more from ""Tangled""—it's the near unanimous praise I don't understand. The songs are lousy, the characters are dull (save for one spunky chameleon), and the story merely suffices (but then it's tough to break something that's survived hundreds of years). The film is so clearly catered to a younger crowd that my curmudgeonly opinion is somewhat irrelevant, but with Pixar managing year after year to satisfy the storytelling needs of both adults and children, Disney's ""Tangled"" is an immediate relic. It's a film made for twelve year olds who need to be convinced that fairy tales aren't stupid and boring.<br/><br/>""Enchanted"" and ""The Princess and the Frog"" were classic Disney films despite their flaws. Their creators clearly understood what made the studio in its prime so successful. ""Tangled"" is a harmless children's cartoon, but it doesn't recapture any of the magic the company is known for. Instead, it takes a snide approach to the Rapunzel story while simultaneously contributing nothing to it. I may not be the target audience, but to quote an old friend, ""If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out."""

Instead, she repeatedly knocks him unconscious with an iron skillet, locks him in a closet, ties him up with her hair in a chair, interrogation style, and then forces him to agree to a deal. In the process, she directly contradicts her faux mother's deepest fears and warnings about leaving the tower. Nope, this is not your 20th century Disney princess. Its the 21st century Disney princess. This is one tough young woman who sets her own destiny, although not without deep-felt feelings of ambiguity and guilt about disobeying mother's orders (albeit a faux mother who definitely does not have the best interests of the young Rapunzel in mind).<br/><br/>For the lesser sex (aka, male homo sapiens), sit up and learn a few lessons. In spite of the string of garbage you have consumed from Pixar for the last 12 or so years, the modern world is not a series of testosterone-laden misadventures. Nope, to compete in this world, you had better learn to value and depend on Rapunzel's golden fleece as Flynn Rider does throughout this movie, particularly during the action sequences. In fact, you are only a secondary player in life.<br/><br/>It is fortunate that Disney chose Rapunzel, its 50th animated feature, to stay relevant. This film will likely go down as its greatest triumph, much better than those male-dominated also rans, such as the Lion King or Alladin. The visuals are strikingly gorgeous, perhaps even better than Miyazaki. It uses a rich cadre of characters and formats to present the content, including slapstick, mime, melodrama, Broadway musical, action, occasional Faustian undercurrents, and so forth. It pulls all the right emotional strings, supported by a wonderful musical score. With two great feminist movies in a single year (Rapunzel and Alice in Wonderland), Disney stays relevant, and gets my vote."

","What can I say about ""Tangled"" that has not been said before about every other Disney movie before it. Like every fairy tale before it, liberties were taken with the original tale to expand it into a movie, the animation is breath taking, the actors and characters are excellent and it has its own morality tale behind it as usual. The songs are memorable but not as infectious as anything from say ""Aladdin"" or ""The Little Mermaid"" and much like Ariel and Jasmine, Rapunzel has a certain buried sexuality about her when she's not bouncing around like a Disney Channel pop star on soda and candy bars. The characterizations and mannerisms are fun to watch of course; at times, you forget these are animated characters. You can really see the efforts the animators made to have these characters move, react and respond like living people. The best parts mostly surround the character of Rider with the horse Maximilian and how Rapunzel reacts with her color-changing chameleon. I watched the movie because I like to see how far the animation is coming, and Rapunzel's ridiculous long tresses look perfect, but the story itself is just as much fun to watch."
"Work424","Null","3","6","16 November 2011"," Disney's Terrific Comeback
","Without a doubt, Tangled is the best Disney Princess movie ever made. While the Princess and the Frog failed, Tangled made up for it with room to spare. It had so much more of a plot than the others, and was really creative. It has so many good lines (Tangled quotes are still very common in our house). And the music was fantastic! They're the kind of songs that get stuck in your head, and you don't really mind. I think people of all ages would enjoy this movie. Even all the kids who had outgrown fairy tales would want to get ""tangled up""! Plus, the animation on this movie was absolutely incredible. Tangled is a perfect movie to curl up and watch, and I absolutely loved it. It was creative, with fantastic animation, catchy songs, and good jokes. I give it ten out of ten stars."

","Since Pixar has taken over creative control over Disney projects, they have gone up. Not only financially but also creatively. And it shows in the outcome of this movie too. While there might be a musical number or two too many in this one, they are still pretty rare. And if you can endure them, you will be treated to a very funny movie. With animals that might not sing (or talk for that matter), but do have a mind of their own nonetheless.<br/><br/>And it's the animals that almost outshine the human (drawn) cast. But while the story is predictable, you will find yourself cheering for the all the right reasons (if you are not too pessimistic that is, of course). Or too cynical.

"MovieJunky101","8","3","6","20 December 2010"," Oh Disney, you've still got it
","All right, finally to the good stuff. Tangled, the latest Disney movie, or should I say the first decent Disney (animated) movie in years. Honestly, when is the last time you saw a decent Disney Animated feature? And yes, I mean Disney, not Pixar. All right, lets back up a minute here. Tangled is the first Disney Fairytale, in years. Originally Tangled was set to be something of an Enchanted-type flick, but the idea was scraped, when the producers realized, uh we're the Disney corporation, we kind of invented the animated fairytale. Which is really eloquent way of saying, that Tangled (bad name by the way, should have stayed Repunzel) is a wonderful throwback to the old days of Disney, the Snow White days, the Cinderella, the Swan Princess days. I felt completely entranced by the story, and excited to see the characters develop. Taking the original Grimm Brothers tale and giving it that classic Disney flavor, that gives the story that light, fluffy taste we all know and love. The fun, funny, free-spirit attitude is just what animation needed and in the end made me really happy, and really, what's a Disney movie without that little twinge of joy? Disney's first CGI Fairytale brought the warmth and sensitivity of their hand-drawn films to CGI was a complete success and a fun, entertaining evening the whole family can enjoy. (Do I actually say things like that?) The real flaw with Tangled, was the marketing campaign, from the commercials it seemed kind of stupid. They should have marketed it as a classic Disney movie, adding in the funny little scenes with Flynn and guitar playing Repunzel. I honestly didn't even know the movie was a musical until the first song. Maybe they were trying to get a wider audience, I don't know, but I'm glad I gave it the chance to surprise me. ++Who knew Zachary Levi could sing?"

I won't say anything about the 3d as I watched it in 2d (I hate this 3D hype). About the animation... well sometimes i felt Rapunzel's hair was a ribbon (kinda hard to describe, but it was definitely weird) but other than that it was good (although I myself don't prefer animated movies) So all in all, I felt like a child again some moments were touching others really funny (the bar scene was hilarious) so I'll say this movie felt like a classic Disney movie (and when i say classic i mean the classics from the '90s like aladdin, lion king, so the Disney movies i grew up on)"
"MaeAbdulbaki","9","3","6","8 December 2010"," An Instant Classic
","**This review contains spoilers**<br/><br/>This is the first Disney princess movie in 3D, and anyone who thought that Disney couldn't bring magic to a movie without Pixar being involved was proved wrong with this ""Tangled"".<br/><br/>The movie, as cliché as it sounds, is an instant classic. Not only will your children love it, but adults will as well.<br/><br/>Rapunzel, voiced by Mandy Moore, is a beautiful, held back lost princess waiting for her chance to break out into the world after being locked in a tower for eighteen years by a witch filled with greed.<br/><br/>Flynn Rider, voiced by Zachary Levi, is a reluctant savior and thief who only really seems to care about himself, at least until he meets Rapunzel.<br/><br/>The songs, composed by Disney alum Alan Menken, are catchy and serve the story well, especially the song titled ""Mother Knows Best"" and its reprise.<br/><br/>The movie isn't bogged down by random characters flowing in and out of the story just for laughs, but they are characters who end up serving the story's climax and that is refreshing. There have been several 3D animations in the recent past that have tried to introduce too many characters and end up overwhelming the audience without furthering the plot or individual characterizations.<br/><br/>The horse and the chameleon, Pascal and Max, are very funny and have much of the comedic relief although they have no speaking parts. Also, the romantic scene between the two leads amongst the lanterns floating into the air was perfection. Very, very well done.<br/><br/>Overall, I very much enjoyed this movie and would highly suggest you go see it! An instant classic!"
"sford605","10","3","6","6 December 2010"," Tangled was a triumph- but perhaps not quite a classic
","I will start this off by saying that I have been raised on Disney classics and I have watched (again and again) every Disney classic- all the way from Snow White to The Lion King, so I have very high standards in cartoons. With that said, I found this movie to be a fantastic movie for child and adult alike. It is funny, lively, cute, well-animated, and, of course, has music composed by the one and only Alan Menken (and I can assure you that if you liked his work in classics like Beauty and the Beast then you will love his work in Tangled). However, I'm not sure if it is worthy of joining the ranks of such masterpieces as Sleeping Beauty. First off, it was computer animated and I have always been a fan of hand-drawn cartoons. This I can easily overlook though as the animation was still great. The film's two fairly significant flaws were the villain and the singing. Mandy Moore was not as good a singer as any of the earlier princesses and the villain's character was not fully developed. Other than that, the film is easily worthy of joining the ranks of the Disney classics. <br/><br/>So, in closing, the film is a must-see. This is especially true for you Disney fans as this is a return to the Disney style we all know and love. When viewing this do not expect perfection, but definitely do expect excellence as this is just shy of being perfect."
"quoozlefreak","10","3","6","5 December 2010"," An AMAZING movie
","I grew up on Disney. I am a typical Disney child. At the same time, I'm a hardcore traditional 2-dimensional animation type of gal. For a while, I've been of the belief that Disney's 3D movies weren't quite as good or had the soul of their 2D classics. Not to say their 3d movies aren't bad... just not the same. So I went in expecting a good movie, but not something spectacular.<br/><br/>Tangled blew me away. It blew right eff out there. I loved this movie. It is my newest favorite Disney movie, and possibly right up there in my top ten favorite movies ever.<br/><br/>From the first moment it started, I was drawn in. The first two minutes, I'll admit to crying. Because the storytelling and the gorgeous animation in this movie is soooo amazing. It takes a different and more elaborate twist on the tale of Rapunzel, but in the best of ways. Still, this movie had me crying a good chunk of the time. Especially in the lantern scene, between the king and queen.<br/><br/>Now a lot of people say Pascal and Max stole the show, but I disagree. Yes, they were funny, especially with the Max and Flynn interaction. Pascal I honestly didn't care for too much. To me, I viewed them as sidekicks that were... well, sidekicks. They didn't overshadow their heroes.<br/><br/>And Gothel. Ah Gothel. I am naturally biased not to like Gothel because she looks eerily like my English professor. Come to think of it... they're both control freaks too... Ehm, but that's digressing, because I despite disliking her, I like Gothel more than my professor. And as far as Disney villains go... I find her to be the most confusing. Yes, at the beginning of the movie, we are presented with her true intentions for Rapunzel but I can't help but wonder if somewhere along the way, she truly did come to love Rapunzel as her own? It's very difficult to say, and I have found myself extremely confused as to whether she is truly really evil or not. I can say, though, that she is highly unpleasant.<br/><br/>The ending is also one of my favorite parts... mostly because it concerns my own hair color, and it makes me feel better about myself.<br/><br/>My only regret about this movie is that I didn't see it in 3D. For the lantern scene alone, it would be worth it.<br/><br/>I don't know how many times I can say it: This is an amazing movie. It is worth your time, it is worth your money, and it... it is truly Disney at its best."

","When we think about Disney, we look back on those oldies but goodies hand-drawn animated classics that have good songs and full of heart, but did we ever dream to think that musicals in their movies would be coming back when they began working on CGI? Well no we haven't because for most people, they think the new Disney is dead to them.<br/><br/>Recently one year after coming back to the old drawing board for The Princess and the Frog in 2009, Disney continues going back for more computer animation, but there's one slight change; they went back to making a princess movie after Princess Tiana got created, yet they still haven't lost their touch for the musicals we all remember from when we were kids.<br/><br/>Not only is Tangled the first CGI musical movie for the holidays, but also the star of the film Rapunzel is the first ever CGI princess in the history of all Disney princess.<br/><br/>If you remember the old story tale of Rapunzel, you may know that she is the classical one for having long locks of big hair. Even before Walt Disney's death in the late 1960s, it's no wonder that after so many movies, they didn't have the time to make a movie out of Rapunzel til now.<br/><br/>And more than 70 years later, it's happen. Tangled is now Disney's 50th animated feature.<br/><br/>Characters such as Flynn Rider and many more (not so much had good names) in the movie Tangled take you on the twisted ways of adventure; something that you will not be catching in most of the other regular Disney princess movies.<br/><br/>With it's highest critic and audience ratings, Tangled is the must-watch movie for all Disney goers. And soon should be added to your collection. Do not miss it!"

","This was the first of two movies I watched with my movie theatre-working friend today (The other one was Faster). The trailers made me wonder if the whole thing was gonna be a little too slapstick for my tastes but having now seen it, I shouldn't have been too worried as it had an equal amount of heart, drama, action, and, yes, laughs. And knowing Disney veteran composer Alan Menken was involved with the songs-with the help of lyricist Glenn Slater-made this film even more enjoyable especially when the number of ""I've Got a Dream"" was performed by a bunch of bar customers that were considered monsters before that. Of the voice actors, I knew ""Chuck""s Zachary Levi was the leading man because of his spots during his show that publicized the movie and about Mandy Moore playing the long-haired princess from some sites but I didn't know about Brad Garrett, Jeffery Tambor, or, best surprise to me, Richard Kiel whom I've long loved for his portrayal of Jaws in both The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker (When I mentioned the last to my friend, he says he doesn't remember those movies or maybe he didn't even see them, I don't know). Anyway, that's a high recommendation for Tangled."

","I must admit that I enjoy Disney movies. They are always trying to push the envelope and outdo themselves each time they make a movie. You can always expect quality, after all they have been making movies for a long time and should know how to make it work by now. With that said Tangled will be a Disney classic. I was really happy to find a good movie dedicated to what Disney is best at...Princess movies. Rapunzel has never been one of my favorite fairy tales, so I wasn't too sure about this one. Well I'm glad I took a chance. They took the Rapunzel story and really built a great storyline and the characters were definitely likable, as they should be in a Disney movie. I took three 9 year old girls and an 11 year old boy to see this movie. They all enjoyed it, including myself. There is something for everybody.

","Just got back from a 3D showing of Tangled with 2 10 year old girls.<br/><br/>The movie was GREAT! One of the more enjoyable kids films I have seen - it REALLY works for adults as much as kids..and not just girls either.<br/><br/>The animation was top notch and VERY effective use of 3D. Much better than Toy Story. The 3D definitely enhanced the film, and there were some scenes that we actually reached out our hands to try to grab something! A first for us! The story seemed a little 'meatier' and mature than some of the other Disney films, while retaining the formula 'spunky girl goes after her dream and nobody is going to stop her.' I really don't want to talk about the plot because I thought it was very well laid out, with a TERRIFIC villainess, and a smart alec -tho-you'll-learn-to-love-him guy and a really likable girl. But it s a very clever take on the Rapunzel story.<br/><br/>I was never bored.. I laughed (the humor is REALLY good - so slapstick, but some refreshingly subtle humor too). and yes, I cried (won't tell you why).<br/><br/>This may be the most enjoyable Disney film I have seen in a LONG time.<br/><br/>There were only 2 things I wished they did differently.<br/><br/>1) The songs. They were 'okay' and served the film well, but nothing really stood out. I left the theater and couldn't remember one song. Nothing like ""under the sea"" or ""circle of life"" from the earlier films that stay with you after the credits have long gone by.<br/><br/>2) speaking of credits, these were the lamest closing credits I think I have ever seen in a big budget film. There was nothing to keep our interest (and the closing credits were LONG).. No animation.. no clips.. no outtakes.. no surprise scene at the end, etc. Just text scroll. Of course, most people don't include closing credits in their review, but I have seen so many clever credits (remember Lemony Snicket's closing credits?) that after such a cleverly done film, just seeing plain text scroll for 5 minutes was disappointing.. Of course, we were the only ones left in the theater watching the credits so this may mean nothing to most people...<br/><br/>Highly recommended for the entire family.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

","With or without 3-D, ""Tangled"" looks set to overtake last year's under-achieving ""The Princess and the Frog"" at the box-office. What's more, its non-verbal horse named Maximus is bound to give Shrek's talkative Donkey a run for the money! The tale of Rapunzel (voice of Mandy Moore) gets a revisionist twist here and she is 'rescued' not by a handsome prince on a white horse but a young, egoistic bandit (Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider) and a horse (named Maximus) that thinks it is a dog. The villain is Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy), the narcissistic witch who imprisons our princess in a secluded tower.<br/><br/>Like ""Beauty & The Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Rapunzel"" also comes with musical and dance numbers. Except for 'Mother Knows Best', most of them have yet to catch on with the public. They may not be as catchy as those of Little Mermaid but given time, some may actually work their magic.<br/><br/>What I like best are the solid Disney characterisations, especially of its animals. Mandy Moore's Rapunzel suitably represents Every Girl who is forced to stay home; Flynn plays the Bad Boy-type who sorely needs to be tamed and corrected by the proverbial Love; and the manipulative Mother Gothel aptly reflects the way some kids view their over-protective parent.<br/><br/>The show-stealers are the mandatory animal sidekicks - a chameleon named Pascal and the palace horse Maximus. These are not just supporting characters but they have actual 'acting' duties as well. And the fact that they do not speak, helps to boost realism and makes them even funnier. Of course, the action is popcorn stuff but the social themes it explores make for worthy parental contemplation. A fitting film for everyone to let down their hair. - By LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)"

"johnnyboyz","6","4","10","9 December 2011"," In spite of often paling in comparison to most other recent animations, Tangled is a charming enough romp which ticks enough boxes.
","Disney's latest is a feast for the senses in as much one cannot deny its colour; exuberance; 'crack on with it' attitude and generally fun, frantic nature - but this is all it is in regards to that age-old ""feast for the senses"" line, as I cannot say I felt a genuine nor heartfelt taking to it like I can to some of their other works and nor can I muster a reaction along the lines of being particularly moved. The film is sassy and effervescent, a film in the Disney mould of its depicting the adventures of a young, often socially starved by her father/mother, heroine getting caught up in all sorts of plots and pratfalls with a range of oddball folk along the lines of Aladdin; Pocahontas and The Little Mermaid resulting in change and great adventure. The film follows that of the Mandy Moore voiced Rapunzel, a young girl who lives with her mother and steadily approaches her eighteenth birthday. Only, she doesn't actually live with her mother but a faux-incarnation of a mothering figure – the dastardly Gothel (Murhpy), who begins the film as a haggard elderly lady before finding a magical flower enabling her to become young and stay young. In order to do so, she must constantly harnesses the power which comes about to be imbued within that of the infant Rapunzel's hair, a catch which is brought about when Rapunzel's REAL mother harnesses the life from the flower herself so as to keep her alive during childbirth. With Moore's character possessing a sort of trichological Holy Grail, and having been stolen away from her true parents, of whom look suspiciously like the king and queen out of 1959's Sleeping Beauty, she finds herself locked away in a tower by herself at the bereft of the person she presumes to be her true guardian.<br/><br/>The heroine on this occasion isn't the best of young female leads that the American animated movie making corporation have ever come up with. Cut from a stone more akin to that of a recent, Disney-mass produced 'conveyor belt' generation of young women along the lines of Hannah Montana and Selena Gomez, Rapunzel is a po-faced; ""Best. Day. Ever!"" quipping poster child incarnation more broadly representative of this and is disappointing in this light. She is, however, ridiculously talented in an array of fields which range from astronomy (perhaps at a time before most astronomers did what they did?) to dress-making; her burgeoning young adulthood cranking things up a gear when she desires to step outside of the proverbial bubble, much to Gothel's disdain when she realises the magic she possesses will go with her.<br/><br/>In essence, we have a film about a young girl wanting to grow up coming up against an elderly woman wanting to grow down – that is to say stay young. Said dynamic brings about the film's best song, ""mother knows best"", in a sort of verbal psychoanalytical orgy of why young Rapunzel should stay locked in the tower with her pet chameleon rather than get out and explore as she approaches adulthood like she wants to. Unfortunately, and on a much more detrimental note, we have had the likes of Black Swan released in 2011; the 'sordid' mother-daughter relationship here paling in comparison to Aronofsky's forcing drama with the whole thing, of which plays such an important role in the piece overall, landing at our feet more damply than what would have been away from exposure to said piece.<br/><br/>Respite in Rapunzel's world arrives with that of Flynn Rider (Levi), a cocksure young thief who's a lot more handsome than his two criminal cohorts and manages to steal some valuables from a castle and get away again before having the gall to double cross his partners in crime and make off. Flynn stumbles upon Repunzel's little hideaway in amidst the hills and forests and renders it his own to lie low – and that's when all the trouble starts. The sub-plot to do with the kingdom's chase, eventually led by a cross pollination between a horse and a bloodhound named Maximus, whose clothing sticks true to his name and sees him decked out in Roman Centurion-esque garb, to get the valuables back and Flynn's own double crossed friends chasing him down does well to intermingle with the central tract of Rapunzel's coming of age story and what eventually transpires on that strand.<br/><br/>We enjoy Rider and Repunzel's coming together extending beyond that of the tower's domain, something which kicks off an adventure similar to that of when Princess Jasmine and Aladdin first met and came to bond – the gimmick here seeing neither of them know of the other one's true-to-life foundations in royalty. I like the fact that her aforementioned trusty pet chameleon, Pascal, is mute; thus, I make it, rendering Tangled the first Disney film since that of Pocahontas to encompass creatures of the animal world whom do not speak. Where we might have had a hair-brained, fast-talking animal sidekick doing whatever, Pascal cuts a silent and often cheeky looking figure – a character who's all hand gestures and facial expressions, a character built on comedy of a more physical nature and making him infinitely funnier than a what might have been. The film, branded proudly by that of Disney themselves, is their fiftieth; if the run were a so-far indelible cricket innings by that of an individual batsmen, then Tangled is the nick along the ground for four runs through the slip cauldron thus proudly bringing up the half-century and enabling the player to raise his bat more than it is the imperious cover drive to seal a landmark. That said, the film comes with a buoyant energy; a charming love story and a fun chase narrative on top of a fair few laughs that compensate for a few lacklustre songs – it is worth a go."

","This is without a doubt won of the worst movie I've ever seen. It just goes to show how far Disney has fallen since it's heyday. The storyline displayed a complete lack of imagination, extremely cheesy and sappy. This movie was so dreadful it ruined the story of Rapunzel for me. My whole family who absolutely adores Disney just hated it. I just don't understand why in such a beautiful world with so much to do and so much to see anyone would see this movie. I think at some parts it was supposed to be funny, the highest level of humor portrayed is when Eugene farts. The soundtrack is pitiful, the voice acting sucks, and the story is utterly pointless. It has a terrible message, even glorifies violence and criminals. It even portrays dumb stereotypes as Rapunzel is supposed to be better with brown hair instead of blonde. I wouldn't even advise this movie to 6 year old girls. PLEASE don't see it."

There are things this movie will even teach you.i really enjoyed how they transformed the movie differently from the story which was written in the books, this change is exactly what people need to see to get away from the cliché movies which are arising these days. Disney animated this film as a new spin on the book which was refreshing and enjoyable."

","As recent Disney movies go, ""Tangled"" is largely forgettable stuff. It looks like your typical CGI kids movie, and there's not a lot to these characters or the story.<br/><br/>But my kid loves it, so they must be doing something right. She usually gets a kick out of Flynn Rider's antics - particularly the ""smoldering"" scene and when he gets a frying pan over the head and stashed in a wardrobe. Which brings us to the movie's real charm: Zachary Levi, who makes Rider a likable guy and infuses this movie with much-needed personality. The guy's just plain charming, and his contribution to this movie cannot be understated.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I ADORED this movie. It had all the magic of old classic Disney films, and great changes too. Rapunzel can fight for herself, is an independent strong woman who can fight for herself. Her goal isn't to meet a guy, but to find her family. And she doesn't need Flynn to saver her, she saves herself and Flynn is merely someone who guides her to the town as she has been locked up for 18 years. I loved all the songs, and I loved loved loved everything about this movie, its a family movie and I recommend it to people of all ages ! Disney needs to start producing more films like this. I grew up with Disney princess films so I's be delighted if they made more !!! They were my favorite. I'm completely appalled this has only 7.7 stars ! seriously ?!"

","A drop of sunlight falls to the ground and grows into a magical flower with healing powers. A woman named Gothel uses it to keep herself young by singing to it. Centuries later, a queen becomes ill while pregnant, and the king orders a search for the legendary flower. The queen is healed after being fed the flower, and gives birth to a daughter, Rapunzel, whose golden hair has absorbed the abilities of the flower. Gothel tries to steal a lock of Rapunzel's hair, but, once cut, the hair turns brown and loses its power. So she kidnaps Rapunzel to raise as her own child in a high tower, telling her it is for her own safety. Every year, on Rapunzel's birthday, her parents and their subjects release thousands of sky lanterns, in the hope that the lost princess will return. For her 18th birthday, Rapunzel asks Gothel for permission to go outside the tower to see the source of the annual floating lights, but Gothel refuses. Meanwhile, Flynn Rider and the Stabbington brothers steal the tiara of the lost princess. During the ensuing chase, Maximus, horse of the Captain of the Guards, is separated from his rider but continues on his own. Flynn outwits his accomplices, takes the tiara, and stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower. He climbs up into the tower, but is knocked unconscious with a frying pan by Rapunzel who puts him in a wardrobe. When Gothel returns, Rapunzel tries to show her the captive Flynn to prove she is capable of handling the outside world, but Gothel cuts her off by saying she is never leaving the tower. So Rapunzel instead asks Gothel for a special paint, the ingredients for which require three days' of round-trip travel. Gothel leaves, and Rapunzel tells Flynn that she will give him the tiara back if he takes her to see the lights. Flynn agrees. While en route, he takes her to the Snuggly Duckling Inn, which is full of Gaul thugs, in hopes of scaring her into giving up her quest. The thugs, however, are charmed by Rapunzel, who encourages them to follow their dreams. Mother Gothel returns early to the tower to find Rapunzel gone but finds the tiara. She then teams up with the Stabbington brothers so she can get Rapunzel back and the brothers can get revenge on Flynn. Meanwhile, the guards invade the tavern, and chase Rapunzel and Flynn to a dam which collapses. Flynn and Rapunzel become trapped in a flooding cave. Believing he is about to die, Flynn admits his true name: Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel admits her hair glows when she sings, then realizes they can use her hairlight to find a way out. Rapunzel later uses her hair to heal Flynn's injured hand. Flynn tells Rapunzel that he was an orphan who dreamed of being like the storybook hero that inspired his alias, but Rapunzel tells him she likes Eugene better than Flynn. When Flynn goes to gather firewood, Gothel meets Rapunzel insisting that Flynn does not care for her and gives Rapunzel the tiara, suggesting that she test Flynn by giving it to him. The next morning, Maximus confronts Flynn but Rapunzel befriends the horse and convinces him to help them instead. Arriving at the kingdom, Flynn takes Rapunzel to see the lanterns. There, Rapunzel gives Flynn back the tiara. Flynn spies his old accomplices and leaves Rapunzel to give them the tiara, realizing that he cares more for Rapunzel. However, the brothers tie him up on a boat and sail him across the lake. They claim Flynn betrayed Rapunzel as they attempt to kidnap her for her hair's power, but Gothel rescues her and takes her back to the tower. Later, reflecting on what she had seen during her adventure in the kingdom, Rapunzel realizes she is the lost princess and attempts to flee the tower. Meanwhile, Flynn is arrested and sentenced to death, but he is rescued by Maximus and the Gaul thugs from the inn. Flynn races and climbs up back to the tower where Gothel stabs him from behind and prepares to take a struggling Rapunzel to a new hiding place. Rapunzel tells Gothel that she will stop resisting if she can heal Flynn. Gothel agrees, but before Rapunzel can heal him, Flynn cuts her hair which subsequently turns brown and loses its power causing Gothel to age rapidly, fall out of the tower, and turn into dust. With his last breath, Flynn declares his love for Rapunzel who cries, and the healing power of her tear revives him. Returning to the kingdom, Rapunzel is reunited with the King and Queen. Flynn then closes the film, telling the audience that he readopted his original name, and he and Rapunzel eventually get engaged and married."

","I can't say enough good things about this movie. It was a visual delight, strong on layered characters, well written, and just when I was considering the idea that the songs weren't as strong as they might be, along came ""I See the Light"" to bring back memories of watching movies from Disney's prime (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Lion King, etc). Rapunzel is one of the most endearing and believable Disney princesses I've seen and Rider was a comedic, cocky, but well-roundedly vulnerable hero for the story. Mother Gothel was the real standout, a clever, slinky, brilliant villain magnificently acted by Donna Murphy. A strangely realistic portrayal (in many aspects) of manipulation and brainwashing.<br/><br/>I've seen it three times and am not finished yet. Wonderful, rewarding movie."

","""Tangled"" is a very, very pretty movie. The lantern scene, Rapunzel's tower, the castle interior – all very nice to look at. The heroine is genuinely adorable, and the hero is really handsome. The script is sweet and funny. The songs fit their scenes. Rapunzel's animal companion, a chameleon, was adorable and different – it did not talk, except through very articulate facial expressions. The chameleon did not have supernatural knowledge; it learned along with Rapunzel.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Tangled"" a lot, but the storyline didn't have the focus or power that would have made it a classic for me. I wasn't scared by Mother Gothel. The extreme exaggeration of the animation distanced me. Did Rapunzel's and Mother Gothel's eyes need to be THAT big? And what country in Europe, which is where this story originated, have such wildly exaggerated topography? Overall, though, this film is better than most. It's just that I did like it so much I wanted it to be a classic."

The animation in Tangled is at par with a Barbie movie—the fake unnaturalness of everything, especially the landscape and any scenes with water—so sloppily generated! The characters are hallow and cliché. The main character looks a lot like Barbie, but she somehow has even less character, which I didn't even think was possible.<br/><br/>The movie took no risks whatsoever.

But that's what I'm least worried about, why is it like every other Disney movie, the most powerful woman in the story is old, evil and manipulative.

","Princess Rapunzel (Mandi Moore) has been locked up in a tower since she was a baby. That's because Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) stole her away from her royal parents shortly after her birth. Why did she do so? Because a magic flower that restores youth was given to the pregnant queen, since she was gravely ill, and Rapunzel's hair now has that magic, with the help of a special song. The young lady's only companions are her ""adopted"" mother and a darling little chameleon, Pascal. However, through the tower's windows, Rapunzel has seen that lanterns are launched on and only on her birthday. A coincidence, maybe? Perhaps. In any case, the Princess wants to go outside the Tower for her 18th birthday present. But, Mother Gothel won't hear of it. She sings a song about the perils of the world, from poison ivy to quicksand, and tells her daughter NEVER to ask such a thing again. Disappointed, Rapunzel tries not to cry. The next day, when MG leaves to gather dinner fixings, Rapunzel is surprised to find a young man, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) has scaled the Tower's wall to evade the Palace Guards. Flynn, you see, has stolen a crown, and is in trouble. Never having seen a man before, Rapunzel manages to knock him out with a pan and lock him in the closet. Thinking quickly, when Mother returns, the Princess sends MG away on a hunt for white dye, a three day journey. Its Rapunzel's plan to ask Flynn to show her the lanterns and, indeed, the world. It begins well. Mother leaves, Flynn helps the Princess down and the vacation starts. But, all too soon, MG returns, surmises what has happened, and is hot on her daughter's trail. Of course, she is not alone, as more men are chasing Flynn, too. Time after time, the duo is in peril. Will they escape and will Rapunzel learn who she truly is? This outstanding film is so adorable that every viewer will, in turn, sing out its glories to the next potential fan. Moore, Levi, and Murphy are terrific in their important roles and they can warble like the most melodic of birds. The supporting cast is fine, too, as is the animation, script and direction. As for the music, it is so exquisite that a special Nobel prize should be created for Menken, the composer. He is one rare earth commodity and he is ours, an American. (The lyrics are also quite nice). In short, untangle your feet from the couch cushions and go get Tangled at once. What a treasure it is!"

","When German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm started collecting folk tales around 1806, little did they know that 200 years later, their faces would be immortalized on a bank note of the highest denomination. Although the Deutsche Mark has been adopted into the Euro, the Grimm Brothers' (as they have been come to be known) story does not end there. From folklore to fairy tales to bedtime storybooks, their enchanting tales have continuously evolved until its present day rendition in cinema. And so we have ""Tangled"", a fluidly narrated, vividly colorful and stunningly animated version of Rapunzel, the original title from a compiled list of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. <br/><br/>In this latest version, Nathan Greno and Byron Howard directs, while Dan Fogelman tweaks the screenplay without straying too far from the original tale. In a kingdom far away (no, not the same kingdom in ""Shrek"") the Queen is aided during childbirth by a rare flower with magical healing properties. Unbeknown to the King and Queen, an old woman has been keeping herself young and alive for centuries with this flower, but now finds that the healing and rejuvenating power of the flower has transferred to baby Rapunzel during childbirth. The old woman named Gothel then kidnaps Rapunzel and locks her up in a tall tower knowing that the little girl's golden hair holds the power to keep her from aging. Naïve to the outside world, Rapunzel grows up believing Gothel to be her mother but is fascinated by seeing thousands of floating lanterns once every year. Just before her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel's life changes forever. Having stolen a royal tiara, a thief breaks into the tower but soon learns the hard way that Rapunzel is not a damsel in distress. Together, they escape the tower and head towards the kingdom, but not before having to deal with Gothel, her assassins and the King's royal guards. <br/><br/>For a year that gave us quite a few animated features, Disney's ""Tangled"" came in third in terms of box-office performance. While ""Toy Story 3"" took the top spot, ""Shrek Forever After"" managed to secure a second place despite its overdone theatrics and lack of originality. For this reviewer, the real competition was between ""How to Train Your Dragon"", ""Despicable Me"" and ""Tangled"", all of which features an engaging and original story. While ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is cinematically epic, our film under discussion is superior in terms of production and visual brilliance. With a budget of $ 260 million, this is not only the most expensive animated film ever made, it is also the most time consuming, having been in production for six years. The staggering amount of time and money put into this project stems from the fact that Disney has invested in animating hand-drawn images and then injecting three-dimensional depth by employing over 50 CGI artists. The result speaks for itself- a gorgeously rendered animation with such detail, it has to be watched on a HD display to truly appreciate the skill that has gone into its making. What makes this film different is that it carries the High Definition clarity found in PIXAR animations, but with the added bonus of having the original art work traditionally hand painted. I were to guess, Disney has gone through such lengths to produce another animation, probably because this is their 50th title, an accolade in itself and a milestone in this company's 80 year history as a media conglomerate.<br/><br/>Like most other Disney productions, the story here has a fare share of fantasy, romance and comedy. Even so, Disney ventures into unchartered waters with elements of sadness, some violence and a scene of drunkenness. Voiced by Donna Murphy, Fogelman's Gothel is not a witch but a woman with a dark heart who is capable of murder. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel and along with Murphy, lends their voices for some of the film's soundtrack as well. Zachary Levi voices the thief called Flynn Rider, a character who is neither a Prince nor charming. Although Rider and Rapunzel's initial scenes together are met with slapstick comedy, the funniest characters for me are, a royal horse called Maximus and Rapunzel's pet chameleon, Pascal. On the other hand, soundtrack is not as catchy as Disney's famed animations like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"". Although nominated for an Academy Award for ""Best original Soundtrack"", this film lost the Oscar to Toy Story 3. Even so, Moore and Levi's duet with ""I see the Light"" is as visually stunning as it is pleasing to the ears."

The king's men find the flower and use it to save the sick queen whom is having a daughter. The daughter is born with golden hair that has magical powers. The old woman steal's the girl and keeps her hidden in a tower, where Rapunzel grows very long hair and the woman uses it to stay young.<br/><br/>On her 18th birthday, Rapunzel wants to leave the tower to see the sky filled with lights.

","Like any child I loved Disney films and I turned into an adult that adores the classic Disney films and hope to share them with my children one day. But could they keep creating the classic films we all know and love from Snow White and Bambi to modern day classics like Aladdin and Beauty and The Beast? Well the answer is absolutely!! Tangled is the first Disney animation film I have seen in quite some time and I was glued to my screen the whole time. Funny, cute, romantic, thrilling, adventurous, edge of your seat, and stunningly beautifully animated and this only begins to describe Tangled. I saw elements of Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast, and even The Lion King in the style, story and characters the film makers created. Like many Disney films it draws on a classic fairy tale and brings those characters to life in such a larger than life way. I saw Tangled on Blu Ray which certainly helps the quality but throughout the film I couldn't stop being awestruck over the quality of the animation. I believe it is traditional hand drawn animation but just...wow...from Rapunzel's doll like features, to the breath taking Kingdom they live in. Kids will adore it and adults will never take their eyes off of it.<br/><br/>Zachary Levi is already high up on my hero list as I am a huge Chuck fan and recognized his voice immediately. But regardless of this his voice talents to the egotistical, romantic thief Flynn Rider is just perfect. As much of a fan of his that I am I forgot about him and he simply became Flynn Rider to me and that says a lot. Mandy Moore seems to have slipped out of the spotlight lately. But she comes back strong as the naive, lovely, young girl Rapunzel with the magnificent hair. I wasn't sure about her voice at first but she is perfect and their voices come together to create a terrific chemistry opposite each other. Donna Murphy plays the voice of the obligatory 'witch' or evil 'step mother' as the case may be. Murphy is a terrific character actor and has been for years and she is perfect behind the face of Rapunzel's captor. And of course any great Disney film needs a handful of talented supporting voices and they include Ron Perlman, M.C. Gainey, Jeffrey Tambor, and Brad Garrett to name a few of the more well known and noticeable performances.<br/><br/>Only Disney can create characters like this. Other film making companies make good animation but does anyone even touch these guys? This film packs so much adventure into one movie just like you'd expect and demand from a Disney flick. There has to be a 'but' since I didn't score it a perfect ten and that 'but' happens to be something that is also a Disney staple and that is the music. I didn't think the music in Tangled was very impressive at all. The best song was the song in the tavern with all the brutes because it was fun and light hearted but none of the songs stayed with me or stuck in my head and I am certain there won't really be any songs that become classics. So its unfortunate that the music stumbles but everything else about this amazing film makes up for it. Constant adventure!! Boys, girls, men and women will find something they love about it. There are some definite dark turns in the film especially near the end where our hero Flynn is stabbed...so be warned with the really little ones but otherwise Disney swings and knocks another one way, way way out of the park. I LOVE IT!! 9/10"

Oblivious of the outside world and what waits for her there, only knowing of what she can see from her bedroom window. Before she was born, her Mother fell very ill, but was miraculously cured by a magical flower. These powers were given to Rapunzel at birth, causing her hair to grow to great lengths, capable of doing amazingly impossible things. An evil hag of a woman that was using the flower to preserve her youth maliciously steals the child in the dead of night, leaving her whereabouts unknown. That is until a good-looking thief finds the tower while looking for a place to hide out.<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned, this is a flawless Disney film. The story is stellar, being told with wonderful voice acting and animation so stunning that you will try your best not to blink. The music melodies and lyrics are crafted in a way that makes them feel like some of your most valued favorites from older Disney classics. Years down the road I hope this film will be considered groundbreaking, and hopefully will be held in as high regard as ""Snow and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Cinderella"".<br/><br/>""Tangled"" is the second most expensive film ever; as far as animated films, it IS the most expensive ($260 million!!!), and it truly shows. Disney takes the CGI route for the first time ever to tell a fairytale story, and the characters are honestly as lifelike as anything live-action. The colors are so glowing, lush, and beautiful.

","Stuck in a secret tower for almost 18 years of her life, Rapunzel has been lead to believe that her special hair is a treasure which should be guarded from the world. She has never left the tower ever since being locked away, but this changes when Flynn, a thief, enters her life.<br/><br/>The classic tale of Rapunzel has many variations and Disney has decided to add their take to the tale by imbuing Rapunzel's hair with the ability to grant health and youth. It is through this very change that allows Disney to retread a narrative formula they used so effectively during their golden age of animation: the young princess at odds against an older, yet wicked, woman. This is introduced early in the story and constant interaction between Rapunzel and Mother Gothel ensures the audience never forgets the tyranny that has taken place. Tangled is, without a doubt, a story of self-discovery, and both Rapunzel and Flynn are evident of this growth. Naturally, this is more obvious through Rapunzel, and it comes as a breath of fresh air that Disney has allowed one of their princesses to act her age. Gone are the mature thinking and acting lead women of older stories as Rapunzel is childish, but ultimately charming. The self-discovery story arc does feel undeveloped as the credits roll, but thankfully the narrative is filled with symbolic gestures, such as the visual connection between lanterns and Rapunzel's hair, and life lessons for both children and adults alike. This is all bolstered by some strong humour that is never overused resulting in the narrative being a highlight of the film.<br/><br/>The voice actors do not disappoint as each is convincing as their respective character. Moore is delightful in displaying Rapunzel as a teenage girl who learns to be independent; Levi brings charisma to Flynn; while Donna Murphy ensures that Gothel is villainous but one who can manipulate that very label.<br/><br/>For the most part, the computer imagery achieves the desired goal of 3D variation of Disney 2D animation. Colour is rich, characters and animals are enjoyable to watch, and the complete sense of wonder is indeed present. If watched in the 3D perspective, the animation does slightly come to life but it never overly used and feels minimally underdeveloped. If there is a slight flaw to be found in the animation it would the occurrence of what appears to be unfinished textures. Many boulders, for instance, look rough at times, but this is thankfully uncommon.<br/><br/>This is a Disney animation through and through so the lack of sex, nudity and language is expected. Violence is tame and at times even comical, ensuring the usual Disney animation that kids can enjoy.<br/><br/>Tangled is a true gem for Disney and animation in general. While it lacks the overall appeal that has made Pixar animations such a treat, it is nevertheless a step forward for Disney as they retread the type of animation that made them so famous. There a few graphical niggles and the story never quite reaches the promising depth suggested by the material, but these are minor problems in what is largely an entertaining and pleasing animated venture."

","""Tangled"" is Disney's latest film, but unusually it is not a highly hyped as previous Disney films, at least where I live. I did not really like the nondescript generic title, which does not say anything much about the movie at all or even hint at its creator, Disney. <br/><br/>Upon watching the movie, we see a spin on the fairy tale of Rapunzel. Rapunzel becomes a princess here, in the Disney tradition. The male protagonist is played by a charming (again in the Disney tradition) outlaw Flynn Ryder. The elements of the Rapunzel story are all there: the long hair, the locking up in the tower, the teardrop at the end... But Disney gives these things a very interesting magical back story (again in true Disney form). To make the boys come and see the movie, they include an exciting and funny action story with Flynn Ryder character, complete with thugs and chases.<br/><br/>I personally like the non-speaking animal characters a lot -- the cute little chameleon Pascal and the mighty royal steed Maximus. I never did like those other noisy annoying sidekicks in previous films too much. The songs are not too memorable unfortunately. They tend to sound alike already, don't they? The action can tend to be a little graphic here, meaning there are lacerations and stabbing with blood, and you actually see what happens to the witch when she falls out of the tower -- unprecedented stuff. It is in fact the first Disney princess film to get a PG rating.<br/><br/>It is a marked improvement over ""Princess and the Frog"", Disney's last film. It is not to the level of ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Mulan"", but ""Tangled"" is a landmark film in Disney history, as they finally enter into 3D CG animation territory. The effect of this animation vastly improves the quality of action scenes (like the breaking of the dam) and the magical effect of the poignant scenes (like the floating paper lanterns). This film is well worth its price of admission. It is fun, funny, exciting, romantic and touching, everything you will be looking for in a Disney animated feature film."

Only to be knocked out and tied. Rapanzel makes a deal with him. To show her the outside world, and she will give him back the tiara. Untying him, he reluctantly agrees.<br/><br/>Despite feeling guilt, but feeling free she has now seen the outside world. She and Flynn enter a tavern despite some trouble from some rough thugs, some were trapped allowing Flynn to escape along his many misadventures. And seek revenge on him for the things that he has done against them, like going back on his promises to helping them. In order to help himself escape.<br/><br/>But her singer and jubilant attitude calms the mood and people down. But low and behold, Gothel is after her. After finding out she isn't at her tower. And with the help from the two thugs that were with Flynn over the tiara. And want revenge on him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the two begin to know one another. And of course, fall in love. But those hindrances could break them up. Will Rapanzel and Flynn's love friendship and love stay true and keep them together? Or will Gothel's secret about needing Rapanze's hair, along with the castle trying to capture Flynn. Plus, possibly having ties to Rapanzel possibly, keep them apart.<br/><br/>It is a good movie. Very cute. As well as a good love story. With wit and charm. It has a twist to it. Not like the original Rapanzel story you have come to know and love. But you will love it!"

","I'll have to admit I was surprised with this movie. I wanted to go to the theater and there is not much to watch really apart from Tron,which I obviously seen already, so as I was in denial to go see the fockers, I saw this movie had 8.1 and went for it, not expecting much anyway, just an entertaining movie, being from Disney and all. I was completely blown, the movie is so funny, made me laugh more than The Hangover, but hey,that's just my opinion. The horse and the chameleon steal the movie, they're hilarious. And the story between Rapunzel and Eugene is really sweet, I must say I shed a few tears. The animation itself is amazing, everything is perfectly done and the scene with the lights when they're in the water is stunningly beautiful. My favorite animation movie has always been and will continue to be ""Up"", but this one comes right in the 2nd place for sure. Bottom line, if you want to see a fun, sweet movie, go see Tangled, I really recommend it, you will get out of the theater feeling happy or at least with a warm sensation in your chest, this time Disney succeeded."

","As a kid, I grew up watching a good portion of the Disney films. While it does draw on some pop-culture gags that most animated films use now-a-days, it is really a reminiscent of the classic ""fairy tale-musical"" genre that has made the company famous in the first place. Everything in works very well in the animation, the story, and the characters.<br/><br/>The only thing that I can think is wrong with this film were the musical numbers. As a 20-year-old male, I've seen my fair share of old fashion musicals, Disney or otherwise. None of them have scared me as much this film's did. It wasn't that they were bad songs and that they slowed the story down, which it didn't, but every time somebody broke into song that it gave me a mixture of terror and humor. Particularly when the thugs started singing. Fortunatly, Flynn Rider and Maximus the horse help balance this fact out.<br/><br/>All in all, this is definitely a film that everybody in the family will enjoy one way or another. I'd definitely suggest that you see it, with or without your kids."
"michelleybellyyy","8","2","4","24 December 2010"," Not what I was expecting!
","I'd like to begin by saying it's extremely annoying to look at the reviews and see people talking about OTHER movies for two, maybe three, paragraphs, so I'm just going to dive right into it. So, I walked in wanting to hate it. Trust me, I did. In fact, I was dragged against my will by my mom with blackmail of my little cousin begging to spend time with me. I haven't liked Disney lately, so I expected something very cliché, along with crude and desperate attempts for laughs, such as butt slapping or minor sexual innuendo to attempt (and fail) in connecting with the older groups. Well, I loved it. I sat with my arms crossed for the first twenty minutes, holding back as many laughs as I could, and then I couldn't help it. I'm fourteen-years-old, and I was laughing at a Disney princess movie. The beginning was slow, and the songs were not memorable in the slightest, but about near the part where the big bad goons began to sing about their dreams, it began to pick up. Flynn's dry and sarcastic humor appealed to the older audience, but it wasn't trying too hard to the point where it became annoying. Repunzel was likable, though my five-year-old cousin thought it was Cinderella, claiming that they didn't say her name enough. Mother Gothel (though she did look/sound like a combination of Cher and Susan Sarandon) was...well, a bit too nice for my personal taste in the beginning of the movie. Sure, she stole the kid, but it had a better bedroom than I did, had more possessions than I did, and well, she was living a pretty good life. The ""villan"" was also a bit harsh in her teasing, but whose mother wasn't like that every once in a while? She still cooed at Repunzel the entire time, babying her even. Thankfully, in the middle/end, she got far more evil, and I was satisfied in what became of her. One thing I was a little concerned about was the fact that Repunzel was under aged when Flynn, who was, what, late 20's, early 30's, was constantly hitting on her and there was clearly some romance sizzling before they finally kissed. Sure, it's the olden days and she is technically (only hours) into legal adulthood, but still, it's just a tad bit too uncomfortable for me to watch them make out. Onto music. I was so, SO relieved that they didn't pop in Tik Tok or Teenage Dream or God knows what else is in with pre-teen girls these days. They stuck to original music, just like the classics. That alone nearly won me over, but none of it was truly memorable. In fact, the songs were a minute, maybe less, each and everyone was constantly bursting into song in every scene. It became annoying after a little while. Especially in the beginning, when Repunzel was singing about her days. I mean, really, why do we care that you make candles, read six books a day, paint on walls, play chess, and do paper miche (by the way, what exactly does Mother Gothel do for a living to provide all of this?) on a daily basis? I get the gist of it was to prove that she was in a rut and wanted a way out, but they could've done it without a lame song. None of it will get stuck in your head the way you want it to (except the Mother Knows Best Reprise; that and that alone I still hum). It has VERY mild and innocent crude humor. Such as, in the end, Flynn says that there was a ""week long party"" and he ""doesn't remember half of it"", or the short old guy hitting on Mother Gothel, or Flynn hitting on Repunzel (while she's under aged!). I'd suggest to bring older kids, 8 - 12. Well, I'm 14 and I greatly enjoyed it, so knock that up to immature teenagers as well. You'll have fun, the kids will have fun, and no one will be scarred too dramatically from it. Go for it; it's definitely a full price film."
"jonnyhavey","7","2","4","29 November 2010"," 3D Golden Animated Beauty
","""Tangled"" is the newest film in the animated world of Disney released just in time for the Holiday movie rush. The film combines the old school classic Disney feel with animation of the modern times. The magic of song and dance flows as glamorously as Repunzel's hair itself through this new tale. After making fifty films, Disney has finally made one about the story of Repunzel explaining giving meaning to the lines, ""Repunzel, Repunzel let down your hair."" The story of Repunzel is available in both 3d and 2d and instead of the 2d Animation Disney tried to bring back last year with ""The Princess and the Frog,"" modern animation and is used. The film begins with the sarcastic narration of Zacharey Levi's (""Chuck"") character Flynn Rider as he explains the legend of Repunzel's (Mandy Moore) hair consisting of a special flower used to save her mother's life. The story then follows Repunzel as she seeks out the answers to questions about her child hood and who the Mother Gothal (Donna Murphy) that is keeping her up in a secluded tower really is. She asks herself what the lights are that appear in the sky on each of her birthdays? Flynn Rider is an outlaw who is more connected to Repunzel than she knows with his latest heist. The story changes both of the characters as they grow towards happily ever after. <br/><br/>The film is a visual masterpiece showing the 3d golden beauty of the animation. Repunzel's sunlit hair flourishes across the screen as the love affair between Mandy Moore's and Zacherey Levi's characters grow through the personalities of the actors portraying them. Disney finds the perfect balance between dance and song for Repunzel, Flynn and company to express very important moments in the film. The songs are crafted as dialogue more than just catchy tunes meant to please the audience and they aren't done in a gaudy fashion like previous Disney films. The film is also a little darker than usual, ending in a more logical sense. Don't worry though, the film does not lose its magic. Comedy is present in order to keep the film fresh and happy as Repunzel's kidnapper Mother Gothel exemplifies her ridiculous relationship with Repunzel. Disney recognizes that its films tend to be very predictable and mocks itself with the dialogue of Flynn throughout. This allows the film to be more believable and captures laughs from the audience as well.<br/><br/>There isn't much in the film for adults other than the animation splendor and a little entertainment, while the almost too Disney film will be immensely enjoyed by younger little kids.. On the other hand the film does have a scary moment as well? The entire film caters entirely to kids until one frightening moment that may cause a squirm or two. The film will not seem very different story-wise to many of the classics that the older audience has already scene throughout Disney's forty-nine other films, therefore it may leave you a little unfulfilled. There are definitely a lot of hokey over dramatized scenes that could have and should have been taken out. Jokes and drama that has been overused in Disney's past and lacks a fresh contemporary application or feel.<br/><br/>Audiences have a film that they can take their family to throughout this holiday season. A G rating would almost suffice, however, the only problem is that there is a scene that may scare some kids. However, don't let this dissuade you from going because the PG rating fits the film perfect and is worth seeing this ""Tangled"" story of happily ever after now!"
"AlsExGal","9","0","0","5 July 2020"," A cute animated film from Disney
","I loved this movie. It is the story of Rapunzel, a princess with magic hair that has the ability to heal. Rapunzel was kidnapped as a child by an old woman who wanted to stay young. She kept Rapunzel captive in a tower in the middle of nowhere, where the two of them lived for 18 years. When the old woman would start experiencing the effects of aging, she'd ask Rapunzel to sing a special song while she brushed Rapunzel's hair. Rapunzel had to sing the same song each time to activate her special powers. Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, her parents, the King and Queen, release two lighted lanterns into the sky, hoping that Rapunzel would see them and come home. Eventually everyone in the kingdom began releasing the lanterns, creating a beautiful ""starry"" sky. Rapunzel sees these glowing lights every year and wants to see the display in person. Enter Flynn Rider.<br/><br/>Rider, a criminal, stumbles across Rapunzel's tower while on the run. He manages to climb inside the tower. Eventually after Rapunzel is understandably freaked out, she makes a deal with Rider: He must take her to the castle to see the lanterns released, and she will give back his satchel (that she's stolen and hidden) that contains the items he has stolen. Inevitably, the two fall in love and Rapunzel's ""mother"" is upset that Rapunzel is gone and seeks out to find her.<br/><br/>This was a great movie with fun characters and fun songs. My favorite part was when Flynn takes Rapunzel on a romantic boat ride so she can view the annual lantern display from the best spot in town. The scene is so gorgeous, accompanied by a romantic song. I'm a sucker for sweet romantic stories, even if they are animated. But none top Shrek."

","This traditional princess story is brought into the 21st century with beautiful 3D animation, arguably the first of Disney's non-2D works to, well, actually work. Just because the studio is fifteen years behind Pixar doesn't mean it can't produce some genuinely good movies. 'Tangled (2010)' is fun, fast-paced and friendly, a nice shake-up of its source story. There are several enjoyable set-pieces and the characters are all likeable, too. Pascal is mood and Maximus is fantastically cartoonish, snappily stealing every single scene he's in. The thing isn't massively thrilling, per se, and it doesn't quite hit the emotional beats it aims for. Its musical nature also almost feels inconsequential, an added gimmick as opposed to an integral part of the storytelling. Still, these song sequences are mostly memorable and they're as entertaining as the rest of the piece. It's just a fun time, generally. If you want a princess story, there are plenty of worse ones out there. 7/10"
"mark-4522","10","0","0","11 May 2020"," Subtly clever, timeless classic. Will age well.
","Tangled wasn't as big a success as Frozen perhaps because while watchable, it didn't pander to what successful Disney films engage in: Fantasy elitism. Even as the films required some sort of quest for the heroine to achieve (or preferably, a dragon for the hero to slaughter), there's a secret desire for kids to never have to grow up and earn a living. Even in this film, Rapunzel lives a pretty easy life in the tower but there are no parties and friends to marvel at her dresses and singing.<br/><br/>What makes this film special is that the villains and heroes, even the rogue, engage in psychology we see in everyday life. The gaslighting performed by the witch should be required viewing for psychology students. The rogue who attempts to dissuade Rapunzel from her quest tries to scare her while it hilariously backfires. It's like the writers were remembering all of their childhoods.<br/><br/>That kind of savvy commentary flies over the heads of most kids (and even many adults) but there's plenty of great music, endearing characters, and solid jokes to keep it moving but not perhaps sell as many toys or get girls excited about a life of leisure on a reality show. It's more healthy, but less addictive. The diet-Frosted Flakes of Disney entertainment."

","I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'.<br/><br/>This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture.<br/><br/>The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.<br/><br/>I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear.<br/><br/>This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it."

"renegadeviking-271-528568","7","0","0","4 February 2020"," Tangled
","To open the current decade, we have Disney's fiftieth animated classic, Tangled, which marked the debut of their first computer-animated princess. The story of Rapunzel was briefly considered for adaptation in Walt's time, as far back as 1938, but the idea was ultimately discarded and did not resurface until 1996, when legendary animator Glen Keane and producer Roy Conli began planning an adaptation of their own. At that time, the project was going to be done in the usual traditional animation, but the studio was deep into the frenetic Renaissance period and the idea ended up being temporarily shelved once again while everyone was focused on other projects.<br/><br/>However, this time, Rapunzel didn't completely fade away; by 2002, Keane and others were tinkering with it again. Between that year and 2006, a more satirical take on the story began to emerge which was planned for the emerging technology of computer animation - Eisner's studio was trying to move away from the perceived ""staleness"" of the classic Disney style in favour of a more hip, contemporary ""DreamWorks"" approach, so Rapunzel's film began to be subjected to the same treatment. That film was set for release around 2007, but then came the change in management in 2006 which brought John Lasseter to the studio.<br/><br/>By that time, Keane was working with Dean Wellins as co-director of the project and was (wisely) trying to steer it back towards a level of sincerity, as he felt audiences would respond better to a less snarky take on the fairy tale. Lasseter agreed, and he gave Keane the option to return to the traditional animation style for the film if he wished, but Keane had accepted the challenge of doing it in computer animation and decided to do his best to bring the artistic qualities of hand-drawn work to the digital age. After suffering a heart attack, however, Keane made the decision to step down as director and instead became the executive producer as well as animation supervisor for the film; Lasseter appointed Nathan Greno as his replacement, and when given the choice, Greno picked Byron Howard to be his partner.<br/><br/>The new directors embraced the classic Disney ""formula"" and turned the film into a musical in the style of the Renaissance fairy tales, with the whole tone of the project being re-worked into something lighter and more balanced. The title, which was then Rapunzel Unbraided, was changed to Tangled in an attempt to avoid the marketing problems endured by The Princess and the Frog, and the key artistic influence on the film shifted from Rembrandt to Disney's own Cinderella, utilising the same ""shape language"" in its scene compositions to provide Rapunzel's world with a sense of comfort and safety via lots of soft, inviting curves. Since the production was all about reconnecting with Disney's roots, the filmmakers even took a research trip out to Disneyland in California to study the Imagineers' architecture. To top it all off, the last surviving member of Disney's ""Nine Old Men,"" Ollie Johnston, then well into his nineties, visited during the production and gave Keane some simple but valuable advice about remembering not to get carried away by the technology at the expense of character development.<br/><br/>A lot of love went into this one, and the result speaks for itself. Tangled became a huge hit for Disney, the biggest they'd had since the Renaissance, so let's take a closer look at it to see what makes it work so well.<br/><br/>Characters and Vocal Performances<br/><br/>When casting the parts for this film, all of the actors had to perform a song to prove their musical chops. Donna Murphy chose Children Will Listen from the musical Into the Woods, while Mandy Moore went with Joni Mitchell's Help Me, a song she had covered herself on her fourth album, Coverage (2003). (A fortuitous choice, as Mitchell's music had a big influence on the music of the film). Moore noted that she had to attend multiple auditions and didn't really expect to get the role, describing herself as ""over the moon"" when she got a call-back as it had long been a dream of hers to appear in a Disney film. The role was highly sought after; Kristen Chenoweth was the original choice back when the film was going to be more satirical, but the later auditionees included Natalie Portman, whose audition was used for a pencil test of the character, as well as Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel, who would go on to star together in Frozen three years later.<br/><br/>During the recording process, Moore didn't meet with Murphy at all, and only recorded once or twice with Zach Levi as Flynn for their duet. The voice actors had to jog in place to sound realistic during the action scenes, and the animators interviewed and filmed them for reference footage. Apparently, after seeing the finished film, Moore was disappointed with her performance and felt it was too ""shrill,"" while Levi thought his sounded ""incredibly nasally.""<br/><br/>
So, who exactly is our heroine? Rapunzel is a young girl who's lucky to have ever been born; her mother nearly dies before giving birth to her, but luckily she's saved by the magic of a certain special flower and, lo and behold, said magic ends up passing into Rapunzel herself. Unfortunately, the flower had long been jealously guarded by the sinister Gothel, and she's not about to just let it go - after breaking into the incredibly-easy-to-rob kingdom, she steals Rapunzel away and raises her in seclusion as her own child, using the magic (now in the girl's hair) to keep herself young and healthy.<br/><br/>This is all set up in an effectively-delivered prologue, and as the main film begins, we meet Rapunzel a few days before her eighteenth birthday. Since being kidnapped, she has never left the hidden tower where Gothel keeps her and is now yearning for a glimpse of the outside world - specifically, she wants to see a lantern celebration which occurs every year on her birthday and plans to ask Gothel to take her. Now, I'll admit there are a few problems with this set-up - I mean, what teenager in this situation wouldn't have tried to get out before now? I know that Gothel has a powerful psychological hold over the girl, but still, did Rapunzel never feel like rebelling and seeing the world for herself before the age of eighteen? Also, many other critics have brought up the point about the date, wondering why Gothel didn't just make up a fake birthday for Rapunzel to prevent her from making the connection (heck, she could've just not told her about birthdays, period). There are plot holes, but I can overlook them because of how intriguing this relationship is.<br/><br/>Gothel and Rapunzel hug<br/><br/>Rapunzel is the Quasimodo to Gothel's Frollo; this is easily the most complicated relationship between a villain and a heroine we've seen since the days of Hunchback and Hercules. With no memory of her real parents, Rapunzel has been brought up to believe Gothel is her only family, but there's a crucial difference between Rapunzel and Quasi. Quasi's prison was right in the centre of Paris, so Frollo had unwittingly left the lad free to observe the outside world and develop an infatuation with it, leading to his desire to leave and see what it's like for himself. Sure, Frollo did try the same scare tactics as Gothel, telling Quasi about how horrible people are, but the lad could see for himself that this was not entirely true. Rapunzel, on the other hand, trapped out of sight in a hidden valley, has apparently never met anybody but Gothel in her entire life, so she has no such frame of reference. Consequently, she displays much more anxiety about leaving her tower than Quasi did, because she truly believes what she's been taught about the world. It's also implied that Gothel has been telling Rapunzel that she will be able to leave one day when she's older, presumably just trying to placate her until she gets old enough to really rebel.<br/><br/>Rapunzel puts Flynn in closet<br/><br/>In the end, the outside world must come to Rapunzel. When Flynn sneaks into the tower, she learns a lot about herself after knocking him senseless with a cast-iron frying pan (damn, girl). The incident allows her to prove herself to herself, showing her that she is not as helpless as Gothel has tried to make her feel. Filled with a new confidence in her own abilities, Rapunzel comes close to revealing the unconscious Flynn to Gothel, but luckily she's stopped by an outburst from her mother. This is a key moment, because it's the first time that Rapunzel seriously begins to question her mother's motives - having proved the inaccuracy of Gothel's statements about her being unable to take care of herself in the outside world, she naturally assumes that there will now be no problem going to see the lights. However, caught on the spot, Gothel simply loses her temper with Rapunzel, screaming that she will never leave the tower, ever. This brings the rebel in Rapunzel to the surface - realising that she might never be allowed to leave, she sees an opportunity in Flynn and ends up keeping him hidden from Gothel, then devises an excuse to get her ""mother"" out of the way for a few days so she can make a bargain with him to take her to see the lights.<br/><br/>Flynn tied up in hair<br/><br/>All of this demonstrates a strong streak of ingenuity; from what we see of her talents and skills in the first few scenes, Rapunzel is clearly an intelligent and highly creative person. She fills her days with artistic expression and educates herself to the best of her ability with the few books she's been given. There's almost nothing the girl can't do - she paints, bakes, knits, plays guitar, makes candles and pottery, and many other things besides, all in the space of one morning! She's also a lot stronger than she looks, probably from hauling Gothel up into the tower every day; the ease with which she later subdues a grown man is impressive. Then there's her hair; with seventy feet of it, you'd imagine it gets in her way a lot, but she's learned to use it to her advantage."

"ikhwan_arif","9","0","0","14 December 2017"," Among Disney's Finest and Most Polished
","An underrated a high quality Disney film, Tangled succeeds in good story, good voice-acting and stunning animation and visuals. <br/><br/>While falling just short from being in the same league as Disney in 90s like Aladdin and The Lion King or even the golden age of Pixar (Toy Story Saga, The Incredibles, Up, Monsters Inc) Rapunzel retained the charm of Disney movies and enhanced it with clever and well-written characters. <br/><br/>Rapunzel here is such a good and likeable character and her backstory is so on-point and tight there is hardly any flaw in it. And what's good here is that Rapunzel isn't a damsel in distress but rather simply a girl wanting to grow up. <br/><br/>Rapunzel is a coming of age story of the best kind, because most of the adventure here is watching Rapunzel get into and out of trouble, watching her overcome challenges and learning what she is capable of, as well as watching her suffer from the choices that she has made (e.g. that scene where she was at war with her conscience is hilarious). <br/><br/>This is different from earlier and later incarnations of Disney princesses where Rapunzel actually takes a proactive role in her life, taking responsibility and accountability for her decisions and actions. This is what it means to grow up and Tangled nailed it. <br/><br/>In this regard, Tangled is far superior than The Little Mermaid, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. <br/><br/>Where Tangled falters however, and arguably why it doesn't quite reach the heights of the Disney greats, is the songs. They aren't bad but they are on the more generic side, but on the whole, each song is well crafted, performed admirably, the lyrics thoughtful and meaningful, appripriate to the scene, in short, much better than Frozen. <br/><br/>The voice-acting is also high quality. I already know Mandy Moore can sing but she shines as Rapunzel for the role, not the singing. Moore's Rapunzel is perfect as the doe-eyed, naive but defiant and courageous girl, her expressions are believable and convincing. <br/><br/>Donna Murphy is also well cast as Gothel and her songs are perhaps the most entertaining (Mother Knows Best). Zachary Levi was just being himself with Flynn Rider and quite frankly, that is good enough. <br/><br/>Special mention has to be noted on Pascal the Chameleon and Maximus the Horse, who have no lines but who both have great scenes in the film. Pascal and Maximus are simply charming and adorable, with both of them having crucial roles on the plot. <br/><br/>And the plot is tight. It is so good. No Disney story ever had this good of a plot that are without discernable plotholes. There aren't even a single hint of Feminist dogma and propaganda here; it is that good. <br/><br/>So no, Tangled isn't a typical Disney Princess movie; it is better. It has a lot of substance. It's a shame that the songs don't stand out more, but even without it, this film is still good."
"L. Lion","3","21","96","18 November 2010"," paint by the numbers mediocrity
","My six year old daughter had somehow scored passes to a preview screening of Tangled. Previously she had received passes to a preview screening of Alpha and Omega, the 3-D talking wolf animated movie. Based on my experiences with these two films, receiving free preview screening passes to a 3-D animated feature indicates that it sucks.<br/><br/>I expected much more from Disney than from Lionsgate, the studio responsible for Alpha and Omega. John Lasseter of Pixar was credited as executive producer, so he must have overseen some element of the story development. Furthermore Dan Fogelman, who wrote Pixar's Cars, was credited with the script. So how could the story be so lacking in interesting characters or surprising plot twists? Characters are introduced and then disappear until called upon, especially a band of ruffians at a pub called the Snuggly Duck. Settings, especially a large wooden dam, seem to come out of nowhere purely to provide a place for an action scene. The romance is uninvolving. The dialogue is boring. The lead characters have no chemistry, and Rapunzel's animal playmate, a chameleon, is utterly lacking in expression. The villainness is surprisingly mundane and never feels threatening. About the only character who was amusing was a horse named Maximus. In fact, everything about this film, aside from some of the artwork and production design, feels paint-by-the-numbers. People associated with Pixar should do much better.<br/><br/>The Rapunzel story was always one of the weakest of the Grimm tradition. Aside from having the chick with long hair, it's mostly forgettable. If you thought Shrek 3 was good, this will please you. If you recognized Shrek 3 for being what it was, which was a warmed-up rehash the same old thing, then you should know what you are getting yourself into.<br/><br/>Incidentally, anyone reviewing this film before me that said anything along the lines of 'Disney's most wonderful film' is definitely a studio marketing hack. Disney has a stinker here, and they know it."
"shereen333","4","9","34","16 July 2013"," So mediocre... did I miss something?
","Of course anything with the Disney label gets a certain rush at the box office openings. <br/><br/>That said, I really do not understand how this film did so well. Really?<br/><br/>It was so mediocre at best. The plot was boring over all. There were somethings that either didn't make sense, or where unnecessary to the plot. The princess is weak and totally out of it. Do the girls of this generation need another princess who's dingy, and lacks visible depth? Her character isn't believable, and is only able to be consistent, because she lacks character, so is able to maintain the lack of. <br/><br/>Her hero is a tad more mentally present, but doesn't exhibit much of what we'd want in a hero. He kind of gives a, ""I'm already in this story, so might as well play the hero,"" vibe. What was lacking was heroic efforts, or something major to be overcome, etc. Again, no depth. <br/><br/>The villain was poorly crafted. The villain, and the villain's motivations were slightly creepy, but not enough to be engaging or interesting. Mainly, I left feeling the villain's role was just plain weird. <br/><br/>As I said, this movie was so mediocre, lacked depth, lacked humor, lacked suspense, and there was nothing to latch on to, to relate to, to hope for. What did other viewers enjoy? The day my family saw it in the theaters, it was really quiet, no laughing, no squirming, nothing. Several dads were asleep, and the rest of the audience wore no expressions on their faces. <br/><br/>The one surprise in this movie, to me made absolutely no sense at all. I didn't feel like it added to the plot, nor made the film more interesting. It seemed out of place and ridiculous. It also seemed like the main character just forgot about some things that would be important to remember, like the surprise I mentioned. ""Oh, that's right, I'm an airhead, I have a surprise, but forgot, oh, now I remember, (poof) magic..."" STUPID!!! <br/><br/>I love animated movies, I love children's movies, I love many Disney movies. This was one where if at any point it had been turned off, I wouldn't have cared much to see the rest. <br/><br/>This title stayed in the theaters for soooooo long, and is so well rated on here, I might try to watch it again. Obviously, I missed something that other people were able to see. <br/><br/>I'm glad others were able to enjoy this film. I'm a little worried as well, if Disney gets the message that this level of story writing creates a winner, than we'll all get more of this sort of thing. Ugh! I hope not. After this and Brave, I'm ready for something more like Aladdin or Mulan... something awesome!!!"

But where is that old feeling we all use to share? Well i can tell you this much....i already knew that Disney had something special here, mainly because the VP of PIXAR jumped ship and decided to fund this project.

","I enjoyed Tangled when I watched in back in 2010 in theaters, but after many repeat viewings years later, I realize I like it less than I thought I did then. <br/><br/>The story is nothing original. It's the typical Disney princess formula. I love Disney films but at least other films (even with the formula) had some uniqueness to them. <br/><br/>The best of Tangled:<br/><br/>Flynn/Eugene and Maximus. These two stole the film and were the film. Honestly, Rapunzel was not needed at all with these two being much more likable and charming. They were funny and they both developed/grew at the film's end.<br/><br/>The animation is breathtaking. So beautiful.<br/><br/>The worst of Tangled:<br/><br/>The songs were bad. Only ""See the Light"" was memorable. <br/><br/>The vikings. They were just...why?<br/><br/>Rapunzel. She was the typical naive, perky, spunky, awkward female character and her design was oddly proportional. I didn't mind her but it's pretty bad when I enjoyed Flynn, Maximus, Pascal, and Gothel more than the main character. <br/><br/>The love between Flynn and Rapunzel was great, though. It was heartwarming and wonderful and the ending was a beautifully-sad twist. But besides that, the film was just an average effort in storytelling. Great visuals and characters but horrible songs and storyline."
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","4","7","28","14 December 2011"," Tangled (2010)
","Reading some of the reviews for this you may expect the start of a new wave of Disney brilliance. What I saw was Disney playing it safer than they have ever done before. Everything is the same, but worse. Worst of all are the songs. I pick up songs very fast. I can hear a song once and hum diddly hum it weeks later. The songs from Tangled are about as memorable as, well, if I could remember something so unmemorable it would kind of undermine my point. The film also has the least threatening of all Disney villains. With none of the menace nor charm as some of the classics, Mother Grothel is just someone you don't like, rather than fear and despise. The humour is immature and wreaks of 90's post-modernism. This same kind of narration was used in Happily N'Ever After, and there's a reason you haven't seen that film. Even the story itself is stretched and involves a bunch of lifeless characters that are overshadowed by a chameleon and a horse. The animation is fine, the voice work admirable, but this is a hollow and bland film."
"s-e-selvidge","1","15","75","23 January 2014"," Incredible how it can be called a ""classic"" with such horrid morals
","I bought the DVD release for this movie, since I missed out on seeing it in the cinema, after watching many trailers and hearing great reviews from friends who had seen it. Sad to say I was sorely disappointed, especially with the plot line and the morality of the story.<br/><br/>OK, I understand that Disney does not condone abuse or any of the like, but when you put a mother figure in a story who is in fact the villain, make it clear to the protagonist. This movie did nothing but make it seem OK to young, impressionable tweens, to go against the advice of your parents when they say the world is dangerous, and that thieves do not make good relationship material. Now, if Rapunzel had discovered that she was taken from her family at a young age (she doesn't need to know she is royalty at this point) early on in the movie, and it was this which sparked her drive to explore, I would have been perfectly OK with the story. But no, she is left to believe that she is a horrible person for leaving and that her ""mother"" is the good in the world rather than the kidnapper. I'm sorry, but this just seems likely to influence kids to think that if their parents are acting responsibly by warning their child of the dangers of the world and of having convict relationships, then the natural process is to think they are kidnapped and to run off in search of a much nicer family who will let you marry the convict.<br/><br/>OK, so that's my first quarrel with this movie, my second is about body image. As a blonde, Rapunzel has the ability to make people stay young, and goes off on a wild adventure with plenty of fun and antics along the way. Not to mention the luscious, long, perfect, low-maintenance hairdo. As a brunette, she loses all magic, and people will grow old around her, and she chooses to settle down and have a family rather than carry on enjoying everything she had in the last hour or so. In other words, Disney is feeding us, oh so subtlety the age-old stereotype that ""blondes have more fun"". How is this carrying on with the traditions of all other Disney Princesses, with the moral that who you are is your true strength? What happened to the strong, beautiful young women such as Pocahontas, Mulan, Belle, and even Giselle? <br/><br/>The only redeeming factor this movie had to offer was Pascal, who seemed to be the only normal character (for a humanised chameleon)<br/><br/>Avoid at all costs if you do not want to pass on horrendous morals to you precious children!"

I enjoyed How to train your Dragon and Toy Story 3 and I thought I would enjoy Tangled because of the positive reviews by the critics and my family but I was wrong. I'm tired of the stereotypical side-buddy who is just there for the laughs (in this case the stupid chameleon, in others think Wall-E: cricket, despicable me: the yellow things, even in Bedtime Stories: the gerbil).

I thought I would have someone clear my mind or back me here. What is the underlying message of this movie? My mind is fixated on the the thought that the richest man in the world ( the king ) can rightly use his power money and influence to destroy a rare species of fauna (instead of somehow creating a sustainable method of harvest) then greedily use that last flower to save his wife and cheat what looked like a natural passing of his wife, when I am sure there are others who could use that flower for perhaps a greater good. but I guess peasants don't deserve the chance to save their wives or children. maybe I am thinking too much into this but I don't see how the old lady (who at least wanted to preserve the flower which was the last of its kind) was any worse than the king. Well at least this film will set a precedent in the mind of our youth that it would be a OK for Disney to kill the last Panda bear if its blood will somehow miraculously unthaw and save Walt Disney !

As one reviewer said, Rapunzel is a hero like the 90s Belle, is full of love, life and curiosity. She is also the equal of her friend, Flynn Rider whose types no longer appear in Hollywood as the concept of an equal has been killed off in modern movies (absent in Moana, ridiculed in Smurfs 3, noting these 2 modern movies are from the same writer who, in my view, does not understand empathy or compassion or equality in any way). If you're looking to see how quickly Hollywood has changed, look no further than Tangled. A beautiful story full of heart and lovable characters (including Gunther and his unicorns).

I know so many boys and men who love this movie. There is just something in the characters that speak out to the audience and pulls you in. Flynn Rider (or Eugene) is the lovable thief who steals Rapunzel's heart when he helps her fulfill her dream. And Rapunzel is the quirky, innocent shut in who comes out of her shell and opens her heart to all the wonders of the world and all of the wonders of love when she gains Flynn's love in exchange for her own. The animation is startlingly colorful and superb. Disney went with the computer animation, against its usual hand drawn animations for a Princess tale, but for the story they provided you find that it works well, hell, maybe even better than the hand drawings would have. For the characters who are very ""Chibi"" like, they emit real human faults and feelings. Their facial expressions just kill you as you see the pain, excitement, joy, love and regret in their eyes. The songs are good catchy tunes, sure to echo in your mind long after the movie has ended. And the villainy is terrific. Mother Gothel is one of the greatest Disney villains ever created. She not only steals the baby princess but raises her and then still has no qualms about hurting her physically and mentally. She never got all mushy and redeeming, she knew what she wanted and how to get it and she stood evil until the end, a good trait in any bad guy. Tangled may be the equivalent to Disney's The Little Mermaid because, just like back in the 80s the world had just about given up on Disney, but after seeing this movie, you will be a believer again."

","My wife and I found ourselves watching this together on Christmas Eve in Portugal. Our Portuguese isn't brilliant but we could follow the story ('Rapunzel' meets 'Snow White') and a film we just happened to find on TV kept us enthralled for an hour and a half! 'Tangled' has strong characters, humour (and it really is laugh-out-loud funny), thrills, a few tears and a happy ending. It is the sort of family-focused animated film Disney used to make. I prefer the old-style hand drawn Technicolor animation but I suppose we have to move with the times. It kept two cynical old hacks in their 50's thoroughly entertained. I would think seeing it with a family would be a great experience. Well done, Disney!"

","I am one of those people who dreaded every new Disney release after their successful hit in the 90's. It seemed all the movie had gone downhill. Boring and predictable. You just had to look at the cover to know how it ended.<br/><br/>This movie is a wonderful surprise. I was very reluctant to watch it, but my friends told me it was funny, so I gave it a chance. And I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>The characters have very good personalities and the animation is beautiful and might I even brag it looks flawless? The voices are excellently picked, even though I worried with the choice of Mandy Moore, she fits the character perfectly. <br/><br/>And the best part is that this movie is so funny! I was constantly laughing and giggling, especially thanks to that horse. Excellent animation and thanks to the fact the animals are silent made it even more funny. It felt almost like watching an old Donald Duck cartoon. (I find that talking animal sidekicks tend to draw attention away rather than provide good humor)<br/><br/>The movie has good morals, a good story and overall it was very easy to relate to Rapunzel. Fun, good pacing and I liked that the male character was more vain than the princess.<br/><br/>It only gets an eight because the singing voices were beautiful, but all the songs were forgettable. Big lack of melody made them pretty pointless. I wouldn't have mind if there weren't any songs."

","""The one thing that the public dislike is novelty. Any attempt to extend the subject-matter of art is extremely distasteful to the public; and yet the vitality and progress of art depends largely upon the continual extension of subject-matter. The public dislike novelty because they are afraid of it. It represents to them a mode of Individualism, an assertion on the part of the artist that he selects his own subject, and treats it as he chooses."" - Oscar Wilde <br/><br/>""Believe in the character. Animate with sincerity."" - Glen Keane <br/><br/>As Pixar becomes evil, Dreamworks and Disney's animated features seem to get better. ""Tangled"", based on the German fairy tale ""Rapunzel"", is perhaps the studio's best animated film since ""Bolt"", though both are still far too manic, the products of a popular culture that has been reduced to an Eternal Now, where noisy, shallow entertainments constantly give way to replacements that are only superficially distinguishable from their predecessors. Disney, and all of modern culture, works hard to create an audience that values artificial newness and not much more.<br/><br/>This kind of creepy replication is at the heart of ""Tangled"", a film which sees a cute princess, Rapunzel, kept in a constant limbo so that an evil witch may be rejuvenated over and over and over again. Rapunzel and her handsome prince's willingness to stick to formula, to remain frozen in character, is what enriches the witch, her body growing like some kind of bulbous, perpetually expanding Disney bank account. It's only when Rapunzel and her man break away from their roles – she transforms from hermit to princess, he from bandit to prince (itself formula) – that the cycle is destroyed.<br/><br/>The plot's mostly junk, but aesthetically this is an exquisite, gorgeous looking film. The man responsible for this is master animator Glen Keane, who has little to no prior experience with computer animation. The result is that ""Tangled"" uses no motion capturing and has a visual style that hearkens back to Disney classics of yesteryear. Disliking the ""sharp"", ""straight"" look of computer animation, Keane issued a mandate for soft, round edges, organic looking movements, and warm hand drawings whose lines and colours resemble that of traditional oil paintings on canvas. Beyond this, the film treat us to richly rendered forests, super expressive characters, an eye-popping colour palette, whispery light effects, and sexy greens, pinks, blues and whites. The film's character animations are themselves very good, particular an odd horse that behaves like a bloodhound, moves like a laser beam and seems designed to mimic the upper body of a chess piece. The human characters are a delight too; visually it's a good film.<br/><br/>""Tangled"" was the first Disney fairy-tale since ""Beauty and the Beast"", which was released way back in 1991. Since those straight faced, earlier Disney films, Disney has slipped into the grip of post-modernity. It's princes and princesses now know that they're ""princes"" and ""princesses "", constantly indulging in sarcastic, ironic, pop-culture referencing winks. Thankfully ""Tangled"" does go too overboard with this, and when it does the gags and jokes mostly work well, as do some of its parody's of modern Broadway tunes. And as with most computer animated films, the virtual camera work here is super fine-tuned, everything ultra choreographed, which lends both the film's action sequences and exposition a special visual kick. All this comes at a cost: 260 million dollars for this baby, roughly three times higher than your average Pixar budget.<br/><br/>This being Disney, the film is overtly sexual, with phallic towers, sexually manipulative women, fertile valleys, wide eyed couples and strong, sexual currents. And as with most modern Disney films, which get increasingly self-referential (""Bolt"" was itself rife with films within films), there's an unintentional meta-plot going on, our animators' love aligned to Rapunzel's love of 2d drawing, of art, which escapes its prison and bursts into a 3d fantasy world of criss crossing spatial axes. Incidentally, Disney's previous ""princess film"" was ""The Princess and the Frog"", an offencive little Obama-era film about a ""black princess"". In comparison, ""Tangled"" is hyper white. Like brushing your teeth with bleach while the KKK eats mayonnaise on your lawn. Only whiter.<br/><br/>8/10 – Worth two viewings."

","After years, Disney has delivered something charming and entertaining. Let's not even get to those straight-to-video sequels and spin-offs (of which only a tiny few were likable). This is Disney's first major CGI movie. The success of it may set a new trend for future Disney films as a result of which I'll miss the beautiful hand-drawn works that contributed in making classics of so many of their older films.<br/><br/>However, the animation in 'Tangled' is first rate and definitely up their with Pixar. The enchanting fairy tale world looks colourful and magical. The details and movements are very well done. The story is told in a very Disney fashion with added tongue-in-cheek humour and the occasional songs. The songs contribute well to the story-telling and the jokes work effectively. There are a few plot holes but given that it's based on a fairy tail (Rapunzel) these things can easily be overlooked. <br/><br/>The voice acting is very good. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi are adequate as the typical Disney princess and Disney hero. However, Donna Murphy steals the show as the evil Mother Gothel and the supporting cast is great. Brad Garrett's Hook-hand thug is hilarious.<br/><br/>My favourite character was Rapunzel's chameleon sidekick who provides some excellent subtle comic relief and Max, the horse. <br/><br/>Only time will tell whether this will be a classic but as for now, Disney seems to be back in providing some quality entertainment."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","5","28 April 2011"," Disney's finally found a way to make its fairy tales work in the CGI era
","It seems to have taken until the eleventh hour, but Disney has finally found a way to make its classic fairytale stories work in the 21st Century. Thanks to longtime Disney animator Glen Keane (serving as producer) and directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard (""Bolt""), the film stays true to Disney's long line of rich fairytale history while adding a distinct layer of action, adventure and humor that modern audiences now require.<br/><br/>2009′s ""The Princess and the Frog"" marked a complete return to traditional animation for Disney and received much praise, but the film continued the trend of moderate and unsatisfactory box-office success for fairy tales. All hope seemed to be pinned on ""Tangled"" to revive the genre or it would surely hit Disney's back burner indefinitely. Once titled ""Rapunzel,"" Disney's strategy for this film was clear: appeal to a wider audience. Zachary Levi's character Flynn Rider, a sharp but self-absorbed thief, became a focal point of the marketing, and while this is Rapunzel's (Mandy Moore) story, he does play a more prominent role than a large segment of Disney princes from over the years. In short, ""Tangled"" appeals to boys, girls and the whole family.<br/><br/>Disney has never been known for defying stereotypes, so in that sense, the complexity of Rapunzel and Flynn should be a lauded accomplishment. Like most princesses (or so it seems) Rapunzel is a naive dreamer who sings about longing to see the outside world from her tower, but she's quick with a frying pan (as a weapon, not cooking utensil) and her hair possesses a surprising amount of dexterity. It's rather unrealistic how well she handles the outside world considering her overprotective and narcissistic mother (Donna Murphy) has bred incredible fear in her, but she's by far the most 21st Century princess to date. As for Flynn, despite the cockiness, deception and excessive charm, he has a down-to-earth dry wit too that makes up for his over-the-top nature.<br/><br/>The story carries a surprising amount of intensity and emotional pull. With Mother Gothel and the two thug twins in pursuit of Rapunzel and Flynn as they venture to the kingdom so Rapunzel can see the ""floating lights"" that come out every year on her birthday, there's no shying away from dark elements. The possessive mother motif always works to make you sick inside and considering Rapunzel's sweet nature, you really do wish ill on Mother Gothel.<br/><br/>In terms of the animation, ""Tangled"" feels traditional, but it's a good thing. Keane has worked on countless of the Disney classics of the '90s and he finds a way to adapt that style while using computers. The result is that familiar richness and magic of a hand-drawn animated film with the photorealism and attention to detail of CGI. With big round eyes, all the characters earn our sympathy quickly and make ""Tangled"" as enchanting as it is action- packed and exciting.<br/><br/>As Disney has always done with exceptional skill, the non-verbal but human-like animal characters vastly increase the humor of the film. Paschal the chameleon and Maximus the royal steed both have unpredictable dispositions that make them fun and lovable. As a chameleon, Paschal likes to instigate conflict but quickly recoils and turns the shade of objects around him when he's nervous. Maximus takes it upon himself to track down Flynn with a sense of self-importance, yet he's a sucker for normal animal pleasures like being pet and apples. The brilliance of these characters never fails and will always be part of the Disney legacy.<br/><br/>So sigh relief if you're a Disney fairytale fan, because ""Tangled"" has finally found the answer. Some die-hards will insist on more memorable songs and musical numbers (even with a couple of excellent Alan Menken tunes, especially ""I See the Light""), but the trade off (as seen with a ""PG"" rating for the film as opposed to all previous fairy tales earning a ""G"") is something more compelling for all audiences.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"jfgibson73","9","2","5","24 April 2011"," IMO: Best Animated Movie in nearly 20 years
","This is probably the best animated film since Finding Nemo, and I would say the best Disney movie since Aladdin. They really hit it out of the park with this one. It'a simple story, but the characters make it lots of fun to watch. Of course, the animation is incredible, both in how detailed and appealing, but also the style of design. I especially like the storybook settings like the Snuggly Duckling and the streets of the kingdom. The songs are fine, although I don't see the soundtrack as being one of the strong points. Rapunzel and Flynn are the main reason to watch, and supporting characters like Maximus and Mother Gothel add a lot as well. As a villain, Mother Gothel is one of the more complicated Disney characters; she's clearly evil, but at the same time, acts as a mother for Rapunzel. When the movie was over, I had some confusion about her motivations, which makes me wonder if younger viewers will be clear about her either."

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","5","4 April 2011"," Very funny Disney comedy. I laughed a lot.
","Going back to my childhood, hearing the story of Rapunzel, there was a nagging issue that always bothered me. Follow me on this: Here is the story of a maiden with extremely long hair who was held captive in the tall tower waiting for her prince to come and rescue her. When he arrives, he implores her ""Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!"", to which she drops her hair down to ground level so he can climb it like a rope. Here's my issue: He's a grown man, climbing her hair like a rope . . . that is attached to her head! How is her hair not being pulled out by the roots? <br/><br/>That's a question, I'm afraid that no one seems to be able to properly answer, neither in the 199 year-old tale told first written by The Brother's Grimm nor in Disney's lively new computer-animated version which turns Rapunzel's over-developed locks into a tool of 1001 uses. Seriously, she hangs from it, makes a jump rope with it, and even ties the intruding prince to a chair with it. I guess the easy answer is: her hair is magic, lay off! Here it is explained that her blond locks have the power to heal when she sings a certain song. What happens if she gets the words wrong? <br/><br/>The story in this version tells us that when Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) was a baby, her hair was accidentally enchanted by an old crone called Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) who had discovered a spell for retaining her youth and beauty. In order to keep the enchantment safe, she kidnapped the child, pretended to be her mother and locked her in a tall tower and forbade her to step outside. As Rapunzel grew up, she wondered, naturally, what was out there. As she grows, so does her hair. If she cuts it, her hair turns brown and the spell dies. Got it? Good! <br/><br/>Her salvation is not a regal prince but a thieving goof named Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi of TV's ""Chuck""). Flynn is not his real name, I'll leave that for you to discover. Anyway, he has stolen some crown jewels and is on the run from some of the palace guards. He finds himself stashing away in Rapunzel's tower until the heat's off - that's how he comes to find himself tied to a chair by her long hair. Naturally the story will involve the pair falling in love and doing battle with Mother Gothel for the enchantment that lies within those golden tresses.<br/><br/>The story is a bit standard. The love story, the magic spell, the villain, the music. They are all lifted from a hundred other Disney musicals. I think the screenwriters knew that because they were smart enough to give the movie a wicked sense of humor. All of the characters have bold personalities, whip-smart dialogue and wonderfully expressive faces. This is a fun movie just to listen to. In tone, the movie has the kind of wise-cracky freshness and sense of humor that made Shrek so special (and that its sequels never quite achieved).<br/><br/>The film also benefits from the presence of two wonderful supporting characters. One is a chameleon who is Rapunzel's only companion. His face is very expressive and so is his ever-shifting skin color the functions like a mood ring. The other is a very clever horse, part of the king's guard. He is ever-efficient and ever-determined to hunt down Flynn and bring him to justice. This is some horse, not only is he a beast of burden but he's also part bloodhound and, at one point, a pretty good swordsman. The fact that these two characters never speak allows their body language to speak for them. They are more expressive that way.<br/><br/>'Tangled' is part of the new 3D revolution. The palette is made of vibrant with colors that are clean and polished. The characters almost resemble Barbie Dolls. That may be the film's only real flaw, it is too clean. There's nothing in the artistry to make it distinctive or to further the art of animation or to try new things. Immediately after I saw Tangled, I saw the wonderful Irish animated feature The Secret of Kells - this happened purely by coincidence. That film had a texture and a form of the illustrations one might find in a children's story book. The characters were angular, squared and pointed in a way that matched their personalities (Think of the form of ""Samurai Jack"" and you get the idea""). Here the characters and the landscapes all look manufactured. We don't feel we're looking at a special place, just a manufactured background. Still, with that limitation, I had a good time. I laugh a lot, the characters intrigued me and I walked away with the image of a man with a frying pan dueling a horse with a sword. Where else are you going to see that?"

This film is so deep and thoughtful, that in some scenes I forgot it was a Disney flick, or even an animated movie for that matter. Genius, heart-warming to the very last lines, and so funny it surprises you! I found it nearly impossible to find any glitches with this movie, and although I will forever have favorites like The Little Mermaid, or Cinderella, this could still possibly be the best tale of love, royalty, and hope. Not only does it succeed in all areas of a film, but it stays loyal to the actual tale of Rapunzel."

"thomvic","9","2","5","2 April 2011"," Highly enjoyable film that brings back some of Disney's magic
","To be honest I miss the old days of Disney films and computer animation hasn't fully taken me over. Perhaps it is because most of the Disney films I love take rank with Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Aladdin, The Lion King and the Little Mermaid to name some. That is not to say I don't enjoy computer animation but there is a certain quality to them in which the humour feels a bit more in your face, which isn't the humour I usually go for.<br/><br/>Tangled takes on the old tale of Rapunzel whom I only remember as a girl locked away in a tower with very long hair. I didn't remember much else of the tale as this is not one I'm highly familiar with in details. So I was surprised to find myself enjoying this and it's been a while that I've been to an animated film that has songs in it again. The songs aren't as great or memorable as Disney's old classics, but they are still enjoyable and Disney has brought back its charm, which has been a long time coming.<br/><br/>Rapunzel (voiced by pop start turned actress Mandy Moore) is kidnapped at birth by an old woman who longs to have her youth back. It turns out Rapunzel's hair has a magic that will keep her young and if it is cut, will lose its power. The king and queen, unable to find her, cast out sky lanterns every year on her birthday in the hope that one day she will return. On her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel desperately asks her mother to see the lanterns as her birthday gift, which is flatly refused. <br/><br/>Flynn Ryder, who is the leader of a thieving group, steals the tiara of the lost princess and ends up escaping to Rapunzel's tower. After Rapunzel knocks him out with a frying pan, which ends up becoming her weapon of choice throughout the film, she strikes a deal with him. If he can take her to see the lanterns, she will give him back the tiara. Meanwhile, her adopted mother Gothel, who kidnapped her eighteen years ago, tries to get her back home.<br/><br/>To change the film title from Rapunzel from Tangled is obviously Disney's cheek at making it seem more humorous because there is a lot of use of Rapunzel's hair. Many escapes from the bad guys involve the use of her hair, whether it be used as a sort of lasso to swing them from one end to another, or being used as a glow in the dark torch while underwater. But hey, this is a Disney film so it's all adorable. Rapunzel is made into a very Americanised girl, but luckily not into a damsel in distress bimbo which would have made her character totally unsympathetic. She is simply a curious girl who has never experienced the world within the four walls she has lived her life in. What is funny about the opening is how casual the introductory voice over is done. Instead of making this a very childlike fairy tale opening, it's almost as though our heartthrob Flynn is taking a humorous approach to the tragic kidnapping of the princess, and for some reason it works probably because you know she will end up being saved later on, just like in other tales such as Sleeping Beauty or Cinderella. <br/><br/>There are some very marvellous scenes in this film, one being a boat ride with Flynn and Rapunzel in which all the lanterns are lighted out and lifted into the air around them; it reminded me very much of Airiel and Eric in the Little Mermaid while Sebastian sings the romantic yet humorous 'Kiss the Girl' song. Visually it is just beautiful and amazing to look at. Luckily, the writers bring scenes like this which are moving, and don't get caught up in making too many unnecessary jokes which would have made this more slapstick rather than funny.<br/><br/>I will have to say that while I do miss the classic Disney films of the ninety's, Tangled is a welcome gem simply because it brings life to these characters, situations and isn't a girly movie in the sense that the plot isn't about Rapunzel finding a prince; it's about her finding her freedom and exploring the world she has only read about. There is plenty here for guys to like too, with Ryder's daring wit and smooth talking with Rapunzel, they add a lot together than they are without, also add some nicely executed action sequences which makes use of Rapunzel's long hair and you're in for an entertaining ride.<br/><br/>The ending, while nice, was a bit too sweet and cliché for me, and considering the cleverness of the film throughout, could have come up with something more cleverer but this is a minor complaint. This is a great film that adults will enjoy as well and is a great comeback for Disney, who have been in the shadows of Pixar's blockbusters. While it may not have that true magic of Disney's original works, it is still a very welcome and entertaining ride nevertheless."
"Doylenf","8","2","5","31 March 2011"," Combines classic old-fashioned charm with a modern twist...a true Disney classic...
","TANGLED is much more than ""a drop of golden sun."" It has a flippant, modern attitude in all of the dialog, a crisply appealing and smartly styled animated technique that brings the characters to life, and a pleasant score by Alan Menken that captures the essence of the fairy tale story in street smart style. In short, it's an instant classic for today's movie fans.<br/><br/>With talented voice chores performed by ZACHARY LEVI, MANDY MOORE and DONNA MURPHY, the characters are given full-bodied images that are uncannily real. In fact, the chemistry between Flynn Rider (Levi) and Rapunzel (Moore) is a gradual thing (not instant falling in love as in most Disney features), and blends and ripens convincingly for the tender moments that follow.<br/><br/>And aside from the key human characters and a horse named Maximus, there's plenty of fast-moving adventure as the evil Mother Gothel plans on keeping Rapunzel at her side forever as a way to retain the magic powers of her golden hair, lest she shrivel away to an old hag. And within the texture of the plot is always a sense of humor from either one-liner wisecracks or the animated expressions of the humans and Maximus, the stubborn horse.<br/><br/>Easily one of the best animated features to come out of the Disney studio in some time despite the fact that the score is not as strong as other animated classics. Nevertheless, it has action and romance and an astounding beauty in its magnificent settings and polished art work.<br/><br/>Absolutely a must for any animation fan."

","""I, am a horrible daughter. I'm going back. I am never going back! I am a despicable human being. Woo-hoo! Best. Day. Ever!""<br/><br/>Tangled is a charming, amusing, visually beautiful movie that will please princess-obsessed little girls, adventure loving little boys, and the older people that are bound to have this movie memorized by osmosis from the countless times the young ones around them will probably watch it. <br/><br/>This modern update of the Rapunzel fairy tale gives a family friendly message about growing up and becoming your own person, wrapped up in the cute animal sidekicks and hijinks that are expected from these kinds of movies. The animation is bright, vivid, and lively, the voice work is good, and the songs are passable, if not great. There's just not a lot to complain about, here. I didn't think it was as hilarious as Despicable Me or as emotionally engaging as Toy Story 3, but there's just something special about a good old fashioned fairy tale, now and again."
"Samiam3","8","2","5","27 March 2011"," Long and flowing
","There's a kind of tenderness to behind Tangled that almost works on it's own with out the need for the so called 'post-modern' approach to fairy tales which brings out the cunning above the sentimentality. Tangled works either way. The film trusts it's material an its audience enough to embrace sentimentality, yet there is also a sense of modernity to the film which gives it that much of an edge. This is one of those a movie where the damsel in distress saves the dashing hero. It's cute as a romance, It's effective as part comedy, it feels organic as a musical (capturing Disney's better days). The ending feels a little cheap, but that's typical of fantasies, and I suppose there is no need to get picky. Tangled works, quite well."
"johnstonjames","9","2","5","20 March 2011"," Pure Disney. One Of Their Very Best CGI Animated Films To Date.
","wow. i really thought this was a lot of fun. it was also pure Disney. the CGI animated films released directly by Disney (Meet The Robinsons, Chicken Little),often feel more like authentic Disney than the Pixar/Disney collaborations.<br/><br/>not that the Pixar films aren't the best in the field of CGI animation, and do utilize a totally Disney approach, but there is always a underlying element of collaboration that often feels as much Pixar as Disney. unlike Buena Vista distribution which was established by Disney himself in the 1950's after he left RKO, Pixar was a independent production facility that originally had nothing to do with Disney.<br/><br/>i also happen to feel that fairy tales are often what Disney does best. i love fairy tales. so i guess this had more appeal to me and felt more like the Disney classics i grew up with. the animation in Pixar/Disney films is more elaborate and accomplished, but this had more of the ""Disney"" heart to it. 'Finding Nemo' and 'Cars' were excellent films and had better, more proficient animation, but in some ways i enjoyed this film even more.<br/><br/>'Tangled' is also a little more psychologically deeper than the usual Pixar films. 'Tangled' might very well be Disney's most psychologically complex film next to their film 'Enchanted'. i've always felt that 'Enchanted' has some of the most complicated and revealing psychology of any Disney film including Disney's golden age of classics. 'Enchanted' kind of works as couch therapy for Disney fans brought up on fairly simplistic, straight forward happy ending philosophies. 'Tangled' might not be as philosophical about the whole fairy tale happy ending thing, but the psychology of the witch/step mother, is pretty intense. the step mother tries to control the girl with fear and manipulation. something our current society often thrives on.<br/><br/>i'm not saying that every time a adult enforces authority on a child is unjustified, but this certainly gives the viewer something to think about. the only problem here is that it does sort of make ""alternative"" parenting look bad.<br/><br/>still, there are little or no flaws here. it's pretty much perfect and perfectly delectable family fare. teen age girls especially will probably eat it up and hang on every word. don't see why not. even though 'Tangled' is for all audience members, it's primary appeal will be mostly for teen age girls and young women.<br/><br/>if you are a true Disney fan, and one that loves the ""princess"" fairy tale movies like i do, you'll get a real kick out of this winner. i suggest that even if you are not a die hard Disney fan, you let your hair down, sit back, and just dig this sugary, Disney treat."

","I've been watching Tangled 3 or 4 times now, and I must admit it has become better. At first I weren't that impressed. A couple of years ago when I heard that Disney was going to make a movie about Rapunzel, and that they were going too make more like a traditional Disney, I became very exited. Since I knew that if there were one company that could make a movie about Rapunzel magical, and timeless, it was Disney. I had really high expectations so to say.<br/><br/>And then, I watched it and felt severely disappointed. Sadly I cant say why, since that would reveal large parts of the movie plot.<br/><br/>But after I have seen this a couple of times, I realize that this is indeed a brilliant movie. The animation is just mind-blowing, there are so many wonderful details. And not to mention that the casting is great.<br/><br/>And If this movie had a story that were less predictable, I know it is a fairytale, but too be honest the original fairytale don't have a lot in common with this film, so when they changed the story they could actually have improved it. The story is not bad, It just wasn't what I expected, wanted it to bee, and I was expecting perfection.<br/><br/>Except fore that, this is one of Disneys magical movies, and it is worth seeing Again and Again."

","""Tangled"" is an instant classic. It is right up there with the likes as ""Mega Mind"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon"".<br/><br/>The story told in ""Tangled"" is the classic tale of Rapunzel locked away in the tower, and we all know that one, don't we. But ""Tangled"" is more than just another re-telling of the classic tale.<br/><br/>The animations and drawing style in the movie is really nice, and I liked it right away. Lots of vibrant colors and beautiful details in every single scene. And that is something that works well.<br/><br/>And the characters in ""Tangled"" were lovable, even the villains. Everyone was colorful, interesting and brought their own unique touch to the story and the movie. From the animals to the people, everyone was just fabulous. I especially liked the chameleon and the horse, they were really hilarious and had really fun poses and faces.<br/><br/>The voice acting in ""Tangled"" was quite nice as well, and they had a bunch of good names on the list.<br/><br/>""Tangled"" is definitely a movie that should be in every movie aficionado's collection. The movie is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again, proving that Disney still can make instant classics.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen ""Tangled"" already, get in gear, and watch it.

"ItalianBabe74","9","2","5","26 February 2011"," Disney triumphs again!
","Disney's modernized Rapunzel story is definitely a movie that will be enjoyed by all ages. The characters are fun and lovable, the songs are catchy and the story has new twists yet stays true to the original fairy-tale.<br/><br/>Rapunzel is the lost princess, stolen away to the tower by Mother Gothel because of the magical rejuvenating quality of her hair. When left alone, Rapunzel, with the help of Flynn Rider, decides to leave the tower and travel to see the glowing lanterns. All the while, going on a journey of growth, truth and love.<br/><br/>First off, kudos to Disney for the brilliant characterization of Pascal and Maximus. Without any lines, these two 'sidekicks' managed to convey a loyal personality to their owners as well as a myriad of other emotions too. <br/><br/>The romance between Rapunzel and Flynn is believable, each character growing over the course of the movie. What makes it better however, is that the romance is not over-bearing. Instead, their relationship progresses alongside Rapunzel's personal growth and discoveries resulting in a wonderful film that will keep you entertained the entire time.<br/><br/>The other thing that makes this movie great, is the fact that evil seems to triumph in the end. It is considerably darker than most Disney animated movies and for a moment, it does seem that all hope is lost. However, being a Disney movie, of course, there is a happy ever after.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore and Zach Levi did a great job as the voices of Rapunzel and Flynn, Moore especially as her voice is amazing and her songs were very good. Same goes for Donna Murphy whose song 'Mother Knows Best' is my favourite!<br/><br/>Highly recommend this movie, it's definitely one of the best Disney movies to come out in some time. Go catch it at the cinemas while you still can!!"
"paudie","7","2","5","24 February 2011"," Excellent animation- Decent story- You'll enjoy it
","I enjoyed this movie a lot. It's an ""old-fashioned"" Disney animated movie, based on a traditional fairy tale. However the characters are given a more modern twist. Rapunzel is a young woman who, despite being locked in a tower for 18 years, is self-confident enough to persuade a passing thief to help her see the world.<br/><br/>The animation is excellent with plenty of bright colours. There is plenty of humour in the script, though not too many laugh out loud lines. The plot is pretty light, though there are a few dark moments in the closing 30 minutes (I wasn't scared.I swear!). There are also the usual Alan Menken penned songs. I'm not a great fan of putting songs in these movies, as it tends to slow down the plot but Disney sticks with their well-tried formula.<br/><br/>The movie is probably aimed mostly at pre-teen girls but accompanying adults won't find it hard to sit through."
"helen_is_here","8","2","5","21 February 2011"," Wow.
","I saw this film yesterday with my sister, just for nostalgia value, and oh my gosh! Loved it! I suppose I have a weakness for happily ever afters, but this film sure did test me. It leaves you on the edge for a moment, waiting for the inevitable happy ending, and then you wonder, ""oh,is it not going to happen? No! Disney can't do this to me!""<br/><br/>However, I would definitely recommend this film! And not just for little kids :) Me and my sister are both in our mid teens and enjoyed it, albeit we both agreed it would remain a guilty pleasure :) I think that it appeals to a younger audience, who will appreciate it for the colourful scenes and fun, energetic characters. It has all the bits of a classic Disney film - princess, 'prince' type character ;), the villain, the anthropomorphic creatures, stunning animation, and of course a few fun singing interludes (where would Disney be without them!).<br/><br/>But what makes this Disney film really stand out has to be the animation. I remember seeing a few teasers on the movies channel before the film came out, and I was hooked from that moment on! I mean, the level of detail is lovely. They really do look so real, and you can tell, the animators have tried hard to replicate the shiny, silky texture of real hair, which, of course, is a main focus of the film, but everything still retains that magical 'fairytale' quality that reminds you of the classics. The characters are placed in a world that looks so real, and so perfect (when watching the film, I remember thinking that I wouldn't mind living in Rapunzels tower :).<br/><br/>I actually felt for the characters throughout. Disney have done a great job with the main villain type character. I don't know whether to hate her or empathise with her, which is what I like to see from a Disney villainess - a bit of a 3 dimensional personality, and not just 'plain evil'. And the ending actually brought a cold lump to my throat! Something that only Disney can do :') Overall, I felt torn between giving this film a 7 or an 8, but think it's worth an 8, so certainly worth a trip to the cinema."
"FireFan","10","2","5","13 February 2011"," Tangled with Rapunzel impressed me like lovable Disney fantasies.
","I am a big fan of Walt Disney animated movies whether they are cartoons or some Pixar animation. My folks have always encouraged all of us in my family to appreciate these movies and so they go a long way back in our lives.<br/><br/>I thought that once again, Disney made some great characters to involve in their shows. The movie and the actors were very lovable with an influence of strong-willed adventure and anticipation as shown by Rapunzel in her quest. I was deeply focused into it while being concerned of what would happen to her and her friend next. Tangled contains smoothly-delivered animation and a fine story. It's nice to find out what really may have happened in the old fairy tale. Also, it played more intensely than some of Disney's happier kids' stories but that could make it stay more memorable to the older viewers. I did feel like I was doing myself a favor by going to see it finally before the movie left the cinema and lo and behold, it turned out to be a winner.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, I would recommend this movie to Disney fans and lovers of fairy tales alike. Even though it seemed someway like girls' cartoon ""chick flick"" story line material with its soap opera-like interaction between the main characters, it really had pleasant feelings to leave to all levels of movie goers."
"FilmFanatic03","9","2","5","11 February 2011"," Disney hasn't let me down!
","Initial thought of the film was that it would be some cheesy, slapstick, 'the film that will ruin Disney' film but i'm glad to say that i was proved wrong. This film captured the heart of what Disney is all about. There were moments of humour, moments of emotion, adventure and it was just great fun! I thought the makers of the film were clever in creating the character of Rapunzel as the original tale shows lack of profile of Rapunzel. So they had to create her as a feisty, likable heroine with character depth to her. Many Moore was great for her speaking role, she can really sing as well. I thought the character of Mother Gothel was interesting as she was superior, elegant yet she was manipulative and evil. She could really sing as well. Flynn's character was not bad, he came out with a few cheesy lines but overall it was great to see his character development in the film. Also with Rapunzel it was clever how they portrayed her emotion of feeling isolated and cut off from society. She wasn't too depressed or reclusive or realistic but she wasn't too happy clappy and showed some emotion of feeling trapped and wanting to break free from the tower. The songs were great as well, defiantly Disney songs. It was just an amazing animation which was fun and enjoyable to watch. Its for everyone to see, for the whole family. Except i wonder why they didn't stick to traditional sel-animation (handdrawn) like they did with ""Princess and the Frog""....i liked the CGI format though, but i think it would have been more special, more ""Disney"" is they stuck to the original format of animation."
"jboothmillard","8","2","5","6 February 2011"," Tangled
","When I read that Disney were going to make a new film about Rapunzel, I assumed it was going be hand-drawn animation, but it turned out to be computer animated, but I was still going to see it. Basically a magic raindrop falls to the ground and creates a new magical flower that can heal injuries, cure the sick and prolong youth, the elderly Gothel (Spider-Man 2's Donna Murphy) wants this flower herself to give her everlasting youth and beauty. But the flower is taken by the kingdom palace guards looking for a cure for the sick and dying pregnant queen, and after being cured by the flower's magic, she gives birth to the baby girl, Rapunzel, who absorbs the flower's abilities in her golden hair. Finding this out, Gothel kidnaps the baby in order to use the powers of her hair for herself, and she takes her to a hidden tall tower that is well hidden and no-one will ever find to raise her as her own daughter. Eighteen years later, Rapunzel (A Walk to Remember's Mandy Moore) has grown her hair to a humongous length, and she still believes the horrible Gothel is her mother, and with the insistence of her mother stays trapped in the tower to spend her time singing, painting, reading, and looking out the window wondering what is outside. She finally plucks up the courage to ask her ""mother"" about the lights she sees rising in the sky every year on her birthday, she doesn't know they are floating lanterns released from her real home at the palace, hoping she will one day return home. Of course Gothel strictly forbids Rapunzel from leaving tower being greedy for the power of the hair, but soon enough when she is alone, dashing thief Flynn Rider (Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel's Zachary Levi) climbs the tower to hide. Desperate to see the rising lights up close, and with her ""mother"" gone for three days, she makes a deal with Flynn that if he takes her to where the lights come from, she will give back the priceless crown he has stolen. So begins a treacherous journey to the kingdom, Rapunzel has mixed feelings about disobeying her ""mother"" and leaving the tower, but she knows she has dreamt of leaving for years, and Flynn is very wary for his sake as well, being a wanted man. When she returns to the tower, and gets back up via the secret entrance, Gothel sees that Rapunzel has been taken away, she at first believes she has been kidnapped, but then she spots her ""daughter"" singing about her relief to be out. After so many chases towards the kingdom, the two thieves that were originally with Flynn join Gothel to capture both him and Rapunzel, they do manage to get to a boat and see the floating lanterns, and they are getting very close as well. Rapunzel is fooled however into thinking that Flynn does indeed still want to crown, he is tied up and captured ready for execution (by hanging), and she is taken back to the hidden tower believing her ""mother"" was right all along. But Flynn manages to escape, and rides back on once rival now friend horse Maximus, while Rapunzel finally realises that she is princess to the king and queen, and of course that Gothel kidnapped her for her hair's abilities. In the end, when Flynn is near death he cuts Rapunzel's hair, turning it brown and taking away its power, Gothel falls from the tower to her death, Rapunzel saves Flynn from death with the flower abilities in her tears, and she returns to her true home to marry Flynn. Also starring Ron Perlman as Stabbington Brother, Jeffrey Tambor as Big Nose Thug, M.C. Gainey as Captain of the Guard, Brad Garrett as Hook Hand Thug, Paul F. Tompkins as Short Thug and Richard Kiel as Vladimir. The voice talent are all great, including of course singing their own songs, Gothel is a particularly nasty villain who enjoys it, and the animation is fantastic, especially if you see it in 3D. The most spellbinding sequence is all the floating lanterns surrounding the couple falling in love with the beautiful Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song ""I See the Light"", it is a family film that shows fairy tales are still possible to make, an enchanting animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Very good!"

","As always I saw the non 3d, and I easily found cinemas in London showing it non 3d, so this was my next film on my list as Green Hornet is nowhere to be found in London but in sod 3d, guess that is why it is struggling at the box office and Tangled made a load off cash in America, lesson, make film available in 2d with loads of prints (no to so called 3d, full stop.) Tangled as you well know marks Disney Animation's 50 animated film, and the print I saw was beautiful, nice rich colours and dark blacks. This is just a lovely looking film visually and the story is fun and action from start to finish, minimum songs, 3 I think, were used rightly and not too long.<br/><br/>Character design for all, but mainly for Rapunzel, her hair deserves praise. The film's colours are akin to Sleeping Beauty with lots of greens and warm reds. Voice cast is perfect, Mandy Moore should do more Disney work after this.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this as much as Toy Story 3 and if this is up for an Oscar, I really do want it to win, as I like it more than Toy Story.<br/><br/>My only moan is did it really cost $180 million to make??"
"cutie_boots","9","2","5","5 February 2011"," Why you should definitely see Tangled!
","I was very close to giving this film a 10, as it is brilliant, and shows that Disney is back at its best! As we all know, Disney went downhill, but after princess and the frog, it was back on form (another great film) and so when i saw Tangled trailer i knew i just had to see it.<br/><br/>Its a very brilliant and original take on Rapunzel, and although its not in usual Disney drawing style it is still very good.<br/><br/>All of the characters are lovable, and the ones i would suggest to look out for, are Maximus, a palace horse who is extremely funny and becomes a hero in the end. Flynn Rider (the thief voiced by Zachary Levi)is extremely funny, charming and very sweet. Mother Gothel is actually really funny, but is quite sinister. Pascal, Rapunzel's chameleon is loyal and cute and rather funny. And finally Rapunzel, who is brave, funny and sweet(voiced by Mandy Moore.)<br/><br/>The film itself is very funny, and full of so many moments which will make you laugh, cry, and 'awhh' to yourself. One of my favourite parts is the ending, as its unexpected, heart warming, and very magical. The only real letdown, is the music, as i would have expected better songs from Disney, but still the songs are very good, and the one i recommend would be ""Mother Knows Best"" sang by Mother Gothel, as its catchy and humorous.<br/><br/>I really suggest, you grab someone and force them to see this film as it really is amazing. The animation is fantastic, the characters are lovable, and the adventure Flynn and Rapunzel embark on is full of life. There are a few surprises which make you laugh and there are a few sad moments which made me cry anyway.<br/><br/>This really is a GREAT Disney film, and i encourage so many to see it. Plus Rapunzel and Flynn are so cute together. So go to your nearest cinema and watch this beautiful, heart warming, hilarious film, as everything about it is just AMAZING."
"estebangonzalez10","8","2","5","31 January 2011"," Tangled is fun for the entire family!
","¨Superhuman good looks, I've always had them. Born with it. But superhuman strength, can you imagine the possibilities of this?¨ Tangled was a pleasant surprise and it reminded me a lot of the fairy tales I read during my childhood years. This is actually Disney's first CGI fairytale film and it was brought to us from the creators of Bolt and Meet the Robinsons (Nathan Greno and Byron Howard). The movie began a bit slow for my taste, but midway through it picked up and completely hooked me until the very end. There are several scenes which reminded me a lot of Disney's early movies such as Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and The Little Mermaid. The main characters aren't really the stars of the film; it's the secondary characters like Maximus- the horse, and Pascal- the chameleon who steal the show. They were the ones who got the most laughs out of the audience, but Rapunzel and Flynn did make a great couple and were very likable characters nonetheless. There are also a couple of scenes were a small man dressed only in diapers shows up drunk, and he is hilarious every few seconds he appears on screen. Disney took a huge risk at trying to go back to the classical fairytale stories, but it absolutely worked. The story was amazing and had several emotional moments along with very funny scenes that the entire family could enjoy. The CGI effects also gave the story a more magical feeling to it, and the lantern lighting scene was just breathtaking.<br/><br/>As for the plot goes we are introduced to Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) who was born with magical healing and aging powers in her hair. The only problem is that if she cuts her hair those powers vanish (which explains why her hair is so long). She was born a princess, but due to her healing powers she was kidnapped by an old lady named Gothel (Donna Murphy), who locked her up in a tower so no one would ever find her. Gothel raises her as her child and Rapunzel grows up believing she is her daughter and thinking that the outside world is a dangerous place. Her only friend is a chameleon named Pascal with whom she spends the entire day locked up in her tower. One day a wanted man named Flynn (Zachary Levi) shows up accidentally in her tower while trying to hide from the castle guards who are searching for him because he has stolen the crown. Rapunzel knocks Flynn down with a frying pan and takes the crown from him. When Flynn wakes up Rapunzel realizes he is not as dangerous as her mother has told her men were, and she decides to make a deal with him. If he takes her to the castle to see the lantern lightings which are released every year on her birthday she will give him the crown back and let him go. Flynn realizes this will be a hard task since he is a wanted man, but it is his only opportunity so he takes it. Together they begin their journey, but the only problem is that everyone is after Flynn, including a guard's horse named Maximus, who is more committed to his mission on catching Flynn than anyone else.<br/><br/>I actually watched this movie in Spanish (Rapunzel and Flynn were voiced by Chayanne and Danna Paola) and the translation was really well done as in all Disney films. The story is really well written and has several funny moments along with some emotional ones as well so Tangled is well balanced. The main reason I think this fairytale worked for both genres is that it doesn't only focus on the princess. This time the main characters are both Flynn and Rapunzel and they both get a lot of screen time. Flynn, despite being a thief, is a likable guy and has a good heart, while Rapunzel is the usual innocent girl who is being taken advantage of. As I mentioned before the secondary characters also are one of the main reasons why this film worked so well. Tangled is one of the best animated films of this year (after Toy Story 3 of course) and is well worth your time. I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did and didn't even like the trailer that much, but it really surprised me. I absolutely recommend this film for the entire family. The story is really well written and the dialogue in this film is hilarious.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"tabjeep","8","2","5","17 December 2010"," Psychiatry through fairy tales
","Disney took and reform one of the most knowing fairy tales, Rapunzel. And as Disney always do, is filling all those tales with tons of secret messages, either to hopefully trying to make kids understand some values of life through entertaining or reminding the same old values to us grownups.<br/><br/>In my point of view, we have this girl who is coming of age trapped in her ""tower"" of virginity longing to get matured and finally discovers where do these lanterns will might lead her. Rapunzel grew up in the arms of her step mother who is over protecting her and as most mothers is trying to persuade her that the world might change if she decides to leave from the fondling and protection of her childhoods.<br/><br/>Examing the step mother, i would say -as i did above- that as all mothers do is trying with all means to keep close to them their precious little child as if it's the only way for them to stay young. What else can a mother feels if not for feeling young again mirroring herself into her growing little girl. Of course, a step mother could have a hole different meaning. It might pictures all the betraying and bad willings of the outside world and all the wrong messages a girl might take when she's coming of age and lusting to discover with her innocence the hole world.<br/><br/>Then, we have the chameleon. A small little creature which uses to change its color. I believe that chameleon as it being portrayed in the movie, might represent Rapunzel's mood. We can see through the movie that chameleon has a very powerful role. It's there in every Rapunzel's expressions of feeling and changes its color according to her mood. It's blue when she's trapped and scared. It's green when she has no worries, it's pink when she's feeling that something new is overtaking her.<br/><br/>As for her hair...it might stands for her purity. 17 years of purity and innocence which finally loses when she realize that she's in love with a man. All this purity and innocence which used to work as a healing procedure to every person who might feel wrong or troubled. And who is that person that doesn't feel losing all his troubles by the presence of a young, carefree and joyful little child.<br/><br/>The lanterns are all her mixed up feelings which she's not ready yet to reveal and for 17 years she's able only just to watch them from distance as if she's afraid or maybe not yet strong enough to examine them. But finally when she's turning 18, being mature now, she leaves fear or questioning behind, and discovers how great it is to understand your feelings in all their expressions.<br/><br/>Then we have the falling in love which is followed by betrayal then, the fear of losing a loved one, and finally the power of love which is undefeated. But, allowed me to say, the obvious reference of two persons which their love is also expressed physically. We can see the lighting flower which blooms from (don't misunderstand me) the young man's pubic area. I believe this reference is very clear, the sealing of love by the act of physical love. An act that brings someone back to life.<br/><br/>All in all, i always admired Disneys perspective of building or reforming a fairy tale and making it look as ""just an other fairy tale for kids"" but for someone who wants or willing to dig it up he can find innumerable quotes and hide messages. Messages that i suppose are being well hidden into child subconscious and which they finally will find the way to evaluate them when they will come of age."
"Ryan_MYeah","9","2","5","15 December 2010"," A witty, catchy, and beautiful movie that touches my inner child.
","I just got home from seeing Tangled, the latest animated fairy Tale from Disney animation.<br/><br/>Rapunzel (Voiced with sincere enthusiasm by Mandy Moore) is a girl who has long, long hair that contains the ability to heal, a power she obtained from a flower that saved her mother during pregnancy. For this reason the evil Gothel (Voiced wickedly by Donna Murphy), a woman who had stolen Rapunzel as a baby, keeps her hidden in a tower so that she may use it to keep herself young forever. But when a sly thief named Flynn Rider (Voiced by Zachary Levi) sneaks into the tower, she forces him to take her to see a city where lanterns are sent floating every year on her birthday.<br/><br/>The film follows the always classic Disney formula, and the prologue is worrisome, but directors Nathan Greno, Byron Howard and writer Dan Fogelman of 2008's Bolt manage a fine balance between humor, a lot of which was most welcome, divine heart, and wonderful character development. But the real storytelling comes from the brilliant animation. The animation is dazzling, specifically that of every strand of Rapunzel's golden locks of hair, which is simply gorgeous, and the physicality and facial expressions of each character are a great match.<br/><br/>The cast clearly have a lot of fun, Mandy Moore's Rapunzel is a sweet, and honest character, Zachary Levi is cleverly funny as Flynn, but the standout is that of Donna Murphy. It's a daring performance, as each time her character manipulates and lies to get her way, it makes the hatred for her rise, but that's the beauty behind it.<br/><br/>And of course, I MUST mention the music by the legendary Alan Menken, whose return to the animated musical is very much welcome. The orchestral score may not be one of his very best, but it's a sweetly arranged and brilliantly put together craft. The songs, by he and his lyricist Glenn Slater, are especially great ranging from old fashioned Broadway, to fast paced Honky Tonk, the best of which being the songs ""I See The Light"", taking place during the beautiful lantern sequence, and ""Mother Knows Best"" a catchy tune taking place in the film's first fifteen minutes, and re-prised at a later point in the film.<br/><br/>There's something else about Tangled that I love, but just can't explain. Maybe it's the cast, the characters, or even the music, but there's something about Tangled that warms my heart, and touches my nostalgic inner child. It makes me feel like I once did when I was a little kid.<br/><br/>So I obviously say go see Tangled, which I give ***1/2 out of ****"
"healingmusic","9","2","5","6 December 2010"," Three words to describe ""Tangled""... Disney is back!!!
","About fifteen years ago, give or take, Disney decided to go in a different direction without the audiences really noticing it. It's only after watching ""Tangled"" that you come to your senses and grasp that something had been truly missing all this time. <br/><br/>It's like going to your favourite restaurant and ordering your favourite dish that has, over the years, progressively gotten worse. But the changes were so subtle and gradual that you never realized it. Then one day the restaurant goes back to cooking it exactly the way you had it the first time. Suddenly you remember that flavour, that aroma, that delicate complexity which made you fall in love with it in the first place. <br/><br/>The increasingly dimming light that had been the Disney ""magic"" is shining brightly once more... with ""Tangled"".<br/><br/>The story (No spoilers here): After going through a Disney style makeover, ""Tangled"" is a remake of the classic tale of ""Rapunzel"" containing a balanced yet powerful mix of adventure, humour, emotion, and song. Yes I said ""song"". In many ways ""Tangled"" is a musical. But for those of you who just rolled their eyes in disappointment; worry not. The songs are few and far between, well placed and serve the purpose of adding dramatic effect to the given scene. And they're pretty darn good. Think classic ""Beauty and the Beast"" style though not as catchy as the likes of ""Aladdin"".<br/><br/>With a place for everything and everything in its place, ""Tangled"" is very well paced with an engaging story line. And despite the few key departures from the original fairy tale the Disney version is seamlessly woven together by strong characters and ageless dialogue. <br/><br/>The Characters: Voiced by the multi-talented Mandy Moore, and with her naïveté, curiosity, lust for life and lack of experience in... anything for that matter, Rapunzel is a Disney princess you instantly fall in love with.<br/><br/>As the viewer your heart instantly goes out to her and even though, I hope, not many of us know what it's like to be trapped in a tower by means of psychological abuse, you somehow relate to her and want her to fulfill her dream, trifle as it may be in nature but very important to her given her psychology.<br/><br/>Flynn Ryder, the leading man and love interest voiced by Zachary Levi, is very likable and has almost the same screen time and character importance as our princess. Something that, as far as I remember, has not been done before in a Disney feature. Characters like The Beast came close but not quite like Flynn.<br/><br/>Other than the brilliantly written and acted character of Rapunzel's mother, who I will not go into as not to spoil the plot, there is also whole spectrum of characters that add colour, companionship and challenges to our heroes' journey.<br/><br/>The Age Range: Anybody from a three year old to a hundred will find something to enjoy and love in ""Tangled"". <br/><br/>I think anyone over a hundred years old will not get the concept of 3D animation and wonder why the ""people"" in this talkie are so colourful (sorry grandpa just kidding)<br/><br/>Final words to Disney: OK, Disney you've had your fun, you've experimented with different directions over the past decade or so, you've gotten it out of your system... Hopefully ""Tangled"" is proof to you that you should stick to what you've always done best musical based, emotion packed, humour filled, classic fairy tales.<br/><br/>I hope you continue down this long forgotten path... it works, has always worked and will definitely always work."
"johnnymacbest","8","2","5","5 December 2010"," Best animated film I've seen since The Lion King.
","What a joyful movie. Generally, I'm not an animated movie fan(especially the CG type) but this is an exception. Filled with witty songs and dialog with stunning vistas and voice acting, ""Tangled"" is not only a film, it's also a metaphor for the many conflicting emotions the characters exhibit in the film such as Rapunzel's desire to see the outside world, to Mother Gothel wanting to shelter her from it(for reasons unknown to her but to the audience) to Flynn wanting to make a name for himself. I was utterly surprised despite being a kid's film, it also touches on some pretty adult subject matter such as ageism, selfishness, desire, and love. That was really unexpected from a film of this type. Although it is loosely based on the legend of Rumplestilskin, Tangled is one of the best animated films of this year. See it in 3D to get the full effect."

","I took my 3 daughters (all Disney Princess fans) to Opening Day of Tangled and all I've heard since is.... let's go again! While we love Princess movies in general in our household, a Princess alone isn't a surefire win (Disney's ""Princess"" made-for-TV was a flop, Barbie is hit and miss, and the Disney Princess Collections are mostly 3/10 stars)...<br/><br/>We went with friends (this included three little boys) and all of the children left smiling, laughing, and wanting to see it again.<br/><br/>The story is captivating and full of adventure. It was exciting to see a prince with some depth. Many trademark scenes (rowboats and a work song) were included (and as Disney Princess fans, we're glad) - but still Tangled made its own mark.<br/><br/>Rapunzel is a princess with integrity, loyalty, and compassion - along with strength, adventure, and charisma. The sparkling personality was outstanding.<br/><br/>Well done!"

","I saw this with my daughter on the weekend. Yes, in the past few years I have re watched all the Disney movies with my daughter over and over again. Yes, I don't like almost ALL of them. I liked Princess and the Frog until they turned into frogs. I hate slapstick. I hate funny talking animals. But, when I saw this movie, it was almost perfect. It is up there with the Toy Story's. No talking animals. The slapstick wasn't overly done. The animation was gorgeous. I am an almost 40 year old man, and I can't wait to get this on DVD. And the subtle undertones! Wow! There was plot problems, sure. But it is a kids movie (personally, i would think it would be better for a 8+ year old)"
"fjhuerta-2","6","2","5","28 November 2010"," Thank you, John Lasseter!
","I clearly remember the last time I was excited about a Disney movie. It was ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". My son sort of likes ""Bolt"", but I can't stand it. With Pixar around, who wants to see stuff like ""Home on the Range"" or ""Chicken Little""? In my eyes, Disney was absolutely defeated by Pixar in every conceivable way.<br/><br/>Which is a shame, really, since there are so many great things about Disney - nobody used to be able to tell a story like them, and their hand-drawn visuals do things that CG can't.<br/><br/>So, what happens when Lasseter does Disney? Well, ""Tangled"". It rocks. It looks awesome - completely distinct than any Pixar film, with a beauty of its own. The story moves slowly at first, but the set-up is well worth it. There's a moment that will probably take your breath away. It was magic, the kind Disney were masters at. <br/><br/>I loved it. While nothing this year was going to be able to beat Toy Story 3 (I mean, why even try?) this is a great 50th film for Disney. They should be proud of themselves. They are definitely back in the game, with a little bit of Pixar magic."
"Jangobadass","9","2","5","28 November 2010"," Brings back that old fashioned Disney Magic
","I have to admit I wasn't impressed by the trailers & commercials for this movie, which made it look like another ""Shrek"" wannabe, full of slapstick and snarky characters. However, I liked what I saw of Rapunzel and animals and heard good things about it from those in the know, so I gave it a shot. I'm very glad I did.<br/><br/>It takes us back to the time when Disney was at their best. I felt like I did the first time I watched the classics like ""Aladdin"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", and ""The Little Mermaid"". And that's a good thing. It may sound like too much praise, but in this era of animated movies more interested in pop culture references and wacky (read: grating) antics than good stories and memorable characters, we could really use more cartoon movies like the ones of old.<br/><br/>Even the opening narration reminded me of old-school Disney in how it told us the back story in its older movies. And I like how we get a different take on the story of Rapunzel, changing her from a farmer's daughter who ended up in the hands of a witch to a princess kidnapped to keep a woman (I wouldn't really call her a witch) young, and instead of a prince we get a thief forced to take her from that tower.<br/><br/>The characters are the best we've gotten from a non-Pixar Disney movie it a while. Rapunzel makes a good heroine. With big green eyes and 70 feet of golden hair, she's more engaging than Snow White and Aurora, as wide-eyed and venturesome as Ariel and Belle, and as clever as Mulan. And she's wonderfully versatile with that hair, like Indiana Jones with a built in whip, or Wonder Woman's lasso as a part of her body. Mother Gothel, like Disney's very best villains, is unassuming while manipulative, cunning and, above all else, cruel and self-serving. We get really good sidekicks in the animals. They don't talk (which I'm glad of), but communicate greatly via facial expressions, gestures, and body language. Pascal the chameleon has a good sense of comic timing and his color changing adds to his communication. Meanwhile, Maximus the horse steals every scene he's in, acting more like a dog than a horse, putting up a better fight than the castle guards, and even having some interesting depth. The one character I didn't like was Flynn. Having seen a lot of him in the trailers, I thought he'd be a weak link. And I was right. Not only is his storyline all too familiar, but I've seen his kind in several Dreamworks movies (starts out selfish, snide and scheming then gets better over time). He's basically a pretty Shrek, or one the heroes of ""Eldorado"" (he even kinda looks them)<br/><br/>This is the second Disney animated movie since ""Mulan"" to have song & dance numbers, and most of them are pretty good, bringing back memories of ""The Litte Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"", which isn't surprising with Alan Menken in charge of music. The best one is the reprise of ""Mother Knows Best"" (once again, the Villain gets the best song!). And I should warn you about the weakest, ""I've Got a Dream"", which is supposed to emulate ensemble numbers of cartoons movies past, but is just too over the top and silly for its own good.<br/><br/>I'll admit its not groundbreaking like Disney Classics of old. But after a decade of many failures, including a few that were close but still missed the mark, this is the kind of movie that made Disney all those years ago with great animation, colorful characters (literally in Pascal's case), and a story that nicely mixes romance, comedy, adventure and heart. This is Disney at its best. And we need more like it."
"Apemangalore","9","2","5","27 November 2010"," Continues the studio's trend of excellence set by 2008's Bolt
","With John Lasseter having gained creative control over the studio several years ago now, it's more than fair to say that Walt Disney Animation has become a force to be reckoned with in the industry. While I felt that Meet the Robinsons was a fairly middling entry in the ""classic"" canon, it was 2008's Bolt that proved that it was still capable of creating films on par with those of its sister studio, Pixar. For me personally, it was the film that quickly found its way among Pulp Fiction and The Big Lebowski as one of my all-time favorites. So, when I heard that Tangled (or, as it was initially titled, Rapunzel) would also be under the helm of Byron Howard, along with Nathan Greno, Bolt's head of story, I naturally got pumped. Thankfully, Disney Animation's 50th feature continues the trend of excellence set by the duo's last project.<br/><br/>If there's one area where Tangled challenges Pixar, it's in the animation. Much like in the studio's previous computer-animated entry, all of the environments in the movie, while looking incredibly realistic, don't contradict the cartoon-esquire design of the characters. The film also provokes feelings of nostalgia, due in part by the painterly backgrounds that are reminiscent of films from Disney's first Golden Age.<br/><br/>As far as the plot is concerned, it's more or less what one would expect. That said, what Disney Animation tends to do best is have characters that are so relatable and different from one another that they make an otherwise traditional, borderline-formulaic tale feel virtually brand new. Definitely, that's pulled off here. The two leads, Rapunzel and Flynn (played with genuine sincerity by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi, respectively) make for one of the most likable Disney couples, and the two side characters that accompany them along their journey are just as endearing. Often, when going into an animated film in particular, I'm afraid of running into agonizingly annoying ""sidekicks."" However, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, Pascal, got quite a few laughs out of me, and Maximus, the horse of the Head of the Palace Guard, pretty much steals the show. The less said about him, out of fear of spoiling anything, the better.<br/><br/>You probably wouldn't know it based on the way that this film was marketed, but Tangled is a musical. While I don't see the soundtrack as a whole going down in history as one of the studio's greatest, there are a couple of truly memorable musical numbers, one of which coming from the film's villainess, Mother Gothel. Voiced excellently by Donna Murphy, she's a character who constantly kept me guessing. If Gothel isn't on par with Keith David's Dr. Facilier from last year's Princess and the Frog, she's close.<br/><br/>Despite a mildly slow beginning, Tangled is one of the most entertaining, as well as one of the most emotionally resonant, movies that I've seen this year. Directors Byron Howard and Nathan Greno prove themselves to be more than just one-hit wonders by providing a film with mesmerizing visuals, catchy musical numbers, and a cast of characters that is almost entirely memorable. If nothing else, it's the first film since Inception that's reminded me why I go to films in the first place."

","Flynn Rider: ""You smell that? It's part man-smell, and the other part is really bad man-smell, but overall it just smells like the color brown. Your thoughts?"" <br/><br/>Tangled is not the Rapunzel story your mom grew up on. As the above quote attests, Disney has post-modernized it with updated, semi-hip dialogue and some Freudian notions that fit the story's thematic base. Disney has made a fun movie of an old fairy-tale chestnut, not as complex as Princess and the Frog, but good enough to be the studio's 50th animation and going strong.<br/><br/>How does 26 years old Mandy Moore's voice sound like 18-year old's? It does, and I'm impressed with the whole angle of vision that emphasizes the needs of pre-teens and teens to bolt from the nest and see the world as it is, not through parents' eyes, while promoting the value of family, real family that is.<br/><br/>Supposedly the visual style, an effective use of 3D, has the properties of ""The Swing,"" a romantic painting by Jean-Honore Fragonard. Whatever, the hair of the two leads, and even wicked ""mom,"" is textured and layered in a most realistic,yet romantically stylized fashion.<br/><br/>Disney is canny enough to use Rapunzel's hair as a weapon, similar to Indiana Jones's whip, to take the staid glam out of its tradition and make it useful for more than a ladder. Even the sidekick chameleon, to be almost as welcomed as Donkey in Shreck, has reactions reflecting the modern cynicism rather than the cute simpleton.<br/><br/>In its further favor, the love between the two teens is not in the Twilight longing motif—it rather it grows organically from a mutual respect, not lust divorced from the idealized bodies Disney distractingly offers in its animations. In short, your thinking youngsters should love the ironies Tangled offers while it entertains with patented Disney humanity."
"SouthSideChgo","3","19","108","18 November 2010"," ALL the shampoo in the world cannot un-TANGLED this hair ...even in 3D!
","Disney has done it ...again and this time, it's in 3D! It's latest addition to the princess lineup - Rapunzel - clearly shows how un-imaginative this archaic animation/movie company has recently become and it has its new movie sucked into the 3D fad too instead of the traditional use of 2D.<br/><br/>Tangled is a loosely-based story of Grimm Brothers' fairy tale, Rapunzel. And SouthSide literally means ""loosely based"" ...watered down to the point that Disney only kept the bare basics to this story (the girl with long hair, tower and a witch, affectionately named Mother Gothel) before adding filler which was never part of the original fairy tale. SouthSide won't reveal much about the plot - let's just say Rapunzel uses her lovely locks for more than pulling a full grown witch up the tower however she doesn't remember reading about Rapunzel's hair having healing powers (reference to Disney's Atlantis movie) or an outlaw named Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) ...or a kingdom that lights lanterns every year on the missing princess' birthday. Somehow the legendary Grimm Brothers missed that part in their fairy tale version.<br/><br/>Now toss in a horse named Maximus (a Russell Crowe Gladiator reference?) that ""acts"" like a trained dog (Hunchback of Notre Dame reference) during the film and a chameleon named Pascal with a Robert DeNiro ""I'm watching you"" complex. SouthSide found the animals (as well as the gang of ruffian bandits) far more interesting in Tangled than the main characters, Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and Flynn (Levi). There's plenty of Disney action, adventure in which binds Rapunzel and Flynn together, romance (of course - think Little Mermaid during the boat scene when Moore and Levi sing the duet I See The Light) and lame Disney humor (most of the funny moments are shown in the Tangled commercials). Sadly none of the humor didn't attract a single guffaw from SouthSide's eight year old daughter - take it as a bad sign when a movie doesn't generate any excitement from a tween girl who's loves dressing up as a princess.<br/><br/>Usually Disney movies are filled with ear-popping, memorable songs such as Can You Feel The Love Tonight (Lion King), Pink Elephants (Dumbo) or A Girl Worth Fighting For (Mulan). However Tangled fails miserably in the song category. The songs are mostly big production, Broadway sounding pieces like Mother Gothel's Mamma Knows Best - SouthSide liked the Shadow Man's song Friends On The Other Side (from The Princess and The Frog) better. It was darker, creepier and scarier unlike Mother Gothel's in which this reviewer had to stop herself from laughing out of her seat from lack of scariness (even in 3D it wasn't scary). Yet Tangled does have one memorable (but not Oscar worthy) song - I Got A Dream that had the feel and fun of Gaston from Beauty and The Beast. Alan Menken is at the helm for Tangled's original score and songs (with Glenn Slater on lyrics) but this reviewer noticed the recycled themes from his past films and lack of creativity on lyrics.<br/><br/>Yes, Tangled will generate the usual Disney money numbers amongst families during this upcoming holiday season however it's not truly a Disney hit or best. It won't ever rank up there with Beatty and The Beast, Cinderella or its first cinematic classic Snow White.<br/><br/>Tangled is simply too tangled up to believe its own hype for this reviewer to like ...even in 3D.<br/><br/>Save your money..."
"nokturnal-rapport","3","9","44","14 January 2012"," A bad all-you-can-eat animation buffet
","Boring, cliché, cheesy, unoriginal are some of the terms that come to mind when I think of this movie. I know it's for kids and not meant to be taken seriously but it's such a bad joke. Despicable Me, Ratatouille, Wall-E, Kung-fu Panda are for kids too but adults can enjoy them because there's an acceptable coherence to the premise of the movie, the role of the characters in the plot, why the characters do what they do, and so on. Of course I always go easy and try not to nitpick on the logical factors in animations but come on it's way too flawed that you can't relate to the characters' motives. <br/><br/>The lost princess is kidnapped and hidden away in an Empire-State-sized tower in a NEARBY forest. And everyone has been searching for her high and low for 18 years? How the hell can one miss such a wonderful architecture? Rapunzel is so healthy, fit, sane and oh so smart despite being solitary confined and brainwashed. Her only interactions are the wicked 'mother' and the chameleon. OK I accept the premise that she's special due to the magical properties of the sun drop flower or whatever. The 'mother' is just weird to the bone. She wants to be forever-young but why and for what? Dude get this, she lives like a recluse and doesn't even have a boyfriend to begin with. OK I accept the premise that she's batsh*t insane and psychotic. She wants to be forever young and forever alone to take walking excursions in the woods like Thoreau during the day then comes back and makes hazelnut soup for the night. Repeat. Flynn, the sly thief can't over-power Rapunzel.I take it he instantaneously infatuates upon seeing Rapunzel. Ah don't even get me started with the singing. <br/><br/>I wonder how are they supposed to search for the lost princess? Age-progression artist? If that's the case, they'd need to execute the artist because no one recognizes her in broad day light. I mean Rapunzel literally looks just like her mother, the Queen. The royal guards stumbled upon her but they were apparently unimpressed with the uncanny resemblance of Rapunzel to their Queen. Rapunzel was surrounded by the town folks dancing and singing on the princess's birthday sky lantern annual ceremony. Yet it crosses no one's mind she's the lost princess. How are they gonna ever find her since they can't even tell when she's right in-front of them? the Queen saw her and knows right away she's her long lost little daughter. Oh I guess mother does know best. <br/><br/>I feel bad for them kids because these kind of movies instill the wrong idea about love. Disney animations will be responsible for the future of the clueless generation of males when it comes to girls. <br/><br/>Some positive points: I did like the animation especially Rapunzel's hair; it's so smooth and fluid. She's very pretty and cute too. It got me laugh out loud in some funny scenes. But it's still a bad animation. It's like Disney dumped some of their previous works together, mix them with the main ingredient of Cinderella from 1950, add some other spices and voila there comes Tangled. I guess kids would love it. But adults don't even bother."

","Although, I am definitely not the target audience for animated movies about lost princesses and evil stepmothers, I am always tempted to see anything animated from Disney, and especially in CGI.<br/><br/>The show doesn't open well. I am getting a little tired of funny narration and the opening song left me a little sick to my stomach. When the evil stepmother breaks into song too, (what she actually is, I won't spoil it for those who may not have seen it yet), needless to say didn't help matters much.<br/><br/>Things recover a little bit after we are introduced to the gentleman thief. Though, he is nowhere as rogue as I would like (this is after all Disney), I liked this character enough to keep watching. When the lost princess shows a little spunk as well, that's when my interest really kicked in.<br/><br/>Now for the best part: Can you believe that it is a song? I couldn't believe it either. It's corny, predictable but handled in such a way that I was surprised I was laughing so much during it. Tough guys with soft hearts have been covered since the silent film days, but whatever. Just look at the scene and you will laugh your head off.<br/><br/>The conclusion is again a little predictable and it made me a little sad that the second act didn't sustain itself into the third. Still, the animation is beautiful as is expected from a Disney feature plus that horse is pretty funny too."

I heard the entire story from Dean during a book signing and it totally sounds like the kind of thing Disney would do because they can get away with anything and the only thing you can't put past them is making an R-rated movie. Rapunzel is a hippie with gold hair instead of red hair that comes from a flower instead of a ward and Flynn is a strikingly handsome thief striving for redemption just like the hunk he was ripped off from.

","'TANGLED': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Disney's 50th animated feature! They spared no expense too, at a whopping $260 million budget it's the second most expensive film in history. The film is a throwback to the great Disney animated films we saw in the 80's and 90's as opposed to the more recent (but it's still a far cry from the classics of the 30's, 40's and 50's). It's a fantasy film based on an old fairy tale again (another from the Brothers Grimm) with plenty of musical numbers. Something kids are sure to love but it may lack the interest of older viewers.<br/><br/>Revamped retelling of the Grimms Fairy Tale 'Rapunzel'. It tells the story of a magical flower that has the power to heal the sick and wounded. It also has the power to keep an old witch named Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) young if she sings to it. The Queen of a nearby village becomes ill and having heard of the flower sends her guards to retrieve it to cure her. They do and the Queen is saved. Shortly later she gives birth to a daughter, Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) and Gothel knows that the powers of the flower still exists in the child's hair as long as it isn't cut. So the witch kidnaps Rapunzel and locks her away in a hidden tower raising her as her own. She forbids Rapunzel from leaving the tower, telling her it's for her safety, and never cuts her hair. 18 years later Rapunzel longs for the outside world and truly dreams of traveling to the mysterious lights she sees every year on her birthday. When a thief (voiced by Zachary Levi, of TV's 'CHUCK' fame) stumbles upon her tower while trying to elude authorities she knocks him out and steals his loot. She then makes a deal with him that she'll give him back his valuables if he agrees to escort her to the magical lights. An adventure begins and of course the two fall in love.<br/><br/>The movie is predictable and clichéd but it is somewhat fun and amusing as well. The animation is colorful and beautiful and the jokes are somewhat funny. I didn't find the music to be very well written though and when it gets to be one musical number after another the film starts to drag and for me becomes really uninteresting. The film is clever and visually impressive to a certain extent but I didn't find it to be nearly as entertaining as a lot of the glowing reviews it's been getting (like Quentin Tarantino's 5th place 2010 top 20 placing). It is better than a lot of the more recent Disney animated films though and as a kids film it definitely works. Overall it's a decent animated kids film but certainly not a great one.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYbw_OZUFso"

","2010 was an amazing year for animated movies. Toy Story 3, Despicable Me, How to Train Your Dragon, and, of course, Tangled. Given this was Disney's first CGI fairytale (no Frozen then, imagine that!), no one really knew what to expect. Disney didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>What immediately struck me upon watching this film was the gorgeous animation. Rapunzel's hair is a technical marvel, and the scenery is simply stunning. The colors are vibrant and diverse and every character, even the minor ones, are exceptionally detailed.<br/><br/>Though it is based off a fairytale, Tangled manages to re-imagine the story of Rapunzel in a way that is fresh for all audiences. Rapunzel ranks next to Mulan and Belle as one of my favorite Disney princesses. She's compassionate and ladylike, but, like the aforementioned princesses, is also resourceful and brave. Flynn Rider has to be one of the most refreshing Disney male leads. He actually *has* a personality, something I unfortunately can't say for Prince Charming or Snow White's prince. The romance that develops between Flynn and Rapunzel is one of Disney's best, probably the best since Belle and the Beast; it's allowed time to develop and doesn't come off as sappy.<br/><br/>Villainess Mother Gothel is truly in a class of her own; manipulative, vain, and coolly calculating.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another standout--the voice acting. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi shine as the leads, and Donna Murphy is deliciously over-the-top as Gothel.<br/><br/>Unusually for Disney films, the sidekicks don't talk. Maximus (a horse) and Pascal (a chameleon) communicate their thoughts by facial expressions alone.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, although not as memorable as Frozen's, does have a few hits. When Will My Life Begin is peppy and appropriate as Rapunzel's intro, and I See the Light is the best Disney love ballad since A Whole New World in my opinion.<br/><br/>Finally, Tangled's writing is terrific. The comedy is well-balanced between slapstick and satire, and the dramatic moments are powerful.<br/><br/>Overall, Tangled is a must-see if you're a Disney fan, fairytale lover, or simply someone who enjoys a fine movie. My only complaint was that Mother Gothel's dress was a little too low, but it wasn't terrible. If you have kids, make sure to screen Tangled before showing them as the movie does have its intense scenes. Well worth a watch!"

","Tangled goes down as one of Disney's best. It does not quite have the grandeur of movies like the Beauty and the Beast or the Lion King, but that does not mean that it is lesser, just different. The tone is light and yet feels deep. The characters Rapunzel and Flynn are extremely likable. The story is simple but moving. The visuals are great too. And most of all the dialog and the interaction between characters are excellent. The one weakness seems to be the soundtrack. The background music works but the songs are not that great. I feel like this is the only thing that keeps this movie from being truly great. Nonetheless, Tangled is very good and I would recommend it to people of all ages."

","Tangled is one of the cutest animated film I have ever seen. Not only does it include elements of fantasy and romance but also comedy. It was released in 2012. Rapunsel, the main character, is the king's daughter but early days after her birth she was stole by an evil witch that keep the princes hostage raising as her daughter. Is she going to realize that witch isn't her real mother? It has really funny scenes and also cute ones. Tangles isn't a normal princes movie, is more different from the other ones that I have seen. I recommend this amazing movie because it's for children and for adults too. In the drama and romance scenes adults feel more that lovely and sad parts because they know more about it than children. But children would like it too because is an animated film and although, it is a princes movie it is also for boys because it has bandits, thieves and fights. So watch this lovely movie!"

","So this movie was the start of a new era of Disney-animation. Their first completely CGI-made animated movie. It was also the second movie (after The Princess and the Frog) that brought back the story of Disney princesses after a long absence. It is 12 years since since Disney made a princess-themed animated feature! I have to say I missed them, it is kind of the trademark of Disney.<br/><br/>Tangled is the story of Rapunzel, the lost princess of Corona, and Flynn Rider, a wanted thief that stumbles upon Rapunzel in her tower. They share a journey to the kingdom for the lantern- ceremony that will change their life forever.<br/><br/>What makes this such a good movie is because of many things. Firstly, the movie is beautifully made, the CGI, that people were skeptical to, works fantastic, and some of the ""shots"" are simply stunning. The animation has also come to an incredibly impressive level. The story is heart- warming yet simple, in classic Disney style. The cast, first and foremost Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi, does a fantastic job providing voices for the main characters. Moore has such a sweet voice that works perfectly to the cute Rapunzel, and Levi is amazing in terms of expressing his characters feelings only through his voice. The music is great, with ""I see the light"" being the highlight, and Pascal and Maximus are both funny and complementary as sidekicks.<br/><br/>I write this in 2014, which means both ""Brave"" and ""Frozen"" have been released. That is two new Disney-princess movies that continue the success of ""Tangled"". People love movies like this, they can be enjoyed by both young and old. I would love to see Disney continue to make these princess-themed movies, and I am sure there are others who feel the same."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","2","6","24 June 2011"," About what we might expect
","Rapunzel doesn't remember her royal parents(why is it that ""destiny"" is always a big, positive one?), as she has been locked away in a tower since infancy, trapped there by a witch(who has a habit of disappearing using her cloak, I guess she doubles as a ninja) who pretends to be her mother so she can remain young, using the girl's magical hair and its healing properties(nevermind its ridiculous strength or the changing back and forth between her roots feeling any pain from pull or not). She does wonder about the outside world(albeit she does know things that one wouldn't think she would, given that she's been indoctrinated against leaving), and when Flynn, a young arrogant thief, hides in her place of residence, she forces him to take her outside. There are more details, but that's the gist of it. I haven't watched much of anything by Disney since Hercules, especially since they went from 2D into CGI, and I see little has changed since my last dip in the pool. Don't get me wrong, this does look pretty good. Nice use of brightness/darkness of color, some memorable designs and the general animation is great. I can't comment on the acting, as the cut I viewed was dubbed into Danish. Anyway, the material is ""safe"". Over the top stuff, silliness, and in general mostly for the kids. I saw most punchlines coming, and this garnered one or two chuckles out of me, nothing more. The plot developments aren't that unexpected, either. We have a horse that acts like a dog(a bloodhound, to be exact), a chameleon as the sidekick(...I don't know, I guess they're just drawing them out of a big hat with ""animals"" written on the side) even though they hadn't thought of very many gags where that comes into play(even fewer that are at least decent... and you could excise it from the script, with nothing changing by it), and a sweetened take on an old fairy tale that had merit on its own, and will henceforth be known in the mainstream by the sanitized, corporate-approved version. With all that said, the pacing is quite reasonable, and this goes into compelling themes(and explores them rather well), such as the fear of age/death, growing up and youth rebellion. Like I said, par for the course. Not better or worse than the general piece by the studio. There is a little mild violence in this. I recommend this to fans of the work and legacy of ol' Walt, and/or of the original story. 7/10"

","Disney's homesick return to its nostalgic fairytale style, a move that started in 2007 with the surprisingly delightful Enchanted, has now led to a belated adaptation of the classic fairytale Rapunzel, one they'd surprisingly neglected in their heyday. While it is pleasing to see them pushing forward, and not simply looking back to their previous works and parodying them, it is also a disappointment to realise that the age of those beautiful, treasured animated gems are gone. After years of DreamWorks Animation Studios slowly beating those films to death with relentless childish mockery, it becomes difficult when watching this musical fantasy story to know when and when not it is meant to attract cynical undertones. Also, the ridiculous tendencies towards half-hearted sitcom humour and ersatz pathos that children's movies have acquired over the past few decades have unfortunately not been fought against here, spoiling most of the attempts to recreate the old magic. However, whilst it can never achieve that winsome sense of purity and innocence we love about the classics and thus join them, it still ranks as one of the better and more universally enjoyable kids films of the last ten years. The animation is attractive and colourful, the pacing is mostly slick and tight, the numerous gags don't quite get a laugh but don't fall flat either, the songs here are quite a nice addition – in particular Mother Knows Best and its reprises – and its characters are genuinely interesting. To top things off, its villain, the nasty witch named Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) is the first antagonist with an actually evil countenance seen in a while. Also starring the voices of Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi, it should be considered at best as a superior alternative this summer to Gulliver's Travels in the children's movies section, but by no means is it a must- see comedic musical fairytale animation extravaganza."
"drqshadow-reviews","6","1","2","21 April 2020"," An Evolutionary Hurdle for Disney Feature Animation
","Rapunzel gets the Disney princess treatment in this loose, computer-animated adaptation of an untapped fairy tale. In a number of ways, Tangled is the proto-Frozen. The thoroughly plastic, pseudo Pixar appearance of everything; the themes of familial strife with a supernatural twist; the roguish (and sometimes oafish) love interest; the polished, American Idol-influenced style of music; it all looks, sounds and feels like a beta test for that later, more successful, animated feature.<br/><br/>The art direction is brighter and warmer, of course (warmer than a film called Frozen? You don't say!), effectively playing the summer palette to Anna and Elsa's winter, and that's refreshing. Doesn't seem like we get too many kids' movies this lightheartedly vivacious nowadays. Rapunzel herself embodies that spirit, constantly bursting with sunshine and positivity, even in the midst of a crisis. Mandy Moore was a good choice for that role: her voice is energetic and youthful, capable of nailing the musical notes, but also the somewhat naive optimism of an open-hearted teenage girl.<br/><br/>The whole production is more than a little superficial, though, from the breezy plot to the hollow soundtrack cuts. We get lovely set decorations with an expressive, painterly touch, a few strong visual gags, a little dose of the touchie-feelies, and that's a wrap. Not to belabor the point, but I can't escape the sense that Disney was trying to find their way for most of this picture, running experiments that would benefit a later project, at the expense of the current effort. It's fine, no more and no less."

Rewatching it again, I stilk enjoyed it, but not as much as the first time round. This is dinsey's first CGI princess tale. I must admit that I do mish the 2D animation of princess films and Princess and the Frog tried ro bring 2D back, but wasn't sucessful in doing so. I must admit that I did enjoy the 3D animation of this film,particularly Rapunzul's hair. It was very fluid when her hair moved very nice. But the only issue's I found was that the pacing did slow down at times in the middle of the film, resulting in it being a tad boring. But my gosh, the story is just too good. I do recommned this film. I think both boys and giels will enjoy it equally. 😁👍🏾"

","...generally. Tangled's combination of fantastic magical princesses with a nontraditional outlaw boyfriend and some blustery action make for a highly intriguing spoof of the Grimm tale of Rapunzel. In execution, though, some things were left out. I didn't find myself get much into the characters, especially Maximus, and the story 's attempts to engage were quite inconsistent in my experience and came with varying degrees of success. There is still the exquisitely charming animation, and oh God Alan Menken did the songs (sorry, I thought IMDb admins would chastise me for overdoing all capitals)! The music was an excellent distraction from any times the characters couldn't keep our eyes peeled to them and the eye candy was starting to turn tart. Yes, I agree that Frozen is better, but I'll get to that one in 3 reviews and I did have to consider how their concepts were quite similar (I can't describe it quite like CinemaSins can). It isn't solid enough to be an all-time classic, but it is still worthy of one view."
"millenniumfalcon-33591","9","1","2","15 December 2015"," Not as financially successful as ""Frozen"", but definitely better!
","I know some people may shoot me down for this (pun intended), but one thing I can say is that while not as well-reviewed and financially successful as THAT 2013 hit Disney movie (yeah, I'm talking about the one with ""Let It Go, Let It Go""), it's definitely the more superior film!<br/><br/>Without a doubt, ""Tangled"" is a loose retelling of the ""Rapunzel"" story that we have grown up listening to. But instead of following the story all the way, the guys at Disney made the titular character into a tough, adventurous girl - albeit still with that super-long hair and living in a tall tower, imprisoned by her ""mother"". In fact, watching that movie makes me think that Girl Power is alive and well, as unlike many of her fellow Disney Princesses (notably Snow White, Aurora, and Cinderella), it is Rapunzel who does most of the saving and fighting - more so than the male lead, Eugene!<br/><br/>And who can ever forget that amazing scene with the lanterns, with Rapunzel and Eugene singing ""I See The Light"" while on the boat? While I know some of you don't quite fancy the song and still prefer the ""Frozen"" theme, the lantern scene is so beautifully shot that it looks very real, especially when watching the movie in 3D. As well as seeing the couple's romance starting to bloom all the while, and up to the part where they almost kiss - but Eugene got distracted by something!<br/><br/>Let's not forget the presence of important sidekicks that make the movie so enjoyable - the lovable Maximus and Pascal. Almost every scene they are in will make anyone laugh and let's not forget that they are your regular animals - i.e. they don't speak, which speaks volumes of how their antics are that hilarious (which explains the spin off Tangled Ever After short film, where Pascal and Maximus are the ""stars"" this time round)!<br/><br/>No wonder reviews of ""Tangled"" always seem to mention that this 2010 movie heralded the start of another Disney Renaissance - albeit this time known as the ""Revival Era"" - since the many movies released since then have been both critical and financial successes!"

","Modern day fairy tales can entertain, teach lessons, and help children expand their imagination. There are often twists of unexpected changes and underlying themes and symbols in the story lines for some particular fairy tales. One example is Disney's version of Rapunzel in the movie Tangled. While the story captures the hearts of the audience by telling a romantic love story through a fun filled journey, there are also major themes presented which often go unrecognized. Disney's Tangled does capture the audience's attention in an entertaining way, but also presents many underlying symbolizations which can possibly affect the overall experience of the movie. <br/><br/>The story begins with a teenage girl named Rapunzel with long golden hair, locked away in a tower with her Mother Gothel. While it is unknown to Rapunzel at the time, she was kidnapped and held hostage her whole life by the witch Mother Gothel. The witch kidnapped Rapunzel in order to benefit from the magical healing powers of Rapunzel's hair. After some time, a young man by the name of Flynn Rider stumbles upon the tower seeking refuge after he stole a precious artifact. After the two meet, Rapunzel begs Flynn Rider to take her out exploring to see a lighting of lanterns which occurs on her birthday every year. While Rapunzel and Flynn Rider often disagree about things and have different challenges to go through, the main storyline of the movie focuses on the journey of the two setting out together. After some time, Rapunzel and Flynn learn about each other's secrets and eventually fall in love. The plot twist of the movie consists of Mother Gothel regaining captivity of Rapunzel and holding Flynn Rider as a hostage. However, Rapunzel sacrificially gives up her freedom by agreeing to live with her mother forever in order to save Flynn. In return, Flynn Rider attempts to save Rapunzel by cutting off her hair and removing her magical powers. This results in Mother Gothel being taken away and allows Rapunzel to save Flynn and heal him from injuries acquired from Mother Gothel. In the end, Rapunzel marries Flynn Rider and reunites with her true family. <br/><br/>Tangled presents a theme that differentiates from common fairy tales because it illustrates the story of a young girl victimized to captivity. The movie paints the picture of Rapunzel living in solitude and enjoying her various activities. However, her story can represent the reality for many individuals in the world subject to human captivity including: domestic abuse, human trafficking, kidnapping, and slavery. Since Rapunzel was kidnapped and sheltered by her witch mother, her whole life and psychological emotions were affected. One example is prevalent when she sets out from her castle for the first time with Flynn Rider. Rapunzel expresses her emotions by singing and dancing after experiencing the wonders of the earth and freedom for the first time. However, there is also an example of the negative impacts of captivity on an individual. In parallelism with Rapunzel's joy of experiencing freedom, she also goes through deep regret and guilt after leaving her captor Mother Gothel. <br/><br/>Disney tries to portray Rapunzel's captivity as harmless and fun, however in reality, human captivity is a serious situation and can greatly affect the lives of victims. It is important to think about the underlying ideas and symbols presented in movies and to understand how easily audiences can be deceived into believing that harmful situations can have no major consequences. Tangled truly entertains by developing lovable characters, adding humor and adventure, and illustrating through beautiful animation, however I found that the overall theme of the move affected my opinion of it. It saddens me to think about the torture and lies Rapunzel lived through and how Disney portrays this lightly and harmlessly. Without much thought and reflection, Tangled presents a lovable story, but after understanding the hidden symbols and realizing their truth in reality, the movie can leave a depressing effect."
"Buddy-51","Null","1","2","1 August 2011"," refreshingly ""square"" and straight-forward fairy tale
","The 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, ""Tangled"" is a little less flashy and a little less hectic than the average animated feature these days, hewing closer to ""reality"" than most such films – if one can stretch that term to include a tale of a beautiful, tower-dwelling princess whose blonde tresses glow when she sings, and whose ""Prince Charming"" comes in the form of a roguish thief whose face is plastered on wanted posters all over the countryside. But ""Tangled"" doesn't overplay its hand in the storytelling arena. There are no fire-breathing dragons, no talking animals, no over-extended action sequences (or at least no more than necessary). The focus is mainly on two attractive and likable characters coming to know and accept one another throughout the course of their adventures.<br/><br/>The adventure begins when Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), who has just turned eighteen, decides she wants to leave the castle in which she's been locked away by an old crone posing as her mother - it turns out Rapunzel's hair confers eternal youth on anyone who touches it - in order to experience what life is like in the outside world. Rapunzel finally gets her wish when the thief, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) - who's fleeing the law and the two cohorts he's just betrayed - attempts to hide in her tower, which he assumes is empty. However, he gets more than he bargained for when he meets this naïve but feisty young woman who sees him as the opportunity for escape she's been pining for all these years. So off they go to see the world, with many an unexpected adventure awaiting them along the way.<br/><br/>""Tangled"" is a little more deliberately paced than the typical kids' flick – indeed it takes a full half-hour before we even get outside the tower room – and the scenes run a little longer than usual, as Rapunzel and Flynn take the time to establish a relationship of mutual respect and trust. The humor is gentle and the tone sweet, yet there is just the right amount of starch in the characters of the crone (nicely voiced by Donna Murphy) and Flynn's aggrieved criminal cohorts to keep things from getting too sappy. The soft-focus backgrounds provide an appropriately comfy setting for the tale, and the musical numbers (by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater) have an appealing Broadway show-tune brassiness to them that lifts the audience's spirits.<br/><br/>As written by Dan Fogelman and directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, ""Tangled"" doesn't come sailing out of the wings, as so many similar recent films have done, trying to impress us with its postmodern revisionism and cynical self-awareness. It tweaks some of the elements of the classic Fairy Tale genre to be sure, but it also acknowledges and respects those elements. It really isn't in the business of tearing things down just so it can congratulate itself on its own iconoclasm and irreverence. And I, for one, am tremendously grateful for that."
"Elswet","6","3","12","26 December 2010"," Mediocre
","I liked this work more than I did Disney's previous princess movie The Princess and the Frog, but only just. Tangled does not have what it takes to be an ""instant classic,"" nor does it have enough quality content to become an eventual one. There are too many pop culture references, herein. It breaks the spell woven by the medieval setting and trappings, and leaves its viewer feeling unsettled and (if they are an older Disney fan) rather melancholy for the older pre-computerized hand-drawn animations like Snow White and Bambi. Ah, the details in THOSE films! But not in this one. Now I'm no elitist. I love Cars, and Finding Nemo, so I am not anti-CG. I am anti-lazy artists who pay no attention to detail, backgrounds, props, and settings. I am anti-lazy animators who really believe that four lines make a face, six lines make a horse, and shading and shadows are unnecessary evils.<br/><br/>It was unremarkable, but not bad. It was mediocre for its lack of anything resembling heart.<br/><br/>It rates a 5.7/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"aharmas","5","6","36","11 December 2010"," A Bit Off
","When ""The Princess and The Frog"" came out, we rejoiced because old fashioned animation, a strong storyline, a different yet strong heroine, and some very funny moments had all worked well to give us a new classic. It was indeed a very good movie, with marvelous music numbers and gorgeous animation.<br/><br/>This year, the animation, with the help of more sophisticated computers, has achieved new heights, creating a softer, more natural look, to resemble old fashioned artwork. The problem is that the other elements are not up to the technical standards. We have rather bland vocal entries in most of the leading performances, and both the music and the storyline could have been much better.<br/><br/>As it is the case in most of the films we see nowadays there is strong emphasis on coming up with ""potentially good ideas"", yet their development somehow comes short. Here our heroine's dreams, which we sympathize with, draw us into her world, and we can't help but admire the simple but strong young woman who tries to break herself free from the only world she knows. To get there, she is assisted by a dashing young man, who must learn to grow up as well.<br/><br/>While as the heroines of recent animated stories, all have assertive and independent personalities, mostly based on their embracing knowledge through books (""Beauty and The Beast""), poor bravado and curiosity (""The Little Mermaid""), or the aspiring chef of ""The Princess and The Frog"". Those characters mesmerized us, with the help of clever, intelligent lyrics, and hummable melodies. ""Tangled"" can't compete in either department, as the very simplistic, underdeveloped characters are poorly served by the pedestrian lyrics.<br/><br/>There are a couple of magic moments in the film, but even those feel forced, as part of a design, not of a fully realized work. Nothing here can match the anxiety and sadness of the furnace scene in ""Toy Story"", the wonder of the birth of love in ""Beauty and The Beast"" or witnessing mortality in ""Up"". Animation has grown so much recently; it's hard to feel satisfied by efforts like this film."

","""Tangled"" is a fine movie. In some ways fantastic. Visually it's gorgeous. Animation top notch as expected. Maximus the horse is a riot, and Rapunzel is a great character with whom I relate and sympathize.<br/><br/>Flynn on the other hand is the movie's weakest link. I can't take him seriously as a scoundrel because he's just a Joey from ""Friends"" and everything he says & does is for laughs which is exactly what I'd want from a tertiary character like the horse. His change of heart is predictable but unconvincing, because he NEVER WAS convincing.<br/><br/>The Mother is just annoying. Evil great! But she belittle's Rapunzel, to the point that I'd expect Rapunzel to leave the tower out of sheer spite. A captor like Madame Medusa, Cinderella's step mother or Judge Claude Frollo could give lessons on keeping a captive while acting benevolent.<br/><br/>And what's with that stupid flower song? It's a magic flower, one of a kind apparently that no one knows about, except an old lady who found it by accident, fine. But who taught the flower to do its magic after a VERY specific jingle, and who taught it to the old lady? An enchanted flower could do that, but this flower is a freak natural occurrence. And when the Queen fell ill, everyone went in search of a miracle and somehow knew it was magic flower tea from an uncatalogued plant? Fix that story! I could forgive the origin if that stupid jingle weren't a persistent thing.<br/><br/>Lastly, they play their best song (""When Will My Life Begin?"") at the beginning. Really, it's excellent! And they know it. Despite the Best Original Song Academy Award going to ""I See the Light."" What song gets reprised in the movie, as well as played on the DVD's main menu? It's ""When Will My Life Begin."" 'Cause it's the good song. ""See the Light"" isn't bad, but it's no ""Kiss the Girl"" and ""Mother knows Best"" & ""I have a dream"" are just hokey."
"Kane20","9","1","3","31 August 2012"," Review - Tangled
","I loved Disney when I was a kid. After the blue and white Disney logo (which has been changed since then), I would sit back and enjoy adventure, fantasy, castles, romance, sword fights, songs, magic spells, talking animals, and...well, you get the idea! I used to watch and re-watch several of their animated films. I have to admit, even now that I'm no longer a Disney lover, I still have to admit that I still consider many of their old animated films (including the ones I've listed above) to be good. In fact, I've given many of these films either three, three-and-a-half, or four star ratings. Nowadays, the only animated Disney films I've really been interested in have been Pixar films. But I have to admit, I really enjoyed Tangled, which I saw for the first time last week.<br/><br/>At the beginning, a queen is gravely ill, but is cured by the powers of a magic flower. Soon afterward, she bears a baby girl, Rapunzel, who actually inherits the magic flower's powers. However, baby Princess Rapunzel is kidnapped in the middle of the night by Mother Gothel, who wants to stay young via the magic healing powers within Rapunzel's hair, so she raises Rapunzel in a tower. Now a teenager, Rapunzel's hair is extremely long, and she has spent her entire life in the tower, and is curious about the outside world. One day, a thief named Flynn Rider, who is on the run, scales the tower and hides inside, and is taken captive by Rapunzel. She hides the tiara he has recently stolen and agrees to give it back only if he takes her to the place where the floating lights appear on her birthday each year. On this journey, she truly discovers the outside world, and, eventually, who she really is.<br/><br/>The story isn't original, and it's a bit predictable, but that's not a problem at all. Besides, this is true for many of Disney's animated films. But it's a good story, and Disney takes it and applies unique and memorable elements and charm to it, and some songs too. Disney even draws ideas and elements from some of its previous films. I think it's safe to say that Tangled is a mix of past and present in terms of Disney. It contains a lot of old Disney-type elements, formats, and methods of storytelling among other things, but with the application of modern CGI animation, and some other modern elements.<br/><br/>I was expecting this film to be geared more towards kids, but it's actually a good film for anyone. It is very much a family movie. Sure, there are some kid-oriented elements, and some slapstick humor that the kids would enjoy, but there are also things that adults would appreciate; even the more childish elements I just mentioned are not so extreme, and are perfectly enjoyable for adults. The film has a lot of good humor, but it also has a good sense of character, story, depth, and emotion. The characters are not flat, but are actually very good, and so are the relationships between them. The characters are truly lovable, especially Flynn and Rapunzel (and of these two, especially the latter), and offer genuine emotion. Their attitudes and personalities contain both older and modern elements. There are even a couple of hilarious sidekicks - a chameleon named Pascal and a horse named Maximus (my favorite of which was the latter).<br/><br/>CGI technology and effects have progressed even further since this film came out, but still, the animation in this film is beautiful. Everything is well designed, and with great detail and scope - the characters, the scenery, Rapunzel's hair...everything. And this animation is not just eye candy - it's used wisely, and it actually works well with the script and helps with the emotion and narrative, like it's supposed to. The film offers some very memorable things (characters, scenes, images, and much more) including a truly unforgettable, visually beautiful, and emotionally powerful scene involving floating lanterns.<br/><br/>The voice actors all put on good performances, especially Mandy Moore as Rapunzel. They all really bring their characters to life. The music in this film is good, both the songs and the standard underscore. The songs could have been better, but they are pretty good and perfectly enjoyable as they are, especially ""When Will My Life Begin?"" (sung by Rapunzel about five minutes into the film) and ""I See the Light"" (sung by Rapunzel and Flynn during the lantern scene I mentioned in the last paragraph). I really have to give the filmmakers a major thumbs up for Rapunzel herself. She is very well designed (especially her hair), and is absolutely beautiful. And not only that, she is hot. Her personality and liveliness are very attractive as well, and she really captures the heart. She and Flynn are great together, and their romantic relationship is handled very well - it's not corny, it's actually charming and emotional (and, yes, with bits of humor here and there).<br/><br/>The film is good as it is, but it still could have been better. The one criticism I do have is that there are some things about the story and characters, especially in the third act, that I think could have been handled better and given more depth, and should have involved more character complexity. However, despite this, the film works, and it does have a pretty good sense of depth, character, humor, and emotion as it is. It combines and balances all of its elements pretty well. You laugh when you're supposed to, cry when you're supposed to, etc.<br/><br/>Overall, Tangled isn't great, but it's good, and, in my opinion, one of the best Disney animated features in years. It's funny, charming, clever, witty, solid, and full of heart and soul, and I'm actually considering buying the DVD.<br/><br/>My Rating: ***1/2 (out of****)"
"michaelRokeefe","7","1","3","21 January 2012"," Disney takes on the Grimm Brothers.
","A pleasant animated feature from Disney takes on the Grimm Brothers' tale of a lost princess secluded in a tower most of her life. Rapunzel(Mandy Moore)is a beautiful princess with extraordinary long magical hair. Rapunzel's evil step-mother Gothel(Donna Murphy)needs the rejuvenating powers of her hair to remain young; so she locks the beauty away in a tower. The story progresses with a bandit, Flynn Rider(Zachery Levi), on the run discovering Rapunzel. The smitten thief is willing to sweep her away to see the real world for the very first time. Mother Gothel in her fear of aging plots to recapture Rapunzel thus ending the romance with her rescuer. Since most Disney animated features are based on fairy tales, you can pretty well count on a happy ending. Super CGI places Rapunzel in the company of timeless classics like SNOW WHITE and SLEEPING BEAUTY. Disney never disappoints.Other voices you may recognize: Brad Garrett, Jeffrey Tambor and Ron Perlman."
"picaresk","9","1","3","14 December 2011"," Back to the Core of Fairy tales
","Unlike many fairytale animations of today, Tangled manages to go back to the deep roots of fairy tales. The mother-daughter relationship between Rapunzel and the witch, and the naiveté of the Rapunzel during her years in the tower is dark and eerie in rudimentary levels. Unlike bogeys, monsters and exaggerated evils, it touches to an inexpressible cord inside us. But that darkness doesn't make you feel depressed as well, as the goodness (even in Gothel to some extent), the sunshine of the tower's pretty dweller and her positive spirit reflected on the life and decoration of the tower balances it.<br/><br/>Fairy tales indeed touch to the very deep cores of humanity, family relations, the boundaries of childhood, pain of growing up, the good and evil.. that's why they survived for centuries. Tangled is more successful in delivering the true soul of a fairytale than many animated adaptations, especially in the first part.<br/><br/>The tower and its hidden small valley is quite atmospheric; and all the other settings are well designed. They deliver the feeling of a fairytale and an ageless style well. Rapunzel is a very likable heroine. The film also has a fun but forgettable bunch of side characters like a horse with exceptional mimics and a surprising Eros."
"alianamreyes","9","1","3","27 November 2011"," Tangled - Humanistic Approach
","Tangled (2010) was an amazing movie to watch. I have recommended it to every one of my friends. As a person who has practically lived through all of Disney's princess movies, though the hand drawn classics have finally met their match with this CGI movie. Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, the directors of Tangled (2010), sure knew how to create a spunky princess based off of the Grimm Brother's classic fairy tail Rapunzel. Like every Disney movie before it, Tangled posed a splendid point of view on modern day thoughts, mainly teenage thoughts.<br/><br/>Any teenager could relate to Rapunzel's comedic moments after she leaves the tower. Going back and forth between the happiness of being free and independent, then switches to a scared girl who fears her mother's wrath. This moment could let one reminisce about the first time they ever opposed their parents, or tried to break the rules. Though unlike us, this spunky teenager was held in a castle all her life and just wanted to see floating lanterns for her birthday. I'd hope a witch hasn't locked up most of you reading this! If so, I hope Flynn Rider comes to your rescue as he tries to hide his stolen loot in your tower. Remember, always keep a frying pan in hand!<br/><br/>This movie states the reality of how adolescence is. As a teen, I can personally relate to Rapunzel's naivety of the outside world and fears of venturing out. But like Rapunzel, adventures allow people to grow and harness their independence. Yes, some of us may not actually find ourselves to be royalty at the end of the day, but we all are able to find our strengths. Disney portrays this part of life creatively with comedy, adventure, and love.<br/><br/>The CGI and 3D only added to this amazing work of art. I have watched this movie so many times, but every viewing feels like my first time in the theaters. Though I do sing along to the fantastic soundtrack."
"ajs-10","Null","1","3","28 October 2011"," Animated fun from those Disney guys Better than I was expecting!... :)
","I thought I'd start my day off with something easy to watch, given a bit of a rough head this morning. Checking what I had recorded, I decided the one that would be easiest on the grey matter was 'Tangled'. I was right I was also delighted with my choice! Nothing like as bad as I was expecting, although it wasn't perfect, Disney have come a long way in the last few years and appear to be on the right track to producing something really great in the next few years. But enough of my nonsense for now More after this very brief summary.<br/><br/>Having been kidnapped by Mother Gothel as a baby, Rapunzel is kept away from the world in a hidden tower. The only way in or out is to climb up her long golden hair. It is her magical hair that holds the secret to why Mother Gothel stole Rapunzel away but I'm not going to tell you about that here. Just as Rapunzel is about to turn eighteen, a man, Flynn Rider climbs the tower trying to evade some palace guards who are chasing him. He has stolen something from the palace and they want it back. Each year on her birthday the sky is filled with magical lanterns and Rapunzel wants more than anything to go and see them. But Mother Gothel has made her afraid to go outside. Can she persuade Flynn to take her to see the lanterns and, more importantly, can she overcome her fears of the outside world. I think that's enough to whet your appetite for now don't want the Spoiler Police chasing me down and throwing me in a dungeon again.<br/><br/>Beautifully animated with some really great songs (& some not quite so great) to take you along the journey. This is a really well made family film with some really nice touches. The voice talents of Mandy Moore as Rapunzel and Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider were both excellent. I thought Donna Murphy played the evil Mother Gothel very well, particularly the songs. Honourable mentions go to the voice talents of; Ron Perlman as Stabbington Brother, M.C. Gainey as Captain of the Guard, Jeffrey Tambor as Big Nose Thug, Brad Garrett as Hook Hand Thug, Paul F. Tompkins as Short Thug and Richard Kiel as Vlad.<br/><br/>The comic relief was supplied by a horse, Maximus and a chameleon, Pascal. There is also a band of thugs who help the unlikely pair on their journey; they have the best musical number in the show (IMO). In fact, this film did have the ring of an old fashioned musical about it and I must admit, I did enjoy that aspect of it. On the down side, I thought everyone looked a little bit too 'Disney cute' for my liking. The eyes way too big and the waistlines way too thin it doesn't look right (to me) I'm afraid. That aside, I did enjoy this film (in 2D) though Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 7.7/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 60,662 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 89/100 (based on 179 reviews counted at the time of going to press)."
"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","1","3","24 August 2011"," Pretty film smothered in boring music
","I reeeeaaally like animation. Although I love the old hand-drawn cartoons of old, I do enjoy the modern marvel of CGI animated films. I had little desire to see Tangled in theaters, especially considering it's Disney but not Pixar. However with all the great reviews and the Oscar nominated film from the typically awesome Alan Menken, I figured I should review the DVD when it came out.<br/><br/>The move has a beautiful opening that has a very different retelling of the start of the story from the original Grimm tale. Original: Man's pregnant wife is dying to have some lettuce and drives him to steal from a magical garden woman who then takes their child when it is born. Disney: Queen is dying of having a baby (sort of similar) and needs a magical plant to survive. Just happens to be the witch's fountain of youth plant, so she steals the baby in vengeance. Pregnant women, guys – am I right? Huh? High five.<br/><br/>So anyhoo, from there the movie goes typical Disney – grotesque side characters, funny/cute animals, and beautiful pop-talented singer leads. I am happy to see Zack Morris getting work as the male lead here. Or maybe just his hair. The story never really takes off into any kind of high drama like you got in days of old with Snow White, Sleeping Beauty (freakin' crap, that dragon scared me as a kid), or even The Incredibles. Sort of an ""oh, that could be bad"" with an ""oh, that resolved painlessly.""<br/><br/>The film had it's fun moments, but the songs weren't any of them. I think this would appeal way more to adults if the songs were catchy, as in Aladin. That said the action, animation, and story are perfect for the kidlins who might like a good fairy tale. It even has a great moral: you can never have a happy ending without being very wealthy and powerful. Also, kids, you can get a great layered cut with just one swipe from a broken mirror shard! Try it at home!<br/><br/>On a positive note, we did get a great Nick Pitera cover of ""I See the Light.""<br/><br/>This film would have been a strong B-range contender were in not for the plentiful sprinkling of boring songs."
"duckifer","Null","1","3","18 August 2011"," Healthy Relationship?! Disney?!
","If you have experienced abuse, been taken advantage of--this movie speaks to the experience of recovery and breaking free, and provides a template that is authentic and hopeful. Surprisingly so, for a kids movie. I suppose each viewer brings their own baggage to the viewing, but I have always felt being a child is a lot darker and more painful than us adults like to believe. Very few films have room for darkness or represent themes that give children templates for coping with the darkness in a healthy way. So often the films end up telling us if you just get pretty fast (via Cinderella) and wait, someone will save you from the darkness. That power dynamic can create really unhealthy relationships, and I would suggest that many people search for that fantasy, instead of searching for a relationship that is more equal, more giving and taking.<br/><br/>This movie offered a surprisingly healthy model of a relationship to kids. Each person was given depth and feeling. Sometimes Rapunzel saved the day, sometimes Flynn, it didn't feel uneven. But what got me was Rapunzel's assertiveness in communicating what she wanted, her confidence in her perspective (innocent and naive as it was). When she put her innocence out there, took the risk, she was given back wonderful things. She is completely in line with her gut. I love the scene in the tavern. By naming her dream and being authentic, she inspired authenticity and emotion in all these tough guys...No game, no pretense, her realness inspired others to be real, and that realness inspired intimacy between her and Flynn. And through that intimacy they fell in love. There are very few children's movies that look at relationships that way.<br/><br/>Rapunzel had a lot of baggage (never having left the tower, magic hair, crazy mother). But every time she claimed it, put it out there, it didn't scare Flynn off or cause a meltdown. It added dimension to the way he knew her.<br/><br/>I just never see this stuff in kid's movies, and it totally impressed me. So though I have a lot of cynicism towards Disney as a company/corp. I am still able to see this movie and find really important messages in the subtext. Yay! This is NOT Ariel who had to give up her voice to find love, or Aurora who had no personality but great hair. Rapunzel has dimension."
"nickmesafilms","8","1","3","18 August 2011"," Tangled (2010) - Rapunzel, Let Down Your Hair! Flynn Rider, Bring Out the Smolder!
","Walt Disney Pictures releases their 50th animated feature film, retelling the classic story of the Rapunzel fairy tale. ""Tangled"" tells the story of a thief named Flynn Rider, and a girl with long and magical hair named Rapunzel. The story involves Rapunzel finally experiencing the outside world for the first time, after her years of being trapped in captive by Mother Gothel, who uses her hair to keep her healthy. Now along the way, besides getting hit with a frying pan and a brave horse named Maximus, the moral to the story is freedom, true love, and bravery. The movie is provided with an amazing script by Dan Fogelman who helped bring a precious childhood memory of those classic Disney flicks, and it was like telling a new fairy tale from the storytelling book. The casting ensemble of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, and Donna Murphy was all super excellent, and brought a lot of comedy, drama, and romance. And let's not forget the incredible music provided by Alan Menken, who made the score into a whimsical musical that is really special to enjoy. Some moments made you laugh, some moments made you cry, and the movie made you feel like a kid in your heart. As I said before, the music is wonderful, the characters are brilliant, the love scenes are beautiful, and the finale blends the perfect taste of comedy and drama, as a perfect way to end another Disney storybook tale. ""Tangled"", in my review, ""a charming, and heartwarming storybook tale""."
"dfranzen70","9","1","3","14 August 2011"," Another charming Disney film
","Tangled is as elegant and exciting as old-school Disney features get. It has the music, it has the charm, and it has the helpful nonhuman acting as the protagonist's conscience. It's also gorgeously animated, with a simple plot that hearkens back to the studio's golden age while maintaining the ability to capture the imagination and attention of today's kids (and adults).<br/><br/>True fact: this movie was originally supposed to be called ""Rapunzel,"" but execs at Disney figured that wouldn't appeal much to little boys (they'd made a mistake, the thinking went, with an earlier feature, The Princess and the Frog). Thus the title change.<br/><br/>So you know the story of Rapunzel, right? Cute lass, trapped up in a tower, had long hair, etc.? Same basic idea here, only Rapunzel is secretly - not a spoiler - the lost princess of the kingdom, spirited away as an infant by an evil crone; seems Rapunzel's hair is not only long but magical as all get out, and the old crone has been able to use the hair - and the girl's song - to retain her youth.<br/><br/>Every year on the princess's birthday, the still-mourning kingdom releases hundreds of lanterns into the sky, hoping that somehow their lost child will find her way home. And every year, Rapunzel sees these lanterns and wonders about their source - could they have anything to do with her, since they appear only on her birthday? Enter Flynn Rider (har har), a thief on the run from that very same kingdom for, you know, thieving. Anyway, he runs into Rapunzel, and they make a pact - he takes her to see where the lanterns come from, and she'll return to him the crown that he had just stolen from aforementioned kingdom but she took from him after whacking him on the head with a frying pan. You know, standard Disney fairy-tale stuff.<br/><br/>For the most part, the movie is just plain funny. It's about dreams and hopes and how you shouldn't let go of either, even in the face of defeat. And that's a great message, sure. But it helps that Rapunzel and Flynn are aptly cast (respectively, the known Mandy Moore and the unknown Zachery Levi) and that each isn't just a caricature. There's a lot of whimsy to go along with the derring-do, a word that's just not used enough nowadays. (Derring-do, not whimsy.) And yes, it has plenty of heart. It has all the hallmarks of a Disney movie without the debit of latter-day stunt casting. It focuses itself on Rapunzel and Flynn working together to allow the former to realize her dream. Because there are not distinctly comical figures in the movie, the humor simply evolves; it's not forced or distracting. Side note, though - one of the best characters in the film is Maximus the horse; he's at odds with Flynn (trying to capture him, as a horse of the palace) and likes Rapunzel, and he has more personality and expressiveness than most of the humans."

Well I say didn't like it but actually I mean it was my least favourite part and that was the opening It's not a bad opening but it's just a bit slow compared to the rest of the film but I don't think they could of done it any better. Exposition is never fun. The film really comes into it's own though with the introduction of Flynn voiced by Zachary Levi after that the film is brilliant till the end. Okay there are a lot of singing through the film but it's not as annoying as you'd think. Great voice work by all involved especially the two leads Zachary Levi and Mandy Moore.

Tangled is a new twist on the age old fairy tale of Rapunzel. The film stars both Rapunzel and Flynn Rider, who is a daring thief. He stumbles upon her tower, and by chance, must guide her through the dangerous world to see the annual lantern festival. The film is full of humor, romance, and even danger and drama. It does a very good job at pacing and balancing each of parts of the movie, and the audience never gets bored while watching.

","Tangled, Disney's newest Princess fairy tale is based on the classic Rapunzel story. You know, the girl with the long hair, trapped in the tower? Tangled stars Mandy Moore, who has a voice like an angel. She is brave but shy because she's never stepped foot out of her tower. Zachery Levi, as the male lead, Flynn Rider, is no Prince Charming. He's a scamp, even a thief! But that's what makes him interesting.<br/><br/>I love all the fabulous new songs by the great Alan Menken, who created the musical magic of ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Enchanted,"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" along with many other Disney classics. The movie starts with ""When Will My Life Begin,"" a sing-a-long song that really gets you going. It tells how Rapunzel is frightened of the real world but excited to give it a try. The song ""Mother Knows Best"" sets the stage for the horrible tangle Rapunzel finds herself in. She wants to obey her mother, but her heart tells her to follow her dream, even if it leads to trouble.<br/><br/>I give this movie five-out-of-five stars, and recommend it for all ages. My Dad didn't think he'd like it, but he was smiling all the way through. (I think he saw a little of himself in that rascal Flynn Rider).

"amberwydell","9","1","3","25 June 2011"," Tangled
","Tangled is a suitable movie for any ages, but I recommend it more to children 5-12 years of age. Though it is a childish and quite predictable story line obviously wrote to suit younger viewers, I never quite found myself bored, and was quite drawn into it. I must admit that the movie picked up more pace when Flynn Rider was introduced, but I find this no means to label him as a more like able character to Rapunzel, because the movie really got going when the two met and were thrown together. I defiantly agree that the bonus characters like Pascal the chameleon who spends most of his time perched on Rapunzel's shoulder and lighting up the movie with his facial expressions, and of course Maximus, a horse who is determined to see Flynn Rider, most wanted, behind bars, are necessary. The songs may not suit all viewers, they most certainly don't let the movie down. Tangled is a breathe of fresh air and reminds me of the classic Disney Princess movies, the only difference is that i find that anyone can happily sit down and enjoy this movie. I defiantly recommend this movie, a great film to sit down and watch with the family, and defiantly a movie you can watch more than once."

"iReviewFilms","8","1","3","19 May 2011"," Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Tangled
","It has been well over 10 years since the Walt Disney Animation Studios branch of Disney has had anything to shout home about as they have struggled to live up to their past successes (Lion King, Aladdin all the way back to Snow White in 1937) and compete with the modern animations of it's sister company Disney Pixar.<br/><br/>Tangled is based on the Brothers Grimm story of Rapunzel (the film's title was only changed from Rapunzel shortly prior to its release) who as traditional tales go was locked away in a tower with only her long flowing hair as a chance of rescue. As a baby, Princess Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) is kidnapped by Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) from the palace for her magical healing powers that have been passed onto her. Locked away in a tall tower and believing she's Gothel's daughter, she longs only for one thing- to get out into the world and see the floating lights that appear every year on her birthday.<br/><br/>As luck would have it Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi), a thief, finds his way into her tower when hiding from the palace guard and Rapunzel fearing he is one of the evil monsters her mother has warned her about knocks him out. When he comes to she strikes up a deal that in exchange for him escorting her to see the lights and keep her safe, she will let him go and return his stolen loot.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is the characters and their mannerisms. Gothel is vanity personified with snide remarks aimed at Rapunzel, Ryder the perfect amount of cockiness and all of the token extras play their part well. My two favourite though say absolutely nothing and easily steal the show. Both the chameleon (Rapunzel's best friend) and a guard's horse, Maximus are fantastic. Seeing a horse which acts more like a dog got me going but this was topped by the chameleon who seemed to have an expression that summed up the mood perfectly every time. A little legend! In terms of graphics, they are some of the best I have seen in an animation with the detail in her hair in particular being most impressive. But then this should be expected as Tangled does now hold the record for most expensive animation and second most expensive film ever made coming in at a noteworthy £157.5 ($260) million.<br/><br/>As with all Disney, there was a couple of sing-a-longs thrown in for good measure and although they will not live long into the memory in the way that others have, (hakuna matata anyone?) they were still catchy and you will find yourself tapping along or humming a tune or two for a while after the movie has finished.<br/><br/>This movie got me laughing and even having watched it a second time I was still giggling away throughout. It works for both adults and children and the witty way in which it was written appealed to me greatly. I will happily be watching this again so it has most definitely worked its Disney magic on me. Disney might well be back!!!<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"
"DemiRonin","7","1","3","16 May 2011"," Tangled may not quite be on par with the Disney classics of late 80s/90s but there's plenty of magic in Rapunzel's hair for most believers.
","Once upon a time there lived a selfish woman named Gothel who found a flower which returned her youth. She kept it a secret and told no one its location. When princess Rapunzel was still in the womb her mother became very sick. In order to save the queen and Rapunzel a search was called to find the magical flower. The magical flower was found and Rapunzel was saved but Gothel had lost her fountain of youth. The flower had transfered all its magic to Rapunzel's hair which could heal wounds and reverse aging. <br/><br/>In order to regain her fountain of youth Gothel kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own. Gothel keeps her locked away in a tower and tells Rapunzel never to leave. She also never cuts Rapunzel's hair, for when it is cut it loses its powers. On Rapunzel's 18th birthday Rapunzel requests to leave her tower and go see the lights that have been appearing in the sky annual on her birthday. When Gothel refuses Rapunzel blackmails a thief named Flynn to be her guide and protector on a journey to the lights. Flynn begrudgingly agrees and the two start off on adventure with Gothel, henchmen and the royal guards all trying to stop them. <br/><br/>The animation is Tangled is good and the characters are well rounded if a little stereotypical. Rapunzel is pretty much the same girl you've seen in most children's film nowadays. She's beautiful, insecure at times but also fairly courageous. Equipped with a frying pan to defend herself Rapunzel also uses her long hair to great effect, using it as rope swinging from cliff to cliff and tying up bad guys. Flynn is the charming thief who learns there's more to life than image and wealth and Gothel is a pretty good evil step mother with a few shortcomings. <br/><br/>The jokes in Tangled are great, with characters making fun of the many of the exaggerated elements of fairy tales and the adventure is quiet charming. The songs are good but not classic and the side characters are fun, consisting of a chameleon and a horse that acts more like a dog. <br/><br/>However Tangled falls short in the last third of the film. It's not that the end of the film is bad in anyway but it's just not amazing or terribly clever. It might just be that audiences have gotten so inundated with fairy tales that they know the endings to most movies. The evil step mother, without any special powers of her own, is not a quiet as scary as let's say Ursula from The Little Mermaid. The only thing that Gothel can do is scheme and wield a dagger. Her schemes are good but Gothel just doesn't have enough of a screen presence to make the film scary, which those old Disney films had. The ending ties up a little too cleanly, at least for me. Also the horse Maximus which in the beginning wants nothing more than to apprehend Flynn switches sides rather dramatically which was a bit unbelievable. <br/><br/>Tangled is a bunch of fun and it's the closest Disney has gotten to bringing back their golden age of animation.<br/><br/>Who this film is not for:<br/><br/>-People who never liked the old Disney movies: Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin etc."
"danielle_caylor","8","1","3","16 May 2011"," Interesting Villain, Wonderful Movie
","What I love about this movie is actually the villain. While many villains are pretty cut and dry evil, I don't believe this applies to Mother Gothel. Yes, she is selfish and kidnapping the Princess automatically sends her into the bad person category, yet it isn't all bad. She raises Rapunzel in a nice and cheery looking home, she buys her things she enjoys (paints, books, pottery clay, etc.), and shows her some affection (she says she loves her, hugs her). Even her reasons for keeping Rapunzel in the tower are not a complete lie for there would be people that would be after Rapunzel for her gift. Now, I'm not defending Mother Gothel by any means, I just find her interesting. Plus, let's face it, there are worse real mothers in the world!<br/><br/>There are other things that make this movie the best that Disney has come out with in ages. The sidekick characters are hilarious and my daughter always laughs at Max's antics. I love the music as well. I even added ""Mother Knows Best"" as one of my ring tones. Overall, this is a fantastic movie that will find itself on the list of Disney classics along with ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Little Mermaid"", ""Cinderella"", and ""Sleeping Beauty""."

"FairlyAnonymous","9","1","3","14 May 2011"," A real surprise, and now one of my favorite animated movies
","Here is the thing about me. If there is a movie I really like I get depressed after I watch it, because I miss the movie already. This has only happened to me with the movie Avatar, How to Train Your Dragon, and Tangled. The movie has very likable characters which is what makes the movie so good.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful, and very fluid. I was surprised how the movie feels more like a traditional hand drawn movie, than a CGI one. The hair in this movie does flow very nice, and it cool to watch. I love the way how smooth characters move, such as how Rapunzel seems to constantly be moving. Also Rapunzel's fake mom also walks very realistically, and sometimes moves very snake like. The animation sometimes is very detailed, while other times it messes up a bit, but this is rarely distracting.<br/><br/>But animation isn't the main thing that makes Tangled good. The characters are very likable. Usually horse characters are pretty standard, and aren't there except for comedy relief. This horse was actually interesting, and was funny at how unbelievable aggressive he was. Flynn Rider was pretty good as well, and a lot of his lines were humorous. Rapunzel is very energetic, and constantly doing everything possible. Pascal or whatever the chameleon's name is, was a pretty nice silent animal. You could tell what he was saying through his color, and his eye movement. Also his face expressions were pretty good. A nice thing about this movie is that it doesn't distract from the main characters with too many side characters. This means you get to know the main characters really well.<br/><br/>While some people complained about the villain in this movie, I honestly liked her more than the original tales version, because in this version she seemed to be evil, yet she was also nice at the same time. The movie does well at making its own story out of Rapunzel, and the plot does seem to flow together very well.<br/><br/>All in all a must watch movie for fans of Disney. I think that Disney needs to make more movies like this where it is CGI yet feels like a traditional animated movie, because I don't think they could've done this movie in 2D and make it as good."

"gogul1","9","1","3","2 March 2011"," A Disney classic to rival loin king, mermaid and beast.
","The first thing to say about this movie is that it IS Disney. It is clear that it was originally intended to be traditional 2D Disney animation. Sadly since Pixar has been on the scene the 2D animation department has struggled to keep up with their new rebellious little step brother in terms of story and, indeed - success. Rapunzel was never the most exciting fairy tale ever which is why it has taken so long to use it as a basis for a film. Luckily the writers have done a sterling job at making sense of the whole tale, giving a reason for her to be in the tower and a use for having such long hair etc Then it was taken over and the decision was made to make it a CG 3D movie. And I should say, it's about time. Disney have tried in the past with limited success without Pixar showing them the way. Bolt and Meet the Robinsons were both very OK films but struggled to have that special""something"" to make people endear to them. They lacked the ""heart"" of Disney's beloved classics. Tangled takes the tradition of 2D classics and puts them into a nice looking CG 3D package. The result is the best film Disney has done in an age and lays a foundation for a bright new future. Let's now talk about the film. It's musical, very musical with lots of sing songs and dancing. Problem? It wasn't for Beast or Lion King so it's not a problem here. It's funny, sharp witted, warm and scary in equal measures. It has small characters like the chameleon, maximus the horse and the old drunk in the Snuggly Duckling pub that makes you instantly like them as well as the main characters. Rapunzel and Flynn are entertaining and their relationship is as good as Belle and the Beast's in terms of believability. The main bug bear I have with this film is that it may kill 2D features completely. Why would Disney go back if they can now make great films this way? All I know is that Pixar better beware, they are very established now and can run the risk of becoming fomulaic with Disney taking up the slack and moving back out in front again. (CARS 2 and MONSTERS INC 2 suggests that Pixar may be running low on steam). Here's hoping the next one is even half as good... P.S. go watch it."
"d_art","9","1","3","17 December 2010"," Visually flawless 'Tangled' gets nearly everything right.
","Tangled is the latest Disney animation that flawlessly captures the whole ""Disney Princess"" genre from its traditional cell animation in full computer graphics (also shown in stereoscopic 3-D format). In this retelling of the Rapunzel story, Princess Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) is kidnapped from the palace as a baby by Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and raised as her own due to Rapunzel's magical hair. Rapunzel has since been imprisoned in a tower until her 18th birthday, when she strikes a deal with a bandit named Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi) to escape and see up close the strange floating lights that she sees every year on her birthday from her tower. Meanwhile, Gothel, a group of bandits, and the King's guards are in hot pursuit.<br/><br/>Finally Disney nearly gets everything right. Almost. Visually, this film is right up there with Pixar's workactually, it even manages to surpass in that arena. This is saying A LOT. Still, the real strength of Pixar's work is how each of their films all work as a whole package, hanging on the strength of its storytelling, characterization, and high concept. It is in these last three points that Disney's Tangled comes very close but not quite reach, yet, that's understandable given that it's based on a well-known fairy tale, and let's face it, when it comes to Disney animation, it has certain rules--repetitive ones at that. There's the recurring cute non-speaking sidekick, the music numbers, the evil stepmother, and couple other rules which will become clear when you see it. Their concept and stories are quite similar to each other, but Tangled does make some novel changes that work well quite dramatically and humorously. The characters have a modern edge to them that makes them fun, yet not derivative. The visual jokes are quite sophisticated and the film never overdoes it.<br/><br/>The characters all closely mimic the traditional 2-D Disney character style. Rapunzel beautifully shines in this film. Her expressions, the facial structure, the cute nose, the perfect skin tones, and the big eyes look amazingly alive. The movements of her and all the characters here are spot on. They move just like 2-D animation, yet realistically. The action scenes are breath-taking. I could just watch Rapunzel move around and simply be amazed at the artistry. Likewise, Flynn Ryder and Mother Gothel are well-crafted, humorously and carefully animated. However, if there was one character that steals the show every moment that he appears on screen, that would have to be a certain horse named Maximus. Truly, if there's an Oscar for a CG character, he'd win hands down. If I ever meet the guy who animated this character, I'd love to shake his hand.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore is flawless as the voice of Rapunzel. I really can't add anything else to say without being redundant. Zachary Levi brings much personality and fun as Flynn Ryder with his expressive voice and perfect timing, which sound strangely like Steve Carell. Yeah, try listening to him with your eyes closed and tell me if you disagree.<br/><br/>Now, the film is not without some flaws. The music numbers can be a tad distracting—admittedly, they weren't particularly memorable. The film would have been just fine without them, but they're not bad. Second, there's a rather predicable nature in the way this film follows a common, worn Disney formula—it's hard to elaborate without spoilers. There's also an underlying meanness in this film that Pixar films tend not to have (yet Pixar films manage to be more mature and thought-provoking than many live-action films). This film is here to entertain and in that way, it succeeds. Disney films are meant to make you want to believe in love and magic, not heady subjects like family relations (Finding Nemo, Incredibles, Up), loyalty (Ratatouille), community (Bug's Life), mortality (Toy Story series), and problems of pride (Cars).<br/><br/>Whatever flaws one may look for, they are actually quite trivial compared to the rest of this film. There's no doubt that this film is a great technical leap forward in almost every way, successfully duplicating the beauty, creativity, and imagination of its traditional, animated roots. Disney has done it quite marvelously here. Bravo! <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, you can also follow me on http://twitter.com/d_art"
"beccad90","7","1","3","5 December 2010"," ""Solid, Humorous Story with a Fairy Tale Feel...""
","When I heard that Disney was finally going to adapt the classic Grimm's fairy tale, Rapunzel, I was ecstatic. For as long as I can remember, I have been waiting for them to pick it up and put their own spin on it. The final product is the musical comedy Tangled, which, while not as edgy as I would have liked it to be, was still very enjoyable. The tale is kooky, funny, moving, uplifting, and—what else—Disney.<br/><br/>Directed by the co-directors of 2008's Bolt, Tangled is a twist on the traditional tale of Rapunzel, wherein the damsel (played by a sweet-n-spicy Mandy Moore) possesses magical hair, which is kept by the villainous Mother Gothel (played with malice by Donna Murphy) to maintain the latter's physical beauty. When a charming but irresponsible rogue thief named Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi) seeks refuge in her tower, she sees this as her ticket out of there, and off to see the floating lanterns released every year on her birthday. These lanterns are released as a memorandum to a kidnapped princess that was stolen on that very same day. Coincidence? I think not.<br/><br/>What makes this movie work is the timing. The trailers tried to appeal way to much to the hip crowd, making it out to look like another floppy animated comedy. But, when I checked out the story, the characters and, finally, saw the movie itself, I realized it kept tighter to the traditional Disney formula of once upon a time and far away, but it was also giving off its own vibe, without trying to be something its not. The jokes all worked, for the most part, and helped tell the story instead of clogging it up with throwaway jokes, which I do appreciate. <br/><br/>The story also shows one of personal growth, especially that of Flynn Rider, whose story this really should have been. He starts off as an irresponsible thief, trying to find a shortcut out of sticky situations with his charm. On his journey with Rapunzel, he falls in love with her spirited nature and even gives his life to save herbut I won't give too much of that away. Donna Murphy's villainous Mother Gothel was also pleasantly over-the-top, but gradually became more threatening as the tale went on. Even though she is not Disney's strongest villainess, she still is a pretty fun one.<br/><br/>The art in this movie also helps tell the story, as well as makes everything look lush and colorful. Rapunzel's hair is one of the most awesome props in the movie, and makes it out to be something more than just looking pretty. It's used as a swing, a rope, a makeshift weapon —besides that darn frying pan—as well as a light and a healing device, which is activated by a special song. Everything else, the flowers, the foliage, water, characters, all look amazing, even if it is in computer animation. The most beautiful scene though, is when Rapunzel and Flynn watch the floating lanterns from the lagoon surrounding the palace. It was here that I started to get a little teary eyeduntil the ending.<br/><br/>The only real problems with it were A) I would have liked to see it in traditional 2D animation and B) I would have liked Rapunzel to be a bit edgier (and a tad skeptical, but how WOULD you feel if you spend your whole life in a tower). However, as is, I think it's one of the best Disney films out there so far.<br/><br/>All in all, Tangled is a fantastic watch, with beautiful animation, a solid—as well as funny— storyline, and fantastic songs and voicework. While not as good as Dreamworks' earlier 2010 release, How to Train your Dragon, OR even 2009's The Princess and the Frog, it still holds up."

","On paper, Tangled sounds ridiculous. It's the retelling of the Rapunzel story except that this time around Rapunzel's hair glows and has magical healing powers. But somehow, despite all the odds, Disney makes it work. Really well. It's a pity that Disney wants to back away from its princess and fantastical image b/c Disney does epic, ideal fairy tales so remarkably well. Tangled is funny, has likable characters, and a smart, complex villain, Mother Gothel. (When Gothel finally says, ""Fine, I'll be the villain"", I'm almost reluctant to see it end that way.) <br/><br/>I know that a lot of reviews have said that Tangled reminded them of Beauty and the Beast, but Tangled reminded me most of A Hunchback of Notre Dame, a happy fairy tale version of it. One of the most fascinating parts of the movie is Rapunzel's relationship with her mother. Gothel is in many ways like Frollo, except she's seemingly much kinder to Rapunzel, showers her with love and teaches her that the outside world is a wicked place and won't tolerate, in Rapunzel's case, how special she is. Rapunzel's relationship with Gothel almost up to the end, is complicated and I'm glad that they depicted it as such. Rapunzel herself is beautiful, naive, and at her very core, a dreamer as all Disney princesses should be. I do really appreciate the fact that they played up her naiveness since she really hasn't seen the world at all. Mandy Moore and Zachery Levi both do a fabulous job voicing Rapunzel and Flynn. My main qualms with the movie were the music. Moore, while she's a fine singer, somehow lacked that signature Disney singing voice. I may be biased though b/c I've heard quite a lot of her other music (when she was a pop singer). Donna Murphy (Gothel) and Levi both have it though. It's also such a pity they didn't have Levi sing more b/c he's really got a fabulous singing voice. Rapunzel is magical, delightful and goes to show that Disney hasn't lost it at all."
"mcshermansmithy","7","4","28","30 January 2014"," The story is tangled up in its plot holes
","Disney can create some great animated films. Unfortanutly, Tangled isn't one of them. Why? Because of its many plot holes and clichés that are really obvious. Lets begin with the question of how nobody can find Rapunzel in the tower where the evil lady took her? I know they said that they tried to find her, but if I was the king, I would tear the kingdom apart until I found my daughter. Plus, towers aren't like huts or hobbit holes where it can blend in with the environment. I'm surprised that it took eighteen years for someone to even stumble upon it. But all of this wouldn't have happened if there were any guards to protect baby Rapunzel from getting kidnapped. You have to be someone from Assassin's Creed to accomplish that. Last of the plot holes that I will discuss is that when grownup Rapunzel looks at the painting of herself, why doesn't she get curious about it. I'm surprised that nobody noticed and thought ""The teenager looks an awful lot like the royal baby who was kidnapped eighteen years ago."" <br/><br/>Moving from that, the characters in Tangled are decent, just not really special. The songs are actually pretty creative and can be a little fun. The animation is very smooth and very detailed.<br/><br/>But all in all, Tangled is not that great. Sure it has its moments and some decent animation, but the story is very weak and the rest of the movie suffers for it. I hope the Frozen is as good as everybody says it is and not a repeat of what I had to go through with Tangled."
"JTurner82","7","2","10","12 December 2010"," Some magical moments, but no match for Disney's better films.
","Disney animation certainly hasn't been what it used to be. After a share of mediocre to bad animated movies, they churned out an instant classic with the traditionally animated THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG. But that film didn't catch on with the public as much as it should have (of course being released around the same time as the mega-super hit AVATAR didn't help matters either). Blaming the underperformance of their film on an assumption that boys were turned off by the phrase ""princess"", Disney decided to rename their subsequent feature, RAPUNZEL, a similar fairy tale in digital 3-D CGI. This name change is something that I still can't shake my head over. I realize the motivation was to try and attract more people, but c'mon, TANGLED? Sounds more like self-parody if you ask me! As expected, RAPUNZEL -- OK, OK, TANGLED -- is a very loose retelling of the famous Brother's Grimm tale. The title character is a young woman with the largest amount of golden hair imaginable shut away in a tower deep in the forest. Her only guardian is Mother Gothel, who stole the child away from her parents when she was very young. Rapunzel's hair has magic powers; it can heal cuts and make even a centuries-old being still appear young. It is for this latter reason that Gothel keeps Rapunzel captive, although of course our blonde heroine is told by her ""mother"" that the world is a dark and scary place and that she should stay in the tower. (If this doesn't give you echoings of Disney's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, then what will?) Of course, Rapunzel years to explore the outside world, namely to attend the ""festival of lights"" held once a year on her birthday. One day, Flynn Rider, a runaway thief who has just stolen a jeweled crown, sneaks into the tower to hide. Knocking him out cold with a frying pan, Rapunzel forces Flynn to take her to the Festival in exchange for the stolen crown. At first Flynn tries to weasel his way out of the deal, but as he falls in love with her, his motives naturally change. But Mother Gothel wants Rapunzel back at all costs....<br/><br/>There are many moments when TANGLED truly shines, mainly anything involving genuine heart or magic. In the latter half of the film there is a breathtaking moment where glowing lanterns literally float up into the night sky while Rapunzel and Flynn sing the obligatory love song, ""I See The Light"". This is a truly colorful and imaginative sequence that ranks among the best at Disney. Similarly inspiring is when Rapunzel uses her enchanted hair to heal a cut on Flynn's hand. And the last half hour offers some powerful drama and heartbreaking emotion on the way to its happy ending (surprise).<br/><br/>Arguably the triumph of the film is Mother Gothel, who ranks as one of Disney's finest villains in a long time. She has shades of Lady Tremaine from Cinderella, but there is also a little bit of Frollo from HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. She's selfish, manipulative, greedy, and deceptive in every way imaginable. The dynamic between her and Rapunzel is both one of the strongest points of the movie and reminds one of the Witch/Rapunzel relationship from Steven Sondheim's dark fairy tale musical INTO THE WOODS. In fact, Gothel's signature song, ""Mother Knows Best"", one of many to be written for this film by Alan Menken, is strangely reminiscent of a Sondheim song. (The score is another highlight of TANGLED; Menken's songs are very pleasing to the ear, with some emerging as true stand-outs.<br/><br/>Unfortunately TANGLED falls short of Disney classic status for the following reasons. One of them is the overemphasis on slapstick comedy for much of the first two-thirds of the film. Most of this consists of Flynn getting whacked around by Rapunzel's frying pan, comical sight gags, and Looney Tunes style goofiness. This gets pretty tiresome quickly after every five seconds. Other sources of comedy comes from Rapunzel's chameleon sidekick, Pascal, as well as a gang of burly bandits who break into song at one point in the film. Both are absolutely useless in that they don't contribute anything valuable to the plot. The bandits, in particular, only show up in one scene that by the time they reappear again toward the finale, I forgot who they were! Pascal seems to be mostly the typical Disney cartoon sidekick intended to provide laughs and/or lure kids into the theater, because that's exactly what he functions as. He doesn't even do anything during the finale.<br/><br/>As far as the lead characters are concerned, Rapunzel is an appealing enough heroine, free-spirited and alternatingly schizophrenic (her various mood swings when she ventures out of the tower for the first time, for instance), while Flynn starts off as a smug, self-centered rogue who has a change of heart as he learns about Rapunzel's past. But while they both have a solid chemistry, there isn't enough of it in the film to emerge as emotionally impactful as it could have been. (Consequently, the climactic moments of the film, while otherwise very strong, don't resonate as dramatically as they would have with better realized leads.) Had the comedy level been cranked down by several notches and the story much tighter, TANGLED would truly be worthy of being Disney's 50th animated feature. THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG was a much better production to earn that status. I did enjoy TANGLED overall, but I don't think it's one of Disney's greatest."

","I found myself flicking through the TV channels with nothing else on, and up pops tangled. I begin to watch not expecting much and thinking I'd go upstairs after dinner anyway. It just so happened that I began at the mother knows best reprise, and this one musical number was enough to convince me that I needed to watch it from the top.<br/><br/>Let's start with the characters. For a start the low number of main characters means that each gets the maximum amount of screen time and therefore it's very easy to fall in love with the innocence and divided mind of Rapunzel and the charm of Flynn. In perfect contrast to a very heart lighted movie is the chilling presence of mother gothel. And she is the star of the show. Her overly sweetened nature and brilliant animation make her one of my personal favourite villeins. <br/><br/>However as is the case in many Disney films... It has problems. With the exception of mother knows best and mother knows best reprise (both of which are brilliant and are as good as any villein song out there) the other songs are Weak at best. The movie also tends to drag a little in places as it focuses more on the romance and less on actual conflict. <br/><br/>That being said this is a fine film. It doesn't quite stack up against some of the classics like lion king or Aladdin but a great watch."
"vchimpanzee","Null","1","4","13 December 2013"," Well done, a little violent
","Mandy Moore does a great job here, and Rapunzel's every emotion is effectively communicated both by the animators and by Moore. Rapunzel is the perfect combination of sweet, funny, intelligent and strong. She totally convinces me that she loves her ""mother"", even though her mother uses her for her power but is herself also very convincing in her loving attitude. Zachary Levi is very good as Flynn, and being a fan of ""Chuck"", I wish I had known his name. But Flynn is funny and likable.<br/><br/>It's amazing how much Rapunzel knows about the outside world, but there are books in her castle. One would think that as much as Gothel wants to ""protect"" her, she wouldn't introduce her to so many concepts that the girl could use against her.<br/><br/>For a Disney movie, this is a little on the violent side, especially when Rapunzel and Flynn visit a hangout with a lot of tough men. But even that scene is still more comic and fantasy than really dangerous. A PG rating is probably justified but nothing to really worry about.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and gives Rapunzel many opportunities to show her intelligence and ability.<br/><br/>It's a good adventure for the whole family, except maybe the youngest kids."

","I first saw this at the cinema two years ago with a temporary support worker at my former care home and we both enjoyed it. Likewise with 'Horton Hears A Who' and 'Igor,' this is another film I found more entertaining than I did on my first viewing.<br/><br/>Although the entire film could easily be mistaken for a Pixar film due to its CGI animation, it is beautifully rendered with characters whose styles tend to differ from those of typical Pixar characters, stunning colours and realistic backgrounds. The floating lanterns scene is exceptionally gorgeous as is the glowing effect on Rapunzel's hair. The animation itself is just as good as that of recent Pixar films such as 'Toy Story 3' for example. I also liked the majestic if poignant and tense incidental music with a touch of Celtic authenticity and the songs, especially 'When Will My Life Begin?,' 'Mother Knows Best' and its reprise where Mother Gothel sings about Rapunzel knowing best as a clever twist, 'I've Got A Dream' and 'I See The Light.' While Rapunzel was cute as a baby and a slightly older child, the teenage/young adult version of her is as aspiring as Tiana from 'The Princess and the Frog' and as excitable as Tiana's friend Lottie (the scene of her up-and-down feelings upon leaving the tower is one of the most memorable), Flynn Ryder/Eugene is amusing (especially the joke about his nose being drawn incorrectly on his wanted poster) and suave while Pascal is cute and provides some laughs with his colour changes but the funniest character here has got to be Maximus the horse with his dog-like traits. Mother Gothel is a wicked so-called maternal figure who is reminiscent of the queen in 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' Malificent from 'Sleeping Beauty' and Lady Tremaine/Cinderella's stepmother - I liked the shocking twist of Rapunzel discovering that she is not her real mother. The writing has a fine mix of humour, emotion and darkness with a hint of intelligence and Mandy Moore was a more than worthy choice to voice Rapunzel since she can both sing and act (I remember her as a singer from my early teenage years) if the other voice actors are not quite as well-known. Another positive aspect is the Steamboat Willie logo to commemorate 'Tangled' as Disney's 50th animated classic. It's not just a Disney Classic, it's a modern Disney Classic. <br/><br/>While I have previously mentioned that 'The Princess and The Frog' bridged the gap between 'Bolt' and this one, this bridges the gap between 'The Princess and the Frog' and the 2011 version of 'Winnie the Pooh,' Disney's most recent 2D animated feature length film to date. Not only that but this is one of Disney's best films to come out in recent years and the short follow-up film 'Tangled Ever After' is a must-see as well. 9/10."

This is the reason why I could emphasize with them easily. The heroine, Rapunzel was not only cute but also brave. I think she was the first princess who fought bravely! I have a great regard for her. The hero, Flynn was narcissistic, which is rather unusual for Disney movies' heroes. At first, he cared about only himself, but gradually became a genuine hero like other Disney heroes. Yes, this is his most attractive feature! The 3D was also wonderful. Every thing which came on to this movie was no more than an apology for being right in front of my eyes. ""Tangled"" put the memory which I dreamed to be a princess into my mind.

"JamesHitchcock","Null","1","4","3 January 2013"," Excitement and Amusement for All
","Several of the early Disney feature-length cartoons (""Snow White"", ""Cinderella"", ""Sleeping Beauty"") were based upon European fairy tale, and with ""Tangled"" the Walt Disney Animation Studios returns to this source of inspiration. Their previous animated feature ""The Princess and the Frog"" had also been very loosely based on a Brothers Grimm folk tale, but in that case the action had been transferred from Europe to twentieth-century America. ""Tangled"" is likewise only loosely based upon the original tale, but at least it keeps the traditional European setting. <br/><br/>The film was originally titled ""Rapunzel"", after the fairy tale on which it is based, but this was changed to ""Tangled"" shortly before its release. The change, which caused some controversy, was apparently motivated by the studio's concern that their recent animated features, with their stress on the ""Disney Princesses"", had only appealed to girls, and their belief that by shifting the emphasis in the title away from the leading female character they could make the film more attractive to boys. (In a similar fashion Disney's current animation project, based upon Anderson's ""The Snow Queen"" and to be released later this year, has been renamed ""Frozen""). <br/><br/>Despite the change of title, the film still keeps the heroine's odd- sounding name (not a normal Christian name even in German and one which I could never pronounce as a child). In this version Rapunzel lives in a secluded tower with a woman named Gothel whom she believes to be her mother. In fact, Rapunzel is the daughter of the king and queen of a nearby kingdom, and Gothel has kidnapped her in order to exploit Rapunzel's ultra-long hair which has magical properties. Gothel has forbidden her supposed ""daughter"" to leave the tower in which she lives, but Rapunzel yearns to explore the wider world which she has never seen, and manages to escape with the help of a young man. <br/><br/>I have often thought that the changing appearance of the Disney Princesses sheds an interesting light upon changing attitudes to female beauty. Snow White from the thirties, although she is supposed to be an adult woman, always looks disturbingly adolescent. Cinderella and Aurora from the fifties are both cool blondes, the first with something of the looks of Grace Kelly, the second resembling a blonde Audrey Hepburn. There were to be no princesses in the sixties and seventies, a period when the studio's cartoons were mostly about animals rather than humans, but Ariel from the eighties reverts to the innocent child-woman look popularised by some of the models and actresses of the era, such as Samantha Fox. The princesses of the nineties, the decade of the supermodel, are much more curvaceous and adult-looking, such as Pocahontas and Jasmine in ""Aladdin"". Tiana from ""The Princess and the Frog"", the first black Princess, made her appearance in the year that America's first black President took office. Rapunzel again has something of the adolescent about her, resembling a young Sarah Michelle Gellar, but then she is supposed to be only eighteen. She is, however, something of a feisty, feminist princess, the sort of girl who prefers to take the initiative rather than sit around in the hope of being rescued by a prince. <br/><br/>In the Grimm story, Rapunzel is indeed rescued by a prince, but here her love-interest is a handsome young commoner named Flynn Rider. Far from being royal, Flynn- presumably named after Errol- is something of a rogue; when we first meet him he is on the run after stealing the tiara of the ""lost princess"", as Rapunzel has become known after her disappearance. Of course, he later becomes a reformed character; indeed, the human capacity to reform oneself and become something new is a recurrent theme in the film. Rapunzel succeeds in rediscovering her true identity, rejecting the false one which has been forced on her by Gothel, and a gang of scary-looking thugs all turn out to be rather gentler than their appearance might suggest. They also have some surprising ambitions, which Rapunzel encourages them to pursue. <br/><br/>Disney villainesses are generally portrayed either as ugly (Cinderella's stepsisters) or as scary-looking (the Wicked Queen in ""Snow White"" or the Wicked Fairy in ""Sleeping Beauty""), but Gothel, a pretty thirty- something, is much more normal-looking, although her brunette colouring and sharper features indicate that, contrary to what she might claim, there is no blood relationship between her and the blonde, sweet-faced Rapunzel. Gothel, in fact, despite her villainy, is generally presented as a comic figure, a neurotically and ludicrously over-protective mother, rather than a figure of pure evil. (Gothel also gets to sing the film's most memorable song, ""Mother Knows Best"").<br/><br/>The other character that stands out is Maximus, the horse belonging to the captain of the Royal Guards and an enthusiastic pursuer of evildoers, an animal counterpart to the heroes of all those ""tough cop"" movies. Like most Disney Princesses, Rapunzel has her own animal companion, a pet chameleon named Pascal. <br/><br/>My personal preference has always been for the traditional hand-drawn style of animation rather than the computer generated version. ""Tangled"", however, is one of the more visually attractive examples of the latter style, often with a look reminiscent of a painting; apparently the eighteenth-century French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard was a major influence on the animators. I am not going to award this film a mark out of ten, as children's films need to be judged by different criteria to films for adults, preferably by the children themselves. I can, however, say that ""Tangled"" is a very enjoyable piece of family entertainment, with plenty of excitement and amusement for all."
"Tweekums","8","1","4","26 December 2012"," An enjoyably take on the Rapunzel fairy tale
","As this story opens leading man, Flynn Rider, tells us how a sunbeam once fell to Earth and became a magical golden flower. This flower was kept by Gothal, an old woman, who used its magic to stay forever young and refuses to share its power. One day, when the pregnant queen is on the verge of death the palace guard search the kingdom and find the flower; they turn it into a medicine that saves the queen. The magic remains though; this time locked within the newborn Princess Rapunzel's hair. Gothal sneaks into the palace to steal a lock of the child's hair but as soon as she cuts it, it turns brown and loses its magic so she takes the baby. The years pass and Gothal raises Rapunzel as her own child; keeping her locked in a tall tower to 'protect' her from the dangers of the world. Rapunzel begs her mother to let her leave the tower to see the lanterns being released on her birthday but the request is refused. As luck would have it Flynn ends up in Rapunzel's tower after fleeing from the royal guard he has just stolen a priceless tiara from the palace! Rapunzel talks him into taking her to see the lanterns and along the way she learns the truth about her 'mother' and the two of them have the expected series of adventures before things appear to go wrong again.<br/><br/>This Disney 3D animation may not have been made in collaboration with Pixar but it has a charm of its own and a distinct 'Disney' look and more importantly sound; the characters sing a succession of songs throughout the film. The story is enjoyably with plenty of action, a good number of laughs, enough scares and even an apparent tragedy that may cause a few tears to be shed if you think a Disney film could let a protagonist die. The film's PG certificate is due to the mild violence; this is mostly comical though and frequently involves frying pans so it should be okay for most children to watch unless you are worried they will copy the protagonists and batter each other with frying pans! The animation looks really good; the characters move and show emotion in a genuinely human way even though they are clearly cartoon characters rather than realistically proportioned. I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Disney animation; it may not be classic hand drawn animation but it is still classic Disney."

","After Tarzan (1999), Disney movies began to suck (I love Lilo and Stitch and I really want to see Treasure Planet). I find it a shame that animated movies relied on computers to create the movie and make comedy the main focus on these movies. Tangled may be a CGI movie, but it's up high with the Disney classics<br/><br/>I was a little skeptical when this movie came out. I was like ""ugh! Not a Dreamworks movie!"" But when I was able to watch it on DVD, I was like ""wow, is Disney coming back?"" Disney would probably never beat great classics such as The Lion King and Snow White, but Tangled prove that the Disney company is trying to.<br/><br/>Tangled takes the Rapunzel story and makes it their own. There's Flynn 'Eugene' Rider Who tries to possess a royal crown. And there's Rapunzel who was kidnapped my Gothel and she was raised in an isolated tower for 18 years. And then the outline is simple: Flynn finds Rapunzel, they hang out, have a romantic scene, a conflict with Gothel, villain dies then a happy ending! I do not want to tell you guys a summary of the movies. See it for yourself and enjoy<br/><br/>Tangled is very enjoyable. Catchy songs, awesome animal friends, a great villain, and Flynn who is the sexiest Prince ever. Please go watch this movie! It's not a typical CGI film like Madagascar or Bolt. It deserves to be with the classics (along with Princess and the Frog-which I need to finish watching) Rent the DVD and enjoy!"

","Some of Disney's greatest films are retellings of classic fairy tales. Tangled is the perfect example of this. Mandy Moore is wonderful as Rapunzel, bringing happiness and joy to even the deepest cockles of my heart. Flynn Ryder and the ruffians were also excellently cast, though I do wish the palace soldiers would've been given a musical number.<br/><br/>I wasn't that big a fan of Mother or her casting, but I do see how her character kinda had to be the least liked. Also, Max's personality greatly reminded me of Altivo from ""The Road To El Dorado."" I would love to see a short film with the two of them.<br/><br/>The only real caveat I have with this movie is the significant age gap between Rapunzel and Flynn, but it's something I can live with."
"angela-reed-330-669181","8","1","4","4 April 2012"," Very good Disney cartoon
","This is not your typical Disney cookie-cutter cartoon. They did a great job with Tangled, using semi-hip dialogue and some Freudian notions that fit the story's thematic base. Disney has made a fun movie of an old fairy-tale chestnut, not as complex as Princess and the Frog, but good enough to be the studio's 50th animation and going strong.<br/><br/>How does 26 years old Mandy Moore's voice sound like 18-year old's? It does, and I'm impressed with the whole angle of vision that emphasizes the needs of pre-teens and teens to bolt from the nest and see the world as it is, not through parents' eyes, while promoting the value of family, real family that is.<br/><br/>Supposedly the visual style, an effective use of 3D, has the properties of ""The Swing,"" a romantic painting by Jean-Honore Fragonard. Whatever, the hair of the two leads, and even wicked ""mom,"" is textured and layered in a most realistic,yet romantically stylized fashion.<br/><br/>Disney is canny enough to use Rapunzel's hair as a weapon, similar to Indiana Jones's whip, to take the staid glam out of its tradition and make it useful for more than a ladder. Even the sidekick chameleon, to be almost as welcomed as Donkey in Shreck, has reactions reflecting the modern cynicism rather than the cute simpleton.<br/><br/>In its further favor, the love between the two teens is not in the Twilight longing motif—it rather it grows organically from a mutual respect, not lust divorced from the idealized bodies Disney distractingly offers in its animations. In short, your thinking youngsters should love the ironies Tangled offers while it entertains with patented Disney humanity."
"hughesjake85","8","1","4","27 February 2012"," Excellent movie.
","This movie was better than I thought it would have been. The story line was a well-thought out movie frame. The tall tower was an amazing part of the movie. The best character would have to the White Horse. That horse was absolutely hilarious. The one thing that I would change is the ending, it was a bit underly- dramatic. It should have been more expressive. However, understanding that her parents are the King and Queen makes more sense about the situation. Tangled is probably one movie that I could watch over and over again. The characters were thought out to be connected to everyone. That is why Tangled is more of a better family- child movie than a Disney Channel Film."
"MartianOctocretr5","8","1","4","19 February 2012"," Animated adaptation of Repunzel both funny and touching
","One thing I've got to say about this movie before anything else: it spares us that post-millennial mentality of mocking any existing story a la Shrek, Robot Chicken, Simpsons, and so many others. It is faithful to the original story, even presenting elements of the original fairy tale that had been rendered obscure over time. It has respect for the source material, knowing it can stand on its own, without gimmickry.<br/><br/>It's truly a splendid mix of childhood fantasy, action, adventure, and comedy. It preserves the soul of the fairy tales's moral, by not watering down the scary and ruthless villains in animated movies or grossly overdoing them to the other direction. This gentle yet playfully mischievous rendering of Repunzel is truly the best I've ever seen. The fact the movie makes chose to title it Tangled even though it's a very faithful telling of Rapunzel suggests the intent to have a good laugh with it. And you do get the laughs but there are no shortage of dazzling and intensely emotional moments. The candle-light lantern bags vigil on the anniversary of the princess's disappearance is lyrical, impressive, and moving. It's magnificently presented and this scene is woven with purpose into the plot. Events that happen there serve as a stepping stone for the characters as they move toward the resolution of what is happening.<br/><br/>The villain is superior; the wicked ""step mother""/kidnapper is threatening and deliciously evil; you can't wait to see her get her come-uppance. The gallant bad guy turned good guy/romantic interest couldn't have been better; very reminiscent of Aladdin who trail blazed that pattern.<br/><br/>Action moves, characters develop, the audience's emotions are touched. A fabulous story; and an expert job of adapting it for animation. Wonderful for kids, and has something for adults too. Recommended."

","I can't think of anything negative to say about this movie. The youngest through to the oldest of viewers will enjoy it. I'm a teenager, at first I thought it would be another boring old childish movie, but I was wrong. I actually liked it, a lot. The characters were likable, and which is good because by the end you begin to feel emotional for them. Some of the characters were funny, my favorite is the horse. Yes, the movie is funny and has a couple of musical numbers and the songs are good, and not annoying like some musicals can be. The animation is smooth and clear. The characters are very cute looking with big sparkling eyes, with exception of the villains of course. The story line is creative and the situations the characters ended up in seemed real enough for me to care. Tangled left me feeling good about myself and a smile on my face. <br/><br/>Overall I think If you have the chance, watch it. It's a very good movie."
"badoli","5","3","24","14 May 2011"," A tame joyful film for the whole family. Just no big hit.
","This movie conforms to all rules classical Disney films set up. Old Brothers Grimm story? Check. Boy saves princess? Check. Singing? Check. Sidekicks providing humor? Check. Happy End...? I guess thats barely a spoiler...<br/><br/>That is as good a fact as it is bad. It all depends on how one stands toward these. Do you like this rigid screenplay framework? Then you'll probably enjoy this. And as such it probably works for the whole family.<br/><br/>I still gave it a 5/10 for being so tame. There isn't any real villain in there, even the old woman isn't evil by heart. The problem i see here is that in this way the male protagonist can't portray the hero as good as the kitschy rest of the movie wants him to be. He's merely a thief and pretty much receives the grand price, the hand of the princess, without all too much deserving it. All he had to do is run off with her, pretty much true to his trade.<br/><br/>In my point this is one reason why the classics are the classics and this one never will be. Cinderella, Snow Wite, the Junglebook, Aladdin, Lionking... They all had great villains and thanks to those were great in making heroes. It's a pity that got lost somewhere."

","Pretty good the main characters were pretty in a Disney style sort. Had a good music score also but did not maintain interest throughout the entire film. Reminds me of a tale I heard when I was young called Repunzal if anyone else remembers. I watched with my little brother and he was a little confused though at times I was able to explain to him the plot devices and characters. The story line is linear (fair amount) but some ""younger' viewers may have to rewind and watch a few parts. Also for sensitive audience maybe remember that there ARE a few scary parts to this film and simply to cover up your eyes is not enough to block the sounds of course so perhaps press mute (small button in left hand-side of remote) so that you can give yourself a few seconds to let the uncomfortable part play through."
"jorijuusojokela","8","1","5","3 September 2014"," A Very funny but slightly rushed
","The movie itself was very funny, especially in the beginning but towards the end, the fun seemed to lost. They should have included the Ever after in the end of the regular movie.<br/><br/>The characters were kinda successful, except Mother Gothel; she resembles the bad person in the very first time we meet her at her younger age, which can give too much hint for viewers (wheter it's intentional or not). Rapunzel's character was very sweet and adorable and especially her reactions to Flynn for the first time, for example. It is also nice to see how creative things she can do with her hair. Especially her changes of mood when he left the tower were funny.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they might rushed the end part of the movie. Story telling started to get fast and ignored some events' seriousness. For example, the death of Mother Gothel didn't seem to affect on Rapunzel at all. Also, in some scenes (water trap and saving Flynn from dead) they almost broke the Pixar's rule number #19 of storytelling: ""Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of are cheating"". <br/><br/>Often, many people would fight over this and Frozen for being a better movie. Where as Frozen was more dramatic, this is funnier and with more simple plot. Tangled is at least as good film. Personally, I think that Tangled was more ""testing film"" for Frozen for using new graphical engines and scenes etc. It also has similar scenes and plot parts (getting in jail, someone need to take one to somewhere, and healing deads). But if I had to choose, I would prefer Frozen more but perhaps only because I saw it earlier.<br/><br/>The thing that they should remember in the future is that teaching kids moral of the story is that you can't heal people who have already died. Even though they might have used it much, it should more show of the ""never loose all hope"" ideology."
"Imdbidia","6","1","5","9 April 2011"," Sweet and Witty
","Tangled is a free adaptation of the traditional fairy-tale of Rapunzel. A fairy-tale romance and adventure movie, but also a coming of age story in which Rapunzel leaves the too-oppressive maternal womb to discover the world and herself. Follow your dream and leave your child discover the world for herself are the two main messages of the film.<br/><br/>The animation is terrific, very beautiful and colorful, but more eye catching than artistic I would say. However, the scene of the flying lanterns is just magical, extremely beautiful and inspiring, as well as the drawing of some of the forest backgrounds. The main human characters are great, very witty and lovable/hate-able. I found horse Maximus truly hilarious, and the chameleon very sweet wise and naughty at the same time. I loved the fact that the animals don't talk, still they have their own personality and communicate with their owners in their own way.<br/><br/>The cast really shines in this movie, and I loved the fact that they were not the usual superstar actors doing the dubbing. Mandy Moore is great as the very sweet, forward and naive Rapunzel. Zachary Levi is cheeky and sweet in his impersonation of the rascal outlaw Flynn Rider. However, the Oscar goes to Donna Murphy, who is brilliant in her role of villain, and she is immediately hate-able as Mother Gothel; she is the epitome of a witch, and one of the best witches ever created by Disney.<br/><br/>Alan Menken's score and Glenn Slater's lyric have to be praised, as they really give the movie its soul and mood. Unforgettable is the song ""I have a dream"", sung by a bunch of ugly looking outlaws, which has great lyrics and melody. This is one of the most lovely scenes in the film, too. Also brilliant is Gothel's song Mother knows Best, that sums up very well her selfish approach to motherhood. The singing by Moore, Levi and Murphy is great.<br/><br/>I found some important flaws and miss-messages in the film, that are clearly noticeable, even for a child, and that were unnecessary. The first one is the physical appearance of Rapunzel's queen mother. She looks much younger than her husband, almost his daughter, and also looks like Rapunzel's older sister, not her mother. It reflects and shameless portrays the obsession for youth of modern society regarding women. An old man does not have any problem in showing his age, his wrinkles and whitey hair, actually that makes it more respectable. On the contrary, an old woman has too look young, unwrinkled and have her hair colored to be likable as an old woman. That was very disappointing.<br/><br/>The second flaw in the story is the fact that, despite Rapunzel living alone, isolated, incarcerated, never putting her feet out of her tower until rescued by Flynn, she's not only able to swim but also to dive! Are we all fools or what? The third flaw is the marriage thing. The princess is rescued by the prince, but she is has turned just 18, has no experience with other humans, and less with boys, she would be almost a savage, but she is totally civilized and, even worse, she is getting married at 18! I wondered by the script changed many of the quintessential elements of Rapunzel's primitive story and did not dare to do the same with this part. They could have simply omitted Rapunzel's age, or draw her in a more womanly way (she looks like a 13 year old in the movie not a 18y.o.!) and nothing else would have mattered, as the final marriage would have made sense.<br/><br/>Despite the flaws, Tangled is a very entertaining, fun and sweet movie for the whole family, full of action, adventure and sense of humor."

Technically, it was very good. However, this was the first 3D film using polarization glasses that I saw so I don't really have a frame of reference -- comparing it to Anaglyph technology makes no sense. I did feel that the effect was overdone and distracting at times but some scenes benefited from it.<br/><br/>The animation was good. The voice acting was good. The songs were mediocre. The plot...<br/><br/>The plot can be characterized by one word -- Predictable. It's like Disney Studios have a mold that they force every story into. You have the brave but naive protagonist, the scheming villain, the dashing ""travelling companion"" that turns into a love interest, the pet (chameleon this time), the ""comic interlude"" characters. You get the the same gags, the same jokes, the same romantic progress: mutual distrust, getting to know each other, falling in love, having a fight (prompted by the villain's treachery), splitting, realizing their mistake, coming together again, defeating the villain, living happily ever after... Even the same moralizations.<br/><br/>Almost everything that happened since Rapunzel left the tower felt all too familiar, like I've seen the movie before. Which was a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>Tangled was not a bad movie but it was not a good one either. My 6yo liked it very much. The other kids thought it was OK. I missed Aladdin. Verdict: 6/10."

","While this film has all the strengths of the classic Disney films of the 90's, the songs range from decent to mediocre, and some of the key plot twists appear forced. The movie's charm comes from the comedic moments, most of which are derived from the character's facial expressions and gestures. The love theme is really the only memorable piece of music in the whole film, while other efforts like ""Mommy Knows Best"" tend to fall flat. The animation, voice acting and singing are all top quality, but the film's plot weaknesses and uneven score prevent it from being placed in the same class as ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King""."

","I am a 32-year old father of two. I recently watched this movie with my family and was pleasantly surprised by a number of things: unlike nearly every other Disney movie over the last decade, this movie doesn't have the frustrating innuendos and jokes that only adults would understand (see Frozen, among many others); this movie doesn't have the same old recycled Disney characters that have appeared in multiple Disney movies (see Tarzan and Hunchback of Notre Dame, et al); and this movie doesn't have the ridiculously annoying pop culture references that seem to have gone out of control since Shrek introduced that style of humor to kids movies (see Frozen, et al). All of the above prevented this movie from being as irritating as most new ""kids"" movies, but it also had its merits: it's got a nice story, amazing animation, an awesome magical atmosphere and setting, great characters, very good voice-over acting, and a smooth flow. Honestly after seeing this, I still don't understand why a movie like Frozen would become such a huge phenomenon when this movie is better in a lot of ways. It must be simply that the music in Frozen put it over the top. That's the one negative about this movie - the soundtrack isn't as memorable as most classic Disney movies, but it's not bad either. Overall, this is an excellent movie and is probably the most refreshing Disney movie I've seen since The Lion King."

I am glad I did, because I did enjoy the film. There were a few things that set me off a bit though. One is that you can watch it in 3D, yet the movie wasn't really made for it. I can only really remember a couple parts that really used the 3D effect. The other thing was the music. Alan Meken did the score for the movie. He also did the score for the Little Mermaid. So this movie seriously felt like I was watching the Little Mermaid every time someone would sing. It was like he took sound clips and words from that movie and put it in this movie. For the most part, the animation was decent and fun, but not amazing. The voice over cast really did fit with the characters. Zachary Levi did fit his character and I thought he wouldn't. Mandy Moore did a great job as her character. They managed to put a little lizard and a horse in the film for fun characters to watch and enjoy and I am glad they did. I really did enjoy the horse.

"griffolyon12","7","1","6","26 November 2010"," A Blast from the Past, but Nothing all that New
","Tangled is another animated motion picture in a long line of Disney movies trying to recapture their past glories without really stepping out to reclaim the animation field. We all know the story of Rapunzel, how she's locked away in a tower and such, but Disney gives it their trademark fairy tale twist (and I almost thought that they'd run out of fairy tales). Rapunzel was long ago kidnapped from her King and Queen parents by a wicked woman who wanted to use Rapunzel's hair to stay young. Of course, this is a musical, with music from Alan Menken (The Little Mermaid), so it makes sense that whenever Rapunzel sings a certain song, her hair has the ability to heal or make one youthful once more, but if Rapunzel's hair is ever cut, she will lose that power forever. Thus her abductee of a mother locks Rapunzel up in a tower all her life till the paths of Rapunzel and the country's most notorious thief, Flynn Rider, cross and romance ensues as, with Flynn as her guide, Rapunzel finally leaves her tower. <br/><br/>Tangled does feel Disney throughout, but it just feels as if we've seen this same Disney movie at least ten times by now, which I think goes against its goal. Tangled desired to be an update on the age old Disney princess-fairy tale formula, and I don't know if it worked entirely. The animators seemed to focus more so on action and adventure and more slapstick-like comedy than ever before, coating it in glossy CG-animation that just made me pine for the good ol' hand drawn days again. The music was not as memorable, nor as enjoyable as that of previous Menken/Disney collaborations; while the songs were solid, there was never that tune that you just couldn't get out of your head like ""A Whole New World"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"". Regardless, Tangled still managed to be a movie that is entertaining and funny throughout, in a large part due to their fresh takes on the stock Disney characters of the Princess and Prince Charming.<br/><br/>Rapunzel was a very different kind of Disney Princess than we're accustomed to seeing, less sure of herself and more of an innocent child who can't make up her mind between her dreams or her loyalty to her abductee of a mother. Her beau is Flynn, the kind of swashbuckling Prince Charming that the old Disney movies lacked, a thief with a soul and charisma behind those good looks. Unfortunately, the weakest character was the villainess of Rapunzel's adoptive mother, whose character never seems to fully commit to her villainy, starting out as merely a person possessed by greed and not fully transitioning into a force of evil. I feel much more could have been done with her character in playing with the idea that she only pretends to like Rapunzel and doesn't actually love her, which was hinted at a lot through the character's facial expressions. I will say, the silent animal characters of Maximus the Horse and Pascal the Chameleon make up for any shortcomings with laughs, these two characters having benefited the most from this more slapstick-Emperor's New Groove-style approach.<br/><br/>So what can I say, Tangled maybe tries too hard to be a blast from the past and it never really comes into its own. There are many great ideas played around with here, and this really is the most entertained I have been by a Disney animation since Tarzan, but Disney tries to hold onto the past too much here and doesn't let the past go to try and usher in a new era of Disney animation. So what if Tangled feel so familiar that I can pretty much predict what will happen? There is a reason the Disney formula from the '80s and '90s worked, and there's a reason it worked way back in the '20s with Snow White. It's heartwarming, and the big duet between Rapunzel and Flynn on the lake surrounded by glowing lanterns is Disney magic, no matter how you feel about the rest of the movie's execution.<br/><br/>I give Tangled a 7 out of 10!"
"aarongrierson-79741","1","2","19","7 October 2017"," I could give it a -1000/10 if I could
","2010 could have been a brilliant year for animation, as ""Toy Story 3"", ""Despicable Me"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon"" were all released that year. However, the year also saw ""Tangled"". I don't want to come across as a troll, but Tangled just doesn't ever hit the right chords, making this, in my personal opinion, the worst movie ever.<br/><br/>No. 1 is the plot. There are several plot holes that are never resolved. For example, why didn't the King and Queen ever have another child? Did they even try? They were staking the line to the throne on someone finding Rapunzel - which someone obviously did, but what if nobody did? And why did Mother Gothel not give Rapunzel a different birthday, one that didn't coincide with the lantern ceremony? If Gothel had given Rapunzel a different birthday, the lantern ceremony may have held next-to-no significance to Rapunzel, and she wouldn't had been yearning to attend it, which was a major plot-kicker.<br/><br/>The music is not something I'd want to remember. Frozen's soundtrack had that special something - it was catchy, and empowering. Tangled's soundtrack is none of those. It is as bland as a plain white wall. <br/><br/>The voice-acting is decent, but I have never liked Mandy Moore, so I can't say the voice-acting is superb. The comedy was hit-and-miss - every joke, it seemed, was used in the publicity material.<br/><br/>And why is it called ""Tangled""? Did Disney believe only girls would see a film called ""Rapunzel""?<br/><br/>All in all, the film was very poor. The only smattering of consolation on this film is the voice-acting, but I think they could have really improved in that regard. It's just as well that ""Wreck- It Ralph"", ""Frozen"" and ""Zootropolis"" had restored my faith in Disney."

","The past decade has seen the giant corporation that is the House of Mouse, Disney, struggle somewhat with their output, never managing to recapture the magic of the early classics, nor the rich comedy and iconic music of their 90's re-emergence. They've now bought Pixar, who are still making movies that are very much their own, and the rights to the Star Wars franchise, so money-making is still a dead cert. But in a quest to re-discover their old magic, they went back to the tried-and- tested, and admittedly dated, tradition of the fairytale, and by combining this with the visual humour of Dreamworks' output (but funnier) and some truly dazzling CGI/hand-drawn animation, they've managed to create arguably their first success in years with Tangled, a re-imagination of the Rapunzel fairytale.<br/><br/>After discovering that a magic flower has the ability to temporarily restore her youth, Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) lives for centuries until a king steals the flower to heal with deathly ill and pregnant queen. She lives, and gives birth to Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), whose hair seems to possess the same magical powers as the flower. Gothel kidnaps the baby and takes her back to a high tower, where she grows up to be a bubbly, but lonely teenager. Because cutting her hair causes the lock to lose its magical power, Mother Gothel forbids Rapunzel to cut her hair, which by her eighteenth birthday, is about fifty feet long. After Gothel is out one day, the thief Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi), after the stealing the queen's crown, escapes his pursuers into Rapunzel's tower.<br/><br/>My main issue with Tangled is something that plagues most, if not all, of today's musicals, and that is that the songs are simply not up to scratch. It's gotten so bad that we don't even get a bad but annoyingly catchy soundtrack by a pop star has-been (I'm looking at you, Phil Collins!), and we are forced to sit through many instantly forgettable musical numbers. But where it did surprise me, is the romance between Rapunzel and Flynn, where I found myself actually caring about their relationship, which is delicately handled and involves two easily likable characters. It certainly doesn't break any ground, but this at least feels like Disney again, even peppering the film with moments of menace that evoke Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Pinocchio (1940). And the chameleon Pascal is one the best animal characters Disney have ever created.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Tangled captures all that is good about Disney animation with all the vivid colours and characters coming through combined with some strong songs and laugh out loud moments. It may not be the strongest of the 50 animated films but it is a more valid entry than previous Disney flops like Chicken Little.<br/><br/>Unlike The Princess and the frog this doesn't feel like a girl orientated film and the character of Flynn is on equal footing with Rapunzel throughout.<br/><br/>The voice actors are all good with Mandy Moore and Brad Garrett of Everybody Loves Raymond fame being the standouts.<br/><br/>Although 2007's Enchanted starring Amy Adams was perhaps a better homage to the legacy of Disney there are enough elements in this film to satisfy Disney fans old and new."

","I didn't realize this was a singing movie. Ugh. I usually don't like singing. However, hearing Zachary Levi sing was enough for me to bite my tongue and not complain. If you've got little kids, they'll certainly enjoy themselves. Everyone knows the story of Rapunzel; it's nice to see her get a face lift in this. But like any Disney movie, this was incredibly predictable (Except for one part, but I'll get to that in a moment). The voicing was great, but it gets squandered by a delusional Rapunzel singing the SAME 5 NOTES OVER AND OVER AGAIN about how her dream is to see these ""magical"" lanterns fly through the sky. I get the jist of it, but I just never really got into it.<br/><br/>Without a doubt Zachary Levi and Rapunzel's pet chameleon (who's name is Pascal) are the strongest things this film's got going for it. Of course, in almost every Disney movie now there seems to be the clichÃ© creature of some sort that makes funny faces and amuses the audience. ClichÃ©s aside, Pascal is really funny, especially when he interacts with Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi's character). A chameleon for a pet is a great choice by Disney- his color would change with the tone of the characters and really set the mood.<br/><br/>Flynn Rider is the unmatched diamond amongst the dust in this. Unlike the original Rapunzel story, he accidentally finds Rapunzel, leading to a rather funny scene where Rapunzel smashing her frying pan into his head. How he survived this I don't know, but it's a kids movie so I won't complain. Zachary Levi had fun with this and it really shines through.<br/><br/>The star of this whole movie was, to be nice, a dud. After about the third time she sang about how she wants to escape her tower, even though she already did so, I really wanted to punch her in the face. Not hard, but enough to get her to STOP SINGING! Why on Earth Flynn Rider stays with her is beyond me. I felt myself getting angrier and angrier the longer the film lasted.<br/><br/>Rapunzel and her singing ability aside, this was a great movie. There's a nice twist at the end that I don't want to spoil. It's worth your $15 to see Zachary Levi sing, but cover your ears once Rapunzel starts ""singing"". Take your kids or grandkids, they'll enjoy this, but hope with all your might they don't try to sing some of the songs on the way home."

But do you think that would be that easy? Contrary to what Thanos did quite easily? you are wrong! The Infinite War movie may have been very touching and shocking when Thanos killed half of the universe creatures, but the endgame is more impactful and shocking than him. Although the cuff will be in the interest of the Avengers in this movie, nothing comes for free, must be given to get, and perhaps the long time period for the movie that reached three hours was very reasonable because their journey to achieve their goal was neither easy nor many options in front of them."

","Tangled is amateur work when compared against it's goliath predecessors, considering its own goliath $240 million budget. This goes to show no amount of money can buy an animation truly emotive with worthwhile songs and character complexes. Tangled relies more on slap- stick comedy than on story development and intrigue. It uses a timeless formula and executes it predictably to sub-standards. Tangled is a colourful mess, riddled with on-the-nose scenes that have the depth of a placid pool. Animations such as these, although targeted primarily for children, usually showcase their strength by having something for everyone, but Tangled doesn't bother, and will be a forgotten farce of an animation."
"OllieSuave-007","7","0","4","24 June 2015"," Adventurous and comedic fairytale.
","This is Disney's 50th full-length animated feature film, a story about the missing Princess Rapunzel, who as a baby was kidnapped and confined to a tower by Mother Gothel because Rapunzel has special powers that will make everlasting youth. However, when Rapunzel reaches her 18th birthday, she yearns to be part of life outside the tower.<br/><br/>After watching it, I thought the film wasn't bad. The scenes of Rapunzel getting kidnapped by Mother Gothel and of the tower confinement in the beginning instantly draws you to the story. This leads to more adventurous parts where Rapunzel meets bandit Flynn Rider and strikes a deal with him to take her outside the tower in exchange for returning his loot. And, more excitement builds when the royal guards are after Rider while Mother Gothel is also on Rapunzel's trail to bring her back to the tower.<br/><br/>The overall story has a good combination of adventure, romance and magic; it's full of action involving Rider's tangle with the guards to him butting heads with one of their horses, and, as with any Disney fairytale, includes some romantic and touching chemistry between Rider and Rapunzel. Rapunzel's magic powers are brilliantly highlighted through the computer animation, which I thought also made the rest of the film look vibrant and detailed. There is also humor in abundance, thanks in part to the goofy bunch of ruffians Rapunzel and Flynn met in a tavern. However, I thought some of the comedy was overdone; it seemed the characters tried to insert comic relief whenever there is an opportunity, doing away with any moments that are supposed to be intense or dramatic. This is especially true with Flynn and the horse, the contemporary dialog and the goofy narration.<br/><br/>The songs in the film were pretty good and quite catchy, and I thought the music score was chilling. As the music and songs were composed by Alan Menken, listening to them definitely brings you nostalgia from the Disney Renaissance days (animated movies released from 1989-1999).<br/><br/>Overall, it's an adventurous and funny Disney film. It does not surpass the earlier Disney fairytale movies, but it is one of the better Disney animated films released after 2000.<br/><br/>Grade B-"

","As I said in my ""Princess and the Frog"" review, this movie was more of a financial and popularity success than the former. To be honest, I wasn't really excited about this film when it came out. A Disney film about a blonde-haired girl with bright colors and pop music? Yeah, this does not look like my type of film. After I finally saw it three years later...it's good. I don't think I'm on the bandwagon for this movie everyone else is on, but I think it's good.<br/><br/>ANIMATION: I'll admit, when I think of Walt Disney Animation Studios, I prefer traditional hand-drawn animation. If I wanted to see a CG Disney movie, I'd watch a Pixar film. However, I have to admit that that animation here is not only good, but it's also unique. While ""The Princess and the Frog"" looks like hand-drawn characters with 3-D backgrounds, this film has 3-D characters with hand-drawn backgrounds. That's very different, and it looks rather nicely here. Disney hasn't lost its touch!<br/><br/>SONGS/MUSIC: I'm glad to see Alan Menken working in Disney again, but...I don't really like these songs. As I mentioned before, I don't really like the pop genre of music - at least, not modern pop/guitar playing/Top 40S/Broadway styled music. I don't remember melodies, lyrics, or anything about any of the songs...Except for ""Mother Knows Best (Reprise)!"" This song is incredible! Let me make that clear, I referring only to the reprise. This song reveals the shift and dramatic change in the movie. Mother Gothel is in charge now, and it's getting menacing and intimidating! I love that number!<br/><br/>ROMANCE: The romance between Rapunzel and Flynn Rider is...good. Like the songs, the romance didn't really grab me, but that doesn't mean it's bad. These two certainly do have chemistry and they learn a lot from each other. We can see how they fall with each other, and it's enjoyable to watch them.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: ...Again, the characters are good, but they don't move me in the slightest. I'm just not particularly drawn to any of these characters. They're good, but there's not a lot I can talk about...With the exception of Mother Gothel! My gosh, she is awesome! She actually reminds me of Ursula, if she were to become a mother. She funny, she charming, she's witty, and classy. But she's also devious, deceitful, manipulative, and wicked! If anyone were to meet her for the first time, they may not know how evil she is - she can fool people very well. That's a great characteristic for a villain, I love it! I also like the King and Queen, Rapunzel's parents. They don't verbalize anything in this movie, but they say everything that needs to be said. I love watching them and their concern for their daughter. I love the animation on them, and I love them as characters. They're supportive, they're loving, and they're just all around great people. Gosh, you feel so bad for them, you'll want to reach through the screen and give them a hug!<br/><br/>STORY: The set up is really good for this movie. The introduction lays out all the details excellently. It creates a perfect reason for why Rapunzel is in the tower, why she would want to leave the tower, and why the villain in the story is so determined to keep her locked away. This is the fairy tale Disney used to do well, and it works very well here. For everything that lies in the movie that I wasn't attracted to, this element worked rather nicely.<br/><br/>QUICK QUESTION: The question I ask myself is, why was this movie more successful than ""The Princess and the Frog?"" Based on what I've heard as well as what I know, here's what I came up with: (1) Some people were turned off by the fact that the other movie featured a Black princess. Not everybody was, clearly, but let's not act like it didn't offend anyone. (2) Guitar playing/Pop music is more popular to the general public than Ragtime. That's why it's called ""pop music."" (3) Sadly, CG animated films are more popular than hand-drawn are. I do hope that changes, though. Finally, (4) I think that since ""The Princess and the Frog"" had the word ""princess"" in the title, many people figured the target-demographic for this picture was little girls. Not a lot of boys want to see a Disney movie with a princess, that's not as exciting as, say ""Aladdin."" Yes, it had a princess, but it didn't focus on her. By keeping ""princess"" out of the title for this film, they can market it as an action-adventure, and market it to boys as well as girls.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: I'd be lying if I said I like this film a lot. However, I do have to be honest; there are a lot of good things in this film. If you can enjoy this type of music and the characters, you'll enjoy the film a lot. It was a lot better than I thought it'd be, and it is a great film - a lot of time and dedication was clearly put into this. While I myself couldn't get as invested as other people, maybe you'll like it. Take a look and see what you think. God bless you. BOOYIKA!"
"lasttimeisaw","6","0","9","11 December 2012"," Tangled Vs. Brave
","Inadvertently I have watched this two Disney animations hand-in-hand (TANGLED is from the orthodox Disney branch while BRAVE is its flagship Pixar production), which seems to be a perfect paradigm to juxtapose them together and to dissect the state-of-the-art tendency of the mainstream genre (enormously profitable since its chief target are zero in on family with children, so it has a much more important and instructive obligation other than merely an entertainment for the toddlers and above). <br/><br/>Coincidentally both films' heroines are princess (Rapunzel in TANGLED and a Scottish Merida in BRAVE), adapted from Grimm Brothers' tale, TANGLED is supremely reminiscent of Disney's other established princess analogs trapped in a magic world, let's say Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, what's more, there will always be a prince-charming to deserve and requite her love. Wisely Rapunzel's Flynn Rider has been sizeably modernized as a reckless, self-mocking yet conservatively ""Disney"" prince with a thief background. <br/><br/>But in BRAVE, Merida is a much more radical rebel by blood, she doesn't have or need a prince with white horse (the film doesn't care to proffer one since all her tribe suitors are one-of-a-kind wackos), she is fighting against her predestined life path which her mother has arranged for her and her status has requested her, a tad thread-bone notwithstanding, but chronicling with a single-linear arc, the mother-daughter predicament has slipped to the hanging-by-a-thread situation when a magic spell transfigures the Queen's appearance into a bear which cannot be recanted after the second sunrise, therefore, instigates an intimate bonding phase for the two, viscerally the mutual love only exudes when something unusual happens, while living in the mundane life, we are all suffering and grated by the love with a insurmountable generation gap. <br/><br/>Rapunzel, on the other hand, her main barrier is the ultimate breakthrough from her ""mother"" Gothel (a greatly overlooked Donna Murphy), who raises her and locks her up in the tower for 18 years, treats her as her own out of a selfish but very understandable motivation (to rejuvenate her youth), but out of any sequential transition, all of a sudden Rapunzel miraculously remember her princess identity (she was taken away when she was an infant, so I doubt there is any memory there, more like an implausible epiphany or actually a screenwriter's block), what's more unbelievably awkward is that she immediately snarls back to her ""mother"" as if all the recollections of Gothel's evil scheme has been replayed in front of her eyes and she has been tortured for all that year long (actually she is fairly happy and content alone with her cutesy chameleon) , which I deem as a child's play, very much panders to its core audience of pre-school demography. <br/><br/>So, from a vantage point under the contemporary context, BRAVE is far more daring and enthralling from its ""no guts no glory"" premise, it is able to identify with a way broader audience, which is also the main ingredient of the winsome recipe ""why Pixar can keep excelling all its peers (if not itself) on the top-tier of the hierarchy"", in spite of that on a technical level, all the major animation studios in Hollywood (DREAMWORKS, BLUE SKY STUDIOS, etc.) are almost equally cutting-edge. <br/><br/>Music is Disney's strong suit, the first half of TANGLED is a conventional musical showcase, culminating the saccharine romance with the Oscar-nominated theme-song I SEE THE LIGHT, fusing with an intoxicating lanterns-all-over-the-sky spectacle, this has always been the tactic to emit Disney's overblown sentimentality, I am certain it is no longer an all-age proof method now. In BRAVE, although Kelly Macdonald and Emma Thompson's heavy Scottish accents do not get along with my ears, the exotic score and tunes are generally agreeable, and what's more admirable, it doesn't steal the thunder of the film per se. <br/><br/>Honestly speaking after the astonishingly-acclaimed WALL-E (2008, 9/10), UP (2009, 9/10) and TOY STORY 3 (2010, 9/10), I automatically skipped last years CAR 2 (2011), BRAVE is a left-field choice, the scale of the story has been slimmed down to a quite unimaginable mother-daughter clash, even grafting it on the most platitudinous soil of a princess's tale. But by good fortune, the film doesn't smear Pixar's paramount reputation, Merida goes through a well-deployed rite-of-passage and the sub-plots such as the blue wisps, the ancient lore of the discontent brother and the witch's hut are all positioned into the right niche to uplift the mythology and idiosyncrasy of the film. <br/><br/>As for TANGLED, Disney will never relinquish its tradition (otherwise Walt Disney will definitely be jumping inside his tomb), and it is also an exquisitely-made piece of work, just unfortunately paled by comparison by BRAVE since there is no sparks glittering and all the chirpy happiness seems synthetic and a bit stale."

","Even though you just know the ending will be typical for a fairy tale, the ride to the end was a thorough delight. The horse deserves an Oscar. I found myself waiting for it to turn up in every scene. Great animation. I noticed the fabric flowing and moving. I noticed the mouth really caught the natural movements for words and expressions. Was a little put off by the cleavage and buxom-ness--really unnecessary and a distraction. Disney can go back to chaste necklines that were still so feminine. Why does every Disney female now have to took a tad slutty? The witch had her knockers out waaaay too much. Blech.

","The movie itself was cute somewhat heartwarming if you follow the main story, but I'm giving it a couple of stars, Why you ask? I just don't think we should be teaching this type of stuff to young children.<br/><br/>This entire movie reeks of sexual subconscious suggestion from start to finish. I sat down to watch this with my bf we were bored we spent the time pointing out the darker undercurrents of the story.<br/><br/>They portray Repunzle as being a highly emotional perky 18 year old lacking in subtlety, but ready to leave her mothers tower to explore the world. She meets a generic badboy named Flynn who takes her from her tower. At first she feels guilty but her new companion assures her that rebellion against your parents at a young age is perfectly normal and that this is a part of growing up.<br/><br/>From there he shows her around as the movie progresses they get to know each other a bit and open up more, she claims her dream is to see the lanterns released each year annually at the palace. She offers to give back his satchel containing a stolen crown she is withholding in exchange for him taking her to see the lanterns. During her adventure her mother finds the satchel and tracks her down. She says she does not want to go home that she's met someone and that he likes her. But her mother calls her naive and says he only wants the crown; then as I quote the scene of the song mother knows best from the movie itself ""Oh, I see how it is Rapunzel knows best Rapunzel's so mature now Such a clever grown up miss, Rapunzel knows best Fine if you so sure now Go ahead and give him this! This is why he's here Don't let him decived you Give it to him and watch you'll see Trust me my dear That's how far he'd leave you, I won't say ""I told you"" so,....."" The crown itself is very obviously a representation of the girls virginity.<br/><br/>During the film they meet up with Flynn's horse Maximums who represents the male ego or anatomy. Maximums was originally mad at Flynn she tells him not to cause any trouble with him, that its her birthday and he is taking her to see the lanterns. But after her ""Big day"", they can ""chase each other all they want"". I am assuming this deals with issues of him ""playing with himself"" and so forth. He revels to her that his real name is Eugene and says that out of everyone she would be the ""First"" to like his real name. <br/><br/>Now comes the Disney duet aka the sex scene. During mandy moore's song entitled now that I see you. While in a boat at the time of the lanterns being let into the sky the couple sits and she tells him that she has been waiting 18 years for this moment and that she is terrified it won't be everything she hoped. He assures her it will, but when her dream dies she can find a new dream. Then she scoots in eagerly telling him she is giving him the crown, and that she's sorry she didn't before but she was just scared. <br/><br/>They both take a lantern and allow it to float upwards as they circle each other intertwining as the couple continues to sing. The song itself has both the male and female perspectives of sex. They claim they everything has changed now that they ""see each other in a new light"" the female part of it talks about how blind and sheltered she's been as if she's falling in love. The male part claims he has spent all those years chasing down a ""daydream"" not paying attention to what was really there. Then after the song loverboy Flynn stats acting funny and runs off he sells her off to some men and leaves. At that point her mother returns to say I told you so.<br/><br/>Pretty much after that it sums it up to a happy ending (like always), although the big question at the end of the movie was weather or not they got married and the prince says ""after years and years of asking and asking and asking I finally said yes.""<br/><br/>Well I still liked the movie it was cute but the subconscious is a powerful tool it used to help people cope and make changes to how they function. I don't believe it should be used like this and for children of such a young age group it can have effects that impede growth. Despite the fact that this movie is rated pg I don't think anyone under 14 should watch it."
"moviefreak523-690-457443","7","0","6","22 October 2011"," With Tangled, Disney has not reach the same level, yet.
","I'll be the first to admit that I was not impressed with Disney's previous animated film, ""The Princess and the Frog."" I did not really care for the characters all that much, the romance is hardly there, and the songs were mostly forgettable. However, the animation is top-notch...and, that's all I can say that I thought was great about it. I don't dislike it, but I can't say that I like it, either.<br/><br/>So, when they announced their next film will be based on Rapunzel, I thought, ""Okay, cool."" Then, I saw some of the drawings and it got me very excited because they look so beautiful. Then, they changed the title from ""Rapunzel"" to the title what we now call it. I thought it was a stupid decision. Then, I watched the trailer. I started to worry a little. At that point, I was afraid that Disney is trying to broad this movie out to a bigger demographic because the last one didn't performed as well as they hoped at the box-office. So, I decided to miss it then, saying that I'll catch it on DVD. So, after a year or so of people saying that it's a great movie, I can, honestly, say that it was better than I thought it would be. But, I found it to be at the same level, maybe slightly higher, than ""The Princess and the Frog.""<br/><br/>Compared to Disney's previous attempt in making a computer animated film, this is, by far, their best film in that field. Even better than ""Bolt,"" a movie that I love. It is stunning to watch at how beautiful the scenery looks and the how the characters move about. It looks fantastic. And, I'm happy to see that there is a stronger chemistry between the two leads and enough romance to go around. I found it to be very sweet. And, while not laugh out loud funny, I do find it to be very amusing. My favorite part is Rapunzel going bipolar after she leaves the tower for the first time. That was very entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>The animal characters, while good, did not really leave much of a huge impression on me. The horse, Maximus, was a great character, but the chameleon, Pascal, I almost forgot he was in this movie because I could not remember any stand-out scenes with him. Also, where the heck did he come from? I like to know his back-story of how he ended up in the tower with Rapunzel. And, I would love to see some scenes of the King and Queen. The scene where the two were readying to released, and the queen is comforting her husband, I found that to be the most touching scene out of the entire movie. So, based on that, I would have liked to see more of these two.<br/><br/>And, lastly, I am, again, very disappointed in the songs. I could think of two songs in the film that I thought were fine. And, one of them is not the villain song, which is usually my favorite. Speaking of which, this is one of the most boring villains that Disney has ever made. I mean, here is a woman who, not only wants to live forever, but wants to look good doing it. And, that's about it. Okay, not saying that kidnapping a baby and holding her hostage for 18 years isn't evil, but, she has the power to live forever, and she does nothing with it. I mean, imagined if you were in her shoes. What would you have done with it? Yeah, exactly.<br/><br/>And, there is one other song, the ""I had a dream"" song, (which, I find them becoming cornier every time I hear one) that felt like it was force into the movie. It's like Disney had a quota of songs that must be in each animated film, and they ran out of ideas for one more song, so they decided to write a ""having a dream"" song, but instead of letting Rapunzel or Flynn sing it, they make it a silly song, sung by a bunch of misfits that we won't see again, but, in the back of your mind, you know that you will see them again. Spoiler alert.<br/><br/>I don't think this is a bad movie. Heck, I don't think ""The Princess and the Frog"" is a bad movie, as well. But, I did liked ""Tangled"" a little bit more. Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe I have huge nostalgic feelings for older Disney films. But, I have re-watched many of those films, and they are excellent films. The animation is gorgeous and still hold up after all these years, that stories are well told and the characters are lovable, and the songs are very memorable and they fit into the story like a piece of a puzzle. I know people have already called these films as the start of the Third Golden Age for Disney, but, for me, it hasn't arrived yet. To me, they are a good start in leading towards, what I hopefully will be soon, the Golden Age of Disney Animation. For now, these will have to do."
"Ostrumation","Null","0","2","18 August 2011"," Disney's 50th: An All-Around Good Film
","For years, Disney was always the leader in animated entertainment ever since Walt Disney produced the groundbreaking ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". Instead of repeating himself, Walt made more films that always tried something new. After Walt's passing in 1966, the studio has never really been the same. There have been ups (particularly the late 1980s and early 1990s) and downs (the early-to-mid 1980s, 2001-2005), and they have fallen behind studios like Pixar, DreamWorks and even smaller studios like Blue Sky. With ""Tangled"", and ""The Princess and the Frog"" before it, Walt Disney Animation Studios is now fighting their way up back up the animation mountain.<br/><br/>""Tangled"" isn't perfect, but it's an indicator that Disney knows what they are doing. With talent like John Lasseter behind the animation division, the films have gotten better. ""Tangled"" is a wonderful mix of great storytelling, heart, humor and fun. It's what a good Disney film should be. The characters are very appealing and likable, the story is interesting and it has its fair share of dramatic moments, and the musical numbers are essential to the story. This is what made ""The Princess and the Frog"" succeed. While ""Meet the Robinsons"" and ""Bolt"" suffered from some inconsistent writing and dialogue, they still had heart and great storytelling. You can't say the same about the Disney films made under Eisner's final years, films that are a mix of weak storytelling, poor dialogue and lowbrow humor shackled to great animation and production values. The film has some flaws. The first half of the film is inconsistent, with dialogue that feels too much like ""Shrek"" or something from DreamWorks. It's fun, but the film gets progressively better as the second half rolls in. When the second half begins, there's more heart and the story gets more interesting.<br/><br/>The story is well-done while the dialogue could've been a bit better (""The Princess and the Frog"" didn't suffer from this, though many will disagree), and the characters are wonderful. They're appealing, they're likable and they're never annoying. The non-speaking animals steal the show, Rapunzel's chameleon Pascal and the palace guard horse Maximus. They supply most of the film's comic relief, along with Flynn Ryder himself. Mother Gothel is a wonderful villain, one who is a lot like Judge Clause Frollo from ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"". She protects Rapunzel, while also manipulating her and using her for her magical hair. The songs are good, but they aren't great, with the exception of the brilliant love song, ""I See The Light"". Still, ""Mother Knows Best"" says a lot about Mother Gothel's character and her relationship with Rapunzel and ""I Have a Dream"" is very enjoyable.<br/><br/>""Tangled"" is basically an entertaining Disney film. It isn't an earth-shattering film that's worthy of Walt Disney's greatest films, but it's a little better than the repetitive films under the Michael Eisner era. It's bright, it's fun and it has heart. The first half is a bit flimsy, but the second half feels like a Pixar film with its heartfelt moments and the storytelling. Out of the four post-Eisner Disney films, I wouldn't say it's the best. Most people didn't care for ""The Princess and the Frog"", but I felt that ""Princess"" had better dialogue and storytelling than this film, and better music. I know many will disagree, but at times, ""Tangled"" felt very flimsy. Still, it's an all-around good film that is perfect for the young and old."

","So my journey to Tangled was a long and confusing emotional roller coaster. As a life-long fan of both Disney Animation and Glen Keane I was excited by the prospect of Mr. Keane directing Disney's grand return to the fairy tale, but as time went on Disney gave us a a change of directors, a terrible name change from Rapunzel to Tangled, and a god-awful marketing campaign to try to attract the boys who apparently stayed away from The Princess and the Frog. All this news really disappointed me and crushed a lot of my hopes for Disney's grand return to the glory days of animation. Eventually though, the reviews started coming back positive and I returned to a state of cautious optimism. Now I've seen the movie and I can finally tell you my feelings once and for all. <br/><br/>Tangled, is a good movie, but unfortunately, like Disney's last attempt to bring back ""classic Disney Animation"" (The Princess and the Frog) it was a bit too much of a mixed bag to really be great. The animation and art style in the movie are gorgeous; the landscapes really feel like a dimensional paintings and Glen Keane's attempt to bring the fluidity and warmth of hand drawn animation to CG was definitely successful (though I do feel, especially after seeing some of the hand-drawn character concepts, that the movie might have stood out a bit more if it had been hand-animated). <br/><br/>The first act of the movie starts off fairly promising until we arrive at the first song, this is definitely one of Disney's, and Alan Menken's, weakest musicals. Especially in the beginning of the film, the songs don't really feel like an integrated and important part of the story telling, but rather an annoying distraction from it. The beginning of the movie does, however, do a good job of setting up the characters, including my personal favorite: Flynn Rider, voiced by Chuck's Zachary Levi. Flynn is such a brilliant character, because unlike most fairy tale heroes, he realizes just how bizarre everything going on really is. It's a great modern twist that doesn't feel too Shrek-ish. <br/><br/>In the second and third acts things vastly improve, this is when it really starts to feel like it can maybe stand on the same shelf next to the likes of Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid. As the relationship of Flynn and Rapunzel grows, we also get some great moments from the film's primary villain all leading toward an exciting, if somewhat predictable conclusion. In the midst of this ending, however the writers pull a very disappointing (and cliché) Deus ex machina plot device which, at least in my opinion, invalidated a lot of the emotion of the ending. <br/><br/>Disney has said that Tangled is to be the last fairy tale that the company produces for the foreseeable future, and as disappointing as that sounds on paper, I can't help but feel that it's the right decision for the company at this point. Unfortunately while watching Tangled, you can't help but compare it to the great Disney animated fairy tales like Sleeping Beauty and Beauty and the Beast. Until Disney can do something to really reinvent the genre like The Little Mermaid did, staying away from fairy tales is the best thing they can do. Part of Pixar's success is that they have been consistently doing what no one else in animation has done. Tangled was enjoyable, and I'm certainly glad I saw it, but it unfortunately pales in comparison to other animated films like How to Train Your Dragon and Toy Story 3 and doesn't live up to the precedent set by Disney's previous fairy tales. <br/><br/>Rating: B"
"kdnor2011","9","0","2","13 June 2011"," I loved this movie
","I am pretty much in the far opposite group, that this movie was aimed at. I'm an 18 year old boy, who's graduating high school soon, and is worried about his future, why should I waste my time watching a fairytale. Well Tangled was fairytale I watched, and it made me feel like a kid again.<br/><br/>First off, the animation is beautiful, Repunzul's hair looked so real, I wanted to reach into the screen and touch it. The characters are great, Flynn was the perfect jerk character, he's so unlikable, that you can't help but love him. Repunzul is charming, and the horse Maximus had me laughing at everything he did. The action scenes are fun and creative, and the ending came as a big shock, it even took one of the worst cliché's ever, and made me not care that I had seen it before.<br/><br/>One of the things that disappointed me were the songs, only two were memorable, the rest were fine, but completely forgettable. ""When will My life Begin,"" and ""Mother Knows Best,"" are still trapped in my head though, I rank up there with my other favorite Disney songs like ""Under the Sea,"" ""One Jump Ahead,"" ""Be our Guest,"" I just Can't wait to be King,"" ""Savages,"" and ""I'll make a man out of you."" Although I still think I like Bolt a little bit more, Tangled shows that Disney can make a great CGI movie, and I hope for more in the future."
"thetimegivenus","9","0","8","4 March 2011"," Most beautiful film ever
","I've got to admit Disney's Tangled is the most beautiful animated film I have ever seen. Unfortunately, it also has the one of most dangerous messages of any animated film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The Story: Once upon a time in a land far away, a drop of sunlight fell to the ground. From that drop grew a magical flower which would heal any wound and could even reverse the affects of time. Some years later, a queen in a nearby kingdom was giving birth. It was a difficult labor, and the kingdom's doctors were afraid she wouldn't make it. So the entire kingdom set out to find this flower to heal the queen. Their search was successful, and the queen gave birth to a beautiful baby daughter.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, someone else knew about the flower and would stop at nothing to get back it's power.<br/><br/>The Good: Technically speaking, this film excelled. The animation was beautiful, the story was well thought out, the characters were delightful, and, despite my not being a big fan of musicals or Alen Menken soundtracks, I actually enjoyed the music of Tangled. Sadly, while there are several other themes which could have been very powerful, the overarching message of the film corrupted them to the point that they are hardly worth mentioning here.<br/><br/>The Bad: As I mentioned earlier, this film has some very dangerous messages. While Mother Gothel isn't Rapunzel's real mother, and is in fact a very evil woman using Rapunzel for her own good, Rapunzel believes that Gothel is her mother and therefore she deserves her respect and obedience. After Rapunzel runs away with Flynn, she does feel some regret for her actions, but doesn't repent of her disobedience. While Rapunzel later learns that Gothel isn't her mother and doesn't deserve any respect or obedience, this cannot be used to excuse her intentional disobedience. Flynn also mentions that rebellion is just part of growing up, and while that does seem to be true nowadays, it is certainly not right.<br/><br/>Also troubling is the relationship that grows between Rapunzel and Flynn. For most of the film it's handled fairly well, but towards the end of the film they blow it with a kiss and a rather lengthy embrace. There are also some low-cut dresses, particularly on Mother Gothel, and magic is involved in the story, though to a lesser extent than in many other fairy tales.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I have rather mixed feelings about this film. On the one hand, it is a beautiful piece of animation, and I found the story to be both entertaining and enjoyable. On the other hand, some of the messages tangled into the story are quite dangerous. Sadly, I cannot recommend this movie for families."
"nEoFILM","6","0","8","3 March 2011"," Not Shrek 5... Though I can understand the error...
","Last night I went to see Shrek 5 No, I actually went to see a Disney digimation which was trying to cash in on the former franchise. But despite its look, this was Disney through and through. Lacking the wit of Pixar and the sharp zaniness of Dreamworks, this was part musical, part sweeping rom-com.<br/><br/>What has happened to this studio, when they lack the confidence to make their films, their way? If this had been hand drawn animation it would have been twice the film, but instead we're treated to a mongrel 3D digimation with the story and style of Disney, Dreamworks and Pixar, but done without any of the flare of any of them.<br/><br/>The 3D was effective but the whole concept is now becoming very, very boring and I would have preferred to have seen it in 2D to be honest. It was never the less enjoyable, it made me laugh and some of the character development was quite effective, such a the horse, Maximus, who was as far removed from Shrek's 'Donkey' as you could imagine, especially as he never utters a word! I recon that kids and pure Disney fans will lap this up, though it is no Lion King, it's certainly an entertaining animation."
"Igenlode Wordsmith","7","0","3","18 January 2011"," Good, but somehow not great
","I saw the UK preview screening of this film -- largely, I confess, because I was intrigued by the rumoured 'Errol Flynn influences' -- and feel a little mean in awarding it only 7 out of ten, when I have consciously awarded more obviously flawed films an 8: but somehow I feel that it's good but not great. <br/><br/>Good points: The creators' stated aim was to recapture the ""cool, retro look"" of the classic Disney animations in the 3D format, and they've certainly done a good job in that. The 3D is much less jumpy than in most live-action films I've seen, and is not intrusive save for a couple of scenes where things start to separate out into 'planes'; whether it actually enhances the film is I think questionable (see the credits sequence for a lively 2D rendition of the same characters), but it doesn't detract. The much-trailed 'post-modern' elements are far fewer and further between than publicity had suggested, and while they grated on this viewer (""I don't do back-story"" ""So you want to make me the bad guy?"") the film more or less gets away with it.<br/><br/>The storyline is dense and well thought-out, neatly explaining a number of issues (why is Rapunzel's hair have to be so long? How can she realise who she really is? How did the witch get up to the tower when Rapunzel was still a baby?) without labouring the point, and setting up all the necessary elements well in advance of when they are needed. The 'Errol Flynn influence' is, I would say, unquestionable (although it's not necessarily presented as being a good thing, so far as the character is concerned!) <br/><br/>In addition, there is no annoying squeaky-voiced sidekick -- one Disney 2D tradition that I can very happily do without! Instead, we get a couple of blessedly non-vocal animals who communicate in the silent-movie tradition of Wallace's Gromit: the chameleon actually manages to be very funny, and Maximus the proud horse is eloquent without a word, in addition to being much smarter than his master...<br/><br/>Bad points: The music I didn't care for. This is no ""Beauty and the Beast"" -- the best songs to my taste were the entertaining 'character' numbers ""Mother Knows Best"" and ""I've Got a Dream"", while the big pop-style ballads don't do a thing for me, I'm afraid.<br/><br/>And American teen-speak in fairy tales really grates, unfortunately. It's not reasonable -- if I can swallow contemporary street slang in 1930s dramas, I ought to be able to handle its modern equivalent in today's Hollywood output -- but for me such expressions as ""Stop with the mumbling"" and ""I am so not going back!"" have the same result as Hobbits scampering through fields of medieval European maize: so culturally jarring as to rip me out of the story temporarily.<br/><br/>Overall, that's far more good points than bad, yet I wouldn't rank this film alongside ""Mulan"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"", my favourite Disney animations of the recent era. It's slick and quick and well-made, with good moments and thrills (although the latter, ironically, were a little too 'CGI' and large in scale to involve me fully), but I'm not sure it's going to be a classic. For me, something was missing."
"PYRiAH","8","0","2","5 December 2010"," Tangled, a movie for all audiences?
","It is no secret that I am a fan of Disney movies. I don't care what anyone thinks; I like good animation and a good story. It also no secret that Disney is one sided when it comes to movies geared to girls than towards boys. The boys get crap while the ""princesses"" have a whole park dedicated to them. So I was a little happy to hear that Disney was doing its version of the story Rapunzel but instead calling it ""Tangled"" because they were going to try appeal to coed audience. How on earth did they expect to do this? I mean the movie is about an 18 year-old girl with long blond hair, little boys aren't interested in that at allyet.<br/><br/>See full review at www.flicksworthwatching.com."
"moviemanMA","7","0","6","28 November 2010"," Beautiful animation meets mediocre dialogue
","Tangled is Disney's take on the classic tale of Rapunzel. The story of a princess stolen away from her parents as a baby and locked away in a secret tower. She is kept there by a woman, Mother Gothel, imposing as her mother. Rapunzel is no ordinary girl however, for her hair holds the power to heal those who touch it, and more importantly for Mother Gothel, keep her looking younger. There is a catch: should her hair but cut, the spell would be broken. As we all know, Rapunzel has very, very long hair.<br/><br/>Just days before her 18th birthday, Rapunzel yearns to leave the tower, because every year on her birthday there is a strange phenomenon that occurs in the sky; a mass of star like objects float up to the heavens. Rapunzel has dreamed her whole life to see in person where these stars come from. Her dreams are answered when Flynn Rider, a thief, stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower while making a getaway. Rapunzel hides his loot and will return it should Flynn show her where the stars come from.<br/><br/>Though not true to the original story of Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm, the story remains intact for the most part. This is true for the majority of fairy tales adapted by Disney, mainly to appease audiences and to entertain rather than frighten children, something all too common theme in Brothers Grimm fairy tales.<br/><br/>That said, you can only go so far in changing a story. The problem with this film is how they start to step on the toes of other fairy tales and films made in the past (and even other studios). One scene that sticks out is between Flynn and Rapunzel in a small row boat in front of the castle. It's eerily similar to the ""Kiss the Girl"" sequence from The Little Mermaid, even including Rapunzel's little friend Pascal, a tiny chameleon (Sebastian the crab anyone? At least Pascal doesn't sing). I also found some similarities to Dreamworks' Shrek, simply because we have a damsel in distress, rescued by an unlikely hero, and reluctantly guiding her back to a castle. Just a thought.<br/><br/>Another aspect essential to a Disney ""princess"" movie is the song selection, something The Princess and the Frog nailed last year, There aren't a lot of musical numbers, only four or five, and luckily they're not terrible. It's not their best work, but it's hard for composer Alan Menken to top his previous work, which brought him home eight Oscars (Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, etc.) It helps that Mandy Moore has the pipes to handle the work load, even though every time I looked at Rapunzel I saw Taylor Swift.<br/><br/>What makes Rapunzel special is the animation. This is Disney' Animation Studio's fourth feature done completely with CGI, and their patience paid off. Chicken Little, Meet the Robinsons, and Bolt all had bright spots, but all fell short. Here they finally captured the most important ingredient to properly animating a CGI film: texture and lighting. If you watch the Pixar films, you can see how with each film they get better and better with texture and lighting. As the technology improves, so does the image. It also helps that they are getting more practice with the medium.<br/><br/>The Disney artists were inspired by Jean-Honoré Fragonard's The Swing, a beautiful oil painting true to its Rococo style, an art movement that focused on ornate, free flowing designs. Much like Rapunzel's hair the artists on this film truly met the challenge of capturing the style of the painting, creating landscapes that were unique and alive. Rapunzel's tower, the forest leading up to the castle, and the town surrounding the castle itself exemplify this style.<br/><br/>Though I enjoyed the look of the film, I wasn't a fan of seeing it in 3D. I found myself looking over the top of my 3D spectacles and see what the film would look like, and I feel like the images would be just fine without it. Though the panorama views look nice, it's not necessary to view them in the third dimension. I understand that the revenue from 3D films is a tremendous boost in box office numbers, but sometimes it's overkill. I felt the same way for Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>I recommend this strongly for families. The kids will love it. Those looking for a deep, thought provoking animated film in the same vain as Pixar or foreign animation, look elsewhere. Unless you can tune your ear out periodically to embrace the images, enjoy. It's hard to say no to a Disney movie, but until they can consistently turn out hand drawn features, I must issue a warning. A slight one, but a warning nonetheless."
