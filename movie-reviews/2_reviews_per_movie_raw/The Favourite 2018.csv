"Bertaut","7","329","422","20 January 2019"," Fans of Yorgos Lanthimos will love it. I'm not sure about everyone else
","The Favourite, the seventh feature from Greek auteur <a href=""/name/nm0487166/"">Yorgos Lanthimos</a>, is a film that eschews both convention and expectation. On the other hand, it's also Lanthimos's most accessible by a country mile. A savage morality play, a camp comedy of manners, a Baroque tragedy, an allegorical study of the corruptive nature of power - it's all of these and yet none of them. A film I liked but didn't love, on the one hand, it's too long, the plot too threadbare, and the metaphors and allegories too ill defined. On the other, the acting is flawless, it looks amazing, the first half is very, very funny, and the end is very, very dark, with the last shot one of the most haunting/disturbing images I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Set in England in 1708, the film tells the story of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (an icy <a href=""/name/nm0001838/"">Rachel Weisz</a>) and one-time scullery maid Abigail Hill (<a href=""/name/nm1297015/"">Emma Stone</a>, charting a course from doe-eyed ingénue to vicious Machiavellian intrigant) and their increasingly bitter rivalry for the affections of Queen Anne (an absolutely mesmerising <a href=""/name/nm1469236/"">Olivia Colman</a>), and is the first film Lanthimos has directed which neither he nor <a href=""/name/nm3328207/"">Efthymis Filippou</a> wrote (the script was originally written by <a href=""/name/nm7629302/"">Deborah Davis</a> in 1998 and later refined by <a href=""/name/nm1110111/"">Tony McNamara</a>). Although it deals with real historical personages and events, historians probably won't be too thrilled to learn that Lanthimos is relatively uninterested in either historical actuality or socio-political contextualisation (to say nothing of the slam dancing). This is a story about a love triangle, with everything else just the background noise against which that triangle plays out.<br/><br/>And it is most definitely a Yorgos Lanthimos film, with his peculiar Weltanschauung omnipresent. The emotionless and monotone delivery of dialogue has been scaled back considerably from <a href=""/title/tt3464902/"">The Lobster (2015)</a> and <a href=""/title/tt5715874/"">The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017)</a>, but everything else you'd expect is here - the pseudo-omniscient judgemental glare; the dark absurdist humour; the formal rigidity; the emotional isolation of the characters; the surrealism; the games of psychological one-upmanship; the alienation of the audience; the thematic centrality of shifting power relations; the lack of distinction between poignancy and joviality; the use of self-contained and closed off pocket universes where characters must play by rules differing from those of the outside world; intimate familial conflict (except in bigger rooms than in his previous films); and a disorienting score. Similarly, whilst The Lobster was a savage dystopian-set allegory for discipline and conformity, The Favourite is a merciless satire of decadence and pettiness, taking in such additional themes as class, gender, love, lust, duty, loyalty, partisan politics, patriarchal hegemony, and women behaving just as appallingly as men.<br/><br/>As one would expect from Lanthimos, the film is aesthetically flawless, with many of the compositions having the appearance of a fête galante painting, so meticulously integrated are <a href=""/name/nm0694309/"">Sandy Powell</a>'s costume design, <a href=""/name/nm2356249/"">Fiona Crombie</a>'s production design, and <a href=""/name/nm0752811/"">Robbie Ryan</a>'s cinematography. Powell's costumes are historically inaccurate, but thematically revealing, with the situation of the characters at any given moment directly influencing the design, especially in relation to Abigail as she climbs the social ladder. In a more general sense, the black-and-white colour scheme of much of the wardrobe contrasts magnificently with Crombie's predominantly brown production design, with the actors effortlessly standing out from the backgrounds.<br/><br/>Of Ryan's photography, perhaps the most impressive feat is that, despite the many scenes tracking characters through rooms, up stairs, and out doorways, there's not a single Steadicam shot anywhere in the film. He also makes copious use of 6mm fish-eye lenses, which distort the spaces the characters occupy whilst also showing much more of the environment than a normal lens, creating the sense of characters lost within an overload of background visual detail. Combined with the whip pans seen throughout the film, the cumulative effect is a world rendered strange, a place of distortion and unnatural compositions. As with most of Lanthimos' work, the film also uses natural light, which makes for some stunning candle-lit night-time compositions, partially recalling the paintings of someone like Jean-Antoine Watteau or, even moreso, Georges de La Tour.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, there really are no words to describe just how good Colman is. Utterly inhabiting the character, she is able to elicit empathy mere moments after behaving thoroughly shamefully, communicating a sense of both tragic inevitability and a childlike refusal to accept reality. The character could easily have been a grotesque villain or a pitiful broken shell, but Colman finds a nobler middle ground, straddling both interpretations without fully committing to either, moving from one to the other seamlessly throughout the film. Yes, she can be a horrible person with appalling manners and questionable hygiene, but she is also deeply lonely, a survivor who has lost 17 children in childbirth, a woman whose health has made her old before her time, a tragic figure too naïve to see how badly she is being manipulated by Sarah and Abigail. Rather than trying to downplay the contradictory facets of the character, Colman leans into them, illuminating Anne's humanity amongst her least appealing characteristics, and finding both wit and pathos in a character whose mercurial nature and excessive neediness could easily have rendered her the film's antagonist. It truly is one of the finest on-screen performances in a long time.<br/><br/>The film's most salient theme, one could argue its very raison d'être, is the dynamic of gender politics. For starters, it's headlined by three actresses (something which is still rare enough as to be notable), whilst the men are portrayed as petty, vainglorious idiots. Men, in general, are background players, existing only to be mocked, exploited, and duped - with their ridiculous wigs and heavy makeup, they exist only to support the women. However, what's especially interesting about the film's depiction of gender is that the world of women is anything but a utopia. Yes, it's relatively free of toxic masculinity and the male gaze, but in most other aspects, there's no real difference between the matriarchy and the patriarchy. Sure, the women are much smarter than the men who surround them, but they are no less greedy or cruel. At the film's post-première press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos explained, ""what we tried to do is portray women as human beings. Because of the prevalent male gaze in cinema, women are portrayed as housewives, girlfriends...Our small contribution is we're just trying to show them as complex and wonderful and horrific as they are, like other human beings."" Similarly, when asked by the Hollywood Reporter if a film about females treating each other badly might be considered a setback in a post #MeToo era, Colman explained, ""How can it set women back to prove that women fart and vomit and hate and love and do all the things men do? All human beings are the same. We're all multifaceted, many-layered, disgusting and gorgeous and powerful and weak and filthy and brilliant. That's what's nice. It doesn't make women an old-fashioned thing of delicacy.""<br/><br/>As regards criticisms, although I personally wouldn't class them as flaws, some people will probably dislike the same things that many have disliked in Lanthimos's previous work - cold formal rigidity, perverse sense of humour, and irredeemable characters being irredeemably horrible to one another. There will be those who find the obviously intentional anachronisms too much, whilst others will take umbrage with the disregard for historical authenticity. For me, whilst I admire Lanthimos for trying to bring something new to his oeuvre, especially when compared to Sacred Deer (which just repeated the beats of The Lobster), I felt the film was oftentimes trying to work its way through an identity crisis, unsure of exactly what kind of tone to settle on. I had similar feelings about the allegories that run throughout, and are never what you would call fully fleshed out. Obviously, it's a treatise on power and the ridiculous opulence of royalty, but that's not exactly an untapped issue in cinema. Additionally, one of my biggest problems with Sacred Deer was how utterly pointless it felt, and although I got a lot more out of The Favourite, I had something of the same reaction to it. It could also be argued that the characters are a little two dimensional, and filmgoers who need a protagonist to latch onto, someone to root for, will be left rudderless.<br/><br/>Superior to <a href=""/title/tt1859446/"">Alpeis (2011)</a> and Sacred Deer, but not a patch on <a href=""/title/tt1379182/"">Kynodontas (2009)</a> or The Lobster, The Favourite will probably attract a sizable unprepared audience because of awards buzz, positive reviews, and excellent trailer. Undoubtedly, for a lot of people, this will be their first exposure to Lanthimos, and I can only imagine what people expecting a Merchant Ivory costume drama will make of it all. Neither morally enlightening nor historically respectful, The Favourite offers a bleak assessment of humanity's core drives; not Lanthimos's bleakest, but a hell of a lot more nihilistic than an average multiplex goer will be used to. The characters within the film live in a milieu of egotism, narcissism, sexual cruelty, psychological bullying, greed, and hunger for power. There's barely a hint of sentimentality, and very little that could be called morally righteous. I would have liked it to have more meat on its bones, but at the same time, one cannot deny that it presents something of a faithful looking-glass, as Lanthimos continues to corner the market in pointing out not just humanity's worst foibles, but its most egregious eccentricities and lamentable character defects."
"roblesar99","8","454","663","22 September 2018"," Lanthimos Delivers... But The Ending Could Use Some Work
","Sumptuous and stunning. With THE FAVOURITE, director Yorgos Lanthimos delivers his best film yet - one that works as both a historical drama and a sex comedy that features beautiful cinematography courtesy of Robbie Ryan (Lanthimos really loves him some fisheye lenses) and gorgeous costume design courtesy of Sandy Powell (just give her the Oscar already because wow). Lanthimos, working for the first time with a screenplay that he didn't co-write, deals primarily with themes of power and the way it impacts the three women at the center of the film. Despite not having had a hand in writing the screenplay, Lanthimos seems to be in his wheelhouse, crafting a stirring yet (darkly) humorous rumination on humankind's innate desire to posses power, whether it be political, sexual, or anything in between. Granted, Lanthimos is also working with some of the most talented actresses working today and the big three (Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone) all deliver some of the best work of their career. As crazy as it might sound, however, and despite Colman's Best Actress win at Venice for her portrayal of Queen Anne, this is Stone's film. I'm already frustrated by the fact that she will be campaigned in the Best Supporting Actress field despite the fact that the film wholly follows her arc. That's not to take anything from Colman, whose performance is likely the most impressive of the three, but I do feel it's something to take note of.<br/><br/>However, the film isn't flawless, and it once again demonstrates that Lanthimos' greatest weakness as a director is his inability to deliver a satisfying conclusion. I loved THE LOBSTER, but the last ten minutes left a bitter taste in my mouth that I detested. I was a bit cooler on THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER, and the last ten minutes proved a bit too dark for me. This time, even a great final shot isn't enough to save the last fifteen minutes of the film from seeming necessary. The film simply (and suddenly) runs out of steam before it crosses the finish line - an unfortunate occurrence considering the fact that nearly everything before it proved wickedly entertaining. That being said, I'm excited to see what Lanthimos does next. I just hope he nails the ending."

","In early 18th century, the friendship between Anne, first Queen of Great Britain and Lady Sarah Churchill, the wife of the Duke of Marlborough, was very close and then deteriorated because of their differing political views and the growing influence of another favorite, Abigail Masham.

","I read the rave reviews before the film opened and really looked forward to it. I read them after the I'd seen the film and thought that I must have inadvertently gone into the wrong screening and watched a different film. The film I watched turned out to be an overblown (at least 30 minutes too long) stylised, pretentious piece of nonsense only saved by three great actresses at the absolute peak of their powers. The soundtrack was as irritating as it was superfluous and the foul language as gratuitous as it was unnecessary. I thought that maybe my response was because I didn't get it, being English and familiar with this type of film, but I saw the film in the US and the mood of the audience throughout and especially upon the ridiculous ending was almost unanimously negative - and volubly so. I realise that in terms of reviews I appear to be in a tiny, tiny minority but if I can save one person from wasting their money on this film my work will have been done."

DO NOT be fooled by the glowing reviews. You've been warned."
"andrewestrella","Null","897","1503","14 December 2018"," The Absurdity of This Film Was Too Much for Me
","Let me preface my review with me saying that I have never had a film experience where I have been genuinely uncomfortable in. I have watched The Human Centipede Series, Saw, and plenty of other gory cinema that has hardly made me cringe. But for some odd reason, The Favourite made me cringe and feel sick half of the time.<br/><br/>Now STOP. Before you flag my review or declare me unhelpful. Let me say this: I think the film had a unique score, excellent acting all around, an intriguing story, and played off the tropes of stereotypical British historical dramas, but the film was not for me.<br/><br/>Because honestly, the absurdity of this film was way too much for me, and I hardly ever say that. I will acknowledge the film was great technically and narratively, but I couldn't stand it.<br/><br/>The Favourite is supposed to be a historical drama with tons of comedy and a light bit of thriller thrown into it, but when it came to the comedy, I couldn't get with it. While the Laemmle Playhouse audience laughed at every single line of dialogue that would come out of someone's mouth, I could not take it. I think throughout the whole film, I laughed maybe 15%, and about 80% of that laughter was cringe laughter. A lot of the film was pure bonkers, and I couldn't really get into it.<br/><br/>The concept of playing against the trope that British historical figures are normally conservative and well spoken, and having them instead be balls-to-the-wall mentally insane and outlandish in this film, is an interesting idea, but it did not work for me. There is literally a scene where a character gives a monologue to the camera about their evil plan, while stroking her newlywed's member. And I was thinking, what in the actual hell?? It was funny, but it was more weird than anything.<br/><br/>The film as a whole is just weird. I don't think it really cares as much about the narrative or the characters, but with how weird the setting can be. Whether it is really out of place dancing in the ball room (the only scene I burst out laughing at), the queen declaring how much they want to get oral pleasure, girls bathing in mud, really loud and obnoxious screaming, an annoying fish-eye lens, continuous rubbing of old women's feet, and even more screaming, I just couldn't find a point to any of it.<br/><br/>It is almost like the director is like ""hey bro, look at how outlandish I made these uptight British royalty look. HAHA! Funny, funny!"" I did not even really care.<br/><br/>I will give the film a rewatch when it comes out on digital, and have subtitles included, because sometimes that improves my film experience. But from what I can tell, The Favourite is definitely not really my cup of tea.<br/><br/>I will say this though: I will probably enjoy The Lobster and Dogtooth more than I will with this. Perhaps because they are not in a British royalty setting, which I have a hard time getting to in the first place.<br/><br/>Anyways, try not to hate me please. Remember, I acknowledge the achievements of the film, but it does not work for me. Think of that before you lynch me."

"andrewroy-04316","8","92","148","23 February 2019"," Funny and with extremely memorable characters, The Favourite is a fun and weird character-driven period drama
","While Lanthimos continues his eccentric and absurdist filmmaking tendencies, The Favourite is still an easy one to get behind and think deeply about. The premise is essential to all of the plot machinations: in early 18th century England, we are in Queen Anne's court, where political power and maneuvering is everything. Queen Anne is an entertaining central figure, as while all politics revolve around her and she can do what she wants, she also seems like a puppet and easily influenced. The real heart of the movie is Abigail's character arc and her rivalry with Sarah. Abigail, played wonderfully by Emma Stone (who in my opinion should've been considered the lead actress, not Olivia Colman), comes from a family who was wealthy but fell far, and comes to her cousin Sarah looking for a job in the palace. Sarah is intelligent, knowledgeable in the political game, and the Queen's closest adviser. Abigail is immediately who we root for, as an outsider ready to work hard and earn a successful role near the Queen. We see her develop from believing that the best way to rise is through honor and loyalty, but quickly sees that everyone is playing political games and becomes ruthless in outstripping Sarah for the Queen's affection. The script is phenomenal and treats the characters very consistently but never one-dimensionally, by clearly showing their motivations but also portraying them realistically as humans. The humor really works, from the absurdist touches like the duck races to the funny dialogue, like when Sarah tells the Queen she looks like a badger and the Queen agrees. The ending, while an ambiguous one, I think symbolizes the Queen's loneliness and struggle for control, as that final shot of Abigail rubbing her leg fades into rabbits. There seems to be a lot going on, but really it's a fun character drama between these three players in an extremely politically charged and power driven society, and particularly Abigail's development and increasing ruthlessness within that framework. On all of those counts, it's very successful as a film, balancing coherence and intelligent filmmaking with innovation and quirks as Lanthimos always does. Every scene builds up and further develops the characters, and none contradict or seem meaningless, which is a sign of a great movie and great script.
Purely for my own future memory, I'm copying down a line I thought was really funny: ""Obviously you have chosen to keep the particulars of your dismissal from me. I shall leave a gap in the conversation for you to remedy that."""
"howard-85268","1","286","491","2 January 2019"," History high-jacked to provide vehicle for contemporary sensibilities
","I was invited to see this film by my wife and had no pre-conceptions other than admiring Olivia Colman's work on British television. I did not know the director or his previous films. I am no historian and know very little about the period in which the film is set. Understanding context is crucial to the telling of any story, yet the viewer is given very little information about how the main characters came to be in the situation depicted: How had Anne become queen? Who had given her multiple miscarriages and been father of her deceased offspring? We are not even given a date to hang the events on. This is probably deliberate since it gave the director the freedom that imprecision allows to impose his own agenda on what for many is little-known period of English history - which is exactly what he does.<br/><br/>What follows is two hours featuring some fine female performances, lavish costumes and location settings, incongruous dialogue, clumsy 'shock' scenes, sub-Greenaway imagery accompanied by a disjointed and distracting soundtrack.<br/><br/>Subsequent reading has revealed that director Lanthimos aims to produce a disconnection between dialogue and setting and to alienate through language - in this regard the film must surely be seen as a triumph.<br/><br/>However, I suggest that cinema relies upon more than the implementation of an intellectual conception. The almost unanimous praise of this film by critics is notably at odds with the comments of those who have actually paid to watch the film, many of whom were encouraged by praise heaped upon it. The audience I watched the film with were not rolling in the aisles in response to the apparently intended humour, aside from the odd embarrassed titter, it was silent and the speed with which they left the auditorium wondering what possible connection Elton John had with Queen Anne was notable.<br/><br/>This was probably not helped by the unreadable 'style over function' graphics used for the end-credits. As a professional graphic designer, I deplore the approach which is disrespectful to both contributors and audience. It typifies the arrogance of a film that has high-jacked history to provide a vehicle for contemporary sensibilities.<br/><br/>With little narrative momentum or development, The Favourite descends into over-long, self-indulgent tedium. A likely candidate for an armful of Oscars and Baftas."
"rsmithsd","1","532","946","16 December 2018"," Absolutely awful
","I literately signed up with IMDB to share was an awful travesty this film is. First of all, it is not a comedy. It is two hours of ugliness. A few chuckles ensued in my full house audience in the first half hour, because they expected to come for a comedy, which gave way to nervous chuckles, and capped off with confused WTH expressions as the awful conclusion. There is no plot, a story, but no plot. One would think this hack of a director would have learned this in film school. I mean the rest of the film with its sophomoric over the top lens selections and transitions screamed ""look, I went to film school!"". And my god, the awful sound track ALONE had me thinking of heading to the door, with the ostensibly tension building staccato beat invoked not once but TWICE with no correlation to the scenes. Do yourself a HUGE favor, ignore the positive reviews, skip this one and go watch Dangerous Liaisons."
"andrebacci-88902","10","346","614","6 November 2018"," Eccentric, witty, and delightful
","Enthralling from the very beginning and bursting with enthusiasm, this endlessly funny period piece, mixed with a ravishing love triangle, is Lanthimos at his most accessible, all while maintaining the mordacious social commentary and absurdist tone that made him such a phenomenon. Needless to say, ""The Favourite"" is marvelously shot, capturing with elegance the grandeur of its setting through gorgeous steadicam and extravagant wide angles, but what really sets it apart are the characters that are shown against it. Arguably the most fascinating showcase of acting from each of its three leads, the dynamics of the trio are effervescent, chock-full of disdainful side-glances, sharp smiles and lascivious touches, making every man look like a disposable accessory. Weisz is ever caustic as Sarah Churchill, the queen's confidant and lover, who actually rules the kingdom through her, and Stone is ravishing as Abigail, Sarah's cousin, who plays a naïve, gleeful servant, but secretly will spare no efforts in order to become the queen's new favourite. However, it is Colman who steals the spotlight, through her mesmerizing performance of Queen Anne. Infantile and broken, impulsive and lustful, needy and erratic all at once, she takes credit for almost every one of the most iconic moments of the film, which are several, through her delicious tantrums and hilarious excesses, but most notably, through a few long, mathematically precise close-ups, during which her expression changes so subtly, yet so richly, that she conveys an extensive array of emotions, disarming the viewer with desperate loneliness and melancholy.
All of that innovating and beguiling experience could never have been made possible without an incredibly solid script, whose segmented structure and whimsically titled chapters make the audience anticipate, with an expectant smile, what kind of wicked schemes and betrayals will come next. While it is riveting and lively until two thirds well into the plot, some of the viewers might be left disappointed at how it becomes hopeless and dark. The sudden change of pace, however, is deliberate and calculated, leading to a visually unforgetable ending scene, as each of the characters finally realize the inescapable consequences of their extravagant behaviours.
Ultimately, ""The Favourite"" is an admirable confluence of talent, whose likes mainstream cinema only glimpses rarely, and that will leave audiences marveled and eager for more."

","Interesting thing about this movie, is that there was no likable character at all. That would normally irritate me as I crave a purpose or something to relate to. It's impressive to have felt such a general disappointment in the nature of humanity (honestly shown as cruel, stubborn, helpless, and self-seeking), and still be very drawn in to the dynamics between these people, and some very unexpected moments. It was quirky and witty. Perhaps the most likable person was the dude Abigail marries (such a small part I can't even remember his name in movie)! He was cute and charming, poor guy. Despite having no character to ""root"" for or connect with (unless you take an exestential journey into the good and bad in all of us and question just how far you would go to get what you think you want out of life...), it was very entertaining, emotional, and captivating. It was clear early on, there is no real winner in this story, however it ends. And the final scene creates a monument to that effect. I really wanted Abigail to be sweet and innocent and her ""goodness"" to prevail, as a fairy tale... but actually the way it was is exactly right. I loved Sarah's line to Abigail saying something like ""you really think you won? We are playing different games"" (or something I know that's off).

There were a couple scenes where they replayed the same couple rhythmic notes over and over and over and over again. And it was to no obvious purpose unless their point was to piss me off and distract me. Dunkirk has some similar musicnear the beginning. But in Dunkirk it reflected the building tension of the scene and sped up. In the Favourite it felt like a poor imitation which didn't understand why it worked in Dunkirk.<br/><br/>Most of the time the score was fine. But the 2 moments with the repeating rhythm were difficult to overlook.<br/><br/>The use of fowl language and gratuity didn't bother me. But too often I couldn't understand the overall purpose or goal or insinuations of other moments. At times I wondered what exectly we were supposed to think was really going on. But given that at times the film wasn't afraid to gratuitously say what was going on, it made it rather difficult to suppose the less literal take on events was the justifiable presumption.<br/><br/>Many of the wide fish-eye camera Angles were also distracting. And the pacing felt slow. I think more daringly odd choices typically work when they are added more subtly than what is seen in The Favourite.<br/><br/>To put it simply: the style and content were too prevalent and confusing for me to sufficiently get invested in a good story or a good movie.

"Gresh854","8","177","324","14 October 2018"," Yorgos Lanthimos Takes On Old-Fashioned England
","The Favourite was not what I expected. This isn't classic Yorgos Lanthimos, this is a whole new, more whimsical Yorgos Lanthimos, approached parallel to his usual sinister, vexing, and twisted spirit. In full hindsight, this more comedic and less calamitous manner ended with me completely and whole-heartedly digging it. And when I say, The Favourite is more cheer and juvenile than his previous work, I'm not inferring that Lanthimos loses his infamous psychologically poignant gift in this, I'm just inferring that it's done in a much more subtle way, hidden by cynical buffoonery.<br/><br/>At the time being, I would claim that this isn't my favorite-sorry-favourite of Lanthimos's filmography-The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer still hold that spot dearly to my heart-but I would doubtlessly claim that The Favourite is by a long-shot, Lanthimos's most gratifying and crowd-pleasing film. I did not expect to had had such a blast with this movie. Not only is it funny as hell, but the comradery and rivalry between Emma Stone's character and Rachel Weisz's character-both who by the way, give the most dexterous performances of this entire year-was just too much fun to take in. And Olivia Colman's performance as the queen...comical perfection.<br/><br/>The atmospherical tone of this movie also is one of the many aspects that won me over. It reputed like an old-fashioned, 1-on-1, battle of the minds movie, just with touches of Lanthimos's typical synthetic stylizations. It's the cherry on the top of this shrewd satire.<br/><br/>The Favourite might not be as poetically relevant to today's society like The Lobster, or as tramuatizingly stirring like The Killing of a Sacred Deer, but it's a playful piece of mental spectacle that is oddly bone-crushing, yet, pleasing, all at once. Loved nearly every second of it. Bravo, once again Sir Lanthimos. (Verdict: A)"

","Do not waste your time watching this movie! As a fan of both Olivia Coleman and Emma Stone, I went in thinking I would like the film.

","Throughout this movie characters vomit. While I wouldn't say that it will make you do the same, I certainly found it deadly dull.
And pretentious.
The story has some basis in history. It takes place near the end of the reign of England's Queen Anne, around 1711-1713, during which time the War of Spanish Succession-the war between England and France that is mentioned on occasion-was drawing near its end. The Queen's husband, Prince George of Denmark, had died in 1708, after having gotten her pregnant 17 times - enough to justify switching romantic interest away from men for any woman. Sarah, the Duchess of Marlborough, who had already managed to become the Queen's friend, and-at least in this movie-something more than that as well, has come to exert real influence over the Queen because of her willingness to play to the monarch's desire for affection from other women. As the movie opens, Abigail Hill, a distant relative of Sarah's, arrives at court with the hope of getting preferment there. She sees how Sarah receives favor from the Queen, and decides that she can play that game as well if it will allow her to advance at court. Lesbian intrigue follows.
The costumes are fine, there is some intriguing lighting, and early in the movie some different types of lenses provide unusual shots. The acting, to the extent that the women in these roles get to act, is all fine.
But, for me, this was a succession of too-often unexplained scenes and strange behavior that I found pretentious in the extreme. I can understand that, if they have to consume a steady diet of play-by-the-numbers action movies, film critics get excited over something different and not formulaic. But for me different and not predictable does not, in itself, produce a movie interesting enough to hold my attention for two hours. I found myself nodding off on occasion-and it was only the middle of the afternoon-because none of it held my interest.
Nor would I say that is movie strikes a blow for lesbians. The characters aren't interesting, so you don't really care about their relationships, which are presented as manipulative rather than romantic. The Queen never gets to say that the relationships she has with women are more fulfilling, or at least less stressful, than the marriage she had with Prince George.
I just didn't see why the director wanted to resurrect this element of history in this way."

"vinylvanilla","6","89","159","13 February 2019"," A pretentious, cliché-filled, dull love triangle disguised as a portrait of the British Royalty
","Once again, Yorgos Lanthimos disappoints me. Before you vote my review as an unhelpful, lemme explain myself. Perhaps I have an issue with his movies, because I have never enjoyed any of his work, and this movie, unfortunately, is no exception.<br/><br/>Because of the hype and the multiple Oscar nominations, I had high expectations of it, but none of them were fulfilled. Here we have the story of Queen Ann (Olivia Colman) and two women who lived with her - Lady Marlborough (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone). Be warned - there is no plot in the movie, only a lesbian love triangle among the 3 lead characters. At one point Abigail, who was nothing more than a servant of the palace, realizes that Lady Marlborough is the Queen's favorite for being her lover, so Abigail decides to give the Queen some love as well. Expect awkward, irksome scenes of oral sex between swollen, scab-covered legs - at this point, the audience should know ""irksome"" is Lanthimos's comfort zone. There's some childish jealousy when Abigail tries to poison Lady Marlborough and some even more childish melodrama when the Queen misses Lady Marlborough's touch and vice-versa. And a lot of rabbits. And that's it, and I am not exaggerating.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie has basically zero character development. We know all characters are flawed and do horrible things - like all characters in Lanthimos's movies do - but we don't know why they do these things, what happened to them in their lives to make them do what they do - and that's called character development, which lacks in this movie in a very blatant way. And to make matters worse, here we have the cliché-filled portrayal of a royal figure (the Queen) as a weak, gullible, laughable figure who is easily manipulated by servants and maids who seem to be smarter than Her Highness herself. Expect also the cliché scenes of the nobility in decadent parties , displaying deplorable habits. Yawn. As if we hadn't seen this is so many movies before.<br/><br/>Cinematography wise, I got tired, exhausted of the poorly-illuminated scenes and the fish eye camera. It made everything claustrophobic, which seems an useless strategy in this movie, because there was nothing shocking or claustrophobic going on, just a boring love triangle and a woman with bandages around her legs. The only remarkable elements in this movie, in my opinion are:<br/><br/><ul><li>Olivia's acting - Olivia Colman is unrecognizable as Queen Ann, in a very good way; (Rachel Weisz did nothing incredible here, her role was 0% risky dramatically speaking. Emma Stone had a more difficult role but once again she still displayed the same mannerisms she showed in ""Easy A"", ""Lala Land"" and almost every movie in which she acts - exaggerated, unconvincing, trying-too-hard gestures and expressions).</li><li>Costume design;</li><li>Art direction - decent artistic portrayal of the English Royalty during late 17th/early 18th century.</li></ul><br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie, which has probably cost a lot of money considering its production, art direction and costume design, was a waste of budget - such a beautiful ambiance fell flat into a boring, empty plot. This is movie is not either enlightening nor shocking, neither incisive or witty, it's just a boring love triangle with very disturbing characters disguised as some ""fun criticism"" of the nobility and the high class."
"daphneconstantine","1","104","188","4 January 2019"," Never seen so many people walk out during a film
","There seems to be a fashion amongst directors keen to gain attention, to snigger at historical figures and make them look ridiculous, regardless of their true character or achievements. The more fictional the representation, the more clever they think they are. Put the film into a sumptuous setting which is historically accurate, throw in some salacious lesbian sex scenes whenever possible and then sit back and rake in the money. I thought this film would be amusing, admittedly reasonably historically inaccurate, but well acted and have some depth. Instead I felt bored, disconnected from the characters, unable to understand any historical context or how they had come to be as they were portrayed. Throughout the time that these supposed actions took place the real queen Anne was married and adored her husband. She had after all borne him seventeen children and lost her young son. This was briefly touched upon now and then but there was no explanation as to how she became the pathetic waste of space that they chose to portray. Every opportunity had to be a bed or sex scene. Boring. Yes she had favourites. No it wasn't proven that they were lesbian. She is widely considered to have been the most stable, sensible and successful of the not very good Stuart monarchs. I realise we don't go to the cinema for history lessons but why make a totally fictional film and pretend it is hidden history, misleading and almost mocking the audience. I thought it was a terrible and distasteful film, only lifted by Olivia Colman having a vague physical resemblance to Queen Anne, and from the number of people who left during it and those who were complaining at the end as they left the cinema, I was not alone."
"writevjnow-IMDB","1","68","119","12 January 2019"," The Emperor's New Clothes
","I generally love historical dramas, the lavish scenes, costumes, settings and so on. I was all set to be thrilled by this, considering the cast. But what was this? A case of Hans Christian Anderson's 'The Emperor's New Clothes', methinks.<br/><br/>I can understand why some viewers/reviewers would laud it and that is good for them, why should they not? Each to their own. I can almost hear them singing ""Isn't it grand! Isn't it fine! Look at the cut, the style, the line! - The suit of clothes is all together but all together it's all together the most remarkable suit of clothes that I have ever seen"". Never mind the naked truth.<br/><br/>Someone said that when there was a great divide in ratings, the zeros and the tens, then that indicated it was a masterpiece. Yeah, might it not also indicate it is quite the opposite? I cannot tolerate reviewers who suggest that those who do not share their views are Philistines, simply too plebeian, too uneducated, to appreciate the ""masterpiece"" they are watching. Well, for me the Emperor was stark naked tosh and I saw right through it.<br/><br/>The Favourite starts off badly and doesn't improve. Within minutes we have strong language, a guy playing with himself within close proximity of others in broad bawdy daylight. To top it all we have the weird banging-noise soundtrack which I thought was a flaw in the film for a while. The cinematography is very frequently through a fisheye lens which makes walls appear to be caving in and trees appear to be toppling towards one another. Really, it's all very style over substance, like a magician deceiving us with sleight of hand. There are lesbian scenes (ooh, how risque, how very modern!) and dialogue delivered in a way that much of the time I couldn't tell a word which was being spoken.<br/><br/>Yorgos Lanthimos must be laughing all the way to the bank."

The three leads are able to hold a fascinating performance that is difficult to achieve. Yorgos Lanthimos retains a pessimistic view of human nature but all goes down with a touch of British glam, as he pushes the idea of the capricious queen through the far reaches of comedy and almost into tragedy. With its brilliant and dramatic script, the sharp dialogues, the great performances, the wonderful production design contributions and a beautiful cinematography, may be for more open-minded audiences, but it's such a charmingly quirky film and is my front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar. nikisreviews.gr"

","I was able to see this movie about 4 months before its theatrical release in Switzerland at the first day of the Zurich Film Festival 2018.<br/><br/>For preparation of yesterdays screening I recently watched two of Yorgos Lanthimos' previous films: ""The Lobster"" and ""The Killing Of A Sacred Deer"". Both movies are very special in their own way so I didn't expect from ""The Favourite"" to be a normal 18th-whatever-century movie. Usually I'm not a big fan of historical/costume movies like this.<br/><br/>But what about ""The Favourite""?<br/><br/>I have to admit that I was unaware of my feelings for the movie shortly after the end. Yeah it was ""good"", but was there more than that?
A day later I'm still not 100% sure because I still think about it but I noticed that hour after hour I like this movie more. The story is really great and there are a lot of wicked but also hilarious scenes.<br/><br/>The three main actresses are definitely the highlight of the movie: Rachel Weisz is amazing and of course, Olivia Colman is outstanding. I wouldn't complain if she gets nominated for an Oscar next year, but can we talk about Emma Stone? Yes, I'm a fan, but I really think her performance is the best in the whole movie, maybe it's because she also plays the most interesting character.<br/><br/>I definitely have to see ""The Favourite"" again when it comes to the cinema sometime in January 2019 to make my final verdict.
Until then I give 8 out of 10 and hopefully more next time."

Weisz vs Stone is a master class in acting, and Colman holds the Crown. Showcasing just how devoted one is for love (or power) but if it is truly worth the cost. If you didn't like The Lobster or The Killing of a Sacred Deer, you may not like this movie. While it is Yorgos' most commercial movie yet, it is still very much his style.

Everything about this film was aweful from the camera angles, bizarre and highly imbelished plot line to the ending.<br/><br/>To be fair, I'm not a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos. But I read reviews which indicated this film was different than his other strange films like The Lobster or The Killing of a Sacred Dear. Despite my opinion of his film making style I was anticipating a great film. His twisted and perverted take on Queen Anne and Lady Sarah was hard to watch. Yes there was some truth to the closeness these two women shared but this filmmaker really went overboard with a strong Lesbian and sexually perversed plot line.

","Oh what a horribly directed film. What a waste of 3 very talented actresses. How can this be? The scenery was good. The costumes were good. The sets / indoor locations were good. The acting was good.<br/><br/>I love historical films / costume dramas and the like and with Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone involved I was excited to see this. I did not know about Olivia Colman but now I am a fan. All three of these ladies were great in this. But they could not overcome the lousy and very gimmicky directing. And what is with the trailer advertising this as a comedy? This is not a comedy.<br/><br/>One of the great and fun experiences is to get lost in a film, to totally fall for the magic of film and almost not realize that you are in a theater watching a film. But this hack director Yorgos Lanthimos destroyed the magic from the very start of this film.<br/><br/>He constantly uses a fisheye / fishbowl lens that distorts every room and even a horse ride in a forest. Indoor shots make the walls bend and ceiling beams curve so much that it was impossible to get lost in the story, such as it was. It is like you normally wear eyeglasses to see and suddenly you have accidentally put on somebody else's glasses making your view distorted and now you are forced to wear them for the next two hours. And his other gimmick was to shoot most of the film with cameras at the height of a young, very short child. The camera is almost always looking up at the actors. And then it is always moving around. The camera would float in front of an actor who was walking toward the camera and then it would suddenly turn 180 degrees to look and move in the opposite direction - just like a small child running around and turning their head all of the time. But at random times the camera would be up above all of the actors and floating around the room like a balloon. I was made constantly aware of the fact that I was watching the work of a director who thinks that he is some kind of ground breaking genius. I could just see him chuckling to himself about how he is turning cinema on its head because of these cheap gimmicks.<br/><br/>And as somebody else already mentioned there are numerous shots of actors in a dark room with a brightly lit window behind them so that the shot is washed out with the bright light and you cannot see much of the actor. For what reason? What does this achieve?<br/><br/>Top all of this off with a jarring and often times ridiculous music score that also seems to think that it is clever (it is not) and the end result from my viewpoint is a disaster. There are so many other people, a woman director would be nice, who could have made a decent film out of this story. Save your money and don't bother with this. And Hollywood - please don't hire this lame director any more. Thanks."

"dierregi","3","38","67","13 January 2019"," Mixing mainstream with experimental pays with the critics
","Some movies are born to be darlings of the critics. Take ""experimental"" director Lanthimos, lately very much in favour, thanks to puzzling movies such as ""The lobster"" and give him a script whatsoever. You may bet the critics will applaude the results, perhaps also thanks to the abundance of salacious, politically-correct scenes.<br/><br/>Allegedly, this should be a ""nastily funny"" historical romp, with focus on the powers struggles at court and between the Whigs and the Tories, but the sex indiscretions are a wink to modern voyeurism and manage to derail the movie.<br/><br/>Loosely based on historical facts, compressed and distorted, we spy on Anne queen of England, who after having given birth to 17 children - all of which died in infancy - decides to turn to safer sex and enjoy the intimate company of her best friend, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.<br/><br/>We're not given any information about the absence of Anne's husband and her switch from heterosexuality (or any of the background whatsoever).<br/><br/>Enter on the scene Abigail, Sarah's poor cousin and the happy couple is torn apart by jealousy and betrayal. Anne is sick, childish, weak, mentally unstable, easily pushed around by any strong woman who may happen to be around. Sarah is harsh, domineering, power-hungry, but perhaps loyal and Abigail is a hypocrite manipulator. Everything is in background, apart from Sarah and Abigail manoeuvring to get close to the queen and getting close means only the most classic love-sex-jealousy plot, only with all female characters.<br/><br/>Add lots of profane language and modern mannerisms, strident soundtrack, way too many fish-eye shots and weird angles, anachronistic costumes and what you get is a movie loved by the critics. For me it is just a missed chance, given that the three lead actresses are doing a great job and the plot was compelling enough without the overdose of sex."

","I agree with others that the film is beautifully shot. (Not so sure about the historical accuracy of the laser-cut style patterns on costumes, though). Olivia Coleman is brilliant, too. However, it's a shame the film creators chose it to be almost all about lesbianism. So much in pain and depressed as the Queen was, would she have much libido left in her at that stage? She was also deeply religious. So, it's not plausible that she would be sexually inclined at that time in her life (and in that way), despite the salacious rumours disseminated by her detractors. There was plenty of genuine cinematography-worthy drama (perhaps not much comedy) to go in her life. One would love to see historically true characters and relationships between the women enacted. But the film makers probably reasoned that a sexually focused rendition would appeal to a greater audience. Or was it the only aspect of Queen Anne's life story that was of interest to them?"

","Having seen the endless trailers on TV and the ""Brilliant"", ""Superb"", etc descriptions, we decided to see it for ourselves. What a mistake. Apart from strong performances from Coleman, Stone, Weisz and Hoult, I found little to enjoy.
The photography was interesting with frequent use of fish-eye lenses, which I can only assume was due to the lack of space in Hatfield House. The music soundtrack was almost as annoying as that of Dunkirk (another rubbish film) and was at times totally unnecessary. As for the language and sex scenes, well, again totally unnecessary and irrelevant. Unfortunately, these seem to be pre-requisites of films these days in order to attract an audience.
Why did four of our currently best actors sign up to do this film? Oh, I know why, because they get paid shed loads of money and get to appear on The Graham Norton Show.

"jennajusticemakeup","2","28","49","20 January 2019"," Unfortunately, The Favourite wasn't my favourite!
","The clips that I'd seen from scrolling through various social media platforms had caught my eye and prompted me to go and watch the trailer for the film, which I thought looked very funny and it seemed to have great reviews as well. Little did I know at this point, that it was all of the funny parts from the film that were in the trailer so I could have just left it at that; it would have saved myself two uncomfortable hours.<br/><br/>Saying that, it wasn't all bad. The costume was good and the hair and makeup were periodically accurate of the most part - early 18th century. This is stuff that I take particular notice of when I watch a film because it really does make a difference and adds a great deal to the final product. The special effects makeup was good also. Lady Marlborough's cuts, bruises and scars were realistic and Queen Ann's stroke makeup was very good; we didn't need to be told that she had suffered a stroke, it was clear from the makeup and performance as to what had happened to her. I'm glad it was done this way, as the subtlety worked well.<br/><br/>It was clear that the film had a decent budget as no detail was unthought-of and as a whole, came across as a well made film. The main idea and storyline was good but it was very boring and slow at times. The ""funny stuff"" distracted from the plot which gave the whole this a kind of messy feel. When I use the word ""funny"", what I actually mean is slightly amusing. The only part that actually made me properly laugh was the badger makeup scene and I had already seen that a few times from clips and the trailer so it had lost some of its effect by the time I got to the cinema to watch the film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the performances and each character along with their relationships were well established. They didn't mess around giving us unnecessary back story. The way we were informed of who was who, how they knew each other etc was clear and to the point however, it was lacking something. I didn't really care about the characters and whether they succeeded or not. When they got hurt or beaten by another character, it didn't really bother me. I was more concerned about the welfare of the rabbits within the story! Those cages were not big enough for all of those bunnies!<br/><br/>The whole film had a strange merge of period drama and modern day elements. I think this as an idea is a good one, and good on Yorgos Lanthimos the director for trying it, but it didn't work for me. It was mostly the modern elements which were supposed to be the funny ones, for example the dance scene, but I think overall it would have been a much better film had the modern day references been left behind and it had just focussed on being a period piece. I didn't like the layout of the wording on the title screens in between scenes.<br/><br/>I need to point out that I had high expectations for this film and sadly, I left disappointed. It did at one point cross my mind to get up and leave and I honestly think I would have done, if I had gone to see it alone. And sadly, I looked at my watch 4 times during it, one time being about 45 minutes in and I remember thinking ""oh no, still so long to go until the end"".

It is clear that a lot of care and thought went into every single detail, and the director worked very hard to create many intricate layers of meaning and an endlessly watchable and absolutely hilarious dynamic between the main characters. If this does not win best picture and a slew of its other nominations it will be very disappointing, as I would compare the overall quality of this movie to the likes of Birdman, or The Kings Speech in terms of the best movies from the last decade. This is Lanthimos' best work yet, which is saying a LOT considering his works leading up to this, most notably The Lobster.

"Mystic1000","10","81","162","4 December 2018"," Call This What it is -- A Masterpiece
","Let me start by saying I have not been a Lanthimos fan. I watched The Lobster for 20 minutes and stopped, and didn't want to see Sacred Deer just from seeing the trailer. This film, though, perhaps because he didn't write it, which constrained some of his worst inclinations, produced something that will live for decades in the annals of truly great cinema.
Unless you are into superheros, explosions, splatter and martial arts as your only movie fare; and if you appreciate cinematic art in its many expressions (acting, music, plot, layered symbolism, cinematography, direction, etc.), then this is a film that will stick with you for awhile.
Finally, I want to say a word about two things ( NOT spoilers):1) the ending that a few people seem to be dissing in thier reviews and 2) a few disparaging comments about historical accuracy.
In my viewing the ending was perfect. The Queen remains the Queen no matter who fights for or wins the place of Favourite. Winning is not what it looks to be from afar. Is who you become in getting to the pinnacle who you really want to be?
And take a look at Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough in Wikipedia, which references her letters reporting the Queen's lesbian bent. Was this out of spite? Who knows, but it's there. One of the only artistic licenses on historical fact that I could find was the tea and horse incident, which served to further the intensity of the drama.
Go see this movie as soon as you can. It's going to have some serious attention in award season."
"filmsbyq","9","9","13","5 March 2019"," The Favourite - go and see it!
","Let me begin this review with my final statement: The Favourite is magnificent, go and see it. You can stop reading now. Still here? Okay, let the gushing begin! It has been quite some time since I've seen a film where the performances match - exceeded even - the hype.<br/><br/>Yorgos Lanthimos' film is an exceptional piece of work. Admittedly I am a little biased, having loved one of his previous works, The Lobster. The Favourite is a very different beast. Resembling another classic piece of cinema, All About Eve, in its story, The Favourite explores more pertinently the personal impact of each individual's actions.<br/><br/>In this past awards season, Olivia Coleman has, rightfully, received widespread praise and recognition for her performance as sickly, petulant and willfully manipulated ruler, Queen Anne in eighteenth-century England.<br/><br/>Though Coleman's performance is glorious, it works so well because of Rachel Weisz 's absorbing dark and powerful portrayal as Lady Sarah Churchill, along with Emma Stone's slyly cruel showing as Sarah's seemingly sweet but duplicitous cousin, Abigail Masham.<br/><br/>Weisz's Sarah is the Queen's lady-in-waiting and her secret lover. She uses her position and close proximity to the Queen to exercise influence over matters of state and the war with France. When her down-on-her-luck cousin Abigail arrives at the Queen's court, asking for work, she allows her to stay.<br/><br/>Confident of her status and given no reason to fear her young cousin's arrival, Sarah focuses her attention on influencing the Queen's decisions with regards to the war. Abigail, a lowly maid, is treated poorly by the other maids, who mistrust her and dislike her due to her relationship with Sarah.<br/><br/>When the Queen's gout acts up and causes her great suffering, Abigail sees an opportunity and finds a root in the forest that helps to ease her pain. Initially, offended by her forwardness, Sarah has her beaten.<br/><br/>But when she finds that the treatment helped her Queen, she takes Abigail under her wing. Abigail is now where she wants to be and make it her mission to better herself and her station in life, regardless of the consequences or impact on others.<br/><br/>As I alluded to earlier, The Favourite is almost a parallel in story to the classic All About Eve. Rachel Weisz's Lady Sarah is like Bette Davis' Margo Channing, a star at the peak of her powers, not seeing her possible downfall until it is too late.<br/><br/>Emma Stone's Abigail is almost exactly like the eponymous Eve Harrington. She shows a deferential willingness initially, but ruthlessly exploits the weakness and opportunities that are presented to her.<br/><br/>So who is Olivia Coleman's Queen Anne in this parallel, you may ask? She is Hollywood. She is the one who makes or break someone. Without the Queen, the other two have no reason to exist or be.<br/><br/>Besides the exceptional central performances, the script of this film and cinematography are the stars of this film. The palace looks grandiose and claustrophobic at the same time, especially with clever use of some fisheye lenses on occasion. The evening scenes, when characters move about the vast building with only candlelight, are wonderfully atmospheric.<br/><br/>There are so many fantastic walking shots, where the camera just follows either Sarah or Abigail as they stride along or away from the Queen's quarters. Lanthimos takes the decision to use tracking, as opposed to steady-cam, when walking along the corridor, so there is none of the slightly rough, skewed movement you get in so many modern films.<br/><br/>The script, by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, is a delight. Intelligent without being unintelligible. Set against the backdrop of a war, with a fragile monarch and a caustic, straight talking, lady-in-waiting and sneaky youngster, all women, all compelling.<br/><br/>The men in the film are both important and unimportant. That is to say that when they are in the story, they serve their purpose, but never detract or are compelling enough to be explored. Also, they help to remind us how women were generally viewed in that time period, especially with the early treatment of Abigail.<br/><br/>The Favourite is one of the best films of 2019 and is, in my opinion, deserving of all the awards and praise it has received. At two hours long, there are no wasted scenes or lulls that have you looking at your watch. Yorgos Lanthimos has crafted a masterpiece of a film. The Favourite is a magnificent film, go and see it."
"vdelrion","2","60","117","29 December 2018"," Very disappointing.
","My wife and I are big fans of Rachel Weiss, and we were very disappointed with this movie. Her acting is excellent, as always, as also that of Emma Stone and Olivia Colman. However, the others overact and look so artificial that we could not decide if the movie is a drama or a bad comedy. The cinematography makes it worse as the camera angles accentuate weirdly the comic side of the scenes. Speaking of which, I never seen a movie in which ALL the camera takes were against the light, both inside and outside environments. Perhaps if it had been balanced the light to use is to accent the dramatic effect... but no, it just generated washed out scenes where details got lost. Moreover, the director chose to overuse the wide angle lens, distorting everything closer to the edges, always! One of the worst movies movies we watched, and we could hardy wait for the (stupid) ending."
"bob-the-movie-man","10","43","81","6 January 2019"," A bawdy masterpiece
","I'll just put it out there. ""The Favourite"" is a masterpiece of movie making on just so many different levels.<br/><br/>The story grips you from the off. The gout-suffering Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is being maniupulated from her bedchamber (both physically and mentally) by Lady Sarah Marlborough (Rachel Weisz), wife of a war-hero General. Arriving at the palace (actually Hatfield House in Hertfordshire) is Sarah's cousin Abigail (Emma Stone), fallen on hard times. But although joining the court as a ""dirty parlour maid"", Abigail is more than a match for Sarah in terms of political scheming and sculduggery. The scene is set for a no-holds battle royale to gain the affections of the queen and be the power behind the throne.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the film presents a triumvirate of female star turns that would - I hope - immediately grab three of the slots for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress Oscar categories.<br/><br/>We all know Olivia Colman as a UK national treasure, but with a movie past that has seen her primarily in smaller supporting roles, this should catapult her onto the worldwide stage. Colman is just unbelievably good as the mentally unhinged monarch Queen Anne. (If you look at the history of Queen Anne in relation to motherhood, referenced in the film, you can understand and sympathise with her mental state.) The camera spends leisurely periods focused on her features and many of these are just extraordinary. One such scene at a dance, with Anne unblinking and mentally deteriotating for what must be a good minute or two is so breathtaking that it made me giggle (inappropriately) with pure movie joy.<br/><br/>Equally good is Rachel Weisz as the incumbant favourite Lady Sarah. Her transformation from someone fully in control to someone seeing a yawning turn in her fortunes approaching is just brilliantly done. Helped by superbly scripted lines (""How did you sleep?"" asks Abigail; ""Like a shot badger"" spits out Sarah), she delivers brilliantly on a role that was reminiscent to me of Glenn Close's turn in ""Dangerous Liaisons"".<br/><br/>Probably in 3rd place in the awards ranking, but not taking away anything from her excellent kick-ass performance, is Emma Stone as Abigail. We've seen similar performances from Stone before: indeed the film has a nice recreation of her ""La La Land"" audition breakdown at one point!<br/><br/>Excellent in supporting roles, but rather overshadowed by the ladies, is Nicholas Hoult fully be-wigged as the leader of the opposition and the ever-reliable Mark Gatiss as Lord Marlborough<br/><br/>Based on the strong UK-talent and the Oscar buzz, the film has received a widespread distribution into UK multiplexes, but I think it has more of an arthouse feel to it that might trigger some disatisfaction from the general cinema-going public. (Looking back, I made exactly the same comment about ""The Lobster"".)<br/><br/>But it is technically brilliant, and I'll call out some of the star turns in the technical department (since it's impossible to read any names from the crazily over-stylized end-titles).<br/><br/>I've already referenced that the script has some memorable whip-smart lines (""Look at me! How dare you! Close your eyes!"") all the more impressive that this is the debut movie screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara.<br/><br/>It is strikingly filmed, using fisheye lenses and to reflect an air of disquiet and paranoia. This always seem to be in use, but seem to be ""more fishbowly"" (not sure what the technical term is!) in some scenes than others. There are also some remarkable low-angle tracking shots: one of Rachel Weisz walking along a passageway is breathtakingly done. The cinematography is by Robbie Ryan, who did ""I, Daniel Blake"" and ""American Honey"" and I would approve of seeing it recognised in the awards season.<br/><br/>Also fantastic are the costumes on show, particularly those worn by Rachel Weisz which are just stunning. As such, there's a second shout-out in two films (""Mary Poppins Returns"") for Sandy Powell here.<br/><br/>Also outstanding is the music composed and coordinated by Johnnie Burn. He's collaborated with the director on his previous films in various capacities as well as the surreal ""Under the Skin"". While the soundtrack comprises well-chosen period chamber music, there are also periods of intrusive and persistent electronic tones that reflect Sarah's rising crisis just beautifully.<br/><br/>Holding the whole thing together is Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos. Lanthimos is a bit of an acquired taste that to date I haven't fully acquired. My one criticism with the film is the same one I levelled at ""The Lobster"" - that it is a tad overlong. A comedy, particularly a black-comedy, can outstay its welcome, and for me I think it would have been a better film if cut down to nearer 90 minute than two hours. (The film is divided into different titled segments, and if you want to orientate yourself as to where you are there are 8 of them.)<br/><br/>I did appreciate though that Lanthimos managed to cheekily include a couple of lobsters into the script, along with his usual menagerie of rabbits and ducks! Having his work cut out then on this film was animal coordinator Gerry Cott!<br/><br/>This is marketed as a ""bawdy comedy-drama"" and be warned that it is very, VERY bawdy. It's a 15 certificate in the UK (R in the US) and for once I'd view it as quite a lenient rating. There are lesbian sex scenes in the film which although subtle (you see less than in ""Colette"") are still relatively strong. However, the language is decidedly on the fruity side with liberal use of the F-word and the C-word. As such, it will not be for the easily offended.<br/><br/>I don't bandy the word ""masterpiece"" around often, but in this case I think it's justified.<br/><br/>(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
"bbrebozo","1","98","200","27 December 2018"," Not Even Emma Stone Could Save This Snooze Fest
","I saw The Favourite because (a) Emma Stone is in it, and (b) it was highly reviewed on iMDB. My current hypothesis is that the Russians have hijacked the iMDB site, and heavily upvoted this movie in an attempt to lure the American public to see it, and bore us into a mind-numbed complacency.<br/><br/>This two-hour snoozefest explores in excruciating detail the interplay between three wretched women, each of who is vying to grab or hold on to power. It sets the record for the slowest-moving, most tedious power plays in movie history -- and, amazingly, the payoff is that nothing is resolved in the end! And in case you could possibly have missed the ham-handed symbolism, the rabbits and slow-motion dancing naked eunich represent the poor working class whose souls are crushed under the feet of the bourgeoisie, who are focused on their own selfish whims.<br/><br/>I've seen many movies that show that the abuse of power is evil and damaging. The only additional lesson from this film is that it can also be boring."

","I haven't seen a movie I disliked this much in a while. The costumes, sets, scenery, and acting were all very good-- unfortunately it was all wasted on a plot that kind of just dwindled down to nothing. (It did encourage me to do some reading about Queen Anne, so I guess that is a good thing.) I've not yet read any other reviews because I didn't want them to influence what I wrote- so I will be very curious to see what the high-raters said.
Maybe the filmmakers were shooting for something ""arty"" and missed. If that was the goal it did not go far enough or get weird enough. It just seemed like a movie with a plot that went nowhere.
Bottom line: All the talent and beauty in this film is wasted on a movie that should be so low on any list that no one would ever get to it.

A sold by bitter film, destroyed by playing games with truth 1 star for this unpardonable sin of fake history"

","There are so many positive critic and audience reviews. I was expecting something spectacular, what I got was a major yawn. I have read some about Queen Anne (she wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but a lot of royalty in England or elsewhere weren't) and Sarah Churchill. I do have to say that they came to life in Olivia Coleman's and Rachel Weisz's portrayals. Emma Stone, once again for me, fell flat. I don't understand her appeal. And, couldn't they get a British actress to play a British role? Anyway, there were scenes of sexual nature which I have absolutely no doubt happened at court in early 18th century (not the ones between the main female characters). So, I think that those scenes, the kitchens, servants quarters and brothel were accurate. But, the story itself was a bore and with all of those long powered wigs, it was hard to tell which man was which. I found it hard to follow except for the main plot line of one cousin trying to usurp the other cousin to be the favorite of the queen and one lord trying to stop the war with France because it was costing so much. I would have left, but it was a first showing and it had a lot of people that I would have needed to crawl over, kind of like Sarah Churchill and then her cousin, Abigail."

","I'm somewhat of a fan of Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos, and was excited to see this new dark comedy from him set in period Britain. The film centers around the relationship between Queen Anne and Sarah Churchill, and how such relationship is affected when the cousin of the latter arrives seeking employment. The film offers an eclectic mix of dark comedy and great cinematography, but doesn't completely hold together, which was slightly disappointing.<br/><br/>Lanthimos' unique cinematography is outstanding throughout, as are many of his commendable aesthetic choices that help enrich the film's unique quality and tone. The acting is generally strong throughout, with the distinct nature of each performance among the three lead actresses enhancing the viewing experience. Unfortunately, however, the film's script has a number of concerns. The film's writing attempts to be witty and funny much of the time, but such lines of wit and humor do not always land. Some of the more raunchy moments are well-placed, but others just feel puerile or ridiculous. For a prestige film from an acclaimed auteur revered by many serious film buffs, the film can end up feeling quite lowbrow at times, which can alienate the viewer from some of the more serious commentary of the time period Lanthimos is depicting, particularly with regards to the issue of gender roles and the patriarchal nature of the society and culture. The total shifts can be quite jarring, even more so when one stops to consider that not all scenes played for comedic effect are particularly funny or even amusing at face or literal value. A majority of the film is paced properly and well, yet the third act can come off as anti-climactic. Ultimately, while I didn't dislike ""The Favourite,"" I did expect a bit more from what some pundits have determined will likely be a top-tier Oscar contender this fall. 6/10"

","Just because you're thrust into the position of ruling as King or Queen doesn't mean you're cut out for it. Olivia Colman is Queen Anne, whose existence is plagued by chronic illnesses and constant unhappiness. Ms. Colman is simply magnificent, as she embodies the pitiful woe-is-me, emotionally out-of-control, petulant childish Queen with her every manner. She's taken by the celebration of the festivities of dancing at a ball until she envies those who can dance, and get around better than her. Her life is a roller-coaster of feelings, emotions, and manipulations. Rachel Weisz keeps her in check and knows her inside out, but soon Rachel's place by her side is threatened by Emma Stone.Who will ultimately be Queen Anne's Favourite? The film and all actors are excellent, but Olivia Colman rightfully steals the show and you think about her even when she's not in the scene. Ms. Colman deserved the Oscar. Sorry, Glenn!

","OK, so we accept that it has not been presented as being in any way historically accurate. So please don't expect any of it to be so. Precious little (if any) is an accurate portrayal of Queen Ann and her historical contributions. That aside, the script is a mind boggling mish mash of events surrounding rivals for Queen Ann's affection in a court where even the dancing jar's as being out of place.<br/><br/>The strong language does abound in a self indulgent way, almost using it to assert itself as a sufficiently arty production to make it permissible. It doesn't perform the role of creating a bawdy tone. It just seems gratuitous. The 'strong sex scenes' are not. Apart from the distant site of a bottom pumping back and forth against who know what pressed to a wall, all else is undercover and left to the imagination. None of it rampant or even lustful.<br/><br/>A sound device is used twice during the film - two long tones followed by a single drum beat. For no apparent reason, other than to make it harder to hear what is being said. It is annoying. Another device used, that annoyed me, was to introduce an 'act' with words on screen that would later be said in it. Not particularly effective and rather trite.<br/><br/>Yes the three main protagonists acted their part extremely well (not something that can be said of all the cast), and the camera work was both imaginative and of an extremely high quality. The awards to those actresses and those involved in that aspect will be well deserved. But I want a lot more than that from a film and I don't enjoy weird for weird's sake - which is what I felt this film is. It is being self indulgently arty-farty with none of the entertainment that should accompany it. The screenplay is, in my opinion, very poor.<br/><br/>I didn't walk out as I kept hoping things would eventually become enjoyable. For me they didn't.

"thesmythley","2","33","64","9 January 2019"," A complete farce. Highish expectations dashed.
","The film has little direction. Yes, there are characters who drive ""the narrative"", but there is little focus and centrality on the queen. Instead we see two women competing for the queen's affections mostly to maximise their personal prestige. These two characters, both being masters of manipulation, define the film's entire content. They aren't redeemable or even likeable in the slightest unless you are the type of person who happens admires powerful machiavellian sorts of people who are venomous towards each other. Oh and apparently that was funny to some members of the audience, though only a minority. I think the only reason it was regarded as so was because they were women who are basically saying subtle passive aggressive things, a bit like the sort of incidents that happen in boorish tv soap dramas. The film would've been better if they had explored more in depth and mademore central the character of the queen but any personal analysis of her was pretty superficial. The trailer that was shown to advertise the film and lure an audience seemed to encapsulate the best bits of in the entire film.<br/><br/>The sound was pretty abysmal, repetitive and unbearable to hear during several scenes.<br/><br/>There are plenty of 'scenes that are just stuck in for no good reason other than to try to set the tone or establish pacing, but they are excessive and end up dragging out the love triangle story unnecessarily. This is presumably done in the name of artistic license but it all feels a bit forced, as if to make the audience think they've seen more than they actually have. I suppose this magic trick it works for those who are easily impressed by the film's aesthetics and those who favour a long-running dialogue as opposed to a guided plot which allows the potential for more things to actually happen. Good acting doesn't mean much without an engaging plot.<br/><br/>Truth be told, I had no idea that the film was directed by the director of The Lobster and Dogtooth. I'm not someone who has ever needed to check a film's director to assess whether it's worth the time to watch it. However, I have found that with Yorgos Lanthimos' films this is highly required as they tend to be so absurdist that they always ruin any attempt to maintain coherence, emotional engagement or intrigue. This film is so absurdist that it feels more like you're watching the raw thoughts in someone's head, a dream, rather than an organised, finished work. For some, the very fact that it is so absurdist and trangresses the traditional boundaries of a film genre would perhaps be appealing and gloriously avante-garde. Personally, I didn't think this and found that this formula started to go stale pretty quickly. Thus, by the end I was left feeling completely unsatisfied."

Sadly, I couldn't because of the appalling repetitive strings and organ playing, the former of which attempts to create a sense of pacing, the latter a sense of imminent castastrophe. The advertising of the film led me to believe that the film would focus on the wider history of why Queen Anne is the way she is, examining her reign and so on. However, this is not what the film does at all. NOTHING HAPPENS.<br/><br/>Instead we get an initially semi-interesting but quickly uninteresting story of two largely similar machiavellian women who fight for the queen's affection, interspaced with a melange of scenes of palace debauchery, stunted attempts at comedic irony and absurdism, the odd slapstick moments and sarcastic ""witticisms"" that aren't really all that interesting of funny except if you are one of those who boast and prattle on endlessly endlessly about sarcasm being your ""second language"". The attempts to make the audience laugh are so frequent that the drama in the film is more akin to a bad television sitcom comedy-drama than a periodic drama.

Nothing happens in a way that one could believe would actually happen that way. In fact, things happen, multiple things, for which there are no explanations. They just suddenly happen because they make good visual glitz. And happening they don't reach their logical conclusions.

Not a great deal happens apart from the ongoing efforts of one woman trying to gain power and the other trying to exert it. In order to do so, there is a great deal of debauchery, violent episodes and gratuitous unnecessary female vulgarity. I'm not offended easily, but there are a number of very strong sexual references which don't add much to the scene - once or twice is fine but this is over the top.<br/><br/>The three main actors here give great performances and are the best compliments I can provide about the film.

The film is desperately uneven in tone, lacks measured and concise editing, suffers from drab cinematography, utilizes one of the most annoying musical cues put to film (that drones on endlessly not once, but twice in key points of the film), and overuses a fishbowl optic that is self-conscious and distracting. Regarding editing, this film stretches to just over two hours when 80-90 minutes would have tightened up the pacing much more. There are a number of needless, self-indulgent scenes that no doubt delighted the director, but served no purpose in telling what should be an interesting story. Too bad...a better director could have made a pretty good movie out of this."

","""The Favourite"" is a rarity in studio films; it feels fresh and original, intellectual and weird. It defies both description and expectation, leaving you unsettled, confused, and yet pleasantly warm.<br/><br/>Your experience watching ""The Favourite"" will not be enhanced by a deep knowledge of the plot, or of the historical events that surround the story. Indeed, the film reflects England under Queen Anne in much the same way that Game of Thrones echoes the Wars of the Roses, which is to say: sorta. In the world of ""The Favourite,"" historical figures blithely employ anachronistic dialogue. Slanderous allegations of yore become genuine plot points. If the movie were making any sort of pretense towards historical accuracy, this might all be grating. ""The Favourite,"" however, is far more concerned with constructing its sophisticated narrative than with faithfully depicting 18th century Britain to impress the four historians in the audience.<br/><br/>Our players, affectionate, shrewd, and manipulative, are as follows: Olivia Colman plays Queen Anne-gout-ridden, somewhat simple, and yet warm. Rachel Weisz is Sarah, the Duchess of Marlborough-the Queen's friend, confidante, and puppet-master. Emma Stone, rounding out the triumvirate, plays Abigail-a noble cousin to the Duchess who has fallen below her station (her condition is most delightfully represented by her appearance in court: slathered with excrement). Lady Marlborough employs Abigail as her own maid, bringing her into the Queen's sphere with dramatic consequences.<br/><br/>All three actresses are exemplary, imbuing their performances with expressions and tics that communicate the veiled struggle for influence that their dialogue disguises. As Lady Marlborough and Abigail begin to square off, the chemistry between Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone becomes electric, their interactions nuanced and pregnant with subtext. Were ""The Favourite's"" DVD release to mimic ""Lord of the Rings,"" with an hour of extra footage of Sarah and Abigail sniping at one another, I assure you, I'd be first in line at the Blockbu...internet to purchase it. Olivia Colman, too, is extraordinary. Her Queen Anne is stubborn and self-destructive, feeble, and eminently manipulable. Yet she is also witty, loving, and canny, making her sympathetic, rather than simply pathetic.<br/><br/>Though the actors' respective roles could easily devolve into familiar tropes, ""The Favourite"" resists such simplification. Moral ambiguity is rife in ""The Favourite."" If you're hoping to divide the three leads into ""good guys"" and ""bad guys,"" you will be continually disappointed. Such explicit designations (and the gendered assumptions implicit therein) have no place in this film. Each main character is, at times, manipulative, trusting, duplicitous, and loyal. They are, in short, human. Cruelty and ambition often live cheek-by-jowl with kindness and friendship in the human heart. If all this friction has you eagerly anticipating a ""cat-fight,"" then I bid you welcome to 2018, Archie Bunker, but you, too, shall leave the theater disgruntled. You will find conflict to spare in ""The Favourite,"" but it is hardly a voyeuristic fantasyland. I know, I know, way too much talky-talky and not enough sexy-slappy. I get it. Now run along to the box office and see if they'll still let you swap your ticket for Robin Hood.<br/><br/>""The Favourite"" defies cinematic tradition by surrounding three complex, nuanced female characters with one-dimensional men. The male supporting cast is neither uninteresting nor unlikeable, but their motivations tend to be simple, their personalities, caricatures. These men's foppish displays are entertaining, no doubt, but they do not captivate the attention like the exchanges between Anne, Sarah, and Abigail. Turnabout is fair play, and this story demands sophisticated interplay between its three feminine leads, while only requiring men for the occasional plot device. Never fear, my masculine brethren. No fewer than six male-driven films were released around the same week as ""The Favourite"". The feminist takeover of Hollywood with deviations like ""speaking roles for women"" remains in its infancy.<br/><br/>Helming this new-age feminist hellscape is Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, who deserves a great deal of credit for establishing the odd world of ""The Favourite"". Lanthimos' whole visual aesthetic is peculiar, with wide, fisheye lenses and odd, unexpected camera angles (""What if I put the camera under the table for this conversation?"" I imagine him asking). In addition, Lanthimos does not like to use traditional film lighting. His exteriors rely on natural light, while his nighttime scenes give a real impression of being candle-lit, with hard shadows and dark corners. If Lanthimos wishes to unsettle the viewer with his aesthetic, he succeeds masterfully. Even during otherwise innocuous conversations, you may feel a creeping trepidation as your neck hairs stand on end. ""The Favourite"" isn't particularly off-putting or violent, but you will feel strangely uncomfortable, despite all the humor, until the credits roll.<br/><br/>Although ""The Favourite"" is thematically - and cinematically - dark, it is often also shockingly funny. The dialogue is snappy and well-tuned, and the actors' interplay with one another is perfectly coordinated. Dull, expository dialogue, usually wielded with all the subtlety of a self-important sledgehammer in historical dramas, here flits across the screen like a hummingbird, lingers briefly, and is gone again. Instead, a droll sort of whimsy prevails. At times, laughter felt wrenched from the audience, as we surprised ourselves with our own snorts of glee. Humor is rarely so cathartic as when your fingernails are digging grooves into your palms. It would be a mistake to classify ""The Favourite"" as a ""comedy,"" I think, but for all its gloom, it is hardly grim. Complexity necessitates a balance between darkness and light; between tragedy and comedy. ""The Favourite"" deftly manages that tension better than most films.<br/><br/>""The Favourite"" is not a movie for everyone. It will be too ""much"" for some, too weird for others, and, sadly, too woman-centric for many (one does not expect a tweet from our dear president, for instance, extolling his love for this film). Nevertheless, ""The Favourite"" is brilliant. The writing is witty, the sets are lavish, and the acting is exceptional. It is a symphony of odd, eccentric anachronisms that will leave you tearing through a dictionary for the right words to describe it, always coming up a bit short."
"dromasca","8","12","20","6 February 2019"," the favo(u)rite of the race to Oscars
","I confess that Yorgos Lanthimos' films confuse me. Each one that I've seen approaches a well-known genre, starts from premises that seem familiar to us, as moviegoers with some experience, and gets totally elsewhere - in territories where the laws of decency or morality as we know them do not work anymore. It is obvious the director's effort to shock through the language used by his characters, but also through his own cinematic language. The result is a collection of movies that belong to the space of the bizarre, but also have obvious quality and which remain in the memory of the spectators. This is also the case with 'The Favorite', which has become an unexpected favorite (the game of words is unavoidable) in the race to the Academy Awards this year. It's a period film. A period film of a kind never made before. A period film by Yorgos Lanthimos.<br/><br/>Queen Anne does not have a great name in England's history. She was eclipsed by other queens named Elizabeth or Mary, but the historical period and her historical role are not to be missed. She was the last queen of the of the House of Stuart (but a Protestant) and the first Queen of Great Britain. Her physical and mental health problems resemble those of her successors to the throne from the House of Hanover. Visually, the costumes and sets created for Yorgos Lanthimos' film reconstruct the atmosphere of the palaces and the royal court at the beginning of the 18th century with an accuracy and care to details worthy of the best films of the British studios or of the BBC. The characters that populate the film, or rather the Lanthimos version of the historical characters, are however far from being conventional representations. One might say that this is a strong feminist vision. The court and the political intrigues are dominated by women, but those are women who have suffered the traumas of persistent sexual harassment and rape since their teenage years, and who take their harsh revenge on the world of men. The sickly queen (played by Olivia Colman) reigns as the absolute sovereign playing as her mind or moods dictate with the matters of state and with the prime ministers and the Parliament, with the help of her favorite Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and of the newly arrived Abigail (Emma Stone). The main thread of the action is the conflict that opposes the current favorite to the younger woman, who will have to overcome the differences in social status and the hostility of the queen's councilor in order to take her place in the queen's circle and even closer to her.<br/><br/>'The Favorite' has many qualities. The acting of the triplet of actresses is phenomenal, and the relationships of this 'triangle' dominate the story, evolving gradually and convincingly. Some of the scenes and some dialogues have formidable humorous sparkles. I've already mentioned about decors and costumes. Lanthimos's spices however add nothing meaningful and interesting, on the contrary, they appear to be forced and obviously inserted to attract attention. I did not think the film needed those. If showing lesbian ties may be considered as an original perspective on the queen's personality and the relationships the the royal court, the avalanche of profanities does not serve anything. Not only is it not plausible that the ladies at the court of the Great Britain in the 18th century have so often spoken words such as 'f ...', but this adds nothing to the characters or to the historical vision. I'm far from being pudic, but I think Lanthimos's vulgar insertions here are devoid of logic. The result is that 'The Favorite' is a movie with many good parts, but which does intend to be liked. I appreciated parts of it but I did not like it. It will be interesting to see if the Academy, with a renewed participation, will reward boldness, or rather pursue its Puritan reflexes and punish the film despite the high number of nominations."
"Dreamcatcher9000","Null","21","39","9 January 2019"," Worst director of the last decade
","I've seen all the films by this director, and I hated ALL of them. This one is slightly better, because he didn't write the screenplay (he's a mediocre director, but an awful scriptwriter, he's incompetent of writing well written characters and dialogues). But still, I really don't get how can critics and people call something like this a ""masterpiece"" and worthy of Oscars. What are they smoking? This is bad, pretentious art.
First, there is no plot. Nothing was happening, it felt like a series of disjointed skits. Second, besides a couple of lines by Colman, I didn't laugh with anything else. If this is considered a comedy, even a weird one, it was not funny. Third, it was absolutely dull, I was feeling bored from the first 20 minutes.<br/><br/>I think most of the people who write good reviews about this film (or any film by this director), they just wanna impress, that they understand and like weird films. But I can not believe that they didn't feel bored and puzzled, especially towards the end.<br/><br/>If this is considered good filmmaking and all (or most) movies were like this, I wouldn't bother with cinema at all. This is not good cinema for me. It's rubbish. I want to feel something when I see a film, any kind of film, from the most independent with the lowest budget, to the biggest blockbuster. This film gave me nothing to think about, it was void."
"scb_coldsteel","10","34","68","22 December 2018"," My Favorite film of 2018!
","So I saw The Favorite at the theater. I was really looking forward to the movie. It has an absolutely phenomenal ensemble cast plus the director Yorgos Lanthimos knows his way around an interesting and provocative film. Overall I was blown away with the movie. It may be my favorite film of 2018, pun intended. If nothing else it might be the best made film of 2018. I cannot recommend the film enough to everyone.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is very unconventional. This is not a movie with a grand historical scope. There are no intense battle scenes or extravagant narratives. While there is a war that occurs during the film it merely serves as a plot device to carry the actual narrative. The real meat of the movie is the political intrigue and rich dialogue. Pretty much the entire film takes place at the Queens royal estate. This is an immensely sharp and witty film that constantly plays with the viewers expectation. It somehow perfectly mixes elements of comedy, drama, and suspense perfectly to keep you entertained. I can say I was completely engaged the entire time.<br/><br/>Instead of an epic narrative we witness the political and social struggles of two women as they fight for the affection of the queen. One a social climber hell-bent on achieving wealth and prestige while the other is a seasoned political matriarch who controls the kingdom from behind the scenes. In a complex mental chess game these two women attempt to outwit each other at every turn. They lie, cheat, steal, and even use sex to their advantage. It's a film the asks the question how far would you go to live a life of luxury. In many ways the film seems like the bastard child of Game of Thrones, The Lion in winter, and Barry Lyndon. This of course is high praise considering all three are at the pinnacle of political dramas and amazing dialogue.<br/><br/>The genius of the film is in the rich textual layers of dialogue that are the center of every interaction. I haven't seen dialogue so smart and biting in a long time. It somehow is hysterical, but at the same time manages to not come off as campy and overdone. I had so much fun watching two people throw backhanded insult at each other all the while in the context of a royal palace.<br/><br/>You really starting to love and hate most of the characters at the same time throughout the film. All of the characters were exceptionally well-written and very engaging. Everyone had their own agenda and motivations that felt genuinely human. There was no glamorizing the human condition here. Human nature was Illustrated raw and animalistic.<br/><br/>The film was also a critique and attack on the decadence and disconnect that elites in higher social classes embody. The film illustrates how far removed the wealthy are from the struggles of the average man and that they have no problem manipulating and using individuals to their advantage. The movie also offers social commentary regarding gender norms and ideas of sexuality. Concepts of masculinity and femininity are questioned while the film also offers critiques on The Cult of Femininity. It was all around an incredibly layered film that says quite a bit while never coming across as preachy.<br/><br/>Of course this might be one of the best acted films of the year. Other than the TV show Peep Show I wasn't very familiar with Olivia Colman. That was my mistake. She was absolutely incredible. She perfectly embodied the characteristics of a power drunk yet fragile Queen Anne. At every turn she brought something new to her charater that made the queen a richly complex figure. She also had physical and mental transformation as the film went along that would make Daniel Day-Lewis stop and take note. She deserves an Oscar for this role.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is another actress that I was blown away with. I know her from a few separate roles but I was never very impressed. She always seemed like a competent, but forgettable actress. This roll completely changes how I feel about her. While the dialog was sharp her delivery was incredible. She brought so much to a well-written script with this performance. She really held a number of scenes together with her screen presence alone. I absolutely loved her in this. I can easily see her being nominated for best supporting actress.<br/><br/>Of course I have to mention Emma Stone. Now I greatly dislike Emma Stone. She has some good roles, but there's something about her I can't stand. That being said this was easily one of her best performances. She managed to portray the wide range of emotions her character embodied throughout the film while still remaining very human. She could play sweet and naive one moment followed my cunning and brutal the next. She easily made a character fans could love to hate.<br/><br/>Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz genuinely had some great chemistry together. The film provided an absolutely incredible ensemble performance worth seeing for its acting alone. While it's easy to overlook his performance in the face of so many strong leads Nicholas Hoult really did a good job also. His character was hilarious and provided some memorable scenes.<br/><br/>If this film doesn't get nominated for best director then something is wrong. Yorgos Lanthimos made an absolute masterpiece of a film. He is known for his quirky and often out of this world storytelling. This is the man that brought us the Lobster which was such a bizarrely unique ride. With The Favorite he managed to tell a story in such a complex manner that is almost comes across that we're watching a play. He took a subject that was ultimately irrelevant and made it captivating. One of my personal favorite elements was his incorporation of sound. The score was outstanding, but the way he used it brought so much tension and life to every scene. The score felt like a character in itself that Incorporated an additional layer of depth to the film.<br/><br/>Plus there was some truly stunning cinematography throughout the film that made the movie pure eye candy. The film is absolutely beautiful in so many ways. It perfectly captured the decadent aesthetic of the era. The costume and set design were flawless. You really felt like you were witnessing the day to day world of those living at the Queens manor.<br/><br/>I loved the movie. The only real criticism I can think of deals more with viewer expectations. If you walk into the film expecting a rich historical epic you are going to be disappointed. If you are expecting action and a grand narrative you will be disappointed. If you expect something other than two hours of dialogue and political intrigue you will be disappointed. If you want a realistic portrayal of history you will be disappointed. If you want a story with a conclusion that is tied up with a nice bow you will probably get angry at the ending. It's hard to fault a film however for things it was never trying to be.<br/><br/>The Favorite is officially my current pick for this award season. The movie offers so much to its audience, but you have to be an active viewer. The film has some of the best dialogue I've seen in years and utterly flawless delivery. The characters are complex and interesting and their interactions absolute carry the film. Technical wise this is the best film of 2018. I recommend it to everyone as this is certainly a must-watch film. It may not be for everyone, but it was a truly unique and engrossing experience. A 9.5 out of 10."

It lacked everything I like in a movie, story development, character development, a character you can empathise with, a meaningful and interesting plot. It was meaningless and lacked depth.<br/><br/>It focused too much on the physical relationship between the characters and not enough on the emotional aspect and motives of the characters decisions.

Queen Anne is a character you can't even feel sorry for being so dumb and at a point, it feels more like a caricature for comedy. Rachel Weisz was good in her role of Sarah and Emma Stone was not impressive as for her award nominations. The men in the movie were just props. Overall, the movie was a bore fest. I think it was made with A list actors to score some awards but not entertain the audience and for art of filmmaking."

","I love historical films, especially about past Queens and Kings and other royalties. I didn't hesitate to watch this when I saw the trailer.<br/><br/>It's not an entirely accurate movie, which is intended, to give the story more flavor.<br/><br/>The fights between Abigail and Lady Sarah is entertaining to watch and I love the portrayal of Queen Anne. It is dark and hilarious. At first I rooted for Abigail, but as the story progresses, their true selves are unmasked. Abigail is a cruel woman who doesn't love the Queen and will do anything to be on top, and I should've rooted for Sarah instead, who was frank but loving. But it's not only about the two women trying to be the queen's favourite. It's more importantly about the queen, how she coped after the death of all her seventeen children (they were either stillborn or died young), and how she dealt with her declining health, how she felt all alone in the world. I can't imagine what she'd been through.<br/><br/>They were all great, but Emma Stone surprised me more because I didn't know she could play a scheming, heartless woman and make it Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>The ending wasn't good in my opinion. It's odd to end a story like that. However it has a deeper meaning, which is none of them lived happily ever after."
"manders_steve","9","4","5","26 April 2019"," A wonderful depiction of the powerplays inside a royal court
","This period piece focusses on Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) of Great Britain's latter days, in the early 1700. Her frailty leads to her governing role and responsibilities largely being taken over by a friend Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz). The royal applecart gets well and truly upset when a new servant, Abigail (Emma Stone) comes to court. Sarah helps Abigail find her feet at the court, where her former aristocratic position in society assists her blossoming friendship with the Queen. The interplay of these three characters, all brilliantly portrayed is the heart of the film, and one where the outcome really is more than the sum of the parts.<br/><br/>I wasn't familiar with Queen Anne (except as the inspiration for furniture legs) and so it opened new ground, both politically but also socially in the implied lesbian relationships between the three women.<br/><br/>One thing this period drama gets correct that so many do not is the lighting. At night, the film is dark, really dark, with a few spluttering candles, lamps and firelight. It makes the intrigue of dark corners and whispered secrets come to life.<br/><br/>Olivia Colman won that year's Oscar for Leading Actress, which I suppose she deserved, but I would have found it hard to say which of the three main characters was the lead and which were supporting roles.
It sets a high bar for this film genre."

"richardchatten","8","4","5","20 April 2019"," Fearsome Femme Three
","After so many films about Elizabeth I, it's interesting to see Queen Anne at the centre of things in this, the latest in a genre of stylised recreations of the Eighteenth Century such as 'The Draughtsman's Contract' and 'Ridicule' which drool over the costumes (Sandy Powell does her usual magnificent job here when let loose on a bygone era) and decor while happily confronting the more squalid aspects of Eighteenth Century life, such as Queen Anne's gout.<br/><br/>The constant fussy use of steadicam and fisheye lenses (plainly originally inspired by Kubrick's 'Barrie Lyndon') fortunately doesn't detract from the absorbing and sometimes amusing machinations between the fearsome sapphic triumvirate of Oscar-winning Olivia Colman as the Queen literally on her last legs, saturnine Rachel Weisz and lynx-eyed schemer Emma Stone."
"pc95","7","4","5","9 March 2019"," Snakepit
","*spoilers* If you're one for mean-spiritedness, you'll probably enjoy ""The Favorite"", directed pretty well by Yorgos Lanthimos. The antics, heathenism, and gluttony are on full display, and can be entertaining in many stretches though curiously gets tiresome at times, watching selfish or power-hungry debutant tit-for-tats over and over (think ""Looney Tunes""). It does have a story-arc that becomes apparent quickly, but the characters in the movie are loathsome on the whole. Lanthimos makes sure every character is infected with some type of sin or debasement. Had heard of extreme excess in high nobility during tours of castles before, and this brought back memories of those discussions. Rachel Weisz plays villainous characters better than she does other types. And here we have a juxtaposition being brewed up of the 2 main characters over the runtime. I was reminded of the better French film, ""Ridicule"" while watching this - check that movie out if you liked Favorite and don't mind sub-titles. This movie was an entertaining watch too. 7/10 Recommended."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","4","5","8 March 2019"," A striking and considerably ""artsy"" film.
","What. The. Favourite. For those of us watching all of this year's Best Picture nominees, The Favourite (2018) is certainly the token ""artsy"" film of the set. It felt like it was following in the footsteps of last year's Phantom Thread (2017) in that the set decoration and costume design were exquisite, despite the-let's face it-weird characters. Regarding the plot, though, I did find The Favourite to parallel the events in the 1950 Best Picture winner, All About Eve. While its art is on full display for all to see, The Favourite is a bit more than how it looks.<br/><br/>Aside from the aforementioned set decoration and costume design, I have to applaud this movie's cinematography. I'd wager that it'll win in these three categories, but the cinematography stands out because it's so different from most films. Heavily utilizing wide-angle fisheye lenses, as well as copious amounts of natural light (perhaps as an aesthetic homage to Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975), which also shares a somewhat similar plot), the continual movement of the camera is both brilliant and jarring. This accentuates the awkward and uncomfortable situations these characters put themselves in for the duration.<br/><br/>While The Favourite is pretty to look at, the characters and their interactions reveal the true ""artsy"" elements of the film. From tons of lesbian overtones to odd actions and dialogue that is distinctly modern in its vulgarity, some moments definitely made me cringe. All that being said, the nuance and subtlety of the actors' fantastic performances allowed so much to be said without uttering a word. The Favourite excels in the ""show, don't tell"" mentality by also including many parallels and realizations that nothing has changed for these characters. Fortunately, moments of levity, especially with Nicholas Hoult's character, help to keep this movie from getting too dark.<br/><br/>A striking and considerably ""artsy"" film, I give The Favourite 4.0 stars out of 5."

"TheLittleSongbird","9","15","27","5 February 2019"," Unsettling favouritism
","'The Favourite' from the day it came out quickly became one of my most anticipated films. Mainly for the critical acclaim, the vast awards attention and the talented cast (namely Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz). Anybody who has seen and liked Yorgos Lanthimos' previous films, including 'The Lobster', would also find another reason to be psyched about seeing it. Interesting furthermore for seeing a monarch and reign/era not explored an awful lot on film and actually even in general.<br/><br/>Seeing it finally last weekend with my sister, 'The Favourite' didn't disappoint me at all. Completely agree with the acclaim (and just to say there have been times where that has not always been the case) and the award nominations, with it receiving the most nominations of the year along with 'Roma' (another favourite of the year), and hopefully wins for at least a few of the categories are richly deserved. Just to say that my sister also loved it and she knew very little about its critical reception and accolades until when we were talking about the film afterwards, so this is not a case of being ""followers"" and this is a genuine review from somebody who actually did love it and has been known quite a number of times before for going against the grain when it comes to critical consensus. With that being said, can understand why 'The Favourite' won't click, and hasn't clicked, for some. But what some have deemed bizarre, cruel and pointless for me was one of the most entertaining, most visually striking, best acted and surprising films of the year.<br/><br/>Won't say that 'The Favourite' is exempt from criticism. Do have to agree with everybody who found the ending disappointing. Far too abrupt and it didn't make sense, leaving a very odd feeling and aftertaste.<br/><br/>However, the production values are exemplary. It is a beautifully shot and cleverly edited film, with a few effectively nightmarish moments that didn't distract at all (this is including at the end). All of this complements the evocative attention to period detail and the sumptuous locations interiors and exteriors. Especially good in this regard are the costumes, gorgeously designed and opulent and the muted colour pallette for some of them looks tasteful. Lanthimos keeps things going at a breezy pace while allowing it all to breathe, the surreal and strange elements that has not appealed to all in his previous films certainly present but more toned down here in comparison, which makes 'The Favourite' one of his more accessible films in my view.<br/><br/>Do not agree with those panning the soundtrack. Sure, the Ferrari and Messiaen weren't to my tastes and some of the placement is repetitive in places, but the pieces featured are great pieces on their own. The most authentic uses being Bach, Vivaldi and Purcell (including one of his most beautiful songs ""Music for a while""), but most effective was the Schumann Piano Quintet (the opening chords and rhythms are truly haunting) and the poignantly sombre Schubert Piano Sonata, which happened to be one of his last works before his ultimely death. Apart from the repetition, the placement mostly didn't bother me with none of it really juxtaposing with the mood of the scenes (mixing a little camp and just as much seriousness) in question, there is a teasing and disorienting quality that is oddly captivating and clever.<br/><br/>One of 'The Favourite's' biggest triumphs is the script, one of the most entertaining and most beautifully balanced and structured of the year. Many parts are irreverently witty, boasting a number of laugh out loud moments throughout and showing a farce with teeth and bite without being over-the-top or tired. It is also quite darkly disarming and pulls no punches, showing that a period that seems so beautiful and glamorous is not as much as appeared underneath. There is shock value here but it didn't feel that gratuitous and was one of the reasons as to why 'The Favourite' stands out as more than one's ""typical"" idea of a period film. The political elements are sharp and insightful. And then there is a sensuality that both disturbs and charms, the chemistry between the three leads being witty, chilling and tense. On a story level, only the ending misfired for me, everything else is thoroughly absorbing and the different tones and shifts are balanced expertly with no real jarring, the twists in the story being manic without being too much that one can't take it seriously and the deceptions really digging deep.<br/><br/>A great job is done getting quality performances from the cast, all thoroughly committing to their roles and avoiding falling too much in overplayed caricature. Anne especially in her human fraility is given a good deal of depth that one does root for her, and the film did well providing some poignant emotion when needed without being overt amongst all the strangeness and irreverence. The supporting cast are on point, with Nicholas Hoult being particularly enjoyable in a very gleeful way. It's the three female leads that carry 'The Favourite' and all three give performances that are among the best of the year. Emma Stone is alluring and one roots for her at first, while making Abigail's shrewish character change unsettlingly believable. A perhaps never better Rachel Weisz brings caustic wit and authority to Sarah. Even better is Olivia Colman, a truly magnificent performance that gives the character many shades and vulnerability.<br/><br/>Summing up, a great film and one of my favourite films of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

It is boring, vulgar for vulgar's sake, foul, awkward, cruel and basically pointless with a God-awful sound track and an inexcusably bad ending. There were a couple of older women in the audience when I saw this waste of time who laughed out loud on occasion. But mostly, everyone sat there in shock that they had bought into this misery. Sadly, one of the laughing hyenas and her male companion thought it was appropriate to bring a boy of around 10 years old to witness this.

"Cineanalyst","9","5","7","17 March 2019"," Down the Rabbit Hole
","Director Yorgos Lanthimos has gone mainstream, which is not to say that ""The Favourite"" is still not a weird and even perverse experience, as is the case with his prior oeuvre. Having recently seen two of his Greek movies, ""Dogtooth"" (2009) and ""Alps"" (2011), along with his two former English-language ventures, ""The Lobster"" (2015) and ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017), he's quickly become one of my favorite filmmakers of today. Unlike those earlier pictures, however, ""The Favourite"" wasn't written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou, which may be why it also doesn't feature his trademark stilted acting, which I admit was becoming stale by ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"" undermining what was a promising modern interpretation of a historical myth (in that case, an ancient-to-classical Greek narrative most famously written down as ""Iphigenia in Aulis"" by Euripides). Here, Lanthimos and his new screenwriters take on a rather mythologized British history of the court of Queen Anne. The three leads of Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz deservedly were honored on the awards circuit, including each receiving Oscar nominations, as well as an Oscar win for Colman as Queen Anne. Meanwhile, ""The Favourite"" is a visual delight, and although it's the most traditional and mainstream--and, in a way, simplistic--production of Lanthimos's career, it's strange enough that its ending and rabbit metaphor seems to have baffled or upset some audiences.<br/><br/>Allowing or directing the three leads to perform in a more traditional style of acting is of utmost importance here. And, despite the suspect award stratagem of listing two of them in supporting categories, they're all leads, especially Stone, who is the main protagonist for whose perspective most of the narrative is told, with the story of Queen Anne and, indeed, Lady Sarah being mostly a sidelong look from Abigail's viewpoint. Moreover, according to the only screentime count I could find, from Erick Anderson of AwardsWatch, Stone has over 56 minutes on screen compared to Colman's 47 minutes and about 45 minutes for Weisz. Anyways, the sexual politics of the court intrigue would've fallen flat without allowing for character identification--much as one was unable to connect with the family of ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" because of the abnormal line readings of the performers. On the other hand, the deadpan style worked in Lanthimos's Greek pictures because they were self-reflexive works about cinematic performance, and it worked in ""The Lobster"" because it was a dystopian burlesque. Yet, ""The Favourite"" deals with a historical subject--even though the filmmakers play very loose with the factual record and are almost obtusely anachronistic at times. Regardless, Colman, Stone and Weisz are terrific in their exaggerated characterizations of these real historical women--all three monstrous and vulnerable, tragic and villainous. Personally, I find it difficult to pick a favorite among them, which is the reasoning behind the studio's divvying the three performances between leading and supporting awards categories to begin with. In other narratives, the characters featured in the sidelong glance are often the more attractive spectacle, but here Stone's Abigail may undergo the most character development and be the most hideous character among them, and the supporting and background male characters tend to be the more flamboyant in costume and make-up.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the allegedly strange ending, although I think it's an entirely appropriate piece of irony. The main thrust of ""The Favourite"" is the vying between Abigail and Sarah to act in the stead of the head of state, Queen Anne, including by being her lover. The irony is that Sarah may not be entirely upset in relinquishing her role as the favorite, whereas Abigail may come to regret her new role. Abigail has become like the Queen's rabbits: surrogates for the love missing in the Queen's life. And, as Abigail holds a rabbit under her heel, as a disquieting power trip, just because she can, so to does the Queen hold down Abigail in a subservient position to her sadistic power--thus, the superimposed image of Abigail and the bunnies, who are now one in the same.<br/><br/>For a splendidly strange picture, I also love the rabbit metaphor because of its allusion to to the ""Alice in Wonderland"" books. It also helps that the cinematography is offsetting, including the use of extreme wide-angle lenses (even fisheye views) and natural lighting. And the Hatfield House, where the majority of the picture was shot, is lovely, with doors receding into murals, and the wide-angle lenses accentuating the corridors and candlelight lending authenticity to the costume picture. ""The Favourite"" is a fascinating visual piece of art just to view figures moving down hallways or even the camera moving through the spaces--through the resplendent oddities of the rabbit hole."

","""The Favourite"" is a deliciously wicked and fictionalized account of what might have taken place between Queen Anne of England, her friend and confidante Lady Sarah, and a maid with aspirations named Abigail, as Sarah and Abigail vied for the Queen's favor.<br/><br/>Director Yorgos Lanthimos, whose last two films, ""The Lobster"" and ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"" were marred by his determination to make his audience queasy, goes a little easier on us with this one. If you like his style, don't worry -- the film has his fingerprints all over it. But whereas those other films mentioned were so weird as to pull me out of the narrative, ""The Favourite"" is more like ""Dogtooth,"" the film that introduced me to Lanthimos in the first place, in that the weirdness is hypnotic and kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see where this whacky movie was going to go next. And unlike ""The Lobster,"" which apparently was supposed to be a comedy, ""The Favourite"" actually made me laugh many times.<br/><br/>The acting is stellar, with Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone all giving crackerjack performances. The film explores the lengths to which people will go in order to yield power over one another. Though all three ladies get plenty of opportunities to shine, the film feels more ""about"" Abigail than anyone, and we watch her first wrestle with her morals as she realizes how skeezy she will have to be to beat Lady Sarah at her game, then commit to doing what she has to do to be top dog, and finally left wondering why she wanted to be top dog in the first place, a warning given to her by rival Lady Sarah that she refuses to heed. And Olivia Colman's Queen Anne is a wolf in sheep's clothing, her physical and emotional frailty a camouflage for her monstrous obsession with being adored.<br/><br/>""The Favourite"" looks stunning, the kind of film that wins Oscars for production design, costume design, and cinematography but actually deserves them. The film reminded me once in a while of Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" in its look and tone, though ""The Favourite"" isn't afraid to get its hands dirty whereas ""Barry Lyndon"" remained stately and pristine.<br/><br/>Easily one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"Chuck5111","Null","23","48","20 December 2018"," Excellent, but, like so MANY historical biography movies, has gross inaccuracies.
","I saw this film this afternoon at our local art house; the costumes and sets were sumptuous, the dialogue scathingly witty, and the acting left NOTHING to be desired. I realize that most moviegoers aren't going to give one hoot or another about what I'm about to kvetch about, but, why, why, WHY is it that this film--like so MANY historical/biographical movies, HAS to have so many inaccuracies? So...here goes. Firstly, Abigail Hill Masham came into the household of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, before Anne had become queen, not after she was already on the throne, and every biography I've read of Anne mentions NOTHING about her having started service in the palace as a scullery maid. Secondly....and, again, based upon my reading, there is NO evidence of Anne having kept pet rabbits. Thirdly--and, this is my biggest beef--NO biography I've EVER read of Anne, Sarah, and Abigail has implied or mentioned any sort of lesbian relationship among them; if anything, Anne was so devoted to the memory of her dead husband, Prince George of Denmark, and such a staunch ""defender of the faith,"" that such an idea is ludicrous. The particular scene where Anne tells Sarah that she's going to keep Abigail on because of her ""talents with her tongue"" (paraphrased) defies belief. Was Anne emotionally dependent on both these women? Undoubtedly! Is it a leap to ascribe it to lesbianism? MOST DEFINITELY! Fourthly, there is NO historical record of Abigail having poisoned Sarah's tea or Sarah being kidnapped and held prisoner. Fifthly, neither woman would have had the effrontery to call the Queen ""Anne."" It IS true that Sarah and Anne's pet names for each other were ""Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman,"" but, that was at Anne's earlier request. All this being said, I give this film a 6.5/7 out of 10. My beef is why this film, like so many historical films, has to stretch the truth so much to ""sell"" the movie. As an aside, I don't understand why a lot of people who reviewed this have a problem with the ending. It was perfectly clear to me. When you get to the top, it's not all rosy.

How did you end up in this tawdry affair?<br/><br/>I suppose it is a historical docudrama comedy or a statement about life being nasty and brutish even for a queen, but watching wealthy, upper-stuff elite act boorish in the face of bloody, distant war smacks of triteness, somewhat reconjuring feelings felt upon trying to fight one's way through an uninterrupted viewing of The Death of Stalin. The Favourite smashes together ideas from Amadeus, Barry Lyndon, and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, all of which, and each of which, are sorely and surely better films.<br/><br/>What if a bunch of miserable, thankless, and uninteresting people all had to live together in one house? Perhaps The Favourite is a modern-day biting critique of The Real World, or even a subtly clever reboot of Fey Big Brother.

"JackCerf","7","2","2","25 February 2019"," Good Nasty Historical Fun
","Maybe it's because I'm familiar with the history of the period, but I didn't find it as hard to follow the story as some of the mainstream critics. Churchill epitomized it thus: Godolphin managed the Parliament, Sarah managed the Queen, and Marlborough managed the war. That is, until they didn't because the bulk of the landowing class decided that England had been victorious enough that they didn't have to go on paying land tax. At that point, the Tories won the 1710 election, Sarah fell out of favor, and England abandoned its allies and negotiated peace with France. Abigail Masham, who took Sarah's place in Anne's affection, indeed had backdoor connections with Harley, the leader of the Tories.<br/><br/>But the war and the politics are just the McGuffin for this movie. The core story is the shifting emotional relationship among the three women, which I found quite involving and fairly well grounded in history as such movies go. (It's certainly far better grounded than the egregious Mary Queen of Scots.) Anne was gouty and not too bright, and she did lose 17 children. (Her husband, Prince George of Denmark, was written out of the story as a distraction from the central triangle.) Sarah was Anne's BFF from the time they were teens, and she was the dominant one in the relationship until Anne kicked her to the curb. Anne did write Sarah some pretty steamy letters, which Sarah included in her published memoirs after Anne's death. Sarah and her husband Marlborough did embezzle public funds. Abigail Masham was accused at the time, albeit by writers in Sarah's pay, of having a lesbian relationship with Anne. The aristocratic bad behavior in this variant on All About Eve was great fun, and the performances deserve all the critical praise they've gotten."

Kudos to Yorgos Lanthimos on delivering a darkly entertaining story about power and it's twisted influence on human beings. It is made particularly enjoyable by the enthralling performance of the three lead actors. Olivia Colman's portrayal of Queen Anne is riveting. She flawlessly executes the role of a bitter queen pushed to circumstances and responsibilities for which she hadn't prepared. The cinematography fits perfectly the mood of the movie and helps the accentuate the emotions of those on screen. However, the film is not without flaw. The pacing seems uneven at places. The script in places does not seem to serve it's own purpose. I did not love the ending. The last 15 min seems wholly unimportant. But the final shot is powerful and something to hold out for.

Churchill's cousin, Abigail Hill soon arrives to the kingdom looking for a job. She eventually gets close to the ailing Queen and Sarah and Abigail start to battle for the Queen's affection. The Queen has a history of health problems so she needs someone to attend to her consistently. The motives of Abigail seem unclear because she seems to have many different interests and pursuits. The film stars an excellent cast of Olivia Coleman, Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone, with supporting roles from Nicholas Hoult and Joe Alwyn.<br/><br/>Yorgo's style is still ever present in this film. The camera uses fish eye and wide shots that encompass the entire grand scenery and decor of the castle. He uses natural lighting which is a common thread in his work. The characters are very well acted, especially Coleman who was just born to scream at servants and complain loudly about everything. I thought the film touches on a relationship between women but doesn't linger on it long enough. The film has comedic one liners as is expected from Lanthimos' work. Its a very interesting film with memorable characters with motivations you can't see.<br/><br/>The film is so very nice to look at but for me doesn't have as strong a presence of something like The Lobster. This is a historical work so I can see restrictions in the imagination that we are used to seeing from Lanthimos but its still a very interesting work because of the intricacies of the relationship between the three leads and how mad they become as the film goes along. its prim and proper in appearance but there's a royal madness to it all. Its worth the watch, and I'm excited for the next chapter of work from the filmmaker.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"PotassiumMan","10","24","53","2 December 2018"," Vicious, bawdy tale of a queen's court
","Yorgos Lanthimos takes on the biopic genre in this serpentine and visually striking depiction of Queen Anne in her diminished condition and her shifting companionship between Lady Sarah, who largely took over the reigns of the state and Abigail, a young woman who comes to the court as a servant but quickly earns the queen's fondness. Abigail becomes a foil not only for Lady Sarah but for the male leaders in Parliament.<br/><br/>Emma Watson and Rachel Weisz play well off each other as Abigail and Lady Sarah respectively. Olivia Coleman is a joy to watch as the frail but furiously combustible Queens Anne. Nicholas Hoult is solid in a supporting turn as the leader of Parliament opposition.<br/><br/>The film is loaded with Lanthimosian dark humor but also cold mystery and austere cinematography and camerawork. In time, we get to know the quirks, hidden secrets and impulses of all three characters as the court confronts the pressures of war with France and political instability at home- and more privately as the queen's closest female confidants duel for their place.<br/><br/>One of Lanthimos's best films to date, this one will keep you on the edge until the very last frame with one memorable sequence after another. Recommended to the highest degree."

"statuskuo","10","21","46","8 December 2018"," The Funniest Most Brutal Film of The Millenium
","Those who are familiar with the somewhat self indulgent monosyllabic writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos may watch this and feel a bit of commercial appeal style that we were all wondering when he was going to get it. He does, and we've been made the fools by previous efforts.<br/><br/>This is acerbic, hilarious and brutally immature look at regal life during a time when feudal wars were at hand. While it still lacks the typical Hollywood-ised completion, this is the film I've been waiting for for a VERY long time.
The story is of Queen Anne who is at the head of England suffering from...responsibility. A Millenial in her time, perhaps? She is played pitch perfect by Olivia Colman, whom if Academy voters aren't too weighed down by all the political ""movements"" should see this as the most perfect performance of the year. When the story begins, Queen Anne is watched over meticulously and with a great deal of tough love by Lady Sarah, played perfectly by Rachel Weisz. Along comes her cousin Abigail, who recently traveled to the estate to seek out employment. Little by little she integrates herself into the good graces of the Queen and slyly usurps positioning.
While this seems like a game of up-womanship, it is really about the fate of England. Admittedly, I know very little about royalty, this film requires you don't know much. Only that women can be brutally cruel to one another to edge one another out. And, boy...is it brutal. The verbal sparring and bitter passive aggressive behavior is catty and mean but also wickedly fun. Pay close attention to the small statements that get under your skin. Even the men get into the act, sooner or later. It's when we learn later that these positions do require favors to remain, in favor (hence, ""The Favourite"" what we are watching is Joan Crawford vs. Bette Davis in royal garb.
And guess what? Emma Stone holds her own in English vernacular against the English Weisz INCREDIBLY well. Though it slips at points, it's the rhythm of the speak that makes you forget she is an American from Arizona.
The beautiful cinematography by Robbie Ryan is brave. Oh boy is it ever brave. Extreme wide angles cover ever corner of that manor which oddly makes it feel like some cold dripping prison. Poor workers who wait in the shadows are felt like the presence of statues, yet do very little to quell Anne's horrific behavior.
For those who see this film as their first Yorgos Lathimos project...I mean, ""The Killing of A Sacred Deer"" is tedious work. This, however, written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara holds him to a brilliant standard. Along with his usual surrealist imagery and dark comedic timing, it proves to be a match made in Hell (in this case).
I love love LOVE this film. One last thing...I hope Nicholas Hoult gets a nod by the Academy as well. He is brilliant as Harley, who spins his own web every time he is on screen. While dueling with Sarah, he turns favor (reluctantly) with Abigail to attempt to gather some foothold in how the kingdom will survive. In the most devious way. Just awesome all around. Something else to consider, once this film was done, I wanted to stay past credits so I could watch again. It's that much fun."

","I do not like movies that slaughter history, and this one is worse than most. the acting and production value was tops, but the costumes and the accents were not. i wish I had read up on it before seeing it. Here are just a few....<br/><br/>Queen Anne didn't let bunnies hop around her bedroom. That right there should tell you a lot about the movie.<br/><br/>The whole movie was about sexual relationships between Queen Anne and Lady Marlborough and Abigail Hill- never happened as far as anyone knows.There was a poem believed to have been written by Whig propagandist Arthur Mainwaring, (died in 1648) which suggested that there was a lesbian relationship between Anne and her chambermaid, Abigail Hill. Historians largely believe that Sarah circulated it out of jealousy rather than truth. Blenhim was built 1705-1722 and the movie takes place before construction was begun..<br/><br/>The clothing was all wrong for the time. Sarah Marlborough wore men's clothing a lot of the time.<br/><br/>Tory leader Robert Harley was not an attractive young 20-something during the reign of Queen Anne.<br/><br/>Sarah (aka the Duchess of Marlborough) realized she was no longer Queen Anne's favourite in 1707 after she learned that Abigail had married Samuel Masham, a groom in the bedchamber of Anne's husband. Anne's husband died in 1708.<br/><br/>The rivalry did not reach the life and death stakes seen in the movie. Much of the rivalry was born out of the fact that Sarah and Abigail opposed each others politics."

","A pair of disingenuous young aspirants vie over Queen Anne's favor amidst the pomp and presumption of 18th century England. Sarah, the stand-offish, incumbent chief of staff, brusquely runs the country while her queen deals with depression, near-madness and a nasty case of the gout. Abigail, a disgraced former upper-class lady who stumbles into the palace smelling of dung and desperation, uses a delicate, sensitive touch to sway the monarch's opinion from the harsher methods of her rival. This pair launches a string of increasingly spiteful schemes and manipulations, always aiming to boost their own standing at the expense of the other, and even the queen herself isn't above such games. A vivid display of willpower, gamesmanship and raw nastiness masked under the guise of civility.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are both excellent as the dueling ladies, but I found the experienced, versatile Olivia Colman's turn as Queen Anne most impressive. Nuanced and complex, her performance transforms a rather frail, tragic figure into something larger, something damaged but still formidable. A Best Actress nomination well-earned.<br/><br/>The camerawork sometimes grows over-ambitious (many early shots use a distracting wide-angle lens that feels out of place) and the ending is a bit of a head-scratcher, but otherwise it's a well-balanced, deliciously mean-spirited battle of wits."
"epaulguest","3","6","10","29 January 2019"," Unrewarding and wastes good opportunities
","This is not my favourite film. Apparently it's a comedy, but I found it unrewarding and not funny at all. Though perhaps superficially true to the historical facts, it's completely lacking in depth and only ""nods"" towards its historical background. The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14) is a backdrop to the film but, absurdly, seems the only public issue in the reign of Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman).<br/><br/>True, there was a triangular relationship between Anne, Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail Hill, later Baroness Masham (Emma Stone). However, there seems to be no evidence of a real lesbian relationship between Anne and Abigail, just an allegation by Sarah - who according to evidence could be cold, bossy and vengeful.<br/><br/>The film makes Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford & Earl Mortimer (Nicholas Hoult), look effete and rather effeminate, but he was in fact effectively Anne's First Minister from 1711 to her death in 1714.<br/><br/>The historical figures are, then, pretty crudely drawn. Anne is often caricatured in the film. She seems to have had quite a hard life, with serious ailments - especially gout, which the film doesn't treat seriously - and, as she mentions herself, she lost 17 children. She's also portrayed as prone to alarming mood swings and pompous behaviour, e.g. by exclaiming ""I am The Queen"" and ordering Abigail only to speak when spoken to. No one would know from this film that she was deeply religious.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Anne reminded me of George III in Alan Bennett's film and the lesbian faded soap actress ""Sister George"", both in much better dramas. Perhaps ""The Favourite"" is a film in which ""The Madness of King George"" meets ""The Killing of Sister George"".<br/><br/>""The Favourite"" wastes some good opportunities. As it's based on real events, it should have exploited them in some detail. At least I found the leading actresses' performances very powerful and was impressed by the film's lighting, which suggests how much an interior depended on natural light from outside. The sound track, however, is rather strange: in a couple of early and late scenes there's a noise like a siren. Some of the dialogue (leaving expletives aside) sounded far more 21st-century than 18th.<br/><br/>Queen Anne would make quite an interesting subject for a serious film. She has a pivotal place in British history, as the last Stuart monarch and the daughter of this country's last Catholic monarch, James II. Parts of her biography could be interwoven on film with scenes from her personal life based on reliable sources."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","9","17","14 January 2019"," An artsy treatment of a small ripple in history
","First, some background. This movie is based on a piece of mildly interesting English history. There is no sibling murder, no violent beheading, no earth-shaking war (just brief mention of one on the peripheral). Critics like to compare this movie to ""All about Eve"", with some justification as it is indeed about a new-comer, an initially harmless-looking young woman, usurping the place of a well-established diva of sorts. But that is where the comparison ends. In ""All about Eve"" there is no queen who is the focus of this vying to be the favourite.<br/><br/>The story is told by auteur-in-the-making, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, in neat little chapters with titles taken from the dialogue in the chapter (""A minor hitch"", ""I dreamed I stabbed you in the eye"" etc etc). The narrative comes in crisp, short scenes creating a pacing that compensates somewhat for the lacking in real excitement (the aforementioned absence of true violence and death).<br/><br/>The artsy direction is right away clearly noticeable: generous use of fisheye lens shots, contrasting light and shadow, heavy use of sustained powerful strings and rhythmic piano. There are also cross-cutting montages such as the one accentuating the queen's excruciating pain from gout with the enterprising newcomer's venture into the woods to look for a cure. A dialogue between the two competing women has them filmed as silhouettes against a large, bright opaque window. A very slow-zoom closeup to the queen's face finally leads to her outburst of a yelled: stop! Everywhere you look, throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The duration of the movie covers a bit less than a decade of Queen Anne's (Olivia Colman) reign up to three years before her death in 1714. It starts by showing Duchess Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), childhood friend of Anne, now in formidable control of state affairs through her intimacy with Anne whose psychological age is probably that of a young teen. Furthermore, Anne is plagued by poor health, particularly painful gout. The newcomer is Abigail Masham (Emma Stone), an ex-aristocrat (circumstances omitted here) coming to seek help from cousin Sarah. Initially taken as a lowly servant, Abigail impresses Sarah with her initiative in finding a remedy for Anne. Seeing her as no more than a useful aid, Sarah makes Abigail a backup in the time-demanding task of tending to Anne. Abigail's superficial innocence is disarming. Although it does not take Sarah too long to see what is coming, it is a little too late. Let the game begin.<br/><br/>Abigail's scheming is depicted in scene after scene meticulously crafted. While she is taken out of the lowly servant's status, Abigail deliberately stays virtually invisible but at the same time observes and listens with utmost attention, as during a confrontation between Anne and Robert Harley (Nicolas Hoult) on whether to go to war (more on this later). However, she is quick and unwavering when an opportunity arises: when Sarah, extremely busy, sends her fill in for a couple of hours, Anne quite understandably is not particularly thrilled by having this near-stranger (albeit someone she recognizes). Unfazed upon being sent away, she recognizes a sure-fire path to Anne's heart, the 17 rabbits the Queen considers her offspring. But it is far from smooth sailing for Abigail. In this movie that is virtually devoid of real violence, those that are manufactured for artistic value have Abagail as target. Harley, in trying to recruit Abagail as his spy, pushes her down a low slope, in his ""persuasion"". When Sarah begins to suspect something, she nearly shoots Abagail ""accidentally"" during their game shooting. Abagail soon gets even, during another shooting session, when she fires so quickly that the blood of the fowl sprinkles on Sarah's face. At that very juncture, a servant arrives to announce the Queen's summon. At Sarah's short pause, still thinking of the blood on her face, the servant hesitatingly adds, pointing towards Abagail, ""The Queen wants HER"".<br/><br/>The main body of this movie is a satirical, sometimes sardonic expansion of the title - the story of how the two women compete to be Queen Anne's favourite, and hence power. I wouldn't go into details. The backdrop is simple. Together with her husband, a Lord and a Whig, Sarah pushes for war with France and heavy taxes on landowners. In fierce opposition is aforementioned Tory Harley who has recruited Abagail to spy for him.<br/><br/>I should be very surprised if the acting does to fetch a couple of BAFTA rewards. Oscar may be a different story as there are American nominees to be considered. While all three performance are riveting, the demand on the three roles vary. Weisz's Sarah is more straightforward - upper-class, coolly in control consistently. Stone portrays an evolving Abigail, growing in menace with every scene. The absolutely mesmerizing performances however comes from Colman. With measured precision, she delivers a Queen Anne inhibited with ailment, eccentricities and neuroses. At them same time, we also see an Anne with endearing, childlike simplicity. Furthermore, there are moments when in innate monarch surfaces when, more than once, we hear her deliver a steely: ""I have spoken"". The ultimate cruel irony is her inability to recognize herself as the victim of manipulation by the two women who are supposed to love her. As Golden Globe has two categories for best picture as well as lead, Colman and Glenn Close triumph separately in peaceful co-existence. I am willing to bet anything that BAFTA is Colman's. As to Oscar, well....."

However, her ambitions are much higher than that.<br/><br/>Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, which made me sceptical about this movie. Lanthimos's previous two movies - The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer - were pretentious, pointless, random nonsense. Here, however, he adds a fair degree of much-needed substance to the style, creating a movie that is intriguing and interesting, even funny, while set against actual historic events. There's still a fair bit of unnecessary style-over-substance scenes (and sounds - the jarring music was annoying at times) but for the most part this is a good story.<br/><br/>Lanthimos makes use of some innovative techniques to enhance the atmosphere. The use of fisheye lens shots was highly original and gives a great sense of the vastness, and emptiness, of the palace.<br/><br/>Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are great in the main roles.

As far as tone, this movie was no different from Lanthimos's other films: the script and story were viciously written and executed, the performances were utterly captivating, and the world itself was exquisitely imagined. The characters we get to know are indeed based on real people, though, I admit my knowledge of the history of this time period is vague. Do not look to me on questions of its accuracy; I've read a touch from wiki just now to brush up a bit, but I couldn't give you history lesson.

","So much good, so much bad. After wishing it would end, it finally did, and as I always do, I sorted out why I felt so disheartened in the aftermath. Do we make art for its own sake, or should there be a greater purpose? Why tell this story? There is nothing that inspires humanity by it, it's cold and heartless. Yet the performances by Colman, Weisz and Stone are exceptional, it almost constitutes must-see material. Why such a waste? You relate to Stone's desperate position at first, and yet the cruelty she is driven to inflict makes little sense. There is humanity in her performance, but not in the writing. There is no arc in the sense of self-reflection that what she does, the games they play, weigh on their conscious. Once the game is afoot, it's one ploy after another, for what? To gain the good graces of the Queen? To preserve their social status? This is the reason this film falls so flat. It will not allow for some true humanity to play a part. Stone will stop at nothing to gain favor, and she is not written to have any doubt about how her actions will affect Weisz. It's not believable or realistic, though not Stone's fault. Yes, in those days if we only understood the pressure she must have felt to avoid going back to the way things were, being raped ad nauseum in normal peasant life.. That's what we're told to buy, and even if it were true, there is more complexity to that than this film is willing to explore. When those don't land, we start to wonder.. Why the irritating commitment to fish bowl shots? Why the historically anachronistic irreverence? It's fun to someone writing it perhaps, and 'funny', but it only serves to weaken any truth the film was close to touching upon. A waste. Makes you think, yes. So I gave it six stars out of ten. The performances, from all three (lead) actors are worth the price of admission. But this film has little to really say about anything. It strengthens the general understanding that our world is horrible. But I think we can do much better, and telling this story with more vulnerability and honesty instead of the commitment to absurdity, comedy, vulgarity, and flair would have honored the amazing acting that saves the film from complete future anonymity."

The story could have been developed so much better, instead the quality of the film is so low that the plot is completely wasted.
The director clearly wanted to do something innovative and extravagant, but one must be talented for that to be a success, and in his case it ended up in a disaster.

And how many scenes had gratuitous rutting in the background? Well, I'm not going to watch it again to count. I'm not going to watch this movie ever again.
I should add, however, that Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone and Olivia Colman all delivered excellent performances."

"ateandahalf","9","3","4","4 September 2019"," Bitterly hilarious
","Changing his tune from the disturbing revenge saga The Killing of a Sacred Deer, of which I am a big fan, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos returns in even better form with this viciously funny tragicomedy set in and around the court of Queen Anne.<br/><br/>The Favourite follows a trio of characters as Abigail (Emma Stone) and her cousin Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) vie for their position as the favourite of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman); a three-way power struggle involving manipulation, blackmail and jealousy, where no one holds true authority. This often results in wickedly hilarious consequences, inspiring many more laughs than most modern comedies, mainly due to brilliantly composed dialogue and characters expertly crafted by writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara. At the hands of Yorgos Lanthimos however, this comedy almost becomes surrealist and absurdist, a common theme throughout all his films, emphasised by the frequent use of a wide angle lens which bends the landscape, and an ominous score underlying the usual classical music that laces costume dramas. This adds sophistication and satirical comedic touches to the drama, outcomes representative of Lanthimos' talent and emergence from the arthouse world.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that all three lead characters are played to perfection - something which is echoed in the awards attention they have received - the stand out is Colman as the child-like and at times tragic Queen Anne. Her performance adds both bitterness and tenderness to the film, reflected not only in her sudden outbursts and complaints but also her care and love for her rabbits, enabling the audience to remain grounded and preventing the film from tipping over into the bizarre.<br/><br/>Yorgos Lanthimos triumphs with this multi-layered period piece, comprised of erudite humour, absurdist satire and an unsettling atmosphere, expertly delivered by three perfectly judged performances."
"aaronburley-43699","7","3","4","10 July 2019"," Behind the scenes of Queen Anne's Kingdom
","Yorgos Lanthimos' latest production is a disturbing period drama telling us about the highly manipulative, insanely clever and cruel minds behind the doors of Queen Anne's kingdom.<br/><br/>Olivia Coleman won the oscar for best actress for her performance as Queen Anne and once you see the film is is clear why, she shows every piece of the characters grief - her pain, her sadness, her anger, her confusion and her cruelty that she can burst out with in moments. A absoloutely brilliant performance.
Rachel Weisz plays Lady Sarah, the right-hand woman and advisor to the queen. She too demonstrated her excellent acting skills to show a person who is constantly thinking, constantly planning her next moves in order to always come out on top, she dominated every room she was in.
Emma Stone as Abigail Hill was something quite unexpected, starting off as a young and smart character who was fairly innocent yet underneith was just as calculating and as cruel as her co-stars. In her own words she is ""capable of much unpleasantness"".<br/><br/>Every second of the film is filled with high amounts of tension, watching these three characters with eachother - all of them attempting to be the ultimate winner. Scraping and scratching at one another until the other two keel over or give up.
I reccomend this film to anyone looking for a period piece that is different, a new perspective on how far someone will go to remain ""The Favourite""."

","I absolutely loved the acting, especially Olivia Coleman's performance. Unfortunately, I expected a high-end period piece about Queen Anne, not a far-out, fictionalized dry comedy. I disliked how much fiction was inserted into this story - but that was just myself being 'off' in expectations. I suppose if one goes into this movie with different expectations, they would appreciate. I laughed out loud at the weird dance scene, tho it was one of many bizarre moments. The one-note, repetitive music score was also bizarre, and a little annoying, although it was appropriate for what I believe the director wanted you to feel. The fish-eye camera angles were... unnecessary? Maybe it is beyond my own tastes. I loved the costumes, and realistic makeup. (I can't stand it when period pieces show 21st century makeup trends. I assume what shows here is more realistic for the time and makeup quality.) At the end the of the movie, I did want more -- more of the real story. Thanks internet. Lastly, I detested the hard-to-read, acute, justified block typography. Someone apparently wants to start a new trend in graphic design which I'm hoping will not be accepted nor duplicated.... please, no."
"areatw","7","3","4","30 March 2019"," Not usually my thing, but I enjoyed this one
","Period dramas have been popularised of late by the likes of 'Downton Abbey' and 'Call the Midwife', and while personally period pieces aren't my cup of tea and I've never been particularly interested in watching them on TV, I was drawn to watching 'The Favourite'. Partly because of the excellent reviews it had received, and partly because a 2 hour film doesn't require as much commitment as a long, drawn-out drama series.<br/><br/>To my surprise, and to the film's credit, I sat through the whole thing and did get some enjoyment out of it. 'The Favourite' does a good job at appealing to more than just the typical 'Downton Abbey' fan audience, which is probably down to the fact that it is surprisingly funny and the lead characters deliver entertaining performances. As with all other high-budget period dramas, 'The Favourite' is also a pleasure to watch with some beautiful cinematography and costume design. This is an accessible period drama film that can be enjoyed by a more general audience, as well as fans of the genre."

"TheMovieDiorama","9","3","4","4 January 2019"," The Favourite deliciously balances courtly politics, devious deceit and sexual jealousy with dark humour.
","Yorgos Lanthimos is a director that does not hide any aspects to his films. If it's unusual, explicit or perhaps even downright mad, he will show it. Audibly separating himself from Hollywood manufactured creations that would never dare to take such bold risks. Whilst The Favourite might be his most accessible film to date, it is certainly his funniest and most sumptuous. During the War of the Spanish Succession, two cousins attempt to convince Queen Anne to be the court favourite. However it soon spirals out of control and turns into a deadly game of jealousy.<br/><br/>Three powerfully inclined women that boast complex mental states. Writer Davis is almost a puppeteer, pulling at the strings of these characters. Each one horrendously unlikeable, whether it be Anne's inexplicable childish behaviour or Abigail's ruthless goal to no longer be impoverished. You dislike them, yet Davis' ingenious screenplay allows you to sympathise with them. They each have experienced sorrow and it is soon revealed that these characters are tragically broken. Their bonds are tested through viperous actions of lust, envy and greed. One spoken word could change your view immediately. One heinous act, particularly purposefully crushing a rabbit, could make you almost indefinitely despise a character you once thought to be the protagonist. It's not a story with grand gestures and lavish plot devices. It's entirely character driven. The subtle twists and turns that further the plot, come from these three sexually ambiguous women who would do anything for power. Lanthimos, whilst still embedding his signature surrealism, never goes over the top or makes the story abundantly dark (unlike 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer'). It remains grounded and Davis' unflinching humour adds that extra depth of ill-mannered politics. Five minutes in a frivolous Hoult exclaims the worst expletive possible in a high-pitched voice. It was from that moment I knew I was watching a Lanthimos feature. The unwavering sense of boldness.<br/><br/>The majority of acclaim that this film has already garnered is towards its three leading performances. I can categorically say now, these are career bests from all these actresses. Stone flawlessly pulled off a British accent and held your attention through falsified innocence. Weisz enigmatically remained captivating with an assured performance that explored the lengths one would go for Queen and country. However it's Colman that steals every scene. Predominantly a TV actress, she was absolutely sensational in this picture and translated to the big screen outstandingly, proving she is one of the best actresses working today. The change in character from a stubborn child to a commanding Queen, which can happen in a split second, was exceptional. The additional layer of melancholy and desire for attention was conveyed simply through Colman's facial expressions. A performance that quite simply deserves any and all awards. Even supporting cast members Hoult, Alwyn and Gatiss were excellent. But the praise doesn't stop there, oh no. Ryan's cinematography was gorgeous and presented 18th Century Britain with style and vigour. The inclusion of natural lighting also enhanced the authentic style that Ryan was able to capture. The use of fisheye and wide lenses enabled the characters to feel claustrophobic in the large room that is shown, capturing every detail within the luscious production design. The mixture of classical pieces from Vivaldi and Bach with modern composers allowed Lanthimos' contemporary filmmaking to intertwine with the period setting. Also the costumes were beautifully designed, particularly the royal dresses.<br/><br/>It's a two hour film, and occasionally it can be felt. The political subplot regarding a battalion in the war and bringing in state taxes was underdeveloped. Understandably the focus is on the behind-the-scenes of these courtly politics, however it never truly feels captivating. Consequently these various scenes allows the pace to dip. Fortunately the proceeding scenes shifts the focus back onto the favourites, with the rapid pace resuming. At first, I was not keen on its conclusion. It left me wanting more. But actually it was incredibly powerful and full of purpose, further asserting the Queen's power. Oh, also loved the chapter title cards. Found them to be rather humorous. In the end, The Favourite nobly presents love, honour and power through jealousy, deceit and manipulation. Proving that Lanthimos is not just a director, but an auteur filmmaker who is here to stay."

","Queen Anne (Coleman) is ill and ineffective and so Lady Sarah (Weitz) essentially manages queen and country. That is until Abigail, a lady on hard times but with ambitions, arrives at the palace to compete with Sarah for the top spot.<br/><br/>It is just so refreshing to see something so original, that is so near to a bizarre art house movie but remains so hugely accessible to us simple folk. The camera work and lighting is deeply strange but somehow seems right, the script is wonderful, with the humour jet black and laugh out loud funny and the supporting cast particularly Hoult all over the top but great fun. Key to all this though is the 3 leads. Weitz's role as the power behind the throne is the least flamboyant of the 3 but she is great in it demonstrating a determined and scary strength throughout. Stone's character is the real cornerstone of the plot and she's clearly having a whale of a time conning her way to the top. Finally there is Coleman as the queen, a women of power and a wrecked life, unable to rule anything. Coleman mixes sweetness and madness effortlessly whilst at the same time giving us most of big laughs - a superb performance.<br/><br/>This is not for everyone and not for maiden aunts as they say - 'Victoria' it ain't, several people walked out of the screening I went to after 20 minutes leaving the rest of us to soak it all up and enjoy the razor sharp wit."

Absurd. Neither historically true nor dramatically true. Queen Anne? Competent ruler of England for I think fourteen years. Had seventeen miscarriages. What do you think? A total wimp who lets herself be dominated by a woman? Then by another woman? Are we kidding. And Lady Churchill. Wife of a general. In 1800 or so in a society completely dominated by men. Sure. She gets to act like wonder woman on steroids. And somehow gets away with it? It seemed so wrong it was obviously some kind of joke. I guess. Or incompetence more likely. It's like this movie was anachronistic at the stupidest level possible -- like the director was simply too dense to understand that society was different in 1800, that even Hollywood 'interpersonal' melodrama has to be modified to fit the world of the times. If you make a movie that is entirely character driven, you damn well better ensure that your characters make some kind of human sense. In this movie they made almost no human sense. But it was still kind of fun and the acting, given the god awful script, was interesting to watch so it wasn't a total loss."
"bkoganbing","9","4","6","10 March 2019"," A classic case of overplaying one's hand
","After having seen and become a fan of the very first series on Masterpiece Theater The First Churchills, I was anxious to see the different slant The Favourite
had on what is an enlargement of the last years of that story. As The First
Churchills was based on Winston Churchill's biography of his ancestor The Duke
of Marlborough it was as expected slanted toward Sarah Jennings Churchill.<br/><br/>Accounts other than Churchill's cast Sarah as a shrew. As you see in the First
Churchills, Sarah and Anne grew up together as playmates and were the most
intimate of friends since puberty. When they were apart they wrote letters and
gave each other pen names for their letters. Anne was Mrs. Morley and Sarah
was Mrs. Freeman. The Duke of Marlborough was a great military commander, but no doubt his wife's influence with first Princess Anne when
she was in line for succession and when she became Queen in 1702 the Marlboroughs were riding high.<br/><br/>The First Churchills had Margaret Tyzack as Anne who over the course of the
series grew from an eager young princess to a rather dowdy queen. Olivia
Colman's portrayal of Anne is of a woman who has nothing really left but the
throne. This woman had several pregnancies from her husband, the longest
surviving of their children who wasn't stillborn lived to be 9. Her husband a
prince from Denmark also died.<br/><br/>By the time this all takes place Anne who patiently put up with Sarah Churchill's constant begging of favors and trying to influence policy was ripe
for a new favorite. And in The Favourite Sarah herself introduces her own
downfall into Anne's court with her own cousin Abigail Hill. It was a classic
case of overplaying one's hand.<br/><br/>The three actresses who play Anne, Sarah, and Abigail dominate this film.
Olivia Colman won the film's only Oscar for Best Actress playing Queen Anne
and she is dowdy, tired, mercurial and plain tired and world weary all at once.
Quite a few people died before she who never expected to be queen was. By
all accounts she was a nice woman before being overwhelmed with the
responsibility's of the throne. There's also more than a hint of a lesbian relationship with Anne and Sarah. Getting all those emotions out and then
some is the hallmark of a great performance.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz plays Sarah who like Susan Hampshire in The First Churchills just
never knew when to quit. Emma Stone as Abigail knew exactly when to quit.
She made a good marriage to Sam Masham who became a Baron. When Anne
died, Abigail knew it was time to gracefully bow it. She lived quietly in the
countryside and died in 1734. Sarah way outlived both Anne and Abigail
dying 1748. Her saved correspondence provide a lively account of her era
written from Sarah's point of view.<br/><br/>The Favourite's only Oscar was for Olivia Colman. Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone both got Supporting Actress nominations and the film also was nominated for Best Picture and a flock of other awards.<br/><br/>I really recommend seeing this and then getting a copy of The First Churchills.
Or you might read Winston Churchill's award winning biography of the Duke
to get Sarah's side in that magnificent Churchillian prose."

","I could talk for hours on the sheer brilliance that is Olivia Colman. She is one of the strongest actors of all time, and does not get the recognition she deserves. Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are also unbelievably talented. I loved the film; I'd say it was the best picture of 2018. From reading reviews, I can see a lot of people are critiquing the ending, but I think it was really quite effective. (Bare in mind, this is simply my interpretation of the ending, it is not necessarily what Lanthimos was aiming for)<br/><br/>So in the final scenes, we see Sarah leave, and Abigail become Anne's new lover. The final shot is three superimposed clips; one of Anne, one of Abigail rubbing her legs and one of the rabbits. It's rather long and honestly quite disturbing. So, to break it down, we must look at the previous sequence. Abigail is living in luxury, attending outrageous parties and spending time with every man other than her husband. It's clear she never loved the queen; she only pretended to in order to increase her status. Queen Anne replaced her true love (Sarah) with Abigail, someone who would apparently do anything for the queen's satisfaction, without asking for anything in return. In short, the queen chose the wrong girl; Sarah gave her tough but true love while Abigail faked it the whole time.<br/><br/>Abigail succeeds in regaining her status, but as we see in the final shot, is still merely a slave to the Queen's needs and pleasures. Abigail is stuck in this role, while Anne is stuck with Abigail a woman she knows deep down does not truly love her as Sarah did.The layering of the women's faces reveals they are bound for a meaningless life of dissatisfaction and falsity. The Rabbits, a representation of Anne's 17 dead children, echo Sarah's replacement with Abigail. The rabbits unsuccessfully fill the hole created by the deaths of the children, while Abigail does the same to the hole created by Sarah's dismissal. The layering of the shots suggest Abigail is just as special to the queen as one of the rabbits and holds no real power in the palace."

Robbie Ryan .
Although Lanthimos didn't make his actors look emotionless and talk like robots but Olivia Coleman was brilliant playing the depressed Queen Anne who was a sensitive child looking for love , accompanied by what I think must be Emma Stone's best performance and a solid one from Rachel Weisz , playing the cousins who want to win her over .

"DoubleKnot","1","7","13","11 February 2019"," The Queen's New Clothes
","This is my first review on IMDB. I have often read reviews here, but have never felt inclined to write one, until now.<br/><br/>Ugly. The Favourite is a hideously, profoundly and thoroughly ugly film. Before viewing, I had done almost no research into it, and had simply heard that it was a period comedy-drama about Queen Anne. Had I clocked that it was by the guy responsible for the desperate The Killing of a Sacred Deer, I would have avoided on spec. What I experienced was a hollow, neurotic, needy film, riddled to death by self-inflicted contrivances and ill-conceived attempts at definition. The film is a postmodern (and necessarily worthless) perspective on the circumstances around the latter reign of Queen Anne, tailored to excite a modern, discerning audience most impressed by ""challenging convention"" and ""perverting norms"". On leaving the cinema, I asked my girlfriend what she thought. She defiantly said that the liked it, preempting my antagonism. However, when I asked her what there was to like about this film, she couldn't answer, eventually and essentially settling on ""It looked nice"". There really IS no accounting for taste, although I'll try to account for the rotten, unsavoury taste it left in my mouth.<br/><br/>From the pathetic (and frequent) use of the c-word, to the crutch-like and strident classical score, to the ""jarring, edgy"" cinematography, this film never fails to try hard to make itself known and convince you of its significance. I really don't know where to start. There are few films where all elements conspire so effectively to create such an unappealing experience. I am not in the least bit bothered, in principle, by ""uncomfortable"" films. I don't necessarily need to identify with, or even like, any of the characters. However, such films can have value in the meaningful treatment of a theme, the realisation of well-developed, interesting personalities, or the creation and maintenance of an atmosphere. The Favourite achieves none of these things. I can just hear in my mind's ear people praising the film for its ""exploration of the notion of (lust for) power"". Nope. It is little more than an exhibition of characters who find various ways to take advantage of or abuse one another, with no sense of meaning whatsoever (and certainly no catharsis, perish the thought!) The vacuous, tedious ending is a good example. Others may perhaps mention the performances as evidence of the film's quality, but like gifted musicians playing a dreadful song, the admittedly spirited turns by a capable cast do nothing to elevate a film which is at its core, empty, or in fact worse, a postmodern vacuum, which aims to suck in, misappropriate (and thereby corrupt) anything it can of merit, be it classical music, Jacobean architecture, or indeed the English language itself, simply by presenting these things through its jaded, fish-eye lens. Any number (no matter how big) ends up a zero when multiplied by the same. In terms of the performances, Olivia Colman seems rather complacent in her role, once again employed as a slight variation of the same haggard, bedraggled, shameless and wretched character she's become known for, and comfortable with. Emma Stone's character, the common link in the development of the films narrative, is like a meagre placeholder for a good film character, not because of her own ineptitude, but rather that of her role and its context. Nicholas Hoult's character was the only one in whom I came close to having any interest and from whom I derived any sense of enjoyment in this otherwise gynocentric, drab, deviant mess.<br/><br/>The sustained psychological and moral destitution is regularly peppered with scenes of vomiting or otherwise dirtying, which almost instantly become tedious and paltry. I of course understand that it would be anachronistic and naive to assume that the film's historical context was glamorous and hygienic, but the fixation on the filthier side of human experience (literal or figurative) is an appeal to the baser inclinations of the audience, and a sign of the creator's maladjustment and neurosis (I honestly don't see how it could be any other way). People indulge in films like The Favourite for the same reasons people enjoy Eastenders; voyeurism and schadenfreude. However, at least the latter are only surrounded by clouds of cigarette smoke, rather than of their own farts.<br/><br/>Needy. The Favourite is like an angst-ridden, yet pompous teenager with an illegitimate superiority complex parading around town with a t-shirt displaying some ""offensive"" slogan about humanity. Little does this fourteen-year-old dummy know that the only thing offensive or in the least bit noteworthy about his presence is his desperate need for a reaction. ""Notice me!"" If only this young lad were equipped mentally to see this. He is achingly self-aware, yet acutely lacking in self-awareness. But at least this teen I just invented will probably grow out of it, just as he will hopefully start eating meat again and end his obsession with Nietzsche. The female-to-female lust, together with the aforementioned coarse language (and yes, I don't care if there's a historical precedent for these words, it's still pathetic to witness) is cheaply calculated to arouse even cheaper thrills, and on several occasions I could hear the embarrassing, titillated snickers of a few middle-aged audience members. I'd love to know why they laughed! Although encouragingly, I did see some audience members exit the cinema well before the film's end; something I was sadly unable to do due to the presence of the above-mentioned girlfriend.<br/><br/>The film is heavily scored with ostentatious, lavishly-rendered classical music by composers such as Bach, Handel and Schubert. These are ironically (read: parasitically) employed to contrast the dysfunctional and uncultured behaviour of almost every character. The score is a one-liner. The film's original pieces are painfully modern, minimal, unmusical compositions aimed to underline the tension (read: neuroticism) behind whatever is going on, while also conveying the oh-so-urbane sense of own-fart-sniffing sophistication you find in so many films now (but here exquisitely rendered). At least this wasn't unprecedented; The Killing of a Sacred Deer really drove home this (oxy)moronic coupling of adolescent, needy nihilism and misplaced, methane-infused refinement. In terms of style, it seems clear to me that this film would like to think that it owes something to The Shining, but Kubrick's methods (orthogonal perspectives, Steadicam, static camera, etc) are wielded insipidly and in bad faith in this film. Simply employing these methods is not enough; success is heavily dependant on the motivation and vision of the director, so the result is consequently ugly, no matter how high the definition, how wide the shots, or how ""sumptuous"" the aesthetic.<br/><br/>While I am by now well-aware that modern films often have as their goals the maligning of tradition, the erosion of morality and the exhibition and promotion of nihilism, what is especially awful about The Favourite is that it aims to define itself in these terms, while presuming to bear the standard of ""high cinema"". This film wants to have its cake and eat it. It digests itself as it progresses, dragging itself through the gutter while simultaneously pointing to the sky. Oh, the irony! Oh, the profound, revealing paradox! As is so often the case with the most revered luminaries of ""high-culture"" (Banksy springs immediately to mind), there is not shortage of aye-sayers offering validation, collectively acknowledging and marvelling at the spectacular new vestments they think they can see clothing the Emperor's flabby, dirty, unhealthy (or at the very least, unremarkable) body.<br/><br/>The Least Favourite."

","The Favourite takes place in the 18th century England, a time period film that I usually check out of about ten minutes in. However this movie was captivating and surprisingly funny by some of its absurdities and witty dialogue. Olivia Colman plays a sickly Queen Anne with her Lady in waiting Sarah seemingly running the government from behind the scenes. Enter in Emma Stone's Abigail - Sarah's down on her luck cousin who Queen Anne takes a shine to and you have a power struggle that can affect the future of the country.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you have yet to see the film, I would stop reading here because I am about to get into some major spoilers. I planned on making a spoiler-free review but there is too much to unpack. The film sets the tone from the start with a man masturbating to Abigail on a stage coach; revealing this isn't going to be your typical run of the mill royalty film. Then the shocking twist that Queen Anne and Sarah are in a sexual relationship with one another is revealed, throwing the entire plot on upside down. I have to applaud whoever put the trailer together, because they put in enough to intrigue you, but left out that one major detail.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This film reminded me of BlacKkKlansman as in I was surprised by how humorous it turned out to be. The ballroom dance scene is brilliant and I feel is the core of the absurdity this film portrays. Sarah and Masham dance in a way that would make you think they were time travelers; sporting moves that were way ahead of their time with their b-boy moves. With the physical humour aside, the films dialogue is sharp. An example of this is when Masham meets Abigail in the middle of the night in attempt to court her:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Abigail: ""Are you here to seduce me or rape me?""<br/><br/>Masham: ""I am a gentleman.""<br/><br/>Abigail: ""Rape it is.""<br/><br/><br/><br/>Everyone involved in this film had a tremendous performance. Emma Stone was able to make us empathize with her, only to despise her by the end; Rachel Weisz able to seemingly do the same, but vice versa, with Olivia Colman portraying the vulnerable and lonely Queen Anne with compassion. This is a film that leaves you unsure who to root for because both characters are just as vile and manipulative as the other; created by the outstanding chemistry between Stone and Weisz whose characters are willing to bend and break their own morality for the slightest glimmer of power. Showing the battle within the Queen's chambers is just as important to the country as the battle miles away with the French. I'd also like to give quick props to Nicholas Hoult who under all of that makeup forced me to look up on IMDB to make sure that was who it was; he makes up the majority of the humour within this film and absolutely nailed the role.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I wanted to discuss the ending momentarily and my interpretation of it, because director Yorgos Lanthimos is apparently known for his ambiguous endings and this film is no different. The final moments we see Abigail seemingly victorious on her knees as Queen Anne presses down on her head for balance; regret depicted on her face as the screen is overlapped with her rabbits. I believe this is reminder that Queen Anne got these rabbits in attempt to fill the void of her seventeen unborn/dead children. They'll never be able to replace the real thing; in which Abigail is nothing more than another one of her rabbits. A cheap imitation of the woman she truly loved and cared about Sarah. Sure, Abigail filled her lonely void at the time, but banishing Sarah was like losing a piece of her as shown by her struggling to run the government in her absence and now she is forced to live with the consequences of her decision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I was planning on giving this film a lower rating because after watching it, I wasn't overwhelmingly enthralled by it. However the more I thought about it, the more I liked it; it was a slow burn for me. I found myself thinking about this film the next morning; small little details that had only come back to me after reflection. This movie can be picked analyzed and picked apart in many different ways and that is the best thing about it; no answer is wrong because it is all a matter of interpretation by the viewer. I believe this film was a top notch for the fact it was funny, intense and was in a genre that usually doesn't intrigue me, but still found myself hanging on to every word and action. The Favourite may not be my favourite of the year, but it is well worth the watch - yeah I did the stupid pun."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","7","13","7 January 2019"," It wasn't my favourite.
","'The Favourite (2018)' certainly feels far longer than it is, thanks to - I feel - its 'chapter'-based and slightly episodic structure. It's never exactly repetitive - nor, indeed, boring - but it does settle into a strange, laid-back pacing that paints many of its, essentially, single-location events with what is ostensibly the same dry brush. While there is, of course, more to the piece than its aspects of black comedy, I do feel that your mileage will vary depending on how funny you find it. It functions far more as a comedy than as anything else (a period drama is the next closest thing, I suppose) and, for me, it just wasn't funny enough for that to be its sole function - or, rather, for it to be all that successful at it. There are chuckles here and there, don't get me wrong. It's not devoid of merit in other areas, either. Lanthimos' direction is prevalent, including his typically dead-pan panning, and the period design - from the sets to the costumes - all looks fantastic. The only issue I have with the film's look is the occasional distracting use of fish-eye lenses, which don't fit with its overall aesthetic. I guess the most noteworthy thing about the affair is the acting - it's certainly drawing awards attention. It is strong across the board, with the absolute stand-out being Olivia Coleman with her portrayal of 'Queen Anne'. Her character is easily the most interesting aspect of the narrative; she's unpredictable, child-like, physically-impaired and there's a real sadness to her, too. Coleman, of course, pulls it all off impeccably, being intimidating and insecure all at once. The other lead characters are portrayed well but, in terms of development or general intrigue, pale in comparison to the Queen. The flick is a strange one. It's not exactly compelling but it isn't disengaging, either. It is generally entertaining, too. It does feel very long, though, and, even if the ending nicely ties its themes together, seems as though it should have ended a full 'chapter' earlier (at least, that's how I felt as I was watching it). Like I said before, I think your enjoyment will depend entirely on how funny you find it. That's completely subjective. In the end, while I usually enjoyed it, it wasn't my favourite. 6/10"

","No other period pieces come to mind when trying to find a comparison for 'The Favourite,' and even if there were, none would hold a candle to this 18th century tale of social scheming and palace politics.<br/><br/>Director Yorgos Lanthimos previously caught the attention (and admiration) of art house audiences with 2015's 'The Lobster,' followed by last year's 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer.' However this film is different, and it will justifiably earn Lanthimos a spot at the table reserved for Hollywood's elite directors.<br/><br/>The cast is outright brilliant. Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone, and Nicholas Hoult each deserve their own paragraph of praise. However, it is Colman who ultimately takes the cake for her performance (pun intended!).

","Yorgos Lanthimos, who is responsible for some of the absurdist films such as Dogtooth and The Lobster, makes a tour-de-force and magnificently crafted direction with his renegade deviltry filmmaking that makes it as a wickedly brilliant and profound movie that blends well with historical period drama with comedy.<br/><br/>Much of the stellar yet gorgeous imagery and style of The Favourite can be attested to Robbie Ryan's brilliant cinematography, the grandiose production design, and Sandy Powell's surreal, meticulous and historically accurate costumes as well the detailed make-up and including a grand collection of classical music. But what truly summed up as the film's beating crowning jewel is an intricate story that features female empowerment with witty sensibilities and a compelling combination of LGBT themes and the accurate depiction of political power.<br/><br/>From the get-go, The Favourite truly shines in its profound glory with the three crowning jewels featured through the powerful and magnificent performance of Olivia Colman as Queen Anne, whose serves as the film's beating heart and are further boosted by the exceptional and charismatic performances of Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, who makes the most of the glorious scenes that they've commit within the movie with witty style and eccentricities in an excellent way. Nicholas Hoult's performance is nothing short but wickedly hilarious and fascinating.<br/><br/>The Favourite makes a clear point of not just showing itself as a period drama with costumes as the centerpiece but makes a compelling yet fascinating story that take centerstage and display a range of elements from drama, comedy, and a biography, which blends well perfectly.

"mannin11","Null","6","11","9 January 2019"," Godawful direction saved by superb performances
","The first thing that strikes one once the story begins is how ""peculiar"" the direction is. Like a film student just out of college who needs to learn that tricks. fish eye lenses, weird camera angles and fancy flourishes are totally unnecessary and merely distract from telling the story. This viewer's reaction was that the director needs to go back to film school to learn how to direct. The second thing that becomes blatantly obvious is that the director is neither American or British (without actually knowing that he is Greek). The directing style is simply odd and leaves one wondering how much better this movie could have been with a more traditional storyteller. Obviously such an off the wall director is instantly embraced as a critic's darling, which kicks the mass audience's appreciation to the curb. What saves this movie is the superb performances from the three supremely talented actresses, all at the top of their form. A lurid script, needlessly peppered with the most graphic four letter words, is saved by the fascinating story and the onscreen battle between all three actresses. Olivia Colman gives an Oscar worthy performance and it would be hard to choose between Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz for best supporting actress. All in all this is an enthralling story that really kicks into action in the third act, when the director stops directing and just allows the actresses to do their work. No question this movie will be nominated for a bunch of Oscars but the tiresome distraction of the director who needs to stop drawing attention to his peculiar style (look at me, look at me, I'm the star of this movie!) would be the least deserved. No question it's going to happen as the critics love him. Oh well, at least we have the fine performances of three wonderful leading ladies."

","The cinematography and acting in The Favourite were not its downfall. It was the story itself that made me want to walk out of the movie almost forty minutes early.<br/><br/>I take this movie as a parody of historic period films. Everything is purposefully over the top and criticizes the ridiculous and self-indulgent ways of royal families in Europe. Since the majority of the movie takes place within Queen Anne's castle, the viewer feels claustrophobic and ill at ease from the setting alone. Queen Anne's palace is beautiful, but just as strange and unwelcoming as she is. I liked how the director created an immerse atmosphere through the scenery, although costumes were not realistic for the time era.<br/><br/>However, the plot completely bored me and I was relieved when the credits rolled. 45 minutes in, the movie became horribly formulaic: Queen Anne will have an attack of gout, one of the two lead actresses will sneak into her room, tend to her legs and then have sex with her to score brownie points. At LEAST thirty minutes or more of the film could have been cut.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult was my lifeline in the film, since his portrayal of a b#tchy nobleman was completely spot-on and offered some relief from the snoozefest lesbian love triangle. This could have been such an interesting story, but I was totally put off by the odd pacing, scenes of Queen Anne eating and vomiting and then...eating some more, with no real explanation as to explain why the Queen is an absolute nutter, and a mind numbing ending that tried so hard to emulate an art flick that it was almost painful to watch. I have a feeling the director had no idea how to end the story, so he settled on something abstract to leave it up to the viewers' imagination: or, the easy way out.<br/><br/>The most interesting character in the entire movie is Queen Anne, but it felt like she was a plot device for Emma Stone to get her way rather than a fully fleshed out character."
"TheVictoriousV","10","9","19","28 January 2019"," Lanthimos is too good for Hollywood
","I'm glad people are finally seeing the appeal of Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos. His The Lobster only got a Best Screenplay nomination in 2017, Dogtooth was loved by some, and The Killing of a Sacred Deer went relatively unnoticed. Now we have The Favourite, a ""deliciously nasty satire"" with more Oscar nominations than I could ever expect of a film of such distinct vision.<br/><br/>Its characters bizarre and/or pitiful like only Lanthimos knows how and its comedy delightfully cruel, The Favourite also excels at production design, costuming, and photography. Lanthimos' presentation and keen eye for detail have been likened to the works of Stanley Kubrick and this is his Barry Lyndon, not only in terms of its authentic appearance.<br/><br/>In the year 1708, Queen Anne of Britain (Olivia Colman) is an absolute wreck, clearly unable to deal with the responsibilities of queenhood. At her side, and running the country whilst she is busy watching duck races and feasting, is Duchess Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), also secretly the queen's lover. Sarah's down-on-her-luck cousin Abigail (Emma Stone, who has been called ""menacing"" in the role) arrives to work as a maid in Anne's court, eventually getting closer, much closer, to the queen and thus her lost nobility. Who shall be the queen's favourite?<br/><br/>As you'd imagine, the relationship between these three women is what fuels the film; there is as much love and sexuality going on as there is concentrated hate and jealousy. But Lanthimos has skillfully directed the supporting cast as well, including a beautifully foppish Nicholas Hoult as the scheming 1st Earl of Oxford. There are also bunnies, and lots of them.<br/><br/>The acting is nonetheless spectacular. I know not why Weisz and Stone are considered Actresses in Supporting Roles (one of these days I need to get my hands on the Academy's rule sheet), as they seem at least as important and brilliant as Olivia Colman, but at least one win is certain. Also recognized is the screenplay (though my vote for this category may ultimately go to First Reformed), and Lanthimos winning Best Director could happen if Cuarón gets unlucky this time.<br/><br/>And of course, it wouldn't be a just world (not that we necessarily live in such a place) if The Favourite wasn't also nominated for its striking camera work (by Robbie Ryan), convincing costumes, and authentic production design. Almost every shot in The Favourite resembles a painting from the century the film depicts. Like the costumes and sets of the aforementioned Barry Lyndon, everything feels lived-in and never comes off as fake.<br/><br/>Much of this is thanks to costume designer Sandy Powell (previously nominated for Carol and Hugo) and production designers Fiona Crombie and Alice Felton. But as others have observed, this may also be Lanthimos' most accessible and relatable film to date, heavy on timeless anxieties and emotions to which many a viewer can connect, though perhaps particularly women. It isn't as quirkily robotic as his previous movies, but his eccentric nature thankfully remains intact in some way.<br/><br/>Really, The Favourite has just about everything (I didn't even mention the classical, often wonderfully disturbing music). I'm just so glad Yorgos Lanthimos exists, okay? Even if he's too good for Hollywood."

To say The Favourite will be like anything you've ever seen, is a direct and misleading understatement, much like the characters it presents.<br/><br/>Written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, The Favourite marks the first film Lathimos has not written a script he has directed since making his big splash at Cannes in 2009 with his highly unconventional and controversial film Dogtooth. Yet, as much as we appreciate the auteur's uncanny ability of making people feel uncomfortable using the eeriness and awkwardness of other people by simply interacting with one another, this is one script that feels more Lathimos than any of the ones he has written in the past.<br/><br/>While the film is made during a prominent and very loud #MeToo movement in Hollywood, The Favourite is set in 18th Century England, a land where Queens rule and Kings drool, especially when the Queen is Mrs. Morley Anne (Olivia Colman) ruler of Scotland, Ireland and England and currently waging war against France. While the Queen is surrounded by men, including her military commanders and parliamentary leaders, Queen Anne proves that at the end of the day, the women make the rules and own the house. Yet, as important and iconic Queen Anne is, it becomes clear quickly that Anne is no more of a mere mortal with a crown next to her life-long friend and council advisor, The Duchess of Marlborough, Sarah Churchill (Rachael Weisz). While Sarah is able to wholly intimidate, scoff and insult the Queen right to her face, it seem that Sarah is only looking out for one person and one person only, despite her illusions and deceit. Occasionally giving accord to Queen Anne or her husband for that matter, military commander of the Queen's army, Lord Marlborough (Mark Gatniss), Sarah is one a one-way ticket to riches, power and most importantly her, affection.<br/><br/>As Sarah seems to seemingly pave a path of success for years to come, things come to a steady halt with the arrival of her cousin, Abigail (Emma Stone). Although Abagail arrives in a heap of mud, discontent and stalked by tragedy, she quickly hardens up and wilts to the whim of her commanding cousin, only to quickly gain her affection and take her opportunity for the Queen's admiration, following a natural herbal remedy for the Queen's disgusting gout infested legs. Once Abigail becomes the Queen's own personal leg-rubber, she begins plotting her dominance over the Queen and her affections, overshadowing her own cousin, proving that Sarah's protegé as quickly become her biggest and most intimidating rival.<br/><br/>Where Sarah adorns the Queen with her brazen honesty and harsh truths, including advising when the queen looks like a badger, Abigail's approach to the affections of the Queen include lies, deceit and endless compliments, making the Queen feel unlike anything Sarah never has. Often times eroticizing the Queen and her mundane and bizarre daily routines with her bunnies and while eating, Abigail and Sarah begin to duel for Anne's love, doing whatever it takes to be her favourite.<br/><br/>As it turns out, each woman is capable of much unpleasantness, not only to one another, themselves but also to the poor saps surrounding them. Manipulating every man, woman and child around them for their own personal gains; both in search of security, status and nobility, Abigail and Sarah turn the conventions of a chessboard on its head, and make the queens, rooks, bishops and knights all of their pawns in their sick and twisted little kinky game of pleasure.<br/><br/>Attacking one another like vipers and wolves, jealousy becomes the weapon of choice for both women, who's use of men only intensifies their sadistic little game of mitral destruction and decay. Taking no prisoners, Abigail and Sarah create alliances, forms admirable teams with many of the men occupying the palace on a daily basis. Abigail learns quickly that her most valuable alliance is the head of parliamentary opposition Harley (Nicholas Hoult), despite his every opportunity to throw Abigail to the gutter. Although many of the men in The Favourite seem to hold their own against the two duelling cousins, it becomes clear with every ridiculous pastime that the men engage in, that the women, no matter how fragile or understated they are, truly hold the men in the palm of their hands. Where we see the men engaging in ludicrous activities of whipping food at each other while naked, duck races and ridiculous forms of dance, women are the only ones seen holding the guns, aiming and killing their prey and having their faces splattered with blood. The men in The Favourite are covered in make-up, wigs and fancy dress, while the women are stripped of their beauty and shown with the scars, bloody noses and battle wounds. Lathimos makes the gun range backyard the common area for Abigail and Sarah's verbal competitions, while the rest of the days, they leave their most valiant and best efforts on the line by exhausting the very people they claim to love.<br/><br/>While the war against the French is always a constant plot within the castle, Lathimos and his talent crew uses the palace as a stomping ground for much haste and ugliness, never showcases physical battle rather the coyness and sneaky actions of each woman's slithering jabs. The trickery of each woman's constant blows are embellished in absolute pleasure thanks to the captivating fish-eye lens tracking shots of Robbie Ryan's camera. Shooting tracking shots from an ant's eye view, upside down, tilting and swinging the camera in every which way and direction, Ryan gives a sense of banishment and fleeting optics to a completely farce security in a castle where allegiance switch at the drop of a pin.<br/><br/>The Favourite may very well be a perfect film and one of the most unexpected pleasures of 2018, but none of that would ring true if it wasn't for the performances of our three female leads. Constantly engaging in the moral destruction of one another's characteristics and pushing the limits physically, mentally and most of all, emotionally, our three leading ladies are at the top of their acting games, proving that the Academy may be in favour of royalty. Weisz is as cunning, sharp and ruthless as can be as a woman who utilizes history as a weapon towards establishing a future. Looking as sly as ever, Weisz is bound to be recognized for her performance that transform her soft eyes into sharp diamonds with razor-sharp edges. Stone, although she isn't singing or dancing, gives the best performance of her career, stripping down her clothing and girl-next door image for a woman capable of anything; including beating herself with a book and bloodying the battlefield of war. Stone's highly misunderstood pouted lips conceal her snake-like tongue and vicious bite. Yet, both women pale in comparison to Colman, an actress who has probably appeared in something you've watched before, but completely and unapologetically demands attention with Queen Anne's constant eccentricities. Whether dunked in mud, on the floor, covered in absurd make-up or having food hang from the very ends of her mouth, Colman gives a favourable performances that will no doubt take attention during the Awards Season and give new meaning the bondages of portraying a matriarchal Queen. Colman is nothing short of godly.<br/><br/>Self-interest and selfishness is the goal and while casualties are expected, Yorgos Lathimos delivers one of the best movies of 2018. The Favourite favours bold acting, incomparable shooting styles, a magnificent score and one of the most unexpected and gruellingly enjoyable movie experiences of the year, and it asks for no apologies. One may be hard pressed to find something else within the year and may side with The Favourite, because Lathimos proves once again that the deconstruction of human values, is much more fun than building it up. Even though parents always avoid picking their favourites, when it comes to 2018, it'll be hard to choose a monstrous extravagance as good as this one."

","Yorgos has really outdone himself with this one. While watchers could hint that he had a special directors charisma, he leaves his own stamp in his movies. With the Lobster being one of the weirdest movies to date, I knew that this director had something in him. His unusual viewing angles could baffle some watchers and take some aesthetic away from the movie but that's not my case. The akwardly long close-ups bring more tension and confusion which leaves the watcher thinking. This movie is definitely not for everyone, but I think it's a setting stone for upcoming comedies and absurd movies to come"

"jackgdemoss","10","7","14","21 February 2019"," The most masterfully created standalone film in 2018
","Where do I even begin. There is not a single aspect of cinema that this film did not tackle well. I was drawn into the world quickly and powerfully. The characters were potent, ambitious, and relatable. The themes were clear and intriguing. The cinematography and costume design were second to none. The performances by Emma Stone and Olivia Colman were stunning. This film was damn near perfect. From a film appreciation stand point, I would even argue that it may be the best I have ever seen. The reason that I am not giving it a perfect score is because it didn't quite scratch that ever-present itch I have for plot twists and betrayal in cinema.<br/><br/>The Favourite is a story about manipulation, perseverance, elder abuse, and gaming the system. I highly recommend everyone see it."
"glendariley","1","7","14","13 February 2019"," Waste of Time/waste of money
","I originally anticipated this movie to be hilarious, a must see. I am completely disappointed, disturbed to a degree, and found this movie to be complete nonsense and vulgar and a waste of time......not to mention the pounding headache brought on from the soundtrack. No wonder it didn't play in many theaters in the USA. Now I am the unproud owner of a crappy movie that I will never want to watch again."
"cempa70","1","7","14","25 January 2019"," Pretentious crap
","I read a lot of ""professional"" reviews where they all were over the top positive about this movie. Now after watching it I really don't get the positivity about it. At all. Pretentious, bizarre and just outright vulgar without leading to anything meaningful and of any substance. The actors are all doing a fine job. I can't really blame them. It's the ridiculous and overly pretentious story and dialogue that ruined it for me. I really can't recommend this movie to anyone. Save your money."
"xmdbx","6","7","14","21 December 2018"," It's just not weird enough
","There are two things you expect when going to see a Yorgos Lanthimos film. One: that it will be visually appealing and two: that it will be strange to the point of absurdity. This film meets the first expectation with flying colors. It is without a doubt his best looking project to date but it falls short in terms of the second. It is almost a normal movie and that is not necessarily a bad thing, it was just unexpected. The problem comes from the story itself. The events that the film is based on are fascinating and the film does them justice but there is only so far you can take this story without completely betraying the history. Now, this is only conjecture but it's possible the increased budget came with the goal of making a film that appealed to a wider audience (the director's other films certainly not being for everyone). Anyway, it is not a bad film but it certainly leaves me with something to be desired."
"elizrug","9","5","9","15 February 2019"," Thoroughly enjoyable
","From reading the negative reviews I understand that this was way over most peoples' heads. What strikes me is blaming a film for being labeled by others as a comedy. If you are going to be scandalised by a movie, wait until you read the reviews before seeing it. If not, go with no expectations.<br/><br/>The ending didn't make sense to many people. It made sense to me.<br/><br/>She fought to escape the life of hardship and sexual slavery her father sold her into, yet, after everything, she ended up a sexual slave, just dressed better.<br/><br/>How hard was that for people to understand?"
"grchic-06036","10","5","9","5 February 2019"," Amazing!!!! BUT it's not for everyone
","There's a reason this movie has received a lot of 10 star ratings and a lot of 1's. Because it's a shocking movie and it's not for everyone. But I absolutely loved the shock value and crude humor. The actors are talented, the music is perfect and adds to the character of the movie. The plot is straightforward. There was a lot of ""oh, ah, ew, geez"" coming from the mouths of the other movie goers. If you are expecting a simple nice gentle movie about a queen then you will not like this movie. If you are very open minded about crude humor and sexual content then this movie is definitely worth every penny!!!"
"muamba_eats_toast","7","5","9","3 January 2019"," Good but overated
","The film was enjoyable it had its funny moments and the main trio were all superb but going in knowing this was an oscar favourite it all felt a little underwhelming especially in comparison to others like green book, a star is born and colette all seen recently. The film was dragging by the end and felt around half hour to long with the most basic of plots. Overall it is enjoyable but certainly nothing groundbreaking in my eyes but each to their own."
"sinapisme","10","5","9","31 December 2018"," Totally absorbing
","Well researched historical fact, skillfully enhanced with fiction when necessary timewise to emphasise the development of attitudes and relationships, and the odd surreal sequence, make a fascinating blend that provided me with two hours rapt enjoyment. Not only is the acting faultless but the decor and costumes facilitated my travel to a time when the European Royal Courts were claustrophobic capsules of opulence idleness and decadence. We are only thirty years or so on from the Restoration and the Court of the Merry Monarch Charles II. Morals were lax, language was sexually explicit, encouraged and practiced by the King himself. The young bucks of that era were now in late middle age - the types of weird practices portrayed in the film were common.at Anne's Court.<br/><br/>Lanthimos is clearly in love with his characters. His cameras dwell long moments in close up on their motionless faces. A free spirit, he will leap out of period to provoke extreme emotional response. Without giving anything away, we have hip hop/dirty dancing to provoke jealousy, unarmed combat skills to illustrate dominance in courtship. These surreal sequences are hilarious..<br/><br/>I cannot speak too highly of the performances of the three main characters. Olivia Colman as the Queen handles the complex character and sudden changes of mood as totally believable - imperious without ever losing the air of vulnerability and fear of isolation. Rachel Weisz as Sarah is impressively dominant, hugely self confident until everything suddenly changes for her - beautifully handled. Emma Stone is quite ravishing as Abigail - I stood by her even at her most dastardly! The lesbian activity? It certainly heightens the tension and there is historical documentation that there were suspicions voiced that both affairs actually took place..<br/><br/>I have rarely felt so sorry to see the titles rolling after two fleeting hours, not because the end was not clear - the message was there for all to see - but because I just wanted this film to go on and on..."
"greydrawer","2","12","28","25 December 2018"," SO BORING. Nice work to the marketing team. The trailer was enjoyable.
","I do NOT understand the praise for this film. AT ALL. Unoriginal. Stolen from an old French play. The characters were all petty and incredibly selfish. The score was so intrusive and annoying. Even the fonts and center justification was off putting and annoying. Great costumes. Love a good period piece, but this seemed far too much like a cable hipster interpretation of history. I appreciate all the girl power, just sad it was executed so poorly. Silly visual posturing."
"jadepietro","8","16","40","17 December 2018"," A Trio of Great Performances Overcome the Flaws
","GRADE: B<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A good, not great, period drama due to the director's excessive style.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: I must admit that filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos has never been one of my favorite directors. While his films have a visually acuity that is distinctively his own, they lack strong storytelling. His initial premise is always intriguing, but his over-intellectualizing, convoluted plotting, and third act ambiguous endings never satisfy. (The Lobster (2016) told a story of two people forced to find love in a dystopian sci-fi world or they would shape-shift into an animal. The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017) is a film where a father must decide which of his family members he must kill in order to save the others from otherworldly forces.) His trademark use of off-kilter camera angles, music scores that resemble sound installations, and remote characters caught in dire situations are all present in his latest endeavor too. The Favourite is another example that less would have been more.<br/><br/>Yet, this film has become a critical darling and is garnering many accolades. (Even this reviewer's expectations were high, though inaccurate due to a movie trailer that stressed the farcical aspects of the film and portrayed the movie as a comedy...It is not.) But it is an improvement on the director's resume of arty films and at least he is going in a more positive direction by reining in some (not all) of his excessive touches. (Actually, the film would have been quite successful had it been directed as a farce allowing it to be humorous in spirit and cattier in tone. That would have been a far more entertaining moviegoing experience.)<br/><br/>The story goes like this: Lady Abigail (Emma Stone, very good in the role) wants her place in aristocracy. New to the royal court, she is a cunning ambitious wannabe who craves fame, fortune, and, most importantly, power. Her arch rival is a woman just as cruel and demanding, her cousin, Lady Sarah Churchill (a winning Rachel Weisz) who is firmly entrenched in all the decision-making in the House of Stuart. These ladies-in-waitings scheme and battle to gain control of the court. They rely on the manipulation and oneupmanship of a very unstable Queen Anne (a magnificent Olivia Colman), whose physical health and mental issues cloud her judgement.<br/><br/>While the film is flawed, it does have a trio of wonderful performances which enhance the film greatly. The political and sexual intrigue may be the crux of the film but it is these actresses that punch up the drama. They create memorable characters as they deliver their lines with verve and delicious venom. Particularly moving is Ms. Colman who takes this mad queen into areas of unexpected pathos and vulnerability, from a screaming harpy to a tragic solitary figure with all of her mercurial mood swings.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara has pithy one-liners and depicts a court on the brink of disarray and corruption. Although I was always involved by the plot and its rich characters, the film allows the intricate hierarchy of the palace household and their quirky and strange behaviors to unfold, albeit too slow-paced for my taste.<br/><br/>Mr. Lanthimos stages his drawing-room set pieces with much skill, filling the screen with gorgeous costuming from Sandy Powell and a stunning production design achieved by Fiona Crombie. Still the director relies on too much theatrics with the overuse of anachronistic fisheye photography and an annoying modern-sounding score with snippets of loud classical music that interferes with all the sumptuous period atmosphere. These overindulgences become a major misstep in a film that held great promise...and again, there is that third act denouncement faux pas once more that undercuts the storytelling.<br/><br/>The Favourite plays like a comedy of ill manners without much comedy. Yet it is technically accomplished filmmaking with much to admire. It also boasts some of the best acting this year. Yet with all of this talent, the film is still in search of a story better told."

","Apart from the costumes , a waste of time .. I m still wondering which was the purpose of the movie , no plot , no story ."
"ayoreinf","8","8","17","11 February 2019"," Theatrical in the most cinematic way
","This historical so called ""comedy drama"", which I consider a non term (at best I'd call it a drama with comic moments, but I actually consider this a historical satire about the politics and machinations of the British court). I don't care how exact are the historical details, I did check, and the basic historical drama depicted here did take place, and for me that's the only importent question - historically.<br/><br/>Cinematically we get a story presented in a very theatrical style, pointing to the theatrics of politics, and of royal politics. But this theater is a very cinematic theater, we get a very nuanced performance of the three leads, nuances that would often be lost on the stage of theater. And we do get three leading roles here. All three are superb, and the fact that Olivia Colman is written down as the lead is arbitrary in my book. She might have a little more screen time than the other two, (one would have to check it with a stop watch to be certain), but plot wise, both Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, are her equals, and Olivia Colman herself has acknowledged it more than once. And as I said , they're all amazing. And actually, this trio makes the movie. I mean, every aspect of movie making is done here at the highest level: cinematography, editing, soundtrack, lighting, - it's all here, but without this trio none of it would matter, they make this story come to life, and they make us care.<br/><br/>One final point, I rated this movie 8 (bordering on 9), it could have been higher, if the point it was making was a bit less subtle. I feel that the final scene did make a point, but it was only half made, almost muted. And in my humble opinion it should have been a bit more forceful. Maybe thats the British understated way, but the rest of the story was fairly blunt, with the acting cast, and most of all the leading trio keeping it British. So I think, such a blunt story demands less subtlety at the finish line."

","The year closes with this excellent gift from Yorgos Lanthimos. He executed flawlessly a whip smart script from Tony McNamara & Deborah Davis.<br/><br/>This costume drama/comedy focuses on the power games of the Lady Sarah and her penniless cousin Abigail. Former lady Abigail vies to further herself and become ""the favourite"" of Queen Anne, played to great effect by Olivia Colman.<br/><br/>There is a beautiful social critique contained in the film. It asks us why we cannot accept others for who they are if they have different preferences than us. Social mobility is touched on in the character of Abigail. Examined are questions are how much further really we've come from this time period and if we're as advanced as we think we are. The absurdity of the limits of supposedly absolute power by a queen is a really funny subtext here.<br/><br/>Ultimately the elements making this the best Lanthimos film and a shoe in come awards season are the phenomenal cast, direction, and the many questions left to ponder."

","This movie was outstanding! It was so beautifully written, it made me want to stay at the theater and see the next show...so I did. It's such as shame that both Wiess and Stone are supporting characters, because they both deserve Academy-Awards for their dark, and twisted characters. As for Coleman, she made this movie. She was absolutely convincing as an ill queen with an unusual backstory.<br/><br/>Now the screenplay was brilliant. The way that every character used each other in some way was marvelously written and everything flowed together and made sense. Characters who seemed flawless eventually crumbled, and the ones who seemed weak turned out to be disastrously strong. It was as if every character was playing chess with another one. They would all try to be 3 moves ahead of the other until their opponent has to forfeit. I was skeptical about it being billed as a comedy, but it made me laugh so many times. 10/10 would recommend.

If you are the sort of person who wants a film like most others , then in the first place you shouldn't be watching a Lanthimos picture. On the other hand if you are the sort who can appreciate or even enjoy something that most people don't feel at ease with then I think you ll like this one a lot. I personally was in awe by almost every scene and kept saying secretly ""bravo "" to Lanthimos. The Favourite is my favorite of his films. The story as a story isn't even that weird it's pretty basic , just two women fighting against each other for power and statusbut what makes it weird is the little things the director chose to include ,chose to film for our pleasure. Some of you will like what he chose to film , most of you won't. It is made intentionally that way I guess. An artist can't compromise. It is what it is."
"phd_travel","4","6","12","31 January 2019"," Off putting bunch but people like that are around today
","This modern take on the favourite ladies of Queen Anne is a part of history not often shown and this movie is partly fictionalised. I guess they didn't want to do a BBC type movie so they added lots of profanity some nudity and modern dialog. Sometimes it makes things lively but often it was jarring just like the classical music mixed with some droning rubbish sounds. The theme of favourites jousting for the affections of the queen is oddly still relevant - there are actually people I known who behave like this today.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is a little out of place in her look. Emma actually looks less out of place. Olivia acts sick quite well but it's not a best actress worthy performance. Nicholas Hoult is quite appropriate.<br/><br/>The on location filming in Hatfield House is atmospheric.<br/><br/>Ok for one watch."

","Lanthimos film surprises on several levels: it provides a brilliant parable about degeneration and abuse of power in social, political and sexual terms, a study of decadence in many dependencies, spiced up with many satirical moments. Visually he delivers overwhelming artwork based on fantastic camera work and opulent set design.
And third, it's a blast to watch the splendid trio of actresses at work. Coleman, Weisz and Stone are absolutely outstanding.
You leave the cinema with the idea that nowadays we're actually not far from the world we've just seen on the screen. A masterpiece!"
"eagandersongil","9","6","12","29 January 2019"," The less authorial Yorgos film delights in its technical and artistic quality.
","""A Favorite"" Director Yorgos Lathinos' new film is his least authorial feature, we missed some of the tense script with numb logic and theatrical performances but we gained something more mature and focused without losing his classic soundtrack and sublime camera use. And that just proves that Yorgos is a great director, because even though he's fleeing from his comfort zone, ""A Favorite"" impresses with technical and artistic issues and consolidates as one of the best films of 2018, in my opinion.
""The Favorite"" succeeds in being an uncompromising empowerment film, from non-boring romance to non-monotonous thriller and non-boring comedy, a blend of genres scripted by Deborah Dean and Tony McNamara that works perfectly in the hands of the talented Greek director. We do not have a high moral or a great dilemma, we have only the history of two women surrounding the Queen of England for power or comfort.
The two women in question are played by Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz and Queen Olivia Colman and James Smith form one of the best performance quartets I have ever seen in a movie. Emma Stone, after winning the Oscar is light and loose, and shows all her artistic ability interpreting multiple facets and feelings making a captivating and disguised character, Rachel Weisz makes a character mature, cold, her performance scares and impresses by the intrinsic violence, and calls more attention if we pull the story of Rachel with characters who are usually ""Bobinhos"". Olivia Colman plays the most broken character in all, a woman with social and health problems, with a great power in her hand but clumsy intelligence, an exquisite performance that requires an artistic and physical delivery, and lastly, James Smith, the most discreet of all, but his character is fundamental to architect the plots between the trio, in addition to a convincing, funny and cunning performance.
Yorgos uses his cameras, he likes, many against plongee, fish eyes, medium and closed planes, with lots of natural light and a composition of simply perfect scene, added to a great costum, hair and makeup we have a direction of art that borders perfection and very similar to the perfect art direction of ""Barry Lyndon"", but that reinforcement, is still better thanks to the director's frameworks. Something that remains of Yorgos's classic signature is its incidental soundtrack that matches the film.
The division of the film into mini chapters is not a good choice, it makes the rhythm of the long regret a lot, it is like extending the two hours, and that in the practical sense, it makes no difference, since the acts of the film are well defined. ""A Favorita"" is a great film, with the very technical and artistic aspect that puts Yorgos Lanthimos in the big showcase of Hollywood."
"miner-23176","9","6","12","27 January 2019"," beautiful, dirty and powerful.
","Lanthimos proved that there is always a fresh way to approach direction. The film consists of a great rythm which follows perfectly the tention of the characters. I enjoyed the film from the first to the last second due to the unique use of timing. Slow parts follow the quicker ones and the opposite so succesfully. Great photography, great costumes and music. The addition of so many clever details gives to the plot not only the colour and the realism of that times but also helps the three actresses to achieve exceptional levels of acting. I believe that this movie takes the whole perspective of cinematography a bit further in all of its aspects. Clearly a masterpiece."
"CubsandCulture","10","6","12","18 January 2019"," Yesteryear was just as messed up
","Even through I ended up really enjoying this film I was a little bit disappointed in it. It isn't quite as bold as I was expecting. It is more intellectualized than I was expecting as well. It remind me more of All About Eve than Tom Jones, and I was expecting the latter. Nonetheless, the film is extremely entertaining. It is a funny combination of palace intrigue, social satire and genre deconstruction. It is certainly the most vulgar costume drama I have seen and it really drives home the point that the past was just as ugly as today. Queen Anne somewhat does remind you of a Trumpian figure with her vanity, self-delusion and preening need for attention. Colman really is a force in this film and she makes Queen Anne tragicomic that it is too painful not to laugh.<br/><br/>The best part of the film, to me however, is Hoult. Pretty much everything out of his mouth is comedic goal. He also delivers an early barbed insult in the perfect, just perfect manner for the tone of the film. It is so important for the film that the line generates laughs and it does. The screenplay, for all its wit, would have died if not for Hoult in that early scene.<br/><br/>I think my disappointment stems from the direction/technical aspects. They are all too beautifully crafted and while it works on an ironic level I would prefer more of the washed out look used in Tom Jones. While parts of them are pushed to an absurd degree they are too conventional for this script. The script is a send up of this sort of story and the visuals are too pristine for it. It works, overall, but a more daring film with less polished visuals would have been better.<br/><br/>Very good film through. 10/10"

","The Favourite (2019), starting the year as I mean to go on.<br/><br/>It's awkward when one of the first films released this year, turns out being on my top 20, last year 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' and this year apparently will be no different.<br/><br/>Yorgos Lanthimos had created himself a hefty job to top either 'The Lobster' or 'The Killing Of A Sacred Deer', but he succeeds on all fronts making a deliciously hilarious and wildly unique experience (which will most likely go missed outside of the film community).<br/><br/>As 'The Favourite' unfolds it reveals more than meets the eye. It is simply more than two people battling it out to win the affection of the Queen. Many subplots cause ripples in this story making a thoroughly enjoyable rollercoaster.<br/><br/>I would be kidding myself if I said the strongest aspect to Lanthimos' newest feature wasn't himself. He continuously proves himself to be an outstanding director and a more than capable film maker. His films are always aggressively unique and feature admirable storytelling methods.<br/><br/>The performances however cannot go unnoticed. I can finally release a huge sigh of relief as I can comfortably say Olivia Colman has finally managed to break onto the big screen with a leading role, which subsequently is one of her best. Her charm and wit does all the work and carries the film leaps and bounds. It goes without saying both Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, are nothing short than exceptional also. The two share remarkable chemistry. All three leads are entrancing and deserve all the praise they seem to be getting.<br/><br/>The structure of this, is told in almost as set of chapters, to a book, which marvellously breaks up the film and allows the scenes to have tonal and pacing variations without making it seem messy.<br/><br/>'The Favourite' may be the first film of the year, but it may also be one of the best. Good luck to 2019 on topping this."

I foresee multiple Oscars.<br/><br/>It may help people to read the Wikipedia articles about Queen Anne and the principal characters before seeing the movie. This is especially true of the political tapestry that was the backdrop for the plot.

This movie is less about historical fact and more about the salacious rumors surrounding Queen Anne and her ladies. Granted, the story is a piece of history, but have some class and present both sides of this story.<br/><br/>Regardless, the movie is laden with ridiculous profanity, unnecessary over the top sexual content and frankly boring.

Things happen in the movie with absolutely no greater purpose beyond how they immediately affect the main character. Not in any emotional capacity, mind you, just on the surface.
To put it short, this film has no meaning, which would be forgiven if it was at all enjoyable to sit through. It is aesthetically empty."
"classicsoncall","8","4","7","26 February 2019"," ""There are wolves out there, are there not?""
","I don't believe I've ever seen actress Olivia Colman before. She obviously has the 'Queen' thing down pat as I see she also portrays Queen Elizabeth II in the TV series, ""The Crown"". She's not really up to the task in this story, as Queen Anne Morley is quite often bedridden and complaining of one ill or another, and the country relies on the more capable hands of her aide, Sarah, the Lady Marlborough (Rachel Weisz). It's always interesting to see from an earlier perspective the type of scheming and double crossing that took place in prior centuries, not much unlike our own era with it's duplicity and devious cunning. Lady Sarah inspires the forces of those who would outlast and defeat the French in their running war, while the opposition wishes to sue for peace before any more blood is shed by England's army. Sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it?<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent and the period costumes evoke the royalty of Eighteenth Century England, but I have to admit, the story gets bogged down at times with the sheer decadence and lecherous behavior of many of the principals. There's some humor thrown in as well, and I for one had never considered the possibility of racing ducks as a hobby. Not flying ducks mind you, but waddling along at a leisurely enough clip to turn a head or two. Horatio, who's credited in the cast list with his real name, is deemed the Fastest Duck in the City, and is the pride and joy of the oddly named Godolphin (James Smith).<br/><br/>Watching this film the day after the Academy Awards ceremony, I'm aware that Olivia Colman won Best Actress for her role here, although one could argue that Emma Stone could have been up for the same award instead of the Best Supporting category. It seemed much of the story revolved around her and the machinations she eventually adopted to get on the Queen's good side, thereby preempting Lady Sarah's position in the royal hierarchy. The palace intrigue and sexual proclivities of the principals makes for a provocative story at times, but ultimately the picture wore itself out for me, and I was ready for it to be over when the Queen requested a final rubdown."

","When I looked at the list of the Best Picture nominees at the Academy Awards this year I immediately spotted 'The Favourite' as the one I was least looking forward to seeing. I'm not a big fan of period pieces and neither the cast nor film-maker garnered much interest from me. As it turns out I was wrong to single this one out. It is a middling film on the list. Certainly not the best, however certainly not the worst either. I was surprised at how engaged I found myself with the story. The pacing too, while not lightning quick, did just enough to always keep me focused and looking forward to what was coming next.<br/><br/>Three actresses from this film have been nominated for acting awards. Olivia Colman for Actress in Leading Role and Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone for Actresses in a Supporting Role (despite them both probably having equal or even more screen time than Colman?). Colman was pretty darn good I'd have to admit. She plays utterly miserable very well I'd have to say (that may be all I've ever seen her play come to think of it). It's hard to see her getting the nod though as she was never given one big scene to blow everyone away. Supporting Actress is usually a very weak category so with performances as strong as Stone's and Weisz' I would usually have said they had a great chance of winning. Unfortunately for them the category is slightly stronger than usual this year though and so I can't see them getting the nod either.<br/><br/>As for Best Picture, again I see it coming up short. While the film is good for what it is, it isn't going to be to everyone's liking. All a film can do is succeed at what it sets out to, however that isn't always enough to win an Oscar unfortunately. I loved that the film had an R rating. It added so many layers to the characters and made for a much more fun viewing experience. All in all 'The Favourite' is a well made film that you may just find yourself having a great time with."

"kimmgould","9","4","7","17 February 2019"," You will love it ... or hate it.
","I loved this movie. I was aware that it pushed boundaries throughout that created an unease in the cinema so palpable I could feel it.<br/><br/>My take on the reason for this unease -<br/><br/>1. This is a movie about 3 women. None of these characters have a reference point to a male character in the film. Weisz' character is married, but her husband is secondary to the main plot.<br/><br/>2. The scenes are written from the women's perspectives. Behaviours, responses, dialogue, it all felt so authentically female. I think most people are so accustomed to watching media created from men's perspective that delving into a women's story seems inherently wrong.<br/><br/>3. The women used language that many people would find challenging.<br/><br/>4. There were lesbian scenes seamlessly threaded through the movie. There was no sensationalising, they weren't gratuitous, there were no men involved, the central character in the sexual triangle was a sick old woman. Sometimes the language around this dynamic was explicit and crude.<br/><br/>So, there you have it. Three women, one of them the English Queen, getting up to no good. If all the sex was hetero we would laugh at the jolly japes and call it a good romp.<br/><br/>Now, the film itself. The three actresses were extraordinarily good. I do hope Olivia Colman wins awards, as should the costume designer. The film is long but filled with intrigue, tension and action. The ending, as some others have said, is a bit nondescript and yet perfectly expresses where the characters have found themselves by the end of it all.<br/><br/>If you are open-minded and like a complex historical drama that's slightly offbeat, don't miss this one. I should add, I really really don't like slapstick, but the humour in this film made me laugh out loud with its absurdity at times. The dialogue is very sharp, very witty.<br/><br/>Also, just thought of one more thing, some of the reviewers were concerned that the English upper classes were portrayed as being barking mad. It wasn't an overbearing part of the movie, more a playful look at some of the stranger behaviours of the time, and that was pretty much a background to the wonderful main storyline.<br/><br/>I was delighted by this film."

This was probably the second film, first being Barry Jenkin's Moonlight, where I so badly wanted to like or even love it but that would really just be a lie. I respect the main three actresses so much. Olivia Colman is so good in this particular role. Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz were entertaining but their roles weren't as juicy as I thought. This was compared to the cinematic hit ""All About Eve"". Is it just me or does that sound like a compliment too good to be true. Weisz and Stone's rivalry was not as enjoyable as I would've liked it to be. The whole feel of the film was so creepy and bizarre. I got an uneasy feeling of confusion of boredom as I was watching it. Their costumes were exquisite but the story just didn't work for me. I left the theatre saying to myself, ""Did I not understand the film? Were there hidden messages that I didn't catch?"" I looked up the spoilers and whole plot and realized that wasn't the issue. The issue was how it was presented. It should've been directed by someone else. This film is just way too boring and bizarre for me. I'm not stopping anyone from seeing this film but just don't go in, thinking it's the best picture of 2018. It certainly isn't."

What we see here recently happening is the director breaking into the mainstream crowd via award buzz. This film should most definitely be viewed by those who have seen and enjoyed his previous work in The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer. If you hated those movies, you'll certainly dislike this one; it falls into that same genre.<br/><br/>But for those who did enjoy the two aforementioned films, this movie is worth the watch.

The men came off second best in this even though they actually held the power. I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who appreciates the genius of film making. It never lost pace throughout and was daring in its use of long held closeups of the actors, who seemed to revel in their chance to give us an insight into their inner worlds. It reminded me of Barry Lyndon in the recreation of a period world without losing sight of people's essential humanity, warts and all."

Ok sure but if you know anything about Queen Ann you know that she had 17 children (most died) and a husband who she was devoted too.

"daryuschandra","10","7","15","6 January 2019"," Definitely Make You Uncomfortable and Cinematically Poetic
","This is my first review ever in IMDB and the lucky film that I've chosen is 'The Favourite' (2018), a film directed by the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos. It's very likely that if you never watched his previous works such as Dogtooth (2009), The Lobster (2015), and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), you would not be very keen on this film, because Lanthimos also exploited a lot of his well-known trademarks in this film. Some level of absurdities and some 'on-the-edge' black comedies are very eminent. Some of the characters also occasionally spoke in a flat-tone and weird manner, although not very obvious. The combination that will make you uncomfortable. I'm not entirely sure if this film holds very much to the historical accuracy, due to those absurdities and exaggeration. That is why I will clear myself from reviewing the historical accuracy perspective.<br/><br/>The performance by Olivia Colman was incredible. The combination of Colman's incredible acting and the Lanthimos' unique directing, made some scene put you on the verge of feeling uncomfortable. For example, the ""Look at Me"" scene (you can find it on Youtube), is very remarkable. It is indeed very funny, but at the same time, you can't help feeling sad for Queen Anne. The way Colman's portrayed the character at that moment gave you a glimpse of how sad and lonely The Queen truly is. When I watched this specific part on the screen, I felt so bad for laughing at The Queen. That's where I knew that Lanthimos has succeeded in achieving his goal to create an uncomfortable feeling inside me. It is just brilliant, also it is proof that you do not need a long background story to create an empathetic feeling to the main character. I heard about Queen Anne before but I did not have enough curiosity to find more about her. But after this film, certainly, I do.<br/><br/>In addition, it is cinematically poetic. One thing I noticed was a lot of use wide lens/fish-eye lens on some scenes, mostly used at the beginning of a new scene. It amplified the sense of spacious but containment simultaneously. For me, it created the feeling of dramatic isolation, which basically what I have captured from The Queen's live. Not to mention good camera's work, vibrant colors, and gorgeous costume designs, they made this film genuinely intriguing. The performance by supporting actress also need to be praised highly, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, because they definitely delivered their jobs. I could grasp their intense rivalry in the air by just observing their staring and glare towards each other. Also, Emma Stone spoke in a British accent!<br/><br/>One thing that I found that could be improved is the ending. Given that the whole film is very dramatic already, the ending falls a bit flat to me. I can see the ending from a mile away because it is very predictable. That's why some additional element probably could be added to give more flavor to this predictable result. Normally, people knew specifically when a film ended, but when I saw the end of the film, I was like ""Is that all? Okay then."" Now, I am not really sure if it is a good thing or a bad one because in a way I say the film is not long enough. I want more."

"thebricks","9","13","33","16 December 2018"," One of the best period pieces ever made
","I had to drive ninety miles to see this in an art theater in a wealthy part of a city, but it was well worth it. I absolutely loved this movie, from start to finish. It's a period piece the director took seriously. Lighting during the day and night seems authentic, characters try to speak as they did back in the early 1700s as well as carry on with the mannerisms. Actors are all solid, the studio didn't force the director to cast actors that can't act and fit in with the time period. Think of the egregious casting of Channing Tatum in ""The Eagle"", set in Ancient Rome. That was so close to being a great movie. It was tragic. Everyone around him tried to play the part, except Channing, who probably never had even heard of Ancient Rome when he first showed up on set. Sets are all detailed and gorgeous to take in, the music is authentic, nothing modern to be heard at any point.<br/><br/>It's an British movie that isn't stuffy. It's set among the rich and powerful yet gritty and realistic. Rachel Weisz and Olivia Colman definitely should be considered for Oscars for their performances. Emma Stone, Nicholas Hoult and Joe Alwyn also do a stupendous job that should warrant recognition.<br/><br/>My one complaint lies with the trailer. That's why I took one star off. AMC advertised this movie constantly for months. Initially, I thought it was awful and that I would never see it because it was so weird and offbeat. Then it grew on me, literally around the 6th time I saw it. I guess I was brainwashed. Sad to say, they took all of the funniest, wittiest parts, pivotal scenes and put it in the trailers and clips released online. The scenes are not out of context either, it plays out in the movie exactly like it was edited into the trailer. What on Earth were the people behind the trailer thinking? It's not like this movie lacked filler scenes that would have sold the film just as well! So beware, if you have not seen the trailer but are interested in the film, do not watch it. The last trailer that was about as bad and revealing was the infamous Terminator Genisys trailer. Hollywood, please stop doing this!"

"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","9","11","27","13 December 2018"," A twisted tale of royal monarchy gone bad
","Yorgos Lanthimos continues to be one of the most unique and dynamic filmmakers working today. In his latest film, Lanthimos engages the audience in 18th century royal British politics that is centered around three women. We have Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), the emotionally unstable and sensitive ruler of England who would rather spoil herself with treats and play with her pet rabbits then engage in any sort of politics. And by her side and constantly controlling her every decision is Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz). Cold, cynical and mean-spirited, Sarah makes sure the country runs the way she prefers by speaking on the behalf of the queen herself. And then comes in the final girl, Sarah's cousin Abigail who finds the Achille's heel in Anne and Sarah's relationship to exploit. As Sarah and Abigail go to war with each other for Anne's affection, it begins to have huge affect on the literal war that is going on with France.<br/><br/>The dynamic chemistry between all three of the actresses and the engaging script by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara is what keeps you hooked in this heightened period piece. From the beginning, Weisz, Stone and Colman portray their characters in one way that you would seem straightforward but by the end your view on them turns a complete 180. Weizs's confidence and dry wit makes her character Sarah feels like a force of nature you want to avoid crossing. By contrast Stone's charm and humour shows her character Abigail as appearing sweet and you wanting to root for. However, once the table turn in the game of manipulation and favouritism, Weisz display vulnerability in Sarah and Stone expands her dramatic chops to the reveal the dark trickster that hides behind Abigail's sweet smile. However the most fully ranged performance is that of Colman. While Queen Anne seems written to be as comic relief at first, Colman gets to put on show of emotional depth that by contrast makes her feel more human then the rest of the royal over-the-top characters we meet. Colman's comedic time definitely does earn most of the laughs in a very dark and twisted story. However it's through her emotional performance that gives the Favourite a sense of humanity that would otherwise be lacking.<br/><br/>Robbie Ryan's cinematography makes the Favourite visually stand apart from previous period piece dramas. The wide dynamic perspective shots make the character's interactions with each other feel like a you're removed from their presence because of their wealth and class status. The feeling of alienation from the shots is what helps it to sell its cold atmosphere. With close-ups of character's face the film then lets you get inside their heads to know where their minds and emotions are at in the moment. This then allows the story and its characters to be seen as being flawed but also honest and real.<br/><br/>Like Lathimos's previous films The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite is a film that will leave feeling very cold and disturbed but is definitely joy to watch three amazingly talented actresses to perform with and against each other."
"BillSims28","9","9","21","12 February 2019"," Sumptuous, Sardonically Hilarious, Impeccably Acted
","Best known for a film about forced therianthropy, director Yorgos Lanthimos has never been one to adhere to conventional rules of filmmaking. His latest piece is a perfect example of this, pitting its three note-perfect leads against each other in a gripping and witty triumvirate of female power-hunting.<br/><br/>'The Favourite' is buoyed by the tightest script of 2018, as produced by AACTA-award winner Tony McNamara and newcomer Deborah Davis. Complete with vicious insults and pithy one-liners, the film often takes on an absurdist feel due to its quintessentially modern approach to the eighteenth century setting. While not a straight-set comedy, it is in many ways the perfect dramedy, using its finely-judged tone to forge a uniquely satirical period piece.<br/><br/>The three central performances are each excellent and the actresses deserve every award they receive. The ever-fantastic Olivia Colman explores the bipolar and gluttonous depths to which she can take her character of Queen Anne, revelling in the attention she receives whilst a deep vein of tragedy simmers underneath. Rachel Weisz's character goes through a lot, and the acerbic wit she demonstrates calls out for her future inclusion in more comedic material. Stone is at her best here, displaying a Machiavellian moral ambiguity attitude in order to become the Queen's favourite. The interplay between the three is great fun to watch, and indicative of their effortless chemistry.<br/><br/>The setting allows for some exquisite production and costume design. Technically, the film also boasts some fascinating explorations of cinematography from 'Slow West' DP Robbie Ryan. The frequent use of the fisheye lens creates a confined, claustrophic atmosphere which enables all the relevant parts of a given scene to be visible. Excluding the fitting collection of sweeping baroque music, there is no traditional score to speak of, and at times the minimalist soundtracking does become too jarring and overstays its welcome. There are a few too many such occasions (including the ending) which could have benefitted from a stern edit, but for the most part the film is refreshingly expeditious.<br/><br/>Overall this is one of the year's strongest and wittiest films which is definitely worth taking the time to watch. With a trio of flawless acting performances, it is Lanthimos' finest work to date. 87/100"

The scenes involving the shooting of the birds was very unnecessary and violent. No story, no plot twists, zero character development. No one is worth rooting for. Very boring and hard to watch. If you just had a good meal or about to have a good meal, skip this movie. You will lose your appetite watching some of the overly vulgar and gross scenes.

"DFagundes","8","5","10","31 January 2019"," Deep, funny and haunting. Not for everyone, though
","The last film by director Yorgos Lanthimos is a unique period comedy that is perhaps the most different film of the year in the Hollywood scene. Lanthimos is not worried about portraying 18th century England with realism.
Instead, he takes a more eccentric and sometimes even absurdist approach on his characters, which reminded me a lot of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, but far less subtle, getting closer to the Coens' darker comedies such as Fargo or a Serious Man.
Lanthimos explores several layers of the human condition, and by dehumanizing his characters in certain ways, and showing us absurd situations as if they are normal, he somehow manages to focus on other human traits with a bit more freedom and depth than he would otherwise be able to.
I think there are several themes explored in this film, the biggest of them being power relations and human desire. The characters are written with such expression and freedom that their desires and ambitions feel so much more alive than usual, as if they are animals who only care about that one thing, and want that so badly that they can't hide it. The plot plays with their desires and how far they are able to go in order to get what they want. We are almost manipulated to connect with the three characters for several reasons, only to be trapped in the moral ambiguity of all the characters we were caring about. This makes the film harder to watch, but a lot more interesting and unpredictable.
The other theme that is dealt with so masterfully throughout the film is power. The way Lanthimos displays the power relations within the characters' relationships is fascinating. He is able to question the very nature of power, and its relationship with the actual utility of it, and the desires that lie underneath. We are always reminded of who is in power at any time, but this always seems to blur into the complexities of the situations, so much that we end up getting confused about what power really means.
The ending says a lot about this power-desire relationship. We are tricked into thinking that the game they are playing is only related to their position in court, and their proximity and influence with the queen. But the ending proves us wrong, and once again displays the ambiguity that lies under all these power games. One more factor suddenly at play: truth. It makes it all most complex, and unexpected since we'd lost all expectations of humanity by these characters. The result is a haunting and intense ending, not easy to grasp at first, but once you let it sink in, it starts making a lot of sense.
I also liked how Lanthimos laughed hard at the face of the place and period he portrayed in this film. All these themes of power and human desire fit like a glove to a political and social satire of the period, and it could't have been more pleasant to watch him make not so subtle jokes and deliver punch lines that cut right through the heart of that particular society.
About the technical achievements of this film, they are all close to perfection. All three actresses do an amazing job, it's hard to say which is best. They share almost the same screen time, and any of them is easily a main character in the film. The cinematography together with art design and costumes show us a haunting 18th century English court, with some detached elements, but some extremely realistic ones. The lighting is superb, and again reminded me a lot of Barry Lyndon, with all the natural light and candles being such an important part of the aesthetics of the film. The music is also haunting and disturbing, and it fits the themes with perfection. It brings intensity to each scene, and is really present in the most pivotal moments. Finally, the editing is also very good, creating some sort of nightmarish pace that enhances the absurdist tone of the film, mixing sounds of different scenes, cutting between thematically converging scenes at times, and keeping the focus on closeups so we can savor the real emotions behind some other scenes.
This film has a comedy style that is hard to grasp at first. We are used to some level of realism and humanity displayed by the characters, and when some absurdist comedy starts wiping the floor before we get to know these characters and before we get used to the tone, it is a lot harder to see where the humor is, or even understand the jokes. Once we get used to it and we buy the idea of this idiosyncratic comedy, we start to really enjoy the dark humor and the tone. Nevertheless, this film is certainly not for everyone, and most audiences will think the it's flat, dull and will not see a single funny moment.
Last thing to say about this film is that it probably demands to be watched more than once, and surely demands to be thought about a lot after each time. This first time left me a bit confused at the ending, with mixed feelings of awe and disappointment. The themes are not on the surface, and the ending is so ambiguous that I could not make sense of it until a thought about it for some hours. This is, in my opinion, what makes this kind of film great."

"morrison-dylan-fan","9","5","10","12 January 2019"," ""These are a few of my favourite things.""
","Needing to go to Birmingham,I decided to look at what was screening at the oldest working cinema in the UK:The Electric. Finding that two movies had the same start time, (the other being Mary Poppins Returns (2018)) I was pleased when out of left-field fellow IMDber timshelboy recommended the other title to me,which led to me finding out if this would be one of my favourite first viewings of 2019.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Signalling the corridor the film will be walking down with the very good Mark Gatiss of The League of Gentlemen and James Smith from The Thick of It and In The Loop being given prominent supporting roles, auteur director Yorgos Lanthimos and cinematographers Robbie Ryan & Stephen Murphy playfully retain the elegance of the Costume Drama, whilst undressing it of the self-importance usually featured in the genre. Incredibly lighting the night time scenes with just candlelights, Lanthimos and Ryan (with Murphy stepping in when Ryan took a break after his dad died) shine a grotesque atmosphere in the darkness, from the pulled faces of Abigail and Lady Sarah eyeing up in the shadows secrets to one-up each-other. Determined to not use Steadicam to follow the trio down the corridors of the lavish Hatfield House location, Lanthimos bask in brisk natural lighting eye the power-play unfolding in ultra-stylised gimbal rigs wide-lensed winding shots spanning the huge rooms and subtly bringing Sarah and Abigail's feud down to size against a regal backdrop.<br/><br/>Playing fast and loose with the real events, ( Queen Anne had a husband, who does not feature in the movie) the screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, (main writer of wonderful Aussie TV series Puberty Blues)flies in with wickedly jet-black comedy dialogue and macabre physical comedy leaving Sarah blood-splattered. Modernising the language used, the writers take great care for it to be a natural fit, as the modern swearing digs into the poisonous state the relationship between Anne, Sarah and Abigail becomes. Surrounding Queen Anne with her rabbits/ ""children"", the writers gradually place the surrealist fur of Lanthimos's other works (this being the first of his directed films he has not written) by opening the cages to excellent, brittle battle between Sarah and Abigail in who can become top dog/the royal pet.<br/><br/>Looking unrecognisable, Olivia Colman gives an outstanding performance as Queen Anne,who Colman has bellow with pain and anger from the minimal power she still holds. Reuniting with Colman and Lanthimos from The Lobster (2015), Rachel Weisz gives an intense, expressive performance as Lady Sarah, whose ""friendship"" with Anne is captured by Weisz with a plastic smile, and a viper spit towards Abigail's power-play. Hiding her US accent under regal clothes, Emma Stone gives an excellent turn as Abigail, thanks to Stone nailing Abigail's attempt to present a refined image, while ruthlessly fighting to become the new favourite."
"Prismark10","6","5","10","10 January 2019"," Palace intrigue
","If The Favourite had music by Michael Nyman. I would had said that it was directed by Peter Greenaway. I do think Greenaway was a big influence with the style of the film, as well as the Oscar winning Tom Jones that lent it some naughtiness.<br/><br/>Director Yorgos Lanthimos adds a rich period setting and visual flourishes. He keeps his camera moving and has lot of fisheye views.<br/><br/>Underneath it all is a power play between three women in 18th Century England. Two of them vie to be Queen Anne's favourite even if this means massaging more than her legs.<br/><br/>Abigail (Emma Stone) has fallen on hard times. She arrives at Court hoping for employment from her cousin, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz.) She is the Queen's trusted adviser, lady in waiting, confidante and even lover.<br/><br/>Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is ill. She has gout, she is mentally unstable. She lost 17 children and she has 17 rabbits that she plays with. Governing the country is something she finds difficult especially as Britain is at war with France.<br/><br/>Abigail wants to ingratiate herself with Queen Anne and climb the greasy pole to secure her position. Over time Abigail and Lady Sarah fight, dirtily to be the Queen's favourite.<br/><br/>The Favourite is a crude, grimy, seedy, bawdy drama in tone and language. Lanthimos is certainly not interested in showing a wholesome chocolate box portrait of 18th century life.<br/><br/>This is a sumptuous looking costume drama about fragile cruel people and egos. People who are desperate to get to the top and remain there.<br/><br/>The film unravels in the second half and gets bogged down. At the end Abigail may not be quiet in control as she thinks, I did think the ending was weak and disappointing."

It wasn't bad at all and if you love history, costumes, dark comedy and a little fun, this movie really is amazing, as it was for me. I was blown away by the performances of Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz, I think both deserve Oscar nominations. Not to discredit Emma Stone, she did well, but her character was just very annoying and I couldn't quite connect with her as the others.<br/><br/>As for the story; it developed quite well. At the start I was a little confused, I didn't know what to expect. But as it developed; it just got better. The ending felt weird, but for some reason, I liked it.

It gets 3 stars only because Wiesz and Stone turned in good performances with what they'd been given, which yielded a few clever bits of dialogue.
I cannot say the same of the simpering whimpering Olivia Colman, who deserves to be sued for her vaudeville representation of Queen Anne.

","It's kind of a sad tale about power. And what you'll to do to get it/keep it. And none of the characters are very likable. If I had to pick one, I would say that I sympathized with Queen Anne the most. It's clear everyone is using her for their own gain. Yes, I do think that Sarah genuinely enjoyed her company, but she also was using her. She was practically Queen except in name. Wouldnt let Anne make any decisions for herself. Abigail used her to raise her status. The government was using and manipulating her to get what they want in terms of the war and taxes. However, the end scene really cements that Anne was also awful and proves her ""power"" to Abigail. Sarah and Abigail are constantly trying to one up each other, like they're just not very nice people. But that doesnt bother me really because its such an interesting story. And its quite witty. Sometimes, it does delve a bit into the pretentious category. Certainly with the ""Acts"", but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I could have done with the fish eye cameras though. It was a weird, distracting choice made by the director. But the acting was really good too. Olivia Colman is a standout."

Helped by a magnificent script, spot on cast and gorgeous cinematography, this is one the best movies I've seen this year and according to sources, it promises to get better and better.

In my point of view, the actors fill their characters brilliantly. The music, the costumes, the production design, the lighting, the typefaces - all is super well executed! Love for details - you can feel it in every frame. WOW.<br/><br/>The film torments the viewer with unreal, dragging passages, metaphors, allegories (which made me think of e.g. the first part of MELANCHOLIA by von Trier, where nothing 'really' happens for 1 hour...), but delights the viewer with funny, grotesque, thrilling, haunting, disturbing moments in between. I believe that this contrasting behavior strengthens the plot, overall storytelling dynamic and the emotional impact onto the viewer.<br/><br/>I, personally, am very glad I've sat through those 2 hours of raw human nature disguised as rich, royal monarchy - the images gave me a long lasting inspiration and the music plays on.

","Set in early 18th-century England and loosely based on historical events, the story examines the relationship between two cousins. Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough and Abigail Masham, who later became Baroness Masham, vying to be Court favourites of Queen Anne.<br/><br/>I know nothing about the historical significance any of these very real people played, but the film is loosely based on their stories so I don't think it's necessary to be completely knowledgeable. I can say however with certainty that this film was still fantastic and let me tell you why. Immediately the camerawork fascinated me. Whoever the cinematographer was on this film (Robbie Ryan apparently) implemented various ways to capture each shot. He uses a fisheye lense, various corner shots, whip pans and long shots. It's very impressive and choosing to do all of this with natural lighting? Literally what I strive to be as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>This all is aided by the set design being so extravagant, regal and gorgeous looking. It all unfolds before your eyes like a storybook and I just wanted to stare at it for long periods of time. Bravo to the director Yorgos Lanthimos on these areas alone, it definitely stood out to me in 2018! So moving onto the acting. It's fantastic all around, but Olivia Colman specifically got an Oscar for a reason. Her character, the Queen Anne is such a miserable character. Constantly ill, not wanting to handle her various responsibilities, keeping the rabbits as surrogate children which in turn is basically a constant reminder of her despair. Even with her power and stature, she's become frivolous and completely given up. Not an easy character to play and she does it amazingly!<br/><br/>Our other two main actors Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are pretty on par with each other throughout the film. Nicholas Hoult however surprised me, his character Robert Harley stood out more than I anticipated. He's quite good in the film and I haven't seen much being said about his performance. Concerning the overall plot, it did keep my attention though I didn't really know where else it was going to go. I knew we had this continuous fight for the Queen's affection and deciding on what to do with the current war. Both of these are interesting, but when you look at it as a completed movie there wasn't a lot that happens.<br/><br/>Seeing the bunny abuse upset me deeply, though of course that didn't take away from the film. Just added a hatred for Emma Stone's character Abigail. I found myself talking to the screen and saying ""yeah Abigail don't get too comfortable in your position!"" The ending makes sense overall, but also leaves much to be desired. I actually thought the ending would involve the Queen succumbing to her illness and dying. That would've been interesting to see play out and considering she had no apparent successors.

","To all those saying the film didn't elaborate on Anne/Sarah's relationship or why Anne had such a large # of rabbits Obviously need to rewatch this... Yorgos' storytelling methods are slightly unorthodox, can make audiences uncomfortable but cinema shouldn't b afraid to take risks. Personally I found this more enjoyable than Killing of a Sacred Deer. There were sum genuinely funny moments in this: the dancing, Hoult's performance. I really enjoyed the showing of multiple female leads who r all at one point villians then victims. It was over the top, funny, sometimes explicit but it was a different take on ""period pieces"" that tend to b similiar. Would definitely watch again."
"soundoflight","9","3","5","28 April 2019"," Not for everyone, and that's the point
","Yorgos Lanthimos is a director that loves to challenge his viewers. He uses a variety of subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) film-making and story-telling techniques that assist him in punching up the story he is trying to tell. The viewer will likely fall into one of two camps: people that are interested in the art of filmmaking enough to pick up on, appreciate, and understand these techniques, and people that just wanted to watch a movie and not be subjected to subtle psychological prodding.<br/><br/>You can see this division play out in these reviews, with most people either highly praising the film, or saying it was boring, a waste of time, unsettling, disturbing, and nonsensical. The funny thing is that the critics are not entirely wrong with these labels - the film actually is at times unsettling, disturbing, and nonsensical, and intentionally so. This is trademark Lanthimos.<br/><br/>The classic example of one of Lanthimos' techniques, and something of his own trademark prior to this film, was the way characters in his films would speak in clipped, unnatural ways to keep the viewer off balance. Thankfully he has dropped that from this film, as I feel it was starting to hold him back a little. But he has included in its place a wide variety of interesting camera angles, lenses, lighting (such as intentional bad lighting, with faces darkened, something you rarely see), a soundtrack that transitions from pleasant to jarring and back, and anachronisms thrown in (Intentionally I believe).<br/><br/>Where I diverge strongly from the critics is that I found this film to be highly compelling and not boring in the slightest. The acting was absolutely superb, with Emma Stone in particular knocking it out of the park. The interplay between the three female lead characters was fascinating. The historical context created by the sets and scenery were mind blowing and I wish I could have seen this on the big screen to really appreciate it. And the aforementioned techniques kept me on the edge of my seat and guessing at what would come next throughout."
"mandagrammy","8","3","5","7 April 2019"," Spectacular Acting
","What an interesting story about a Queen of England we seldom hear about. Very well done, although there were some uses of camera work that I found distracting. However, the story is fascinating and told in a linear way that is easy to understand, something that many films do not do nowadays. You can not fault the acting of all 3 major female roles. It is spectacular. All three women are complex and the actresses inhabit them totally, revealing so many different sides to them. Costuming and scenery are spectacular too, feeling very authentic. Two thumbs up for this one, particularly for the acting."

","This is my first review ever. I loved this movie and watched it after reading countless terrible reviews about it. I won't go into any great depth about, so much as to say that most people are idiots that lack insight into nuance, subtext, black humour, art direction and the absurdity of the human condition. This movie isn't a unicorn but it is quite unique. I won't unpack all the subtleties, but in short, the soundtrack was perfect, the cinematography beautiful, even the fish eye, which actually lends a more realistic perspective than the standard numerous quick cuts of close ups. It's quite brilliant actually. In real life you would see the entire room. So you can appreciate the grandeur of the opulent setting in this movie. And shooting from lower down makes people appear as giants. Which is what these people are in our hierarchical society. It all makes sense if you think about it. The ending makes perfect sense. It's not even slightly difficult to figure out. The acting is perfect. I was totally immersed in this bizarre world that beautifully portrayed. If you like movies that are different and don't require all the typical Hollywood cliches to get a movie, you may love this. Many people won't get it, but don't be deceived by the bad reviews. It is an exceedingly good movie. I'm not a critic, but I worked in a DVD store for years and I've seen thousands of movies. Hundreds of them period movies. I know when something deserves 1 star reviews and this movie absolutely does not. People are just morons."
"hlahorner","5","3","5","23 March 2019"," Overhyped, Pretentious Historical Fiction
","Here's something that I've learned about myself, and it has a direct bearing on my enjoyment of a movie, and therefore my review; I do not like the current trend of ""reimagining"" actual, historical people with modern sensibilities. I highly doubt Queen Anne and the people in her court went around liberally dropping f bombs. Then there's the ballroom dance scene that my husband called 18th century ""Dancing with the Stars"". Actually that made me laugh, so maybe that's what was meant when it was described as a comedy. Call me uptight, call me old fashioned, I don't care. It bothers me.<br/><br/>Basically, Lady Sarah Marlborough, who is an actual ancestor of Sir Winston Churchill and Lady Dianna, was a childhood friend of Queen Anne and a trusted confidant and her personal assistant. She was intelligent, outspoken and did influence the Queen. This is all true. It is also true that her cousin Abigail was a Lady who fell on hard times and was taken in as a servant, and slowly replaced Lady Sarah as the Queens ""favorite"". I did a little light research on all of this and it is believed that Lady Sarah was pushed out because she was outspoken, domineering and blunt, as opposed to Abigail's softer approach. Serious historians ""highly doubt"" that any of the women were lesbians or sexually involved. I read that historical movies tell you more about the people that made it than the people and events they portray. Currently the mood in Hollywood is that men are weak and secondary, even when it comes to sex, and it's all about girrl power. That is the perspective this movie takes in telling the story, even though that's not what the reality was for these real people.<br/><br/>I gave the stars that I did based on the strength of the actresses and the elaborate costumes and settings."
"konporer","6","3","5","20 March 2019"," Pretentiousness ruining a potentially better movie
","I dont understand the fish eye cams, other than to show that ""Im so unique and deep""? Seriously, other than that I just can't imagine a single bit of reason for it. Simply because It's not like fish eye cam is a new thing and no one ever tried to do something with it, imagine lowering the resolution of the film randomly making it blurry sometimes in between key scenes for no reasons, yeah, such new avant-garde, such creativeness, right? why no one does it? because it looks freaking bad and serves nothing other than repulsiveness to some audiences.<br/><br/>The plot is suspenseful most of time keeping the movie engaging, but on a story level it's average at best if not simply bad. Aside from being overly simplistic, there are hardly ever any character or character development, I understand it's a luxury to ask for realism even though with its almost absurd level budget or attention to the historic clothes and environment settings one would naturally expect so, then again one can only hope they can at least allocate 1% of that to the story to make it more reasonable or believable, to be at least worthy of all the dazzling fancy environment sets.
The movie is successful in depicting the most basic settings as to where the main characters are to the queen on relationship levels but that's about it, theres no character consistency after that, the queen is literally a cheap plotdevice with no personality of her own while the others had IQ and sympathy level that are conveniently changing every time the plot demands. One time a woman can threaten and nearly kill the protagonist directly with the slightest offense, next scene on the most serious intrusion of the highest seriousness, protagonist is merely ""dismissed"", giving her chance to fight back in the following plots.<br/><br/>Probbly coming from a background of Asia used to all kinds of palace drama and movies of all kinds of princes and concubines scheming and fighting to the death, tons of the events in the story just feels stupid and naive, with actions of the characters uncharacteristic and fake. Like the single most powerful person in the country even controlling the Queen should have easily executed a mere maid along with the maid's whole family or the entire crew when she dared to use poison in cups served to queen, and even nearly killing her. A person as smart as her controlling every fair in the palace would not give the maid chance to plead to queen with self inflicted fake wounds when she ordered her to leave, no, she'd go directly to the guillotine, as if not already ridiculous enough, later when the maid is with the queen, an audience is suddenly required denying the woman more chance with the queen? The writer or director needs to at least learn and understand how an audience with the King or Queen works, it's not the door lock of a 13 year old girl throwing tantrum, If the Queen had the power to banish the woman out of the country, how dare , how dumb and why would the smartest powerful woman threaten the Queen with life and death matter?? thats simply not her character, and it serves literally nothing, this is not modern time world where a public figure can not be killed easily,, (in the end she's indeed banished from the country losing all her power just because of one command from the Queen), etc etc, there are so many convenient development that are dumb on many levels to anyone used to historical dramas inside a feudal palace.<br/><br/>Another widely hated part is the background music which didn't bother me, on the contrary I found them just right for the atmosphere the movie is trying to create (could be that im watching it at 1.5-2x the speed rather than being forced to hear it all the way through in a closed theatre with heightened decibels though).<br/><br/>Anyway, an average movie with an overly simplified and most of the time dumb story that is simply sub par and in sharp contrast to the grandiose visuals and environment sets.<br/><br/>
People say when the wave ebbs, the one that is naked is then exposed. IMO This movie is precisely the case showing exactly how much worth this director is at when he is no longer shrouded in this guise of ridiculousness of ""omg so deep""""so many meanings"",
like an artist known for drawing abstract random mix of colors that hardly anyone appreciates, but are always touted by a certain group of people as ""Deep! masterpiece!"", when this artist is asked to simply draw a picture of something in real world for the beauty of it simply rather than drawing ""deep things"", alas, the result just turns out to be this painfully average and at most place sub par drawing, worthy literally no more than a rating of average, 5/10. Plus 1 point for the high budget fancy set pieces that are a joy to the eye."

The overweight naked gentleman being abused and the scene cut to at least four separate times was disgusting.

"alvesmarceloalves-73751","8","3","5","15 February 2019"," Not the best Lanthimos, but still a good movie
","It is curious to think that Yorgos Lanthimos' most conventional and less ""insane"" film is being the most successful of his career. In fact, ""The favourite"" that has been collecting awards. There are already a total of 134, entitled to a Golden Globe for actress Olivia Colman and seven awards Bafta, The film still won ten Oscar nominations. But ""The favourite"" is far from having the complications, the sadisms and to cause that discomfort that had its previous works, ""The killing of the sacred deer"" and ""The Lobster"". With a more palatable film that was not written by Lanthimos and his latecomer Efthymis Filippou, the Greek director eventually got the chance to win more sympathy from the members of the academy.<br/><br/>And this proves that no matter how much the Oscar tries to be more sympathetic to other, less expensive Oscar production - and the ""Black Panther"" nomination for the best film signals that - the academy always has its limits. Films in which you have to decide whether or not a family member with echoes in Greek mythology such as ""The Sacrifice of the Sacred Deer"" or a little more intricate scripts like ""The Lobster"" still has not come this far. Everything, however, can change with the winds.<br/><br/>But of course ""The Favourite"" is still a good movie because of it. If there is a mark of Lanthimos in this film is the irony and the almost contempt with which its characters are treated. Lanthimos is almost marvelously cruel to ridicule royalty with a subtlety and at the same time a caricatured tone of a great charizard. All right with a few shots that send a spectator who seems to be just lurking, looking through the keyhole and scenarios of kitschy exaggeration, a luxury that provocatively borders on bad taste.<br/><br/>In their hands, the whole monarchy tradition is pathetic. The way the queen should be treated (never turn to her, do not look at her without being asked) the ridiculous makeup of the men and even a fierce run of ducks and lobsters. Everything sounds kitsch as if Lanthimos told us: ""How did we sustain this ridiculous theater for so many centuries and still today?""<br/><br/>In the center of ""The Favourite"" is a dispute involving hatred, jealousy, envy between two women, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone) for the attention of Queen Anne (beautifully lived by Olivia Colman). The fight is ridiculous, childish. Worse, rich and spoiled children.<br/><br/>From the outset a rivalry has been established between the two distant cousins. One wanting to maintain the power of influence over the queen and, consequently, over the government, which is facing a military battle against France. The other, an ex-lady who lost everything in some failed marriage wanting to recover the money and status she had once had. It's all about power, influence, and wealth.<br/><br/>For this, both use all the weapons they have. If they sabotage, they ironize themselves, all with the perceptive look of the queen, who loves the dispute of the two to seduce her. At bottom, the queen has a wit at the same time that Lanthimos exposes the strange eccentricities of the monarchs.<br/><br/>At bottom, the question of war inside the palace has more to do with the mood of the queen and the political and extra political games inside the palace than properly a practical and objective question. But is it so in any political scenario, we could argue? Yes, but when it comes to royalty it gains even more proportions in the futilities and eccentricities of the court.<br/><br/>Lanthimos filmed the ridiculous with a mixture of satire and poison and, best of all, making everything seem very serious. It is not your most interesting film, but how can you not delight in the display of luxury and kitsch in a court of futile and miserable values such as that built by the Greek director?<br/><br/>In fact, Lanthimos did it again. And on this we can only applaud."
"wildcatalert","9","3","5","15 February 2019"," A more crowd-pleasing Lanthimos film, but still Lanthimos style
","Well, I guess Lanthimos is a top notch in Europe right now, trying to ""win"" international market (mostly US), that are used to delightful comedies , badass adventures and Super heroes movies.
This is a film that makes you feel a bit weird, uncomfortable , and makes you think in many levels. A typical Lanthimos film but lighter. If you felt very weird and sick watching this, then don't bother watching any of his other movies! I dare anyone to watch ""Kynodontas"" ! It's the most daring (I cannot find words to describe it) film I've ever watched, but every Lanthimos movie does something to your head and makes you see things clearly (if it doesn't watch it again and again).
This movie is not a waste of time (as some of you describe...) , it IS a Masterpiece, and it IS so True! It is about survival , manipulation , woman power , witty , using sex to gain power , and lots of rivalry !
So if you want just to relax in your couch , eat popcorn , watch a film and then sleep, don't watch a Lanthimos film!!! That's a general advice. But if you want to watch something that you'll remember for the rest of your life, that could be life-changing, then that's a movie that you should watch!
Lanthimos has a unique style (kind of reminds me of Stanley Kubrick) , and I'm always looking forward to watching his films!
So great that he managed to get all these awards for this movie. The performances were above perfect! I'm curious to see how it goes at the Oscars. I would give him the oscar for everything by far!!!"
"johnklem","8","3","5","15 February 2019"," Wickedly entertaining and accurate depiction of an unwelcome menage a trois
","Firstly, this is not for simple palates. It lacks obvious dramatic moments and the kind of crowd-pleasing finale that the cousins seem to need. In their place, the film offers endless nuance, psychological and emotional truth and an ending that perfectly fits the story as told. And it packages all of that in a deceptively simple movie. And deception is the word here. This is like Liaisons Dangereuses for real people.
The cast, Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone and Olivia Colman all bring their considerable A game to a very smart and very witty script. The cinematography is spot-on and the music is idiosyncratic and sheer perfection.
Of course, all these attributes inevitably limit the film's audience. I imagine that showings outside the big coastal cities of the US will be less than enthusiastically welcomed but that's a very small and unavoidable price to pay. If you got past third grade and have an IQ in triple digits, buy a ticket now.
A footnote for those who gave the movie a poor or worse rating: because you lack the education, breadth of vision or humanity to understand what's really a very simple story, don't blame the film, the actors or the filmmaker. Look to yourself. Recognize this opportunity to become a fuller, more complete human being. Learn to read."

Rachel Weisz embodies her character so well and performed so well that I was internally begging her to come back on screen the moment she was off it.<br/><br/>Watching Olivia Colman as Queen Anne felt like I was having a psychotic breakdown one hundred times over- in the best way possible. Queen Anne- er, I mean Olivia Colman, was her character through and through. She masterfully painted a tormented portrait of a psycho Queen who had no business ruling but did anyway.

"frienderman","10","10","27","27 December 2018"," Opulent savagery and wicked fun
","Yorgos Lanthimos is the very definition of chaotic good. His films are disturbing, shockingly violent, outrageously humorous and eerily allegorical to ongoing political and socioeconomic turmoil. His most recent film, The Favourite, is no exception.<br/><br/>The Favourite tells the tale of Queen Anne, the early 18th century monarch of England at a time ravaged by war, and her wavering relationships between Lady Sarah and Abigail as they fight to win over her affection and favor.<br/><br/>I remember reading a quote from someone that said Lanthimos' films are very akin to a horrific car accident: ""you can't avert your eyes from it."" While The Favourite is surely no exception, it differs from the rest of Lanthimos' filmography in that, while there is still a sense of outrageousness and frivolous absurdity, there is an obvious metaphor at the core of the story.<br/><br/>The film is about power, specificially amongst women during a period in history known for the achievements of men. Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) acts as the queen's consultant and closest friend, a relationship that is put into trial when Abigail (Emma Stone), a young woman whose family has fallen on hard times, attempts to work her way up the political ladder. The entire duration of the film shows these women manipulating, deceiving, and brutally brawling with each other to win the affections of the queen but they both have different reasons for it. Abigail, who is rebuilding herself after being gambled away by her father, wants to be on top because she understands what it's like to have nothing. Lady Sarah wants to maintain her loving relationship with the queen, but also wants to continue to play with the big dogs in the court.<br/><br/>The film cleverly outlines how out-of-the-loop the queen was in terms of the ongoing politics of the country. ""The war is over. We won,"" she contends to Lady Sarah after awarding her her own palace. ""Oh, but it is not over. We must continue,"" Sarah responds with a sense of determination. ""Oh. Oh, I did not know that."" And the film follows through with this on just about every issue. It's certainly not entirely the queen's fault, however. She was ailing with physical and emotional pain, and was known to be despondent and unstable. Olivia Colman's portrayal of the decrepitude queen is masterfully commanding and darkly comedic; she perfectly captures the spirit and troubled soul of Anne. The two contending women, Sarah and Abigail, are portrayed by their respective actresses in a hilarious and horrifying way. We lose ourselves in their battle of the wits and not once does the film ever stop to justify their actions as having the best intentions. Nor does it ever try to paint them in glorified canvas. These are simply terrible, power-hungry people who will stop at no means to obtain or maintain their statuses. This is achieved by the excellent screenplay.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the most finely-tuned script that Lanthimos has adapted into film; it is also the first that he did not have a hand in writing (Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara are to blame for this slanderous entertainment). But, I think his attention and pertinence to a story he did not write pays off incredibly well because the end result is a film so ravished by opulent savagery and decadent deliciousness that it is endlessly fun and shocking at every turn.
Another thing that I found interesting was the direction. Yorgo Lanthimos has never really experimented with the camera on his previous films; sure, he's done a lot with negative space in his shots and the drab, neutral coloring of the cinematography has always worked in his favor. Here, he gives us a glimpse of a classical time through the eyes of the beholder.<br/><br/>The use of fish-eye lenses in certain shots are jarring and grab your attention, and they do so to show us just how overtly glamorous everything is. The immensity of the palace is compressed into this tight, claustrophobic space within the lens as a sort-of metaphor for how the excessive extravagance substitutes the vacancies at the core of the royalty. Love is not truly felt, but the allure of power is.<br/><br/>The Favourite is easily Lanthimos' best film to date. It is hilarious, gorgeous, and disturbingly exhilarating. Every turn is unknown and unpredictable in a way that only Lanthimos can fully capture. The Favourite will surely be a favo(u)rite for the year."

Sorry fellow Greek, you are obviously a great director, but this one was a big zero. I may be ignorant since i cannot understand the reason behind the big numbers of the critics, but i regret i saw it.

","This is a truly awful film. It is saved in part, by the acting of Olivia Coleman, but is otherwise a vacuous, pretentious film masquerading as a highbrow, thought provoking story. It fails on all fronts - the story is weak and the humour falls flat. It is difficult to empathise with any of the main characters, as they all turn out to be fairly unpleasant, and we are left not really caring what happens to any of them. I left the cinema with a real feeling of emptiness, and wondering why I had spent money to go and see it. Not my favourite."

This is sad for the critics of the movies but also goo because people will talk about the movie.
The characters of the movies a well defined and surprising in the way they change, the atmosphere is very tight and matches perfectly, and these 3 actresses were just great. Emma Stone never acted better before and convinced me into seeing her as a real artistic actress who can do much more than I thought she could.

Many people may disagree but i see many people do agree.

"torrascotia","6","4","8","9 January 2019"," Entertaining, if crude, period drama with a very weak ending.
","Fans of period dramas will be split on this movie. For many period dramas are a genteel affair which provide an escape from many of the trappings of modern movies such a explicit sex, violence and swearing. This point was brought home when I attended a screening of the favourite and noticed just how many of the audience were elderly women, keen on seeing what all the fuss was about with The Favourite.
It was clear that many were shocked by this movie as it is fairly sexually explicit and the use of course language is rife throughout. This is no BBC production.
The story itself concerns a power struggle between two cousins who try and outdo each other using any many underhand means as possible to gain favour with the Queen and become her favourite.
This is a very engaging movie for the most part however the ending just seems to happen without any real conclusions, its as if the final reel has gone missing and it is a major disappointment. More so because the story seemed to be coming to a head and then........... just nothing.
The cinematography however is stunning and so many scenes look like a painting come to life.
This is a modern slant on a period drama with explicit sex scenes, very vulgar language and cruel humour so be warned, if that is not your thing then The Favourite is not for you.
If however you enjoy great visuals and dialogue similar to that spouted on The Thick of It by Malcolm Tucker then you may find this to your taste. Do not however blame me for how you react to the ending as you have been warned!"
"crownofsprats","7","4","8","5 January 2019"," A rebuttal to all the negative reviews
","How do people rate films? (To say nothing of criticism, because a two-line review that says ""I was bored"" or ""I hated it"" does not qualify as such, plain and simple.)<br/><br/>Most of it comes down to expectation vs perceived reality. Here, some reviewers were clearly expecting a ""vehicle for Emma Stone's acting talents"" or a ""British period piece"" or a ""comedy with bits of thriller thrown in"".<br/><br/>Fools! Squares! This is a Yorgos Lanthimos film, first and foremost. If you have no prior knowledge of what that means (and are not a fan of bizarre, offbeat, off-color cinema), you will probably be baffled, repulsed, or bored. You will clearly miss out on a nuanced and engaging study of character and a darkly comic power struggle. And of course, it wouldn't be a Yorgos film if it didn't try to get at the nature of what love is and what it means to love someone by showing love through a prism of toxicity and garishness.<br/><br/>Here's a sampling of some of the specific complaints I read about here:<br/><br/><ul><li>""The movie is weird."" That's your problem for expecting something that's not weird. To reiterate, this is a Yorgos film. It's going to be weird, unsettling, and even kind of icky. I suggest you watch one of his other films before venturing to the theater to see if his style is a good fit for you. And no, it's not weird for the sake of weirdness, and its goal is not to upend British historical period piece tropes - it just tells a different story in its own style.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>""The lead actresses curse too much."" I guess it's supposed to render the film unrealistic for the period or something. Because clearly people here are experts on how British royalty talked in private! (Also, see ""it's inauthentic"" below.) Some people were more honest and simply said that they found it distasteful and vulgar, which brings me back to my original point: squares, please stay at home, watch a movie about golfers or binge on Friends or whatever else makes you feel safe and comfortable!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>""I was expecting a comedy."" Unfortunately, promoters of films need to pigeonhole them into some genre. Yorgos films aren't classifiable into genres. No, it's not the kind of film you would laugh out loud at. It's theater of the absurd - which means it's laced with dark humor all throughout - but it's not a comedy. Again, don't expect comedy - expect only Yorgos.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>""There are sex scenes - how gratuitous and gross!"" This one makes me angry the most. Not to spoil anything, but sex plays a central role in this narrative. Without the sex, there would be no story. If you don't get the point of the sex, you'll never understand the ending. For the record, the sex scenes are tame, matter-of-fact, and not at all graphic or gratuitous. There is nothing titillating or even glamorous about them. It's hard to fathom that in this day and age there are still enough prudes out there that would be put off by such things.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>""The soundtrack is annoying."" The soundtrack actually does a great job at complementing what's happening in the film, humbly serving its purpose in the background. It could have been way more atonal and intrusive. Broaden your musical horizons.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>""It's inauthentic to the period."" It's not supposed to be an authentic period piece - it's a character study. And actually, as far as authenticity goes, it probably does a better job at nailing what life was really like than a lot of other so-called ""period dramas"".</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>""I hated/didn't get the ending."" Again, your fault for not paying attention and dozing off during the film. No, it's not the best ending ever, but it makes perfect sense if you understand what the film is actually about. To be honest, I knocked one star off because I felt like it could have been a bit stronger. But it doesn't ruin the rest of the film, and everything that needs to be explained is already explained by that point.</li></ul><br/><br/>Anyway, to sum up: squares won't get this and will criticize it for being bizarre and vulgar. So if you're one of those people, don't watch it, plain and simple. Otherwise, enjoy another Yorgos film - which also happens to have lavish costumes and award-worthy acting."

Some of it was so over the top and just not plausible, for example, a sevant girl has access to a horse to go horseback riding. Huh? Or how about that imagined dance between Rachel Weiz's character and some lothario where he whirls and swings her almost around his head. Never would that have happened. I remember reading Madame Bovary and the scandal in the then 19th century was the waltz because when the women turned, their ankles would be shown, a big no, no. But here in the 1600's we have the stupidity of Wiesz's dress go almost over her head. And of course, there is the excessive make up of the courtiers surrounding the queen who look like puppet dolls. I couldn't stomach any more of this nonsense."
"s-maniatopoulos","9","6","14","17 February 2019"," Direction Masterclass
","Ever since ""Dogtooth"" Lanthimos has steadily been creating cinematic experiences which seem exceptionally innovative, highly provocative and extremely interesting. Until now, however, his somewhat minimalist preferences, coupled with his Orwellian scripts, seemed to limit his direction to cold, impersonal scenes, that were more suggestive of what was missing rather than what was being shown on screen. Ironically, this feeling was perfectly captured on the movie poster of the Lobster, depicting a man hugging a empty space in the shape of a human.
Until now.
Leaving behind his close scriptwriter and collaborator, mr Fillipou, and working on a period piece instead of a sci-fi allegory, Lanthimos the director has decided to show up -probably for the first time- and to prove that his work of genius is not reliant upon his usual themes: in the Favourite, he creates a claustrophobic movie, set inside a vast palace of breathtaking beauty and natural colors, constructed by a symphony of magnificent shots. The camera work in this movie is for the ages. The cinematography is as bold (if not bolder) than Barry Lyndon. The actors deliver top performances with a ""scent"" of Lanthimos's usual impersonal flair. And the music is an integral part of the overall experience.
This is a master class in film direction.
Lanthimos is precise, to the point, daring, innovative, and extremely consistent in every scene.
With the exception of the (deliberate?) vagueness of the last shot, which deviates from the Kubrickian accuracy of all other scenes, this movie is exceptional, to say the least.
It deserves all the praise it gets.
It elevates Lanthimos to the status of one of the great directors of our time, with a vision of pure cinematic genius.
And it delivers a passionate story, told in a way that can only be said by a cast and crew of exceptional artists, all of them in perfect sync and at the top of their game.
This is almost certainly the best period movie since Amadeus, and possibly the most beautifully directed period movie since Barry Lyndon.
In my humble opinion, this is without any doubt not only the best directed movie of the year, but also one of the best directed movies of the 21st century."
"SvetoslavGrigorov","10","6","14","10 January 2019"," Female apocalypse!
","In a year like 2018, in which the cinema has produced tons of rubbish, a film that I saw yesterday has appeared and refuted the saying that there is nothing new under the sun .<br/><br/>Presumably, historical dramas and biographies are always inflated and overburdened with surpluses that I have always tried to escape.
It is incredibly rare for a film to be as accessible and honest as it is in the case with The Favourite. I remember two other similar movies that attracted me over the years and left a trace in my personal notebook, Orlando (1992) and Marie Antoinette (2006). They played with naturalism without exaggerating with unnecessary details in the historical context. Of course, along with The Favourite, they are all delving into another different surface, which we will be talking about in this review.<br/><br/>So let's focus on the film by George Lanthimos, who has so far become known for The Killing of the Sacred Deer (2017) and The Lobster (2015). The story is quite simple but multi-layered. Lesbian-queen with unpredictable temper (Olivia Colman) has a mistress Lady Sara (Rachel Wise) who actually manages the court and state affairs at moments when the queen is incapable of doing so. As we notice these moments are way too many because the queen is almost absent from being a head of state. Abigail (Emma Stone), Lady Sara's cousin, appears in the court trying to regain her lost title and reputation. She uses every single chance to win the Queen on her side.<br/><br/>The film is divided into eight parts, each of which contains a quotation from the subsequent dialogue.<br/><br/>There is something extremely introvert in the movie, despite the use of a fisheye lens and the incredible shooting angles. Olivia Colman gives Queen Anna maximum human dimensions. Here she stands in front of us without makeup, mask, grounded and exposed to godlessness. This is a woman without a desire for life, suffering from bulimia, gout, and the only thing that keeps her alive are the rabbits and her lover's company.<br/><br/>Abigail gradually pushes away her cousin from the favourite's throne , settling herself closely to Anna and then marries Lord Samuel Marsham, rewarding her with the needed honor and cementing her reputation.<br/><br/>The Favourite is a female apocalypse, a female kingdom and a female matrix in which men are only present as small figurines. This is a crazy but real story in which everyone is using each other. The genre is difficult to define because the pendulum sways between black comedy, love story, historical drama, and a thriller game of cat and mouse. All these segments are totally deconstructed and sent to you, so that you can then assemble them personally in your own head. That's why I like such films because there are no solutions here, but there is an eccentric, inspirational and dimensional vision in a tragicomedy. Tragicomedy is a genre that stretches the action from all possible angles of psychology, and gives the context a certainty and credibility.
Each character at one time is duplicitous, but faithful, manipulative, but also trusting. Visual aesthetics extracts Baroque and renders it on the screen, inhabiting it with animalistic and raw characters. The dialogue is brutal. C.nt and f.ck are widely used and this is only a plus for the film, because the human history is shown without idealisation and romanticising.<br/><br/>The incredible soundtrack with lots of Bach and Handel, and as well modern experimental compositions of Messiaen and Ferrari, filters and dozes the splendour and glamour, and that's what, of course, every real movie needs.<br/><br/>Costumes, and oh, surprise but! the incredibly English accent of Emma Stone (who is from Massachusetts) is raising the bar high (even) over Hollywood level, and that (for sure) will be noticed and generously rewarded by the Academy.<br/><br/>I have read a lot of criticism of how the film is missing an end. Nothing like that!No one needs an end, only modestly shaped souls, which necessarily require an explanation of a historical fiction so that they can fall asleep quietly. In this line of thoughts, the film is not at all calm and quiet and will remain forever in you. Precisely with this open end."

I don't to say anything about the film and I also wouldn't recommend you to watch the trailers, knowing nothing about the central plot makes you enjoy the film more. Firstly. the performances were terrific especially from Emma Stone, who delivers her finest performance yet. The production design, makeup and costumes were like they were straight out of the 18th century and you would forget about our current world. Robbie Ryan has done a great work as the DP and his close-ups were very impressive. Shooting the movie on film stock was the right decision.

I thought the three female lead performances were absolutely brilliant, the cinematography, costumes, soundtrack, locations, script and directing were all first class. From start to finish I found it original, funny, and also, at times, quite sad. The interplay between the two protagonists was beautifully played.
I know we can't all like the same things but I genuinely don't get the amount of vitriol that has been poured into some of the negative reviews on here.

"jon.h.ochiai","8","6","14","18 December 2018"," The Favourite: 'It's all about me!'
","Set in 18th century England, Director Yorgos Lanthimos's ""The Favourite"" stars Emma Stone as maid Abigail and Rachel Weisz as Lady Sarah, who both serve Queen Anne, played by amazing Olivia Colman. In ""The Favourite"" Abigail and Sarah contest to be Anne's 'favourite' in more than conventional distinctions.<br/><br/>Rachel's Sarah is Lady Marlborough, whose husband leads the English military campaign against the French. The physically unattractive self-aware Queen suffers from gout and associated maladies; thus, rendering Sarah as her renegade proxy. The Machiavellian Sarah instructs Anne to double the taxes to finance the War effort to support her husband, ending the War, and bringing him home.<br/><br/>Pretty young Abigail, played by Emma, arrives on the scene reunited with her cousin Sarah, played by Rachel. Abigail was from a noble family, but dark financial times beset her Father, who sold her to the older German rival, essentially selling her into sexual slavery. Consequently, Abigail is driven by redemption. She seeks to regain her nobility and stature at any cost. Perhaps, cousin Sarah becomes her leverage point?<br/><br/>Sarah enlists Abigail to tend to the Queen, while she basically manages the affairs of England. The skilled herbalist Abigail soon gains favored status of Anne, played by Olivia. One night while surprisingly educated Abigail reads in Anne's library, she discovers the nature of Sarah's relationship with the Queen. It becomes transparent to Abigail what she must do to become the Queen's ""Favourite"".<br/><br/>Olivia plays Anne with touching wounded loneliness. Her Anne knows that she can get whatever she wants, because she is the Queen. If not for that, hardly anyone would want anything to do with her. Olivia's profound sadness in Anne humanizes the angry beast. She exposes the lightness and darkness in Anne, and in ourselves. Anne is all about herself, as is everyone in Writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara's narrative.<br/><br/>In a defining scene in a local bar, Emma's Abigail confesses, ""I'm on my side!"" The hysterical, yet mostly anguished narrative of ""The Favourite"" is: It's all about me. In Yorgos's tale women rule with power up front and behind the scenes. This is not necessarily the polarized #Metoo narrative either. Yorgos depicts the well of ugliness in society in vast contrast to the stunning visuals of Robbie Ryan's beautiful cinematography. We see Sarah riding her horse on the immaculate English estate. At the same time, Abigail and Sarah scheme to one up the other in gaining the Queen's favors in the palace.<br/><br/>Both Emma and Rachel are inspired. Rachel's Sarah is the regal lioness, who takes no prisoners. However, in her utter humiliation Rachel reveals her humanity in redemption. Emma is brilliant initially enrolling us in the suffering innocent maiden with the tortured soul. Emma subtly transforms Abigail as the gentle eyed ruthless mercenary. For Abigail the ends and the means are the same. In the heartbreaking scene Sarah cries to Anne, ""I never lied to you... That's love."" Perhaps, love is more than just that.<br/><br/>""The Favourite"" might be one of the best movies of the year. Yet, I wasn't on anyone's ""side"" in ""The Favourite"". Everyone in the movie is all about themselves. I suppose that's Yorgos, Deborah and Tony's point. ""The Favourite"" is hysterical with its clever banter of classism and sexism. Yet, ultimately it is all very sad. Everyone uses someone else. And so goes the world of ""The Favourite"". ""The Favourite"" is a great movie, although not my favorite. Let's put it this way: I won't be seeing it again."
"ferguson-6","8","6","14","30 November 2018"," Yorgos and 3 great actresses
","Greetings again from the darkness. Our biggest fear was that Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos would one day soften the twisted edge he blessed us with in THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER (2017), THE LOBSTER (2015), and DOGTOOTH (2009). That day may yet arrive, but not today and not with his latest. It's his first time to direct a screenplay he didn't write, which likely explains this being his most accessible film - though labeling it ""mainstream"" would be a huge stretch. So brace yourself for an unusual and odd costume period piece unlike anything you've seen before.<br/><br/>Co-writers Deborah Davis (her first screenplay) and Tony McNamara (TV background) deliver biting dialogue and treacherous situations, and benefit from three staggeringly terrific lead actress performances. Olivia Colman stars as Queen Anne, Rachel Weisz as Lady Sarah Churchill, and Emma Stone is Abigail. The three combine for one of the strangest and most convoluted love triangles and power struggles in history.<br/><br/>It's very early 18th century and Britain is at war with France. Queen Anne is frail and in ill health due to severe gout and who knows how many other ailments. Her erratic behavior and quick temper convey childlike behavior from an adult body with a crown. Lady Sarah (Winston's great-great grandmother, if I've calculated correctly) has strategically become the Queen's trusted political advisor and often governs in her stead, while also sharing moments of intimacy. Sarah pulls no punches and certainly doesn't subscribe to the 'kill 'em with kindness' approach, and instead frequently insults the Queen to her face. When Sarah's cousin Abigail appears after her family's fall from grace (her father lost her in a card game), Sarah takes pity on her due to Sarah's fondness of Abigail's father during her childhood.<br/><br/>Abigail's naivety and kindness soon win over the Queen's affections. Is her sweetness an act? Is it due to ambition or desperation ... is there even a difference here? We soon learn Abigail treats conniving as a profession - she views it as her only path back to respectability, and she's willing to take on many acts lacking in respectability to charm her way into the inner sanctum. We are plopped into the wicked fun, delicious cat-fighting, strategic backstabbing and crafty political and personal maneuverings ... right up until the story turns to vicious bleak darkness in the final act.<br/><br/>It's fascinating to watch three women hold the power during this era, as the noblemen are relegated to constantly playing catch-up (kind of like the real world) and struggling to figure out the rules of the game. Power struggles abound, as do director Lanthimos stylistic touches. Noblemen played by Nicholas Hoult and Joe Alwyn are frequently dressed in frilly costumes, giant wigs and heavy make-up - quite the contrast to what we typically see in these period pieces. Other Lanthimos touches include royal duck races, pet bunnies representing deceased children, and fisheye lenses used from every conceivable angle.<br/><br/>Ms. Colman and Ms. Weisz were both in THE LOBSTER, and both have a knack for the Lanthimos style, and Ms. Stone surprisingly is also a natural with the twisted, vicious material. Each of the actresses have an extended close-up allowing them to show-off their immense and subtle talent ... Ms. Colman's is especially impactful. Extreme profanity (numerous c-words and f-words) is at times startling and effective, and the music is unique and diverse - as we would expect. As an added bonus, it requires little imagination to connect the dots to our contemporary political state, although that approach would likely stifle one's enjoyment of the film. Mr. Lanthimos has quickly reached the 'must-see' list of directors, with a guarantee that we are going to see something unusual and interesting. It's one of the year's best, even if it's not for everyone."

"rabbit-26960","9","5","11","10 February 2019"," Hate it as you will, I'm happy on the other side of the fence
","I almost never write film reviews, but after seeing the incredible spitting waves of feelings on this movie, I felt compelled to chip in.<br/><br/>The Favourite is a dark, exquisite, disturbingly humorous, and humorously disturbing work of arts. The use of fish-eye lens, the stilted and close-up shots all lend a beautifully haunting and comical quality to the movie, enriching its satires. The music is absolutely brilliant and is one of my favourite things about this film (it's surprising that the music is actually the very thing that grates on many other viewers). The repeated notes and passages of bleak, haunting melody so excellently accentuates the tone of the film, and I believe without this superb score, the film would not be nearly as successful in its deliverance. The extravagance is made possible by the gorgeously lavish set designing and costumes, another of my favourite things about this film.<br/><br/>Yet, we do not forget the true stars of the film, the triumvirate whose wicked performances are the deciding factor to the success of the film - Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone. It is simply impossible to pick between the three as to who is the true star of the film, for they all fulfill their assignments so perfectly. My personal star of the show would be Colman. In her close-up shots, you can see and feel the subtlest outbreak of emotions, be it an uncontrollable paroxysms or a silent, ominous realisation. Weisz and Stone, as well, also achieve this themselves and deserve as much admiration for their acting.<br/><br/>The ending might come as a disappointment to many audience, though to me it is a most appropriate and perfect climax. The ending caps this entire piece of dark comedy in a bleak, hopeless cloak, leaving its characters no way out. This film shows the twisted desires of humans, for power, for safety, for love. The more you think of ending, the more you see how perfect, how right it is for the film.<br/><br/>I can totally see why The Favourite is too ""weird"" to be well-received by half the audience out there. I myself also thought this film is extremely bizarre and can thus elude many's taste. However as the film expanded itself, I gradually came to appreciate - and even like - its weirdness. Lanthimos set the bar high with The Lobster, and yet The Favourite, to me, live up to it, that speak volumes about this movie. Go watch it, and see for yourself which side of the fence you are on."
"adam-m-fontenot","10","5","11","13 January 2019"," Another winner from Yorgos Lanthimos
","I've seen most of Yorgos Lanthimos's previous films, and not only is The Favourite one of his best, it's also one of his most accessible. As with much of his previous work, it features defective relationships as a central theme. This time, however, the conflict isn't buried in layers of symbolism or allegorical sci-fi; it's immediately apparent. I think this greatly benefits the film, as it helps to channel a complex network of issues into a simple story structure.<br/><br/>In The Favourite, the most prominent defect of the depicted relationships is their imbalance of power. Abigail (Emma Stone) faces the court of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) as an untitled servant, the court's preying men as an unmarried woman, and her cousin Sarah (Rachel Weisz) as the disgraced daughter of the family drunk. The film asks us to what lengths such a woman must go to defend herself and improve her station, as Abigail is determined to do.<br/><br/>Abigail is a careful observer of the court's internal politics, and quickly learns how to take advantage. Early in the film she expresses surprise that anyone would suspect her of betrayal, but she soon realizes that loyalty has no place at court. The external political circumstances - a war with France and its prosecution - are significant to the court participants only as symbolic wins and losses as they jockey for power and prestige. In this conflict even honesty does not signify love and loyalty, instead doubling a weapon for bullying. Abigail's participation in this wrangling, though it sullies her and her relationships, works in the film because she is vulnerable. A moment of weakness would result in further harm.<br/><br/>This exploration of the effects of power is triumphantly executed with Lanthimos's signature dark humor, and bolstered by a magnificant performance from Emma Stone. Excellent work is turned in by Weisz and Colman as well. This very funny film is a must-see, and because of its accessilibility it makes a great introduction to Lanthimos. Possibly the only complaint I have is that it feels a bit long; I suspect most criticism, however, will come from those expecting a high-society drama played fairly straight. Instead we have this uproarious romp of a film that manages to ask a number of serious questions along the way."
"isaacj02","9","5","11","6 January 2019"," A darkly humorous spin on the period drama
","With Olivia Colman set to follow on from Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth in the third season of The Crown, it seems a satisfying coincidence that Yorgos Lanthimos' latest film The Favourite sees the actress take on the role of another monarch. The Crown may be the dictionary definition of period drama, but The Favourite is a very different affair, a tantalising twist on what often promises to be a dull sub-genre.
Here, Colman stars as Anne, the last Stuart queen ""stalked by tragedy"", ravaged by gout and depression, with her pet rabbits her only solace. She has passed on the keys of power to her closest confidant and secret lover, Lady Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), but all is turned on its head with the arrival of Abigail Hill (Emma Stone) a once noblewoman whose family has fallen on hard times. As Abigail surprisingly gains the favour of the Queen, so begins a ruthless battle that plays out before our eyes in a particularly captivating power struggle between the three women.
The Favourite is an enthralling film; Lady Sarah and Abigail turn loyalty into an increasingly vicious blood sport, making for a narrative littered with gratifying double-crossing, carnal intensity and stylish brutality, all accompanied by an almost illusionary sense of madness. It can only be defined as a tragicomedy, subtly hilarious yet hiding timely subtext that is delightfully ambiguous. The lines between love and deception are expertly blurred in a film that takes no prisoners in its uproarious execution. There is more deliberation in the overblown final act, however, that feels lengthy and distinctly less focused than the rest of the film.
The movie finds its greatest strength in its stellar cast, led by Colman, Stone and Weisz. Colman is outstanding as Anne, hilariously petulant and childlike, reminiscent of Miranda Richardson's Queenie in Blackadder. There's a blunt imperiousness to Colman's performance that carries the film through with black humour. Beyond this, however, the scenes of greatest emotional resonance are those that show the more tragic side of Anne, as a woman who has lost seventeen children (""Some were born in blood, some without breath and some were with me a very brief time"") and has never recovered from the trauma. Colman breezes through these harsher scenes that cut surprisingly deep and help to give the film a greater purpose.
Rachel Weisz is the epitome of calculated steeliness as Lady Sarah and Emma Stone is pitch perfect in her first period role as the opportunistic and marvellously Machiavellian Abigail. Nicholas Hoult's flamboyant Leader of the Opposition leads several foppish male roles, but these lie clearly in the peripheral; Yorgos Lanthimos makes apparent that the film's sole focus is its women, all of whom are callous, yet vulnerable, but all quite brilliant in different ways.
The Favourite is beautifully designed, lavish costumes by Sandy Powell and a regal set giving the film all the expected grandeur of a period drama. The film's more salacious side, however, is shown in Robbie Ryan's absurdist cinematography which, whilst occasionally pretentious, gives a haunting contemporary spin. I was less of a fan of the wide-angled bend shots, as well as the film's soundtrack (from Handel to the itchy modernism of Anna Meredith), which felt invasive and ceaseless.
Here, Yorgos Lanthimos has struck a fine chord. The Favourite is a wonderfully unusual and unsettling film that is at points gratuitous, but generally audacious and exciting. Spellbinding performances and an intriguing story make this not one to miss out on."

All of the lead female performances are great and it's hard to pinpoint just one for praise. I only wish the ending had been better.

"ilovesaturdays","6","2","3","17 April 2020"," But where have all the men gone?
","The movie started with a lot of promise & for a while I felt like I could really sink my teeth into it. The concept of three strong actresses playing three strong characters was quite good and all the actresses played off each other quite well.<br/><br/>My problem was with the fact that Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark, with whom she's said to have had a good relationship, doesn't figure in the film at all! There's taking creative license and then there's removing an important character altogether just to make it a novelty by having literally an all-female cast. Sarah's husband was shown for maybe 5 minutes in the movie but on account of his being at war, he could be easily dismissed as a minor character. Same for Abigail's husband, who also didn't merit too much screen time. But Anne's husband should have been retained and there's no excuse for that. In fact, his death & Anne's grief over it, is known to have soured the already strained relationship between her and Sarah. It's good to know that women are being given due recognition in movies but we need not remove men to do that!<br/><br/>I realize that this creative license taking isn't the first one and definitely wouldn't be the last. But, if you are taking so much liberty with history, why use the names of real people? I think that perhaps it's simply because they can't sue for defamation on account of being dead! If the creators had used fictitious characters, then the intimate relationships shown between the women would've been much easily accepted without raising concerns over their authenticity. The audience deserve much more honesty from their movie makers & other artists in general. The creators should have had more faith in their own creation instead of hijacking other people's story & manipulating it every which way. After all, it is a good story & might've worked better with fictitious characters. Unfortunately, now we'll never know!<br/><br/>My other problem was with the use of gratuitous profanity, for example, with the tomato throwing scene and also the scene where the recovering Sarah wakes up in the brothel. There are other examples too, but I think I've made my point.<br/><br/>I liked the last scene though. Abigail is seen catering to Anne's needs in a subservient & degrading manner. This brought to mind the scene where Sarah asks Abigail if she thinks she has won & she responds that she has. And in yet another scene, Abigail says that she's doing it all to avoid a degrading life. So, in that context, the last scene doesn't look like Abigail has won or that her life isn't degrading anymore, only she's taking it from the queen herself & not a nobody! The way I see it, it was Sarah who won because she wasn't subservient before & didn't have to be so later too. She led a much freer life!<br/><br/>Watch it if only for the amazing actresses!"
"criti-cally","8","2","3","3 April 2020"," Funny, smart, dark, irreverent, cruel and immoral - this movie is everything but still none of them. {criti-cally reviews}
","The favorite is director Yorgos Lanthimos seventh film, and a good one too. It's one of those masterpieces that people either love or hate, there's no in-between, and looking at the reviews on IMDB, you can clearly this movie for it is. A Masterpiece.<br/><br/>This is a merciless satire about a love triangle set in British Monarchy times, with everything else (class, gender, love, lust, duty, loyalty, partisan politics, patriarchal hegemony, and women behaving appallingly just like men) just the background noise against which that triangle plays out.
It is the story of the largely forgotten British monarch Queen Anne (played by Olivia Colman in an Oscar-winning performance), who unfortunately is most remembered today for her frail health and the little interest she had in governing. She would spend most of her time in organizing odd games and playing with her pet rabbits. The country is effectively ruled by Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough (played by Rachel Weisz), who through unrelenting scheming has cemented herself as Queen Anne's advisor and, in moments of need, her lover.
When Sarah's distant cousin Abigail Hill (played by Emma Stone), washes up on the shores of the grand palace she lives in with the Queen, her crippling insecurity convinces her to take Abigail down, lest her position be threatened.
Abigail, who belongs to a lower class than Sarah, is initially forced to work as a scullery maid, but soon begins to make inroads into the Queen's inner circle. She begins by showing the Queen kindness, because that is what Anne seems to be yearning for the most. But later, she sacrifices her body in her pursuit of power.
The ending, while an ambiguous one, symbolizes the Queen's loneliness and struggle for control, as that final shot of Abigail rubbing her leg fades into rabbits. The first half is very, very funny, and the end is very, very dark, with the last shot one of the most haunting images one can see.<br/><br/>The film's most salient theme, is the dynamic of gender politics. For starters, It's headlined by three actresses (something which is still rare enough as to be notable), whilst the men are portrayed as petty, vainglorious idiots. It truly doesn't think much of its men and it allows the guys to make a fool of themselves - which is something you can always count on. Men, in general, are background players, existing only to be mocked, exploited, and duped - with their ridiculous wigs and heavy makeup, they exist only to support the women.<br/><br/>Its central female characters do not bear any resemblance to the submissive pushovers that men are more likely to pursue and consequentially, less likely to feel threatened by. The Favourite is in many ways an exploration of this power, and more particularly power in relation to women. While men are more likely to fuel their egos in similar situations, the film seems to suggest that with women, it has more to do with survival. However, what's especially interesting about the film's depiction of gender is that the world of women is anything but a utopia. Yes, it's relatively free of toxic masculinity and the male gaze, but in most other aspects, there's no real difference between the matriarchy and the patriarchy. Sure, the women are much smarter than the men who surround them, but they are no less greedy or cruel. At the film's post-première press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos explained, ""what we tried to do is portray women as human beings. Because of the prevalent male gaze in cinema, women are portrayed as housewives, girlfriends...Our small contribution is we're just trying to show them as complex and wonderful and horrific as they are, like other human beings."" Similarly, when asked by the Hollywood Reporter if a film about females treating each other badly might be considered a setback in a post #MeToo era, Colman explained, ""How can it set women back to prove that women fart and vomit and hate and love and do all the things men do? All human beings are the same. We're all multifaceted, many-layered, disgusting and gorgeous and powerful and weak and filthy and brilliant. That's what's nice. It doesn't make women an old-fashioned thing of delicacy.""<br/><br/>The script is phenomenal and treats the characters very consistently but never one-dimensionally, by clearly showing their motivations but also portraying them realistically as humans. The humor and the satire really works, from the absurdist touches like the duck races to the funny and witty dialogues, like when Sarah tells the Queen she looks like a badger and the Queen agrees. The comradery and rivalry between Emma Stone's character and Rachel Weisz's character-both who, gave the most dexterous performances of this entire year-was just too much fun to take in. The atmospherical tone of this movie also something that can easily win one over. It reputed like an old-fashioned, 1-on-1, battle of the minds movie, just with touches of Lanthimos's typical synthetic stylizations. It's the cherry on the top of this shrewd satire.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, there really are no words to describe just how good Colman is. Utterly inhabiting the character, she is able to elicit empathy mere moments after behaving thoroughly shamefully, communicating a sense of both tragic inevitability and a childlike refusal to accept reality. The character could easily have been a grotesque villain or a pitiful broken shell, but Colman finds a nobler middle ground, straddling both interpretations without fully committing to either, moving from one to the other seamlessly throughout the film. Yes, she can be a horrible person with appalling manners and questionable hygiene, but she is also deeply lonely, a survivor who has lost 17 children in childbirth, a woman whose health has made her old before her time, a tragic figure too naïve to see how badly she is being manipulated by Sarah and Abigail. Rather than trying to downplay the contradictory facets of the character, Colman leans into them, illuminating Anne's humanity amongst her least appealing characteristics, and finding both wit and pathos in a character whose mercurial nature and excessive neediness could easily have rendered her the film's antagonist. It truly is one of the finest on-screen performances in a long time.<br/><br/>As one would expect from Lanthimos, the film is aesthetically flawless, with many of the compositions having the appearance of a fête galante painting, so meticulously integrated are Sandy Powell's costume design, Fiona Crombie's production design, and Robbie Ryan's cinematography. Powell's costumes are historically inaccurate, but thematically revealing, with the situation of the characters at any given moment directly influencing the design, especially in relation to Abigail as she climbs the social ladder. While Abigail's transformation from maid to confidante has an element of nouveau riche tackiness, Sarah is dressed mostly in dark, masculine hues; almost like combat gear, which makes sense for a character that always seems to think she's on a battleground. Anne, meanwhile, is like an overgrown child whose clothes are still picked out by her parents. The black-and-white color scheme of much of the wardrobe contrasts magnificently with Crombie's predominantly brown production design, with the actors effortlessly standing out from the backgrounds.<br/><br/>Of Ryan's photography, perhaps the most impressive feat is that, despite the many scenes tracking characters through rooms, up stairs, and out doorways, there's not a single Steadicam shot anywhere in the film. He also makes copious use of 6mm fish-eye lenses, which distort the spaces the characters occupy whilst also showing much more of the environment than a normal lens, creating the sense of characters lost within an overload of background visual detail. As with most of Lanthimos' work, the film also uses natural light, which makes for some stunning candle-lit night-time compositions, partially recalling some renaissance paintings.<br/><br/>A savage morality play, a camp comedy of manners, a Baroque tragedy, an allegorical study of the corruptive nature of power - it's all of these and yet none of them. And that is exactly why one should watch it."

When a new servant, Abigail (Stone), arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah.<br/><br/>A critical darling with awards and nominations to match, The Favourite, to me at least, is something of an acquired taste. Firstly it should be noted that as a history lesson it's pure bunkum, so much so I wondered if Lanthimos is actually Mel Gibson. Though to be fair to Lanthimos, he never hid from the fact he and his writers were pretty much making it up for entertainment purpose.<br/><br/>The craft on show is top level, with three high quality lead lady performances giving their all for the director. Lanthimos also has some nifty camera tricks up his sleeve, it's clear that this is a talent to follow for those so inclined to his off kilter type of film making. Helps, too, that the costuming and set designs are also from the top draw. It's hard to fault from a production standpoint.<br/><br/>Narratively the pic is pulsing with parliamentary politics that blends with royal shenanigans. Yet ultimately the prime concern is about the battle for Queen Anne's soul between Sarah and Abigail. This consistently remains fascinating, even as Lanthimos continues to sex things up and pitches black comedy alongside the tragic thrum at the core.<br/><br/>It's an odd mix of a film that I personally don't think works as a whole, and with the finale a crushing disappointment, it leaves one in awe and yet also unsatisfied. 7/10"

"jamiedarlow-37510","4","2","3","29 February 2020"," Uncomfortable and a bit boring despite its talent
","The script for this star-studded period comedy-drama has been in circulation since the late 90s and has finally been greenlit with writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara and Director Yorgos Lanthimos. The setting is early 18th Century England (filmed at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire!) Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is in rule and assisted by her close friend and confidante Sarah (Rachel Weisz). A new servant arrives, Abigail (Emma Stone), who starts to work up the ranks and gain the trust of Queen Anne. And so begins a dangerous rivalry. This is the third film I have seen by Lanthimos and both films previously were completely different sides of the spectrum for me. I really didn't like Dogtooth; although it was an interesting premise, I found its rough edges to be too rough and isolating which I guess is the point of the film but not for me. On the other hand, I absolutely loved The Lobster which was a genuinely brilliant, funny yet darkly savage look at a dystopian future. The Favourite leans more towards the former for me; it felt strangely uninvolving despite the good performances and I found myself just looking at the screen rather than being engaged as it went on. There are some brilliant moments though particularly thanks to Olivia Colman who is stunningly great as always; the close up camera shots of her are so good, portraying the pathos and sadness of the character of Anne extremely well. Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are also great as ever and have a lot of fun in the roles of consistently trying to outsmart the other. There is a brutal moment involving self-mutilation with a book that reminded me of the most shocking moments in The Lobster. The ending frames are also hauntingly amazing; edited beautifully by Yorgos Mavropsaridis! Lanthimos is a master of uncomfortable atmosphere and brooding darkness which can go either way; in the case of The Favourite it's a bit of a mixed bag. When it works particularly during the eerily quiet moments, it's really good but when it's uncomfortably bizarre which is the majority of the time it's a bit of a numb watch"

Her cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives looking for a job after her family had fallen in status. Sarah looks down upon her and sends her to be a maid. She is being whipped when Sarah suddenly needs her to alleviates the Queen's gout pains. Leader of the opposition, Mr. Harley (Nicholas Hoult), is pushing for an immediate peace treaty while Sarah uses her power over the Queen to raise taxes to continue the war led by her husband at the front.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful competition of female relationships. It is deliciously passive-aggressive. All three performances are amazing. The visual style is impeccable. It is a movie of singular vision and great actors."

","One of the very few pieces of media to not obsessively and leeringly display alternate sexualities The Favourite apparently in line with the films of Lanthimos does have moments of the wildly surreal and shocking but still, and impressively so manages to maintain a foot in reality at the same time. The love triangle of Stone, Weisz and Coleman is one of the most believable and interesting ever put to screen with others usually being soap opera-esque filler that fail to engage. The cast are outstanding and personally it's clear to see why Coleman enjoyed such success as her role was genuinely so moving and powerful its remarkable. The story is masterfully created remaining at all time moving and engaging and does a fine job at balancing the multiple tones of that are required to get across this complicated love story. One of the greatest of the year"

","I went into the favorite thinking that it was going to be the same old typical boring period piece about a queen of England. What I got was shockingly surprising. This wasn't the typical run of the mill bland period piece. The three main actresses were all amazing in the roles that they played. Each character was brilliantly twisted and vile in their own unique way. I was continuously shocked at what was happening to each character. You really can't say more about it without giving too much away. This movie was definitely worth the watch, and I will be going back to check out the other movies that I have missed from this director."
"clanciai","10","2","3","17 August 2019"," The last days of the morbidly wretched Queen Anne and her grotesque court of intriguing favourites of all sexes
","This is a disturbingly unsympathetic film, enterprising a thorough insight into the goings-on at the court of the old dying Queen Anne, totally invalidated and rather potty and wholly at the mercy of wicked favourites who grow the worse the more influence on her they get. There is not one sympathetic person in the plot, unless you try to mobilize some absurd sympathy for the Queen, like all her courtiers and favourites never tire of cultivating a maximum of hypocrisy of affection for her just to keep a finger in the pie. Rachel Weisz carries the burden of the play with magnificent splendour as usual, for once you can see even her truly nasty, she is almost the only man in the context, while Emma Stone starts well to develop more and more into another mummy and dummy like all the others, doing anything just to stick to her situation. There are some notable anachronisms in this otherwise perfectly realistic costume drama of the first decade of the 18th century, like music by Schubert and Schumann and Emma Stone saying ""OK"" and a modern word a number of times, but what perfect palace is completely dustfree? The most difficult part is that of the Queen, impeccably sustained and made totally convincing by Olivia Colman, but all the actors are perfect in their vicious and revolting characters, as is the direction, the cinematography, the composition of the film, in brief, everything - but it's a nasty story, and the more so for being true."

The acting is superb, he has a trademark humor and the setting is clear.

","Although this is an original screenplay, it mimics the tone of a live play so well that it is the most well-done play-like film I have seen. The characters are so interesting, lively, and funny, that the restoration period dialogue and unfamiliar circumstance are easier to digest. The film was shot and edited to maintain the structure of play, with a fishbowl sense and clearly marked acts, but the storyline is tight enough for a film that it doesn't need this imposed structure, although it doesn't do the film harm."

I watched this film about four months ago and still don't remember what exactly I was suppose to take from it."
"tomfeller","5","2","3","9 May 2019"," Entertaining story with historical inaccuracies
","Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) was the last Stuart monarch, but not for want of trying to produce an heir. She had 17 pregnancies, twelve of which ended in either miscarriages or still births. None of her children survived her, and only one lived as long as his 11th birthday. According to the film, she keeps 17 rabbits as pets for some solace, but this was not historically accurate. Another historical inaccuracy is that the film has her husband, Prince George of Denmark, as deceased, although he did not die until a few years after the year the film begins.
The title actually refers to two women: Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), aka the Duchess of Marlboro and Abigail Hill (Emma Stone), later Baroness Masham. The plot is driven by their struggle to be the favourite of the queen and borrows from All About Eve, and it is loosely based on historical events from 1704 to 1711, although it gives the impression that less time passes than it did historically. The movie is quite entertaining, funny, and beautiful to watch, and it was no surprise that it was nominated for Academy Awards in the director, original screenplay, production design, cinematography, and costume design categories. On the other hand, the dialogue is full of anachronisms, and the costumes are not historically accurate.
At the beginning of the film, Great Britain is in the War of the Spanish Succession with France, and their army is led by Sarah's husband, the Duke of Marlborough (Mark Gatiss). Sarah is effectively acting as regent, making policy decisions while attending to the queen's health, both physical and emotional and becoming her lover. She is allied with the Whigs led by Sidney Godolphin (James Smith), who were in favor of the war with France. Abigail, Sarah's cousin and the daughter of an impoverished nobleman, comes to the palace as a servant, but Sarah takes her under her wing. Abigail endears herself to the queen and eventually displaces Sarah as both the queen's favorite and her lover. She becomes allied with the Tories led by Robert Harley (Nicholas Hoult), who were opposed to the war because, not because of the cost in human lives, but because it required higher taxes."

"nikxatz","9","2","3","8 February 2019"," Rabbitholes
","Here it is. The Favourite is probably Yorgos Lanthimos most well-crafted film yet.<br/><br/>Firstly, the 3 actresses were a blast to watch. Olivia Colman does an outsanding job and her performance really makes you understand her character. Rachel Weisz is tough, stiff, cold but caring. Emma Stone is a delight to watch once again. She is cunning like a fox (or should I say a rabbit), passionate , sexy and adds a lot to the movie.<br/><br/>The films looks exceptionally well. The natural lighting, the complex editing, the overall production and the costumes create a a mesmerizing feel and really put you at that time period. As for the fish-eye shots, I kind of liked them. They look incredible when movement is present, but some of them feel a little out of place. But, I like that he is actually trying new things.<br/><br/>The soundtrack... just perfect. It is intense and fits to the film dark, worrying tone.<br/><br/>Well, what about its story?
The Favourite is one the best screenplays ever written. The dialogues are sharp, the way in which the story is developed is so clever and the events that take place are so well thought. Its disturbing tone is apparent , but not as much as in his other films. Oh, and its lots of fun. Hilarious.<br/><br/>Its themes are also interestingly developed. It is open to interpretation like his other films and if I made something out of it it would be that power and fame don't give room for love and care. The queen is form the very start of the film weak and lonely, desperately searching for somebody to truly understand her pain. She lives in her palace with her ""everythings"", but is in lack of connection and sensitivity towards her. Rachel's character cares for her and loves her but the queen does not want that kind of love. And when Emma Stone's character pops out, the queen finds pleasure and love in a lie, a fake love. What is it better, to feel nice even if you know its all a lie or to always feel empty, but having to face the tragic truth? For me, its the second one, but you can make something different out of it.
Also, the rabbits play a huge role and are a key factor to understanding the film.<br/><br/>Overall, The Favourite is one of my favourites. I am Greek and I profound moved that a Greek director has made such excellent films. The Favourite is a haunting, dazzling labyrinth, a dark rabbithole in which you'll keep falling and falling... till you fall in mud.
And you know, mud stinks.<br/><br/>Great

First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Favourite. Watching The Favourite was like reading a book of short stories, you just find yourself absorbed in one scene and then it ends. I think that was possibly the weirdest film I've ever seen and I have no idea if it bore any resemblance to true historical facts, but I found it strangely compelling. Olivia Coleman is a supreme actress and played the part of Queen Anne with a flair that was quite remarkable. I'm not sure if I would watch it again but with a distinct air of disbelief I found myself completely entranced by the shenanigans taking place in the screen. Rachel Weiss was stunning as Lady Sarah and Nicholas Hoult was quite dashing as the foppish Harley, who grew more ridiculous as the film progressed. One thing to note, there were a vast number of wigs in this film, quite large and quite ridiculous, and it makes you wonder how many wigmakers went out of business as fashions changed back in the day. An interesting outing and an odd way to spend a couple of hours."

"nikhilmanahs","8","2","3","24 January 2019"," Old tale told again
","Numerous times the story of a Queen or a lady president or a minister who is emotionally and romantically involved with her mistress is told. And always this relationship leads to the demise of the queen. This time it's no different.
Queen is vulnerable, gullible, needy and depressed, and her mistress knows this and uses it to her advantage. But damned she knows that she will soon be getting the taste of her own medicine. Mistress' maid will be even more shrewd than her, and it won't take much time for the maid to start playing her game. This is what happens.
Though the movie is 2 hours long and never makes you feel bored at any point, but now recalling hardly any surprising twist happens. The strong performances by all three ladies keeps us on the edge of our seats, and constantly tickle our funny bone. The strong background score is what moves the movie forward and lends it a grave sense of realism.
The ending of the movie is quite realistic and sad at the same time. The queen tries to show that she still the queen, but we all know that she has already lost the position and her clock is ticking."

"red_jacket0707","7","2","3","13 January 2019"," Amazing acting and filming. But that ending!!
","I write this review seriously torn. My partner was bored rigid with this film but I was engrossed throughout.<br/><br/>Plot summary: two women vie for the attention of Queen Anne, leading to some underhand tactics.<br/><br/>So, let's just wash over the historical inaccuracies shall we. I'm aware there isn't really much evidence that Queen Anne was attracted to women, but it isn't beyond the realms of possibility, so I can go with that.<br/><br/>The acting is indeed exemplary. All three of the main roles played it with an intensity and they had a real spark. I also thought the supporting cast was superb.<br/><br/>The cinematography was first class. I loved that classic camera pan the director is known for, and it created a quite claustrophobic feel (in a good way) that added to the tension and underhand tactics that the characters were involved in.<br/><br/>The plot - it was intriguing to the point where I actually wanted to learn more about the characters and did some research afterwards, as well as the role of the Whigs in parliament, which I knew little about. It's also completely bonkers. There is a scene where they are throwing oranges at a naked man in a wig for entertainment, and for me this really showed how out of touch these people were with the real world.<br/><br/>Here be spoilers....<br/><br/>What I can't get my head round is the ending. I'm going to say some things that happen so look away now...<br/><br/>So at the end, Emma stone's character has triumphed in usurping Rachel Weisz's role as queen's confidante, but the queen seems torn by this situation. There then follows a scene where she asks her to rub her leg. The queen pulls her hair, there is a suggestion of eroticism but not overtly implied. Then there's this strange juxtaposition of both of their faces looking miserable, and lots of rabbits, which I'm guessing is some nod to how this had added to the queen's sadness (that a part of her leaves with every child, and perhaps this is true now lady Marlborough has left)<br/><br/>I'm totally guessing though, as I found it a really disappointing ending. I can deal with films not wrapping things up in neat little ribbons, but for me this was a bit of a step too far. A frustrating ending for an otherwise excellent film. 7/10"
"ampscrvon","8","2","3","6 January 2019"," Superb Acting
","The three female leads deliver fine performances in this early 18th century costume drama set during the reign of Queen Anne. I enjoyed watching the rivalry of the characters played by Rachel Weisz (Duchess of Marlborough) and Emma Stone (Duchess' cousin) as they vied for the affections of the Queen played by Olivia Colman and the way in which the true nature of Stone's character is gradually revealed. As a student of politics, I enjoyed the power games and the way in which the Queen could be manipulated by her ""favourite"" to allow that person to have major influence over the affairs of state including wars and the choice of Prime Minister. I think some people have approached this film expecting a comedy and have been disappointed. In my opinion, this is definitely not a comedy although there is dark humour throughout much of it. In addition, it seems to me that the film at a pace to suit the times in which it is set; thus, don't expect things to develop too quickly."
"joshbarton15","8","2","3","5 January 2019"," Twisted Pleasures.
","It's safe to say director Yorgos Lanthimos has been pretty hit or miss for me, The Lobster leaving me bored stiff but The Killing of a Sacred Deer leaving me in a trance like state. Both were pretty out-there so I went into The Favourite expecting more of the same and, with Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone as the leads of the film, it's hard not to get a little excited for.<br/><br/>Early 18th century England and a frail Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) sits on the throne. Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz), who runs things in the background, vies for her attention with newcomer Abigail (Emma Stone), in a battle of wits that escalates to the point of no return.<br/><br/>It's an absolute pleasure to watch a trio like Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone bounce off one another in The Favourite, each of them devilishly good in their respective roles. Weisz and Stone in particular revel in their character's battle for the attention of Colman's royal figure. Out of the three, I found myself enjoying Weisz's performance the most however, the beauty of a film like this with as strong performances as these, is that that could easily change with every viewing.<br/><br/>There's some solid support on show in The Favourite as well, Nicholas Hoult's rather pompous Robert Harley proving to be a real snake in the grass if ever I've seen one. Hoult has always been an exciting young talent and working in a film like this will do no harm to his reputation.<br/><br/>Yorgos Lanthimos has ventured in comedy before with The Lobster, with incredibly mixed results that had me very sceptical about this film. What I can say is that, while a few of the jokes went right over my head, there is a lot to enjoy in the screenplay from Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, the wit and venom firing at rapid rates throughout.<br/><br/>With a strong screenplay and a string of fine performances on show, The Favourite is quite an intriguingly fun way to start 2019 at the cinema."
"Pairic","9","2","3","5 January 2019"," Darkly Comical Period Drama
","The Favourite: Queen Victoria is staple of 19th Century drama whether as a character or the subject of a feature portrayal. However the reign of another female Monarch, Queen anne is largely forgotten. Director Yorgos Lanthimos now remedies this with The Favourite, set in 1708 when Queen Anne is distressed and a newly arrived servant raises her spirits. On a superficial level the film is similar to Mrs Brown and Victoria & Abdul, Lanthimos brings his own inimitable style to it.<br/><br/>Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is depressed, suffering from gout and other ailments. Not caring for Affairs of State she allows her friend (and secret lover) Sarah Churchill (Rachael Weisz) to rule in her stead. Sarah uses this power to advance the military campaigns of her husband, the Duke of Marlborough (Mark Gatiss). Sarah's impoverished cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives seeking a position in the household. At first she is a menial maid but when she provides a herbal remedy to ease the Queen's gout she is promoted and soon comes to vie with Sarah for Anne's affection and confidence.<br/><br/>A darkly comic tale of a battle of wills. For Abigail to lose means be returned to penury but for Sarah defeat will result in the loss of her (de facto) absolute power.Anne's Court can be a odd place, courtiers race ducks and lobsters for amusement, indeed the Prime Minister (James Smith) walks his pet duck around on a leash. Anne herself keeps seventeen pet rabbits, one for each of the children she has lost through miscarriages, still-births and infant deaths. The adventures of the Queen, Sarah and Abigail unfold in a manner which at times seems farcical but always advances the films inner logic. 9/10."

"ferdinand1932","7","2","3","5 January 2019"," Innuendo
","This is a stylish and innovative genre film. The camera movement and angle of photography is not typical for such a film. Similarly, the writing approach is fresh and the terse characterization, along with dialogue, has a sharp and regenerating effect. Add the locations, and the strong cast around the principals, and it's an entertaining film.<br/><br/>Even with these artistic qualities it's a bit of a hoax: it's not history and it's not genuine biography. Sure, it exploits historical entities in some inferred behavior, but that is just speculation and not even toward an objective, that is to say, that some imagination was used to concoct as to why a policy was imposed, such as to pursue a war. No, this film is simply a salacious invention in order to titillate an audience with the idea of what may have occurred. Possibly.<br/><br/>In itself that is not incorrigible: Robert Graves did it brilliantly in his books on the Roman Empire. But it is just fiction, it's not history and it's no historical biography, nor anything like it. It's gossip and innuendo.<br/><br/>The question then is: would anyone watch this if it was invented and just about three women at any time, or does it only work on the basis that it might have been historically true and that authenticity is the necessary ingredient in which an audience gives its time. If that contingency of historical truth is removed than it's a type of fraud because it means only the smallest measure of historical truth makes it watchable and for prurient reasons."

The staccato repetitive notes and lavish classical scores were beautiful and heightened the pressure of the scenes. Sometimes this felt almost too much temporal pressure.<br/><br/>The beautiful scenery and buildings, Hatfield House and Hampton Court Palace providing opulent and fitting settings for the majesty of some of the performances. Most of which seem professional and proficient, Olivia Coleman's decaying character showing her damage beautifully both inside and out and we get a glimpse of the pain of her history. Her acting is sublime.<br/><br/>""Some wounds do not close; I have many such."" Queen Anne<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz was the choice after Kate Winslet to play Lady Sarah, a superior choice for this role in my opinion, with harder edges. It took much of the film until I noticed Rachel's beauty as her character was so convincing and managed to conceal it well.<br/><br/>Emma Stone as Abigail was an equal and did incredibly well to not be out shined by this stunning cast. I loved her character, driven and single minded. Beautiful and practical. I suspect Olivia will win the prizes but these three have no apprentice in each other.<br/><br/>I loved the eloquent use of the English language, clipped yet with great use of profanity. Beautiful uses of the C bomb! These gift some of the best laughs and there are a few.<br/><br/>The history and view of parliament and royalty, class and status, pomp, ridiculous outfits and beautiful dresses, fascinated and helped the sumptuous feel.<br/><br/>All this and a masterful tragic victory, the final scene so powerful yet left me bereft. This is an esculent, luscious and complex film with an acting masterclass and experience.<br/><br/>8/10 Treat yourself."

"davidgee","8","2","3","3 January 2019"," Queen Anne: gouty, doughty - and gay
","It's the early 1700s. England's war with France is not going well, and the Queen is playing with her rabbits. She has 17 rabbits, in memory of the 17 children she lost or miscarried. When she's not playing with rabbits, Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), gouty and doughty, is playing with her latest squeeze, Sarah Duchess of Marlborough (Rachel Weisz).<br/><br/>Yes, dear fellow citizens of the realm, our sometime sovereign lady Queen Anne was a ""friend of Dusty"" (long before Dusty). There is (Wikipedia) historical evidence (mostly letters) of a whole series of attachments to ladies of the court. In the movie Sarah's cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) inveigles her way into the palace and, surprisingly soon, into the Queen's bedchamber. The feud for Anne's affections has ramifications in Parliament as well as in the palace.<br/><br/>There are some lesbian scenes here, plus a small amount of heterosexual sex in the movie - played for laughs - and a large amount of swearing, with liberal use of both F-word and C-word. The somewhat camp vulgarity and the brisk pace of the narrative will have reminded many in the audience of the CARRY_
-ON comedies. I was more reminded of THE MADFNESS OF KING GEORGE, Alan Bennett's royal Regency romp, which wore its lese-majesty with a similarly brazen air of triumph.<br/><br/>The acting by the three female stars is nothing less than glorious. The male cast members are also outstanding in more ways than one. There are some weird camera angles which I found distracting and some of the music score is painful to hear, but this is another right-royal romp, tragi-comic with a bias towards comedy, not quite as enjoyable as Mr Bennett's, but a splendid visual feast."

"debappleby","9","2","3","1 January 2019"," Excellent!
","Decided I had to see this after catching the trailer a couple of times on TV and then watching Olivia Colman on Graham Norton's chat show so I went to the first showing at 10:30 am on New Year's Day.
First off bravo to Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone who are all brilliant in this: exceptional performances of three very different women (and a fantastic English accent from Emma Stone). Their characters and intertwined relationships evolve throughout the film and the change in the balance of power is initially subtle but very clear, whilst the 'pretty' men remain powerless. Mesmerised from the beginning, I found myself holding my breath and at other times laughing out loud. (Queen Anne's meek response to Lady Sarah handing her a mirror and asking her what she thinks she looks like: ""badger"" is hilarious but for some reason I was the only member of our audience of 9 who laughed at all at any part of the film - what was wrong with the others?)
I quite liked the unusual camera angles, the close ups of the characters and their steely eyes, and the use of the fisheye lens - which seemed to add to the dark comedic appeal and made me look and wonder about what the women were really thinking but the weird period/street dancing just made me feel a little uncomfortable and I'm still not sure why it had to be like that.
SPOILER ALERT: The ending however, disappointed me slightly, almost as though I had been cheated out of a definitive ending - that said sometimes an ending that leaves its mark on you and has you thinking about it hours after you've left the cinema is the best kind - perhaps that's what Yorgos Lanthimos wanted. I think I understood it though: Queen Anne's sad realisation that she had chosen the wrong woman and Abigail's Pyrrhic victory - both trapped in a situation that neither satisfied nor made either happy, whilst Sarah although enjoying and overstepping the power she wielded and despite her blackmail attempt, did truly love the Queen.
Finally to the titles, which I stayed to watch because they were unusual and very hard to read, which unfortunately made me all the more convinced there was to be something extra afterwards but no - unless you count the wildlife sound effects.
A well deserved 9/10 and surely an Oscar nomination at least."

"gcsman","8","2","3","31 December 2018"," Offbeat tale of palace intrigue, but the three lead actresses are great.
","The reign of Queen Anne in the early 1700's must be one of the least well-known segments of British history. We have loads of movies to choose from about Elizabeth I, Victoria, the Henrys, Richard III, and so on. But Queen Anne? I went into this movie knowing about as much as anyone else about her era -- in other words, nothing. At first, I thought this one was more in the line of a historical fantasy, but it turns out (relying on Wikipedia) that it's largely historically correct. Anne (played by Olivia Colman) did indeed have Lady Marlborough (Rachel Weisz) as a politically influential confidante, they did have a serious falling-out, and Abigail Hill (Emma Stone) replaced her, not too long before Anne's death. The story of the film is how that happened.<br/><br/>That's the bare bones of it. The substance of the film, despite the offbeat humor that most of the scenes have, is the deadly serious tug-of-war between Lady M and Abigail, with the ultimate prize being the Queen's favor and the inside track to status and influence. The three lead actresses are all top-notch and they carry the whole film -- all others in the cast (pointedly including all the male roles of course!) are secondary. Emma Stone especially has real screen presence -- she's building up quite a resume of outstandingly varied roles in her still-young career. Colman plays the Queen as a sort of petulant dimbulb (which may NOT be historically correct, though. It seems that Anne in fact had a lot more agency than originally given credit for). She has a bad case of gout that renders her barely able to walk, but won't do anything to modify her diet or exercise accordingly. She gets browbeaten by all her advisors personal and political. who treat her as just a necessary pawn. Ultimately, however, she learns that she can exert the real power she had in her hands all along, and the subversive message of the plot is that both Sarah and Abigail, who've been infighting for power all this time, both get the rug pulled out from under them by the very person they are trying to ""capture"".<br/><br/>Part of the fun of watching these historical costume dramas is seeing how people dressed and carried out daily things (300 years ago in this case), and this one is meticulously researched and executed. Well done! The only thing that holds me back from giving a higher rating is that it's hard to know at times what to make of it: it's as if the actors are simultaneously telling the story and also standing outside it all watching it happen. But the bottom line is -- go see this to watch three actresses at the top of their game."

"MrDHWong","7","1","1","31 January 2019"," An odd take on one particular British monarch's legacy and the ones who served her
","The Favourite is a period drama directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer). Starring Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz, it is an odd take on one particular British monarch's legacy and the ones who served her.<br/><br/>In the early 1700s, Britain is at war with France and the British Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) sits upon her throne taking advice on ruling from her loyal adviser Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough (Rachel Weisz). However, one day Sarah's broke cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) shows up looking for work and catches the attention of the Queen. Over time, Abigail gains the Queen's favour and is promoted as her personal attendant, much to the envy of Sarah, who feels she is being pushed aside for someone better.<br/><br/>Well-acted and shot, The Favourite is an interesting yet strange film about an intense rivalry in 18th century England. Both Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are appropriately catty and spiteful towards one another, and it is fun to watch how each one tries to outdo the other. Olivia Colman also shines as Queen Anne, clearly having fun playing up her character's eccentricities. The film has wonderful set pieces, much in the vein of Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon and Milos Forman's Amadeus, and one can certainly appreciate the effort that has been made to make the film look as authentic as possible. Unfortunately, though, the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a questionable ending. In terms of plot, there is not much shown other than the two servants vying for the Queen's attention and considering the film's two hour running time, this almost feels like a wasted opportunity for some showcase of the war between Britain and France. In addition to this, the film is a slow burner, not becoming particularly engaging until about twenty minutes in. It is understandable why this has little mainstream appeal and most audiences will be put off by its slow start, but overall, the film is still worth seeing for the solid performances of the three lead actresses and the eye catching set design.<br/><br/>I rate it 7/10"

"youngman44","5","7","18","29 December 2018"," Unredeeming Failure
","I should begin with the fact that I love period pieces and historical dramas (or dramedies) - even if these take liberties. I also am a big fan of dark comedy (e.g., Fargo).<br/><br/>But, this film was pure pretentiousness on the part of Lanthimos as it had little comedy and, more importantly, zero redeeming characters. Even a broken, flawed character who had some redeeming value would have made the film more tolerable. One kept looking for someone to root for - even if that ended in a tragic outcome it would have been better. I found none.<br/><br/>The five stars go for the three main actresses - Colman, Weisz, and Stone. They were exceptional. Stone in particular.<br/><br/>The film was grounded in the historical relationship between Queen Anne (who reigned from 1701 until her death in 1714) and her close but eventually strained friendship with Lady Sarah (Weisz). As far as the bare bones of the story went, it was accurate. However, there was no effort to find any positive quality for these characters. They were all purely selfish and evil.<br/><br/>I did find first 45 minutes or so were quite interesting and enjoyable wondering where things were going. But, unfortunately, the film just does not bring a single positive value.<br/><br/>Even in the Trump administration one can find a few altruistic people. Lanthimos wrote none into the story. Too bad. It was neither fun, humorous (except in one or two scenes), nor redeemable. A waste of time and money from my perspective."
"mhughes57","1","6","15","28 January 2019"," What Did I Just Watch?
","Was excited to see a movie about British royalty as I usually love these movies, but within minutes realized this would not be the case. First off, the filming has that grainy texture that I despise. It never looks clear and has a yellowish dreary tint throughout the whole thing. Most of the filming was so dark and hard to see....yes, I understand it was a period of time with only candlelight but this got old real quick.
Secondly, if you like the ""C"" word, you will probably love this movie. I on the other hand absolutely hate it and it seemed to be every other word. The whole movie just had a nasty, dirty feel to me. I'm not a prude by any means but some scenes just made me want to close my eyes. The music in this movie was weird and very annoying in parts.......long drawn out scenes with some sound that reminded me of a piece of machinery going on the fritz.
I really don't have anything positive to say about this movie. My friend that was with me was actually laughing out loud at just how incredibly hideous and asinine it was.
I truly don't understand the positive reviews and that's actually made us want to see it. I don't think I'll be as trusting in reviews from hereon. Please take my warning, save your time and money and avoid this movie at all cost."
"mikeburdick","9","6","15","30 December 2018"," Bound to be a classic
","""The Favourite"" is a near-perfect film that solidifies Yorgos Lanthimos amongst the rarified club of master filmmakers. Its script crackles with caustic dialogue that rivals ""The Sweet Smell of Success,"" its dark humour rivals ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and its costumes rival ""Barry Lyndon."" The top-shelf actors are at the top of their game. And what a beautiful film, with stunning photography that elegantly captures the massive scale of the palace, often utilising a fish-eye lens to lend an off-kilter feeling, reminiscent of the Czech New Wave. As a lover of film, there are a lot of suspect reviews here. I'm never surprised that there are a few people who are turned off by something or other-period pieces, sardonic humour-but to give a low rating to a film as well-acted and well-crafted as this film-clearly one of the year's best-is completely disingenuous. Catch it on the big screen, it's deserving."
"Turfseer","4","6","15","26 December 2018"," Quirky director Lanthimos can't decide whether he's laughing at or sympathizing with his characters in early 18th century tale of royal shenanigans
","Deborah Davis is the screenwriter of The Favourite, best described as a black comedy focused principally on the reign of England's Queen Anne in the early 18th century. Davis began writing the screenplay in 1998 so kudos to her in persisting in getting this made. You can tell that there is a serious underside to the narrative but at the hands of director Yorgos Lanthimos, his weird farcical take is imprinted all over it.<br/><br/>
The Favourite is a story about a love triangle involving the Queen and two women vying for her attention and power within the Court. It's very loosely based on fact and Lanthimos focuses on the most salacious aspects, attempting to convince us there was an actual intimate (physical) relationship between the principals. The majority of historians would probably disagree including Winston Churchill who wrote about one of the principals in the love triangle, his ancestor, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.<br/><br/>
When we're first introduced to Queen Anne, it becomes apparent that she's a seriously disturbed woman, who has endured the deaths of 17 children (she keeps 17 rabbits that represent each of her deceased children). Today the Queen might have been diagnosed as bipolar, prone to frequent bursts of uncontrollable anger which members of the Court end up obsequiously enduring.<br/><br/>
Sarah is initially the Queen's primary adviser (as well as lover); today she would probably be seen as a conservative as she wholeheartedly supports the war effort with France. The political opposition is represented by Robert Harley, a member of Parliament and wealthy landowner.<br/><br/>
We're soon introduced to Abigail Hill, a distant cousin of Sarah, who must work as a scullery maid after her father loses his fortune due to gambling debts. Abigail seizes the opportunity to ingratiate herself with the Queen (craftily massaging Anne's inflamed legs with herbs), eventually usurping Sarah's position as lady-in-waiting. Marley uses Abigail to spy on Sarah to gain insight into her schemes.<br/><br/>
The plot takes a nasty turn when Abigail poisons Sarah, who then falls off her horse while taking a trip, and sustains a large cut on her face. Anne makes it clear she no longer wants to speak with Sarah. The Queen rewards Abigail by granting Nobleman Samuel Masham's wish to marry her-thus restoring Abigail's aristocratic standing.<br/><br/>
Sarah blackmails the Queen by threatening to release letters of their secret (lesbian) relationship. Despite changing her mind and burning the letters, the Queen ends up banishing Sarah from the Court for life.<br/><br/>
All of these shenanigans might not have been too bad, but unfortunately Lanthimos doesn't know whether he's laughing at or sympathizing with his characters. The narrative morphs into an unpleasant hybrid of some believable historical fiction coupled with a coterie of buffoonish, cartoon-like characters. One particularly ridiculous scene has Abigail wrestling with Masham out in the woods. Lanthimos attempts to get mileage out of all the fawning sycophants who are constantly forced to kow-tow to their ruler-we get the point about the fawning early on and what it ultimately amounts to is massive overkill!<br/><br/>
Olivia Colman gives a standout performance as the over the top queen along with Rachel Weisz, who presents the Duchess of Marlborough as wonderfully cold and calculating. Emma Stone as Abigail perhaps has the best scene with Colman at film's end: the Queen humiliates Abigail after she mistreats one of her precious rabbits, revealing herself to be just as cold and sadistic as her banished rival, Sarah. Scenes like that are few and far between in The Favourite, as its quirky director seeks instead to find laughs where few exist."

","THE FAVOURITE appears to be about Queen Anne (an illustrious unknown to me, even after reading about her) and her sexual and other vagaries while supposedly leading her kingdom -- though Lady Marlborough (Weisz) is the real power behind the throne, and the queen's firm favourite and sexual consort.<br/><br/>That is, until the character played by Emma Stone bursts upon the mud; She has fallen out of grace because of her family's misfortunes and she is a distant cousin to Lady Marlborough. She rapidly surmises that the queen is the only way out of menial service, and she jostles to become the queen's favourite, and in the process engages in personal war with her cousin, with bad consequences for both.<br/><br/>Overlong, very pretentious, pointless from a historic and didactic standpoint, this film is something of a psychotic foray, and its greatest attempts at shocking are the use of profanities and expletives. It is also a sexist film, in which males are portrayed as stupid, vain, irrelevant, powerless and risible.<br/><br/>Lanthimos' direction is disordered, as reflected in the credits that you cannot read, and in the over the top performances (Colman reminded me of Kathy Bates in MISERY (1990), but without the bite of that performance); it keeps repeating lugubrious scenes in the palace's corridors; dialogue is repetitive; and the annoying and anachronistic soundtrack, including what appears to be a most disagreeable and jarring beat of a pendulum, had me wanting to walk out early on.<br/><br/>Lanthimos also shamelessly borrows ideas from TOM JONES (UK 1963), which showed England's royal court as a place of carnal, Epicurean, and other excesses - but at least TOM JONES posted superb acting down to the smallest role; it had a crisp pace, running on zany comedy interspersed with shocking reality; and it did not need offensive language to make its point.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the caged rabbits are the queen's real favourites and they reflect the film's level of intelligence. The vague ending only emphasizes the pointlessness of the entire exercise.<br/><br/>Finally, I fail to see how this dud can get such a high overall IMDB rating when so many reviews award it 1 or 2 stars.

The rise and fall of Sarah Churchill and Abigail Hills influence as favourites, although a reality, had other credible political motivations. Much of this movie paints a picture of an ineffectual culture of fops and frivolities in court life, whereas the politics and the principles of the time were a lot more serious and calculating, as was Queen Anne's legacy (the United Kingdom was birthed under Anne's reign). But, as a fanciful history, there is great humour and tragedy in this movie and the acting is truly superb. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Costume Comedic Drama}"
"AramIsaac","9","5","12","7 January 2019"," One of the best costume dramas since 'Barry Lyndon'
","I'd say I'm a moviefan. I don't claim to be a critic, but I can judge movies critically.
I really liked The Favourite. I saw The Killing of a Sacred Deer in cinemas about a year ago, and I really liked that movie. However, I LOVED this movie.
The cinematography is great. The colors are beautiful, and the camerawork is great. I dug the repeated cameramovement to the right. Only problem with the cinematography was that sometimes a certain lense was used, which took me out of the movie, as it wasn't used consistently.
The performances of Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz were all fantastic. Especially Colman is amazing. There is this one scene where she just stares, and you can see her eyes get a little bit wet. She also did a great job with the moments of crazyness she had. Her role is one of the best female roles of the year, together with Toni Collette in Hereditary.
The comedy was sharp and well-done. It was not in your face, and subtile enough not to make it forced. Even the men who are after Emma Stone's character, which are all comic reliefs, felt like real persons.
At some points the movie really felt like Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon: a person in the 18th century who used to be from a rich and important family which lost their title gets into the house of an important woman in England, and tries to gain power by (pretending to) fall(ing) in love with the rich female. When this person gets her trust, the same person lives a wild life, cheats on his of her husband of wife and doesn't treat the woman with power well. Even the score of the film reminded me of some of the music used in Barry Lyndon.
There are a few (minor) issues with the film, one of which I already mentioned. My biggest issue with the film is that the husband of Emma Stone's character isn't as important as he should be. They marry, she jerks him off one time and then he disappears from the movie. When she flirts with another man shen she's drunk, it wasn't clear who her husband was.
In the end is The Favourite a great movie. I would highly recommend it. If you didn't like the previous films of Yorgos Lanthimos, then you won't like this one I think, but it is worth a try. I'd give this movie a 8.8/10"
"zken-1","10","5","12","27 December 2018"," If you love history, and satire, you will love this film
","Reading the reviews for this movie, I am shocked that none of the writers seem to get the tremendous level of political satire imbedded in this story. This film has two levels. The first is about the decadence of royalty in British history. The second is about the situation in our political world today. These two ideas are put together like the layers of an omelette. You cannot separate these if you are watching with a critical and astute eye.
As such, this is a masterful depiction of greed, gluttony, betrayal and revenge. The fact that this tale is through the story of three women is a delicious irony that works like a clock clicking. This is a tale of witchcraft (Emma Stone), power (Rachel Weisz) and gluttony and greed (Olivia Coleman). The characters are a dance with the devil that echoes through history and right to our world today.
Not to be missed, this is one of the best films we have seen in years."

"mshackletonchavez","10","7","19","3 January 2019"," Yorgos Lanthimos' Masterpiece.
","Rarely does a film feature in my mind quite as this one did, raring for weeks for its arrival. Yet in the futures stead, this may stand a the one to define this decade. A hail to the Lesbians, a cry for mastery, a perfection in comedy, a masterclass in drama and what brings a director from auteur to master.<br/><br/>This film shall not be easily forgotten. I say this not lightly, but this possibly the best directed motion picture that I have ever seen. This is Yorgos Lanthimos' masterpiece, on par with the classics of bygone eras and delivering a new wave into the future of filmmaking. I believe for this film's influence to lay beyond one awards season, and be heard in the years to come, as two hours in which this enfolds is the greatest that film can be. It challenges normality, has strengths where others do not, and makes perfection of what it can.<br/><br/>The narrative, from full picture perspective was perfect. Perfectly paced, and I have never seen a film balance it's tones so incredibly. How they say: 'You'll laugh and cry' - well I did, and by god did I love it. Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara's screenplay is the years best, without a shadow of a doubt I can say this. Its characterisation os a momentous achievement that will be subject a great many analysis in video and book. Their perfect act structure is one of great pleasure and uniqueness, for I suspect that this film play over not 3, but 4 acts. If one were to watch this feature, and pay attention to its screenplay's structure, I think others would suspect it to be this way. This is a peculiar number of acts, but it plays to this films strength, making it more engaging, though some may say the end drags on a bit, I found it to be to my personal liking.<br/><br/>The direction of this film by the great Yorgos Lanthimos was his best, the years best, and among the best ever put to film. The best I have seen. His mastery over performances (Which I will get to later), over cinematography, over sound, over the physical look of the sets and costumes, it has his mark all over it. And by the day, does it come to fruition in an ablaze of glory. This film is distinct, yet its flavour its certainly more palatable than his other features, Lanthimos' strong flavour is unwavered in my opinion. While it is more accessible than his other films, it is simply more subliminal, that his fans would understand and normal visitors will not.<br/><br/>The performances were simply astonishing. Olivia Colman as Queen Anne was the best performance I have seen from any actor or actress for the entire of the 2018 film season. Her performance is enough to see this film on its own, her character was tragic, hilarious, deeply troubled, and yet a frightening reflection of what could happen to anyone. 'Stalked by tragedy' is one way she is described, and while I will not quote historical facts which are spoilers, her character was far more compelling than I had expected her to be, thanks mostly to Colman's performance. Her acting prowess is surely on course for great honours in the weeks to come.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz was Sarah Churchill the Duchess of Marlborough, (Who is actually related to Winston Churchill), was incredible. Her characters command over scenes, even ones where she is in loss, cruelty or evil, is a control over the screen that is formidable and unforgettable. In particular the shooting scenes, the hot chocolate scene and her and Annes final scene (Not a spoiler), they were portrays of perfect chemistry, perfect acting, on levels that were scarcely see a few times a decade. Could there be anything more grand, more gorgeous than this performance, a perfect portrayal of all the worse sides of aristocracy, and of a manipulative friendship, one that is a vie for power, for control, to be the favourite.<br/><br/>Emma Stone as Abigail Hill was I think, her best performance to date. Though it was only this films third best (in my opinion), it was etherial, stark, incredibly well layered and portrayed. The fact that it is only this films third best, as is still of such a level, goes to show the caliber of this feature. I found for her portrayal of arrogance to be the part to discern the most from the others, but truly this is an amazing performance.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was also stellar. Nicolas Hoult in particular was a welcome addition, as well as the rabbits. The rabbits represented so much more than cuteness and cuddliness, they were love, fear, hate, depression, gout, and a cruel past all rolled up into little bundles of fun. This film wouldn't be the same without the rabbits.<br/><br/>The Cinematography was astounding to say the least. I had heard that cinematography Robbie Ryan had stated that Yorgos Lanthimos was basically the director of photography. And this does show, its his mark which is most present, in its sweeping left to right turns, and specific colour palette (Mostly browns and greys in this feature) it is pure Lanthimos, as most of his films follow a two colour palette in most of their composition. The use of natural light was also well chosen, highlighting light and dark, the duality of people, very excellent things most normal viewers do not notice on first viewing. The shot design was unique, more so than other Lanthimos films. The use of Panavision super-wide shots was great, really fun. And his signature angulation of not showing faces is toned down in this film, but is modified in certain ways and is just as strong and unique as his other films.<br/><br/>The set design was remarkable, mostly shot at and Hatfield House, it feels more immersive than any other film set in this period. Everything felt real, despite the small budget. The costumes, just give them an oscar. They were easily the years best, and I would say on the level of the best this side of 2000. On the level of The Lord Of The Rings, they never faltered, and were highly suited, pure eye candy. The makeup and hairstyling were also of the highest quality, also the years best. They were messy, fun, outrageous, immersive, all the marks they aimed for were hit. a perfect shot, not a beat missed. These factors all weighed in, especially the wigs and 'Badger' looking makeup are what historically sold the time period, as well as supplementing the narrative, setting the greatest backdrop for Lanthimos' direction.<br/><br/>The Sound was also a notable factor. Rather more immersive than I had imagined, ever book thrown, tea cup set, and step taken is accounted for. Adding to eeriness, love, endearingness and fear of every scene. Also it subliminally sets one into he film more comfortable, making one notice their own surroundings less, it was highly clever and well executed.<br/><br/>On the weaker side, there was a momentarily feeling I had during the first act that it wasn't all clicking together as well as I had though, however by 20 minute this feeling had passed. Especially since this film has perhaps the strongest second act in the film this side of 2000. Many contemporary films weaken and lose pace in the second acts, but this actually maintains it's trajectory more strongly than anything made during my own life time (That I have seen).<br/><br/>Finally, in the end: This was, I can say with confidence,the best film of the year. Everything, as a final product, fitted together so supremely. This is one for the history books and sets Yorgos Lanthimos' name into stone. For its portrayal of love is so intimate, and truthful, yet subliminal and as all lanthimos features do, sets more questions than it answers. It is now down to the viewers to decide what they thought of its questions, and in that, it is true cinematic perfection. Also classic Lanthimos weird dancing is present, which is always a treat. 5/5"

I'm no prude but this isn't an Eddie Murphy movie, dropping the C-bomb every 5 minutes doesn't make a movie hip. It seems they're not sure what direction to take with the story line.
Also every few minutes, the director uses a fish eye lens, which just makes it turn into an LSD inspired scene that can work on movies such as ""fear and loathing in Los Vegas"", but I found it totally out of context in this time period.<br/><br/>In my opinion, if you want to see a great movie about an English royal going to pieces, stick with 'The madness of King George"""

","The three leading ladies's acting is what makes this movie worth while. I am used to English comedy and I enjoy it. This movie has very few moments of it, they all appear on the trailer. It is too long. Becomes so boring. It could be boring yet be a good lesson in history. I am no expert in Queen Ann's rule nor the historic facts around it. Yet, I do like to learn and felt I learnt nothing to very little from a 2 hour, long, exhausting movie. As a woman I am really sad with this. I wanted this movie to be awesome. You do learn that rulers can be silly (from what I have read after, Queen Ann wasn't the silly child like person it is portraid in the movie) and life in court is not for everyone. I myself ended it thinking I'd rather live in a shack in the woods than having to go through all of that (still not worth watching the movie). In sum, I though that the goal of the movie would be to show the power and intelligence of women in court in a time were very little was thought of them. And in my point of view the movie completely failed in this regard. Very sad."

In terms of their sexual performance?<br/><br/>They are Lady Marlborough (Rachel Weisz) her 'loyal' lady in waiting whose husband Lord Marlborough is abroad in battle versus the French and young upstart Abigail (Emma Stone).<br/><br/>Stone begins the film as a penniless waitress to Lady Marlborough but promotes to a Lady by conveniently marrying.

Im still in awe of how many negative reviews this movie is getting.
Sound track was a huge addition to the overall feeling and sinister vibe of the movie as well as the ending. What an ending. Literally summed up two hours of the movie in one short scene with a perfect accuracy.

The actors are an appealing bunch, dressed beautifully but swearing like sailors. There are a few good chuckles to be had, no more, and the movie is a tad bit too long.

"kjproulx","8","4","9","18 January 2019"," A Well-Written, High-Energy Period Piece
","Whether you call yourself a fan of the films that Yorgos Lanthimos directs or not, it's without question that his movies aren't for everyone. They are pieces of art that not everyone can understand or are even willing to try understanding. So take my review of The Favourite with a large grain of salt because I'm someone who can get into anything, no matter what the subject matter is. That being said, The Favourite is one of the most unique films of 2018 and for that reason alone, will have me remembering it for quite some time. While I don't think The Favourite is perfect in any way, I do feel like certain film fanatics will eat this one up. There's a reason this film is circulating around awards season (deservedly so), but I personally believe it deserves the recognition and not a win.<br/><br/>Set quite far into the past in England, The Favourite follows the servants of Queen Anne. As needy as she is invested romantically in her first hand servant, everything falls to pieces when a new one arrives in Abigail. Aside from a frowned-upon romance that does have a three-act structure throughout the course of this movie, my biggest complaint is that it felt a little light on story. There are other side plots and hints of backstory that are eluded to, but I felt a little short-changed when looking back on the film's story as a whole. As I mentioned, The Favourite will be remembered for many reasons by film fans around the world, but I believe the story will be remembered far less than everything else this film has to offer.<br/><br/>From the very first shot of this film to the time the credits rolled, I was enthralled by how impeccably filmed this movie was. It should come as no surprise when you have a cinematographer like Robbie Ryan at the helm. While I haven't seen a lot of films that he has worked on, I absolutely loved his work on both American Honey and Slow West. He has a keen eye for camera work and I can't wait to see what he does next. On top of that, the score present throughout this movie is incredibly engaging, to say the least. This is a very tight screenplay, with not very many breaths taken between lines of dialogue-but when there is, the score takes over in a majorly memorable way.<br/><br/>Since we're on the topic of things to remember about this film, the cast is near perfect in every way. I normally don't say that about many movies, because there's usually at least one casting choice that throws me off, but The Favourite is immaculate in that regard. From Emma Stone giving her all, to Rachel Weisz giving her best performance in years, to Olivia Colman as the Queen, I was either laughing hysterically or sucked in by a dramatic delivery. If for nothing else, this is a movie that's worth seeing for the performances alone. Don't be shocked if you see this cast sweeping many of the female awards categories in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>In the end, The Favourite is nearly perfect on a technical level, but the substance itself felt slightly lacking to me. The screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara packs a heavy punch in terms of the dialogue throughout and I found myself remembering moments in David Fincher films where the dialogue flies a mile a minute, which are my favourite kind of screenplays. Overall, I can't say this is one of the best films of the year, like many critics are, but I can recognize that certain elements absolutely are. I had a great time watching this movie and certain viewers will as well. If you're not intrigued by the trailer for this one, I don't believe the movie will do a good job of winning you over."

"JamesHitchcock","8","4","9","16 January 2019"," Great Anna, Whom Three Realms Obey
","The script for ""The Favourite"" was written as long ago as 1998, but the project spent twenty years in development hell as writer Deborah Davis tried to persuade the reluctant studios that, contrary to their assumptions, there was indeed a market for films with a lesbian theme, with three women in the leading roles and with no male characters of equivalent importance. The times appear to be changing in this respect, as recent weeks have seen two historical dramas with a lesbian theme, the other being ""Colette"".<br/><br/>""The Favourite"" tells the story of the rivalry between Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough, and her cousin Abigail Hill at the court of Queen Anne in the early 18th century. Anne (1702-1714), the younger daughter of a younger son, was one of Britain's more unlikely monarchs. She owed her elevation to the throne to a combination of three factors- the failure of her uncle Charles II to produce a legitimate heir, the conversion of her father James II to Catholicism, which led to his being overthrown after a brief three-year reign, and the premature death of her childless elder sister Mary II. Sarah was the wife of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, a man who has gone down in history as something of a British national hero, but this film only strengthened my view that his main achievement was to win a series of tactically brilliant but strategically meaningless victories in a pointless war. His stately home Blenheim Palace was, metaphorically speaking, built on the graves of all those slaughtered in its namesake battle.<br/><br/>The Anne we see in this movie bears little relation to Pope's ""Great Anna, whom three realms obey"". She is an eccentric woman, confined to a wheelchair and prematurely aged by ill-health. (At the date when the story opens, 1708, she would only have been in her early forties). She shows little interest in governing, preferring the company of her pet rabbits to that of her ministers and official advisers. The effective ruler of the country is Sarah Churchill, her friend, her confidante and, in this version of history, her lover. (Most historians, in fact, have taken the view that Anne was not actually a lesbian and that Sarah's accusations to that effect were merely sour grapes). Sarah's position, however, is undermined by the arrival at Court of her pretty younger cousin. Abigail, whose branch of the family have fallen into poverty, is at first forced to work as a maid, but rises to become a lady-in-waiting, a position which she exploits in an attempt to supplant Sarah in Anne's affections.<br/><br/>The film has been described as a comedy, and there is indeed something comical, even farcical, about Olivia Colman's portrayal of the silly, petulant and childish Queen, and about the machinations of the two rival cousins. We are, however, never allowed to forget that serious matters are at stake. While Anne plays with her rabbits, war is raging on the continent, a war which Sarah is determined to prolong for as long as possible because she sees it as providing an opportunity for her husband, the commander of the British forces, to distinguish himself and to earn even more rewards from a grateful nation which has already given him a Dukedom and Blenheim Palace. Abigail's chief ally at court is Robert Harley, the leader of the peace party and a sworn enemy of the Churchills. As played by Nicholas Hoult, Harley comes across as an extravagant dandy, but beneath his foppish exterior his is a voice of reason, even if his pacifism may owe less to moral or humanitarian concerns than to resentment of the taxes he and other landowners have to pay to support the war effort.<br/><br/>
There are two very good performances, and one excellent one, in the three main roles. Rachel Weisz's Sarah is a rather mannish character who frequently wears male clothing, yet Weisz is still able to suggest the sexual attractiveness which lies at the heart of her domination of Anne, whereas Emma Stone's Abigail is more conventionally feminine. Stone also deserves praise for a faultless British accent; she clearly did not want to take the lazy way out of ""Well, British people in the early eighteenth century probably did not speak in the same way as we do today, so it doesn't matter if Abigail sounds a bit American"". The acting honours, however, must go to Colman as the Queen, whom she makes a curiously sympathetic character despite her silliness and obvious incompetence as a ruler.<br/><br/>In some ways this is a typical British costume drama, but unlike most ""heritage cinema"" productions this one has a strongly satirical element. Indeed, its relevance to modern politics has probably grown since the project was first mooted in the nineties. The way in which John and Sarah Churchill manage to prolong the War of the Spanish Succession to their own advantage recalls allegations that certain members of the Bush administration were seeking to profit personally from the Iraq War. And we can all think of politicians (no names mentioned!) who, even if there is no sexual impropriety involved, allow themselves to be manipulated by ""advisers"" whose advice may be motivated by self-interest rather than the national good. 8/10"

Olivia Colman as a gout-ridden slightly crackers Monarch is wonderful, she has captured a schizoid personality that swings from childish humour to paranoid screaming in a very non-hysterical way. Rachel Weisz is captivating, icy and singleminded but ultimately outgunned by a devious Emma Stone.<br/><br/>The camera work is unusual to say the least but it worked for me, adding to the sense of craziness inherent throughout, as was the muscial score which was quirky and intrusive and appropriate.

Her closest advisor, Lady Churchill (Weisz) and the newly arrived, fallen from grandeur Abigail Masham (Stone). Abigail was previously a 'lady' and sees any devious association with the queen as a chance to return to her aristocratic past.<br/><br/>Whatever you first think of Abigail at the beginning is turned on its head by the end.

To tell you more of the movie's plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just haven to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Yorgos Lanthimos, who previously brought us ""off center"" movies like ""The Lobster"" and just last year's ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"". This movie is very much in the same vein, another ""off center"", this time, historical piece, based on more-or-less true events taking place in the early 1700s. Frankly, it took me a while to get into the movie, as the first half establishes the overall sense (Abigail the newcomer vs. Sarah the power-person), and it wasn't really clear whether this was comedy or drama, but the movie's second half resolves that dilemma: this is drama, and court intrigue at the highest level. The movie's greatest asset is the lead performances of the three ladies: Olivia Colman (as Queen Anne), Rachael Weisz (as Sarah) and Emily Stone (as Abigail). I don't think I can point out which is the better, all three of them are just outstanding. But make no mistake: this is not just another historical drama, as director Lanthimos puts his very much ""off center"" stamp on it and it makes not for your ""standard"" viewing. The movie has been getting rave critical acclaim, and while I think this is a good movie for sure, I am just a little bit puzzled, frankly. On the other hand, when you compare this to that other recent historical drama (set 150 years earlier), ""Mary Queen of Scots"", then ""The Favourite"" is the better movie of the two.<br/><br/>""The Favourite"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early Christmas Eve evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay (about 20 people or so). If you are interested in historical dramas with an ""off-center"" bent, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it at the theater, on VOD, or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"Red-125","9","4","9","23 December 2018"," A strong queen and two strong women. Who will prevail?
","The Favourite (2018) was directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. It's an account of a period in the life of Queen Anne, who reigned in the early 18th Century.<br/><br/>Olivia Colman plays Queen Anne, Rachel Weisz plays her friend and confidante, Lady Sarah, and Emma Stone portrays Abigail Hill, who wants to be the queen's friend and confidante.<br/><br/>I looked at the Wikipedia entry for Queen Anne, and the history is extremely complicated. (It was complicated then, and it's even harder for us to understand 300 years later.) However, the movie plot appears to me to conform closely to history. If you're a history buff, you may know the history, or you may want to check it before you watch the film. If not, let it pass, because the film is really about interpersonal relationships rather than history.<br/><br/>Lady Sarah was, indeed, the queen's friend and confidante. The family of Abigail Hill, Sarah's cousin, had fallen onto hard times, and Hill arrived at the palace pleading for a job. She was given a job in the kitchen, but she rose far beyond that.<br/><br/>So, my suggestions is to forget the War of the Spanish Succession, Whigs vs. Tories, and Catholics vs. Protestants. Concentrate on three brilliant actors. One is the queen, and the other two are scheming to be the closest to her.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, and I recommend it. When was the last time you saw a movie with three women actors as the leads, while men have only supporting roles? That in itself makes the film worth seeing. Of course, better yet, Colman, Weisz, and Stone are wonderful actors, who fit into their roles perfectly.<br/><br/>We saw this movie at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. All the scenery and royal finery will be better appreciated on the large screen. However, I recommend the movie even if watched on the small screen. See it!"

"patriciogl10","8","3","6","14 November 2019"," Impactful.
","Yorgos Lanthimos is a unique filmmaker and he proves this film after film. His style is surrounded by ethereal and almost surreal passages, unconventional and somewhat unorthodox storytelling, distinctive camera techniques that allude to certain narrative moments in film. For example, the use of fish-eye lenses in The Favourite, which brings a distorted image of the protagonists, leading to the notion of emotional instability and disruptiveness. The film counts with three leading ladies, all of whom are exceptionally brilliant in their performances, specially Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz (her portrayal gave me chills). The acting definitely feels much more vivid and much less monotonous in comparison to Lanthimos' previous films such as The Lobster, which makes it more accessible for people unfamiliar with his work. Having said that, The Favourite still contains elements that may cause casual viewers to shy away from this effort, most notably its dark humour, its remarkable use of natural light, along with meticulous photographic compositions that inevitably make The Favourite a painstakingly elaborate feature, an artistical product that even with that ultra-careful attention to composition details can make unfamiliar spectators feel uneasy and slightly disturbed.<br/><br/>That is how Lanthimos' film aesthetic works, he uses any element at his reach to provoke and disturb filmgoers, and he achieves this with this film, although to a much lesser extent than his previous works. Undoubtedly this has had mixed opinions, and with absolute reason, but I have to add, that to understand pretty much every aspect of this film (dialogue, acting, camera movements; lenses; techniques, aesthetic, themes) you have to be a bit familiar with the director's work, so that you won't easily disregard this film for its unusual approach, because I'm sure most viewers would expect a simple take on a period piece, but this is much more than that, so much more. And do you know why? His name is Yorgos Lanthimos."

It is a film about not very much, in a historical period that is not widely covered (The end of Queen Anne's reign, she was the last ruler from the Royal House of Stuart).

The three lead actresses are absolute powerhouses any one of those three could have won the best actress Oscar!<br/><br/>The music is unsettling and makes you fear that something awful will happen at every turn, but with the backdrop of politics, favouritism and manipulation it does work and holds your attention throughout.<br/><br/>The dialogue is snappy and there are moments of genuine hilarity. Often it concerns the absurdity of court life, but there are also some funny slapstick moments.<br/><br/>The ending was ambiguous and leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied, but it shouldn't detract from what is a wonderful work of art.

"masonfisk","9","3","6","24 September 2019"," IT'S A CURRENT FAVORITE FOR ME...!
","Yorgos Lanthimos' Oscar bait from last year which yielded Oscar gold for Olivia Coleman (for Best Actress) is a period piece which dusts off the stodginess off of most period pieces. Not being especially well liked by me (especially 2 of his earlier efforts The Lobster & The Killing of a Sacred Deer), Lanthimos finally finds a project which perfectly suits his esthetic. Queen Anne is out of sorts in her kingdom both externally (they're at war w/France) & at home (she's childless) & the only thing holding everything together is her loyal (& conniving) lady in waiting played by Rachel Weisz but things get more interesting when a distant cousin (played by Oscar nominee Emma Stone) comes into the picture & turns the household upside down. Mixing influences as disparate as Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (its use of fish eye lenses & natural lighting) & Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (modern sensibilities brought to a chamber drama) w/a razor sharp wit that could cut diamonds, this film opens the possibility for future takes which can winnow out the cobwebs of a genre most viewers may find quaint or picturesque. Also starring Nicholas Hoult (the current Beast in the X-Men series) & more bunnies you can shake an Easter Sunday at."

"skyisthelimit925","8","3","6","31 July 2019"," Another great work by Lanthimos
","While the movie beautifully pictures the atmosphere in the England palace at 18th centuries, it also makes you think about certain things like passion, love and intrigue. Yorgos Lanthimos is one of the best directors in the modern era but unlike his other films, he steps into a different area this time. Under the pressure of directing an historical movie for the first time, he tries to be as accurate as possible and in that regard, I would say he is successful.<br/><br/>There are some scenes that you can relate with the directing style of Lanthimos which criticize the palace's unnecessary exaggeration. In addition, Lanthimos refers to the aspects of human behaviour, which he is also known for, and makes the viewer realize it naturally, rather than forcefully.<br/><br/>Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone brings together a realistic trio of brilliance which earned every single one of them an Oscar nomination. This is also a thing to consider while reviewing this title, and it can only be a positive thing, obviously.<br/><br/>The general decoration, make-up and hairstyling is flawless. For the soundtrack, only classical music is used, so it may disturb the ones who are not familiar with it or the ones who dislike it. Other than that, there is no reason to think that this movie is bad. General consensus of the humankind is not trying to be 'grey' sometimes, but only choosing to be 'black' or 'white'. That is the only reason these movies are getting unfairly downgraded. I would recommend not to behave like this, nor listen to those who behave, as it kills all the joy you would get from any kind of entertainment.<br/><br/>8/10."

So there's the three plus.<br/><br/>But it's not an historically accurate film - and that's fine. Creativity is, after all, encouraged. And there's the polarized portrayals of men and women - women are witty, fully developed, ambitious; men are shadowy caricatures - and that's fine. Get the message, even though that's not exactly a new message. My biggest problem with this story is that the story itself is not compelling at all. Difficult to care for any of them, and I suspect that few would care for it if labels such as ""true historical characters"", ""costume drama"", and above all ""royalty"", are not glued to it, if it happened in some random old spinster's household in ... Milton Keynes. If so, then this film is playing to a low common denominator - sensationalism without sensation."

"mnpollio","3","3","6","26 April 2019"," Misleading advertising - depressing and overrated
","Set during the 18th century reign of Queen Anne in England, The Favourite focuses primarily on the dueling relationship between two women - Lady Sarah of Marlborough and her cousin Abigail - in their bid to oust the other from a position of power in court through the Queen's favor.<br/><br/>Judging from the non-stop adverts for the film and its designation at the Golden Globes, one would expect to view a savage comedy of manners, but instead the final result is anything but comical. More often than not, it is downright depressing, tiresome and childish. The film gives us a brief crash course in the political maneuvering. Parliament is split, there is a war going on, taxes are high and everyone is jockeying for a foothold on which to sway the Queen. The serious decision making seems to be delegated to the Queen's current favorite lady-in-waiting, Sarah, a childhood friend. Into the mix arrives Sarah's black sheep cousin Abigail, who initially snags a job as a maid, but ingratiates herself with Sarah, and then ultimately the Queen. This leads to a power play between Sarah and Abigail as to who will retain the Queen's favor.<br/><br/>Where to start! Given that the film strives for some degree of authenticity and received serious awards, it appears to play havoc with both facts and atmosphere. I really do not see ladies-in-waiting at court dropping f-bombs. The film also devolves into a series of sordid lesbian encounters between the Queen and Sarah, and later the Queen and Abigail. Granted that history is up in the air about whether or not such encounters happened or were the product of malicious gossip intended to damage the Queen, much of it ostensibly initiated by Sarah in retaliation for being replaced. However, I think given the players and history involved, there are more intriguing stories to be told here than settling on questionable salacious encounters as a centerpiece. Unfortunately, that is not the road chosen by the writers and the director.<br/><br/>The film is not overly long in running time, but ultimately feels at least double. Not sure if it is just me, but the odd score was off-putting as well. Technical aspects like costumes, sets, etc., are top-notch.<br/><br/>Emma Stone gives one of her best performances as the initially fresh-faced, but ultimately manipulative Abigail. She seems genuinely concerned and open, so the audience gets suckered into her machinations as well. Conversely, Rachel Weisz is all subtlety, intelligence and snark, as Sarah. The film dramatically overstates the kind of power the Queen gave Sarah in governance, but Weisz is completely credible pushing around sputtering men of power and leaving them stewing in their own juices.<br/><br/>Where I differ in the acting department is in Olivia Colman's performance as Queen Anne. Anne was considered a bland monarch (barring the lesbian gossip) plagued by miscarriages, the deaths of children, and questionable health, but still managed to rank some serious accomplishments during her reign. Colman was a surprise upset winner for Best Actress, but damned if I know why. Although I did not carry a stop watch, it seems that Colman has less screen time than co-stars Stone and Weisz, who landed in the supporting actress category, which makes her inclusion as Best Actress indefensible. Worse, I really find her the least of the three actresses here. Colman's Anne is depicted as an easily manipulated, weak, mewling child. We never get any indication that this woman could rise to the occasion of even minimal leadership. She is a one-note caricature to be either pitied or repelled by, who is eternally at the mercies of outside forces and the whims of heinous lying shrews. I freely admit that my disdain for the part could be the fault of how the writers have envisioned Anne, but I would be remiss in not pointing out that Colman does absolutely nothing to transcend the problem or breath any semblance of dignity into the role. Her Anne is merely a plot contrivance to set up the rivalry between the real leads - Stone and Weisz - and then retire to the sidelines to marinate in her own apathy and weakness. Not a fan of her work here at all.<br/><br/>Although the advertising for this film includes some savage one-liners, the film is almost devoid of comedy. Certainly the latter half is no laughing matter. The depressing climax which finds Anne duped into ostracizing Sarah (and her husband) into outright exile, Anne being felled by a crippling stroke which makes her more of an emotionally unstable infant than before, and Abigail realizing that her role as a favorite (including pleasuring the Queen in a dead-eyed manner) is not all it was cracked up to be, will leave no one skipping out in high spirits. A real desperate miss here."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","3","6","10 February 2019"," Get ready for this mesmerizing trio of actresses
","""The Favourite"" is a new English-language movie from 2018 that is considered among the big players this awards season. For director Yorgos Lanthimos, it marks another step in his successful transition to Hollywood, even if he has worked with the likes of Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman before. As for the writers, it is pretty impressive what they came up with. For Tony McNamara, even if he is experienced, it is somewhat his first big project and Deborah Davis, also a producer here, has never worked on another movie before apparently. The cast is basically the three actresses at the center of it all: Golden Globe winner (already before this movie) Olivia Colman and Oscar winners Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone. The latter two probably don't have a shot at a second Oscar with Regina King cruising this awards season, but Colman seems like a potential upset to Glenn Close. But back from the awards now and back to this film. It runs for 2 hours pretty much and takes us back 300 years in the past, to the court of Queen Anne and her most loyal helper who faces competition in a new aspiring maid coming to court and she quickly finds her way into Queen Anne's heart. Like the German title says, it is really an intriguing watch. There were more than just a few moments when I was tempted to give this film a higher rating than 3 out of 5, but in the end it just wasn't enough. There is also nothing wrong with costumes, sets, makeup, cinematography etc. it is also among the most visually impressive films of 2018 and all this without huge special effects. You can definitely say this is a period piece, but one that is oh so different compared to all the Keira Knightley films for example. The main characters are swearing and talking in the most obscene language. Character transformations and character depth is everywhere. In terms of transformations, Stone's character is the best example. She is ambitious from the very beginning, but it needs a while for her to really become relentless in achieving her goals. The duck shooting sequences are the best example. Early on, she is still a slightly innocent maid fooled even simply by another maid and nowhere near Weisz' character during their first meeting. But the longer the film goes, the less morals she has. Of course the tea poisoning scene needs to be mentioned, but also for example her brief comment about collecting the herbs she needed to cure the Queen or her love relationship with a nobleman on the court. She seems to be into him, attracted to him, physically interested in him, but the more power she becomes the less interest she shows. The wedding night is the best example. As unintimate as it gets really. And of course the bunny moment near the end when she steps on it and I do believe that early on she really finds them cute, but her affection there vanishes quickly too and makes room for her greed and longing for power. She is a true sociopath. And Emma Stone brilliantly shows that she can portray evil very well too. By the way speaking about the bunny sequence, anybody else was more worried about the bunny than about Wesiz' character being pulled to death by her own horse when the poison kicks in? Says a lot does it? By the way, animals always have a very special significance in Lanthimos' films, not just this one.<br/><br/>Now for Weisz' character. She is far from likable either. And she is a schemer, but she is not a sociopath. I do believe that she kinda likes the Queen and values the friendship with her, which is obvious throughout the movie, but also in her last scene behind the wall when she basically is ready to sacrifice her dignity. Also her harsher moments like when she slaps the Queen or is very dominant towards her, it is because at that very moment it is what the Queen needs. To be lead by somebody else when she herself does not have the power. And she does not pretend to care for the rabbits and she is not scared to call her mastress a badger. And even if her presence includes sexual favors, she will not humiliate herself beyond her hand and Stone's character is not scared of using her tongue for her own plans. Very interesting character Weisz portrays here. Now as for the Queen. Yes there would be no servants and maids without her, but I am still struggling a bit with the idea that she is the only lead. Would there really be a movie without Stone and Weisz? With the gigantic amount of screen time they have. Anyway, Colman does a good job here and shows she is as capable on the big screen as on the small screen and we will see a whole lot more from her in the next years I am sure. That effort and performance cannot be ignored and good by Lanthimos casting her here. She has more than just a few moments, dramatic and comedic and she also brings a huge deal of comedy in here. It is basically her effort that the film qualified for comedy at the Globes. Her effortless switching between helpless and dominant was very impressive. And her last scene with Stone's character is very telling about who is in charge here. She knows very well that the latter's efforts in terms of politics and finances are more than clumsy and she is not scared to let her know and humiliate her. There is no way for Stone to ever bridge the gap to the Queen and become an equal individual, maybe a peer even. Not a chance. Weisz' character got as close as it gets, but she will not. She will always be a servant no matter what. Even if the Queen has a day when she feels weaker. There was a comment from Weisz' character briefly before she has to leave when she says something along the lines that she and Stone's character are playing very different games here and that Stone should not consider herself the winner only because she is the one staying at the Royal Court. And that final shot somewhat confirms it. I must admit I did not like the ending too much initially because it felt that it went very strongly against some of the story and plot before that, not because evil wins or so (does it really?), but the more time passes and the longer I think about it the more I like it. Not a flawless film and maybe a bit overrated as a whole, but definitely a good movie and I give it a thumbs-up and positive recommendation. Also a defining historic femme fatale performance by Stone here. Cannot say I wasn't really amazed by her as a heterosexual male. Go check it out."
"tabuno","8","3","6","10 February 2019"," Definitely Not The Comedy It Was Marketed To Be
","Olivia Coleman performs superbly as Queen Anne in this period drama that was somewhat deceptively and misleadingly marketed more as a comedy which it definitely strains at accomplishing such a designation. Instead this strongly more somber and serious drama with mild interludes of humor should be expected as such when viewing this movie. The photography is striking in its bold and sharply projected visual impact, reminiscent of amazing camera work from This is Cinerama (1952) and Brainstorm (1983) both very still relevant in today's photographic approaches to visual artistic endeavors. The background music and sound effects are eerily similar to the more creepy and sinister motif of the Under the Skin (1983) and cast an odd off-balance mood during the movie, definitely off-setting the supposed comedic tone of the film. But it is in the presentation and scripted story that the more graphic and decadent, sometimes even raw and gross behavior of the Royal Court that oozes out of the movie that can captivate the audience with its voyeuristic behind the scenes purveyor of sordid delights. The movie jumps around a bit with its editing and its characters eventually are not that endearing making this movie somewhat less appealing then the typical and much more traditional movies that attempt to capture the vicarious mood of Victorian England."

But I can't say I had an instant liking, it's really demanding in terms of patience but maybe it's a film that takes time to grow on you.<br/><br/>Not for any taste or audience, but definitely a memorable experience, and so unpleasant at times you've got to admire its daringness, you can say it's over-stylized but that's the kind of thing you say about film that are all flash and no substance, this one has both and sometimes, flash and substance act like the two favourites in the film. And the story oddly enough acts like the Queen, it looks weak, flawed and flobby but it' got more strength inside and more personality than you'd think.<br/><br/>8 seems like the right rating, but it was a close call."

","I can't quite understand some of the negative reviews against this film. I'm almost certain most are from people who don't understand the history of the UK or in general. Or have just gone in with a negative mindset from the start.<br/><br/>The film is loosely based around the era of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman). War in Europe is currently ongoing, the Queen is sick and mourning the loss of 17 children. Lady Sarah (Duchess of Marlborough) (Rachel Weisz) running the country on the Queens behalf. Trying hard to keep on top of political matters and the country afloat as the war has been expensive.<br/><br/>As a result of this they've both become incredibly close in terms of friends & lovers. This relationship is tested Abigail (Emma Stone) turns up looking for work. She has previously been among the high society but fell from grace due to a drunk father and his gambling. Now taken on as a lowly servant girl. She weaves her way up the ladder by first becoming Lady Sarah's maid whom both battle for the queens affections.<br/><br/>Abigail ceases the opportunity to becoming a lady with a Â£2000 a year salary by poisoning Lady Sarah. Then marring a Colonel and quickly becoming the Queens favourite. Lady Sarah returns and realising she has been replaced by Abigail, threatens the Queen that she will release intimate letters between the 2 which would expose their relationship unless she installs 2 chosen men into Parliament and continue funding the war.<br/><br/>The Queen refuses and instead goes against Lady Sarah this is the start to the end of their relationship. Abigail and Sarah's continued battle against each other comes to ahead. Having planted a seed of doubt into the Queens head over missing money supposedly spent by the Duke of Marlborough. Eventually the Duke and Lady Sarah are banished from the country due to this.<br/><br/>It appears the Queen is having doubts about the decision she made and Lady Sarah is encouraged to write an apology to the Queen tontry and repair their relationship. However, the letters are being intercepted by the scheming Abigail who has reached the pinnacle of high society. The Queens health has seriously deteriorated and she has become quite needy and demanding. This is not what Abigail had signed up for. Doubt has also set in with regards to the banishment of the Marlborough's and her choice of friends.<br/><br/>This film although deemed a comedy is not a laugh out loud style of film. The humour is very subtle and very dark and there are many uses of the c word as well and scenes of a sexual nature throughout.<br/><br/>Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz all play their parts superbly and Colman in my opinion thoroughly deserves her Oscar nomination. Nicholas Hoult as Hanley is also a stand out performance.<br/><br/>The critics for once have their reviews correct. Please ignore the negativity on here and comments about it being boring etc. It really isn't it's a cracking film well worth the price of the ticket."

","Greek Director Yorgos Lanthimos is the director of such quirky, bizarre comedy/dramas as DOGTOOTH, THE LOBSTER and KILLING OF A SACRED DEER and his latest, THE FAVOURITE is no different, so when it was nominated for 10 Oscars, I thought I'd better go see what all the fuss was all about.<br/><br/>And I'm glad I did for THE FAVOURITE is a biting, funny, sarcastic, bizarre, intense and interesting Royal Court drama about the inner workings, back channel dealings and backstabbing social climbing in Queen Anne's court in England in the early 18th Century as seen through Lanthimos' camera lens - a lens that is different indeed.<br/><br/>Starring Oscar winners Rachel Weisz (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) and Emma Stone (LA LA LAND) in their Oscar nominated turns as cousins who vie for the attentions of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman, also Oscar nominated), it is the rare film that features 3 strong women who play off each other well and where each one is a full character in and of themselves - all 3 with strengths and weaknesses that make them real and compelling and performed by 3 strong actresses. Needless to say that each Oscar nod is well deserved.<br/><br/>But the real star of this film is the sensibilities and camera work of Lanthimos. He uses unusual camera angles, unusual angles and bizarre imagery to show the unreality of the court in relation to the real world around them and is a commentary on these people as much as it shows the action on the screen. This film is an artist with a true, unique vision and is one that, while not for everyone, is one that worked for me.<br/><br/>Lanthimos layers on a rich tapestry of story (by Oscar nominated Screenplay writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara) locations (by Oscar nominated Production Designers Fijona Crombie and Alice Felton), Costumes (by Oscar nominated costumer Sandy Powell) , editing (by Oscar nominated Yorgos Mavropsaridis), Cinematography (by Oscar nominated Robbie Ryan) and performances, direction and film.<br/><br/>I think you get the point - this film has become (rightfully so) a darling of the Awards season and is well worth checking out - while this film is not entirely successful in what it attempts to do, it is fun to watch the attempt and the strong performances, characters, direction, costumes, cinematography, etc...which more than makes up for any shortcomings in the story (especially the final act of the film).<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B+<br/><br/>7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"

Her performance has been receiving many awards and for sure more will come to her. Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are not left behind in their supporting roles and will join Olivia in many red carpets.<br/><br/>What is interesting in this movie is how the story is told and specially how it is filmed. This not the first historical movie that we are presented about this point in British history, but it is a film that concentrates on personal relationships and explains them in a unique way.

","We just came out from seeing this stunning movie to find lead actress Olivia Coleman has won the 2019 Golden Globe for best Actress in a Comedy or Musical and Glenn Close for her superb performance in The Wife in the Drama category..
Olivia Coleman gives a sensational portrayal of the ageing Queen Anne and yes this fine film has comedy in it as well as compelling dramatic moments thanks to the fine screenplay Tony McNamara and director Yorgos Lanthomos.
It reminded me of the 1988 Film Dangerous Liaisons but with the bawdiness of Tom Jones .
It's a tour de force for 3 fine actresses Olivia Coleman, Rachel Weiss and last years Golden Globe Best actress recipient Emma Stone.
The male actors are all fine but every scene is dominated expertly by these 3 fine actresses.
I'm not sure of the historical accuracy of Queen Anne or Sarah Churchill's relationship or of her influence over the Queen but who cares this is a fine screenplay and perfect example of when the Cast , The Director , and the Screenwriter are in perfect synch.
As a final comment thank goodness the Monarch has no constitutional power today who knows what devious characters lay in waiting to manipulate and trump them into irrational decisions like Brexit negotiations for instance.
Go see this fine example of great cinema and I can't wait to see Olivia's portrayal of Queen Elizabeth 2 in the next series of The Crown .Long Live Olivia."

","... I think The Favourite has the potential to be regarded as a classic. And, no, it is NOT a comedy, although a smattering of malevolent humour is present throughout.<br/><br/>This film messes with your mind. By turns, it is an unpleasant and uncomfortable watch, complete with a repetitive and deeply irritating score. It is also gives us magnificent performances from three actresses at the top of their game and fabulous support from Nicholas Hoult and Joe Alwyn in all their fantastically bewigged, foppish glory. Special mention must also go to the 17 bunnies and Horatio, The Fastest Duck in the City!<br/><br/>This is a fictional account of lives of the three main protagonists. The jury remains out concerning the true nature of the relationship between Queen Anne, Lady Sarah Churchill and Abigail Masham, although it is clear from historical records that, for a time at least, Anne and Sarah did share a close bond of friendship.<br/><br/>I came out of this film feeling confused, annoyed and empowered and it continues to make me think. Yorgos Lanthimos is a puppet master extraordinaire.<br/><br/>If Sandy Powell doesn't receive an Oscar for Costume Design, then there is no justice. Unfortunately, the Sound Department did a less impressive job, particularly in the scenes where Sarah and Abigail are shooting outdoors. The dialogue was was so obviously recorded in a studio and it stuck out like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>The Favourite is nasty, dark, menacing, sly and filthy. Impossible to warm to any of the characters but it IS possible to admire them.<br/><br/>Now, let's shoot something ...."

So glad to see his continued success!<br/><br/>Sadly though the accompanying sounds/music was very annoying. A constant temple throbbing pounding in two different scenes that really took away from my enjoyment.

"thesupertomster","8","3","6","12 January 2019"," Excellent
","The best way to describe The Favorite is a dramatic dark comedy packed with absurdism. While the film is mostly focussed on the shifting power dynamics between the three main characters, it it packed with comedic commentary on the 'everyday cruelty' of the time period and the ridiculous extravagance of the royal family.<br/><br/>The shots, colour scheme, wide lenses and lighting were chosen perfectly to illustrate the lavishness of the time period - darkened corridors lit by the orange glow of lamps are particularly stunning. All the acting was spectacular, especially Olivia Colman as Queen Anne. The minister of the opposition, played by Nicholas Hoult, also stole every scene he was in.<br/><br/>So, The Favorite is hilarious, dramatic, shocking, excellently shot and exactly what you would expect from Yorgos Lanthimos. If extremely sexual and somewhat disturbing films aren't your thing, maybe give this a miss, but otherwise I strongly recommend it."
"c-kelsall","8","3","6","11 January 2019"," Stylish, witty and original period drama
","I have a rapidly growing admiration for Yorgos Lanthimos (it doesn't exactly trip off the tongue, does it) as a director. I recently watched The Lobster, which is one of the most original, bonkers and fabulous films I've seen in a long time. So, quite a bit for Mr Lanthimos to live up to with his most current film, The Favourite.
The story covers a scarsely considered, brief period in British history, the latter days of the reign of Queen Anne, whos failure to produce an heir led to the house of Hanover taking over the British throne. On the face of it, it is hard to imagine how this era could be portrayed in any other light than one of sombre reflection, but the lightness of touch and wit evident here is very refreshing. The three principal characters are all women (Queen Anne played by the excellent Olivia Coleman, her principal political adviser and confidante Lady Marlborough, played by the wonderful Rachael Weisz, and Abigail the desperate newcomer played by the revelatory Emma Stone), which is highly unusual in big-budget film-making (even in this day and age), and the actors who play them are uniformly excellent. Someone I know made a valid point that none of them are terribly likeable characters, but that's sort of missing the point; they existed at a time when men typically dominated every aspect of life, so despite their favoured positions in the pecking order, they could only really exercise their influence on each other. They are also quite complex, 3-dimensional characters, with moods, rational and irrational behaviours, fears and regrets.
The film looks wonderful, with a variety of interesting shots, including a kind of fisheye effect used to great effect, the dialogue frequently sparkles with wit, and there is a lot of humour. Only later on does the tone turn more serious and sad, which reflects the overall change in the state of mind of the queen. The acting ranges from good to superb across the board, and I loved the artifice of the intermissions with Roman numerals and a character quotation, acting as a form of chapter heading; nothing new, but it fits the tone of the film perfectly. The only thing I took issue with was a small aspect of the soundtrack, involving two brief periods dominated by a two-note dirge, with what sounded like a single fiddle note followed by the pluck of a double bass, repeated ad nauseum. Mind you, that's just my personal feeling. Don't let it discourage you from seeing the film - it certainly wouldn't be the first time a bit of soundtrack distracted and annoyed me in a film which was otherwise excellent."

There were times when the sweeping angles and one camera set up made you feel nauseous- together with the overuse of fish eye lenses .<br/><br/>The central theme was strong with the rivalry between Lady Marlborough ( Rachel Weisz stole the show in this Lady Macbeth type role ) and a rising maid ( played affectionally by Emma Stone ) for the affection both in and out of the bed of a bisexual Queen Anne with the backdrop of conflicting politics surrounding the continuing war with France led by the national hero and distant relation of Winston Churchill the infamous Duke of Marlborough played excellently by Mark Gatis.<br/><br/>Olivia Coleman has come in for a lot of praise for her role as Queen Anne , but it was the suppprting cast who were so good that they stole the limelight , not least Nicholas Holt as the leader of the opposition.<br/><br/>It reminded me a bit of The draughtman's contract but with an appeal to a much larger audience , British cinema has come a long way since Chanel 4 revived it in the 1980s .<br/><br/>A enjoyable film with a few surprises if not just a little bit too long but certainly worth seeing and worthy of the praise it's getting .<br/><br/>Pad.A 8/10"

"Equalizer16","9","3","6","9 January 2019"," The Favourite is a very enjoyable, mad tale, webbed in glorious design,
","During the early 18th Century, Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman) becomes bedridden from a severe case of gout, while needing to tend to serious matters regarding the war with France. Her confidant; Sarah (Rachel Weisz) tends to the Queen's duties herself and comforts her in an extreme intimate nature. Arriving at the palace is Abigail (Emma Stone) cousin of Sarah who seeks employment , but is degenerately put to work in the slum kitchens where she is forced to sleep in a cramped room with countless others. While Anne is helpless in bed, Abigail sneaks her self into the Queen's favour becoming her new bedroom maid, toppling her friendship with Sarah, and emotively aggravating Sarah.<br/><br/>Within the first moments of the Favourite, I think you immediately decide whether you are on board with it, and I found myself in comfortable arms from the very beginning. In a very quick and witty story, the Favourite is an easily enjoyable and elegant tale, if you are compatible with the world of wigs and mad humour. Slightly far off the tone of Lanthimos previous films, unlike The Lobster (2015), and the Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), The Favourite is a less challenging and more entertaining watch.<br/><br/>This is systematically brought to life in widely smart and funny script by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara. The tension and powerplay in the narrative is almost Shakespearian with its wicked ensemble of double crossing. The pleasure of these character's quibble is truly smashing.<br/><br/>The film's true charm is achieved in the love triangle between Queen Anne, Sarah, and Abigail, as both court favourites compete over receiving the Queen's praise and friendship for their own gain. The talents of Coleman, Weisz and Stone are undoubtable expectational, with an exquisite dynamic on screen. Weisz is uptight and tough and an intimidating presence who dominates the film. Although still a confidant, Sarah seems to be really pulling the strings on he political matters. Sarah even walks over the spoilt childlike Anne who roams her palace helplessly shouting at her musicians and cuddling her seventeen rabbits. Coleman's British wackiness seems never out of place. Then Emma Stone; first a sweet and innocent Abigail is sympathetic lead, but gradually reveals only to be a self serving villain herself as she greases herself up to the Queen. Although Coleman's role had been identified as the lead, it feels at times that her presence is mostly overtaken by the performances of Weisz and Stone.<br/><br/>Additionally grand is the film's gorgeous periodical production design, covered in the delicate artwork infested hallways and ballrooms, to the coordinated outdoor gardens and palace landscapes. There is an almost post Barry Lyndon-esc serge that echoes through Robbie Ryan's sharp photography. There are frequent shots of spherical frames twisting the scale of the land, but capturing beautiful texture. With a high contrast with the palace rooms, the film's art direction powerfully embodies it's historical period, almost overwhelmingly so.<br/><br/>The Favourite is a very enjoyable, mad tale, webbed in glorious design, precisely crafted by Yorgos Lanthimos, but it's heart is truly made in the ensemble cast. If his other films are too weird for you, then I think the Favourite will be a much more amusing experience."
"birkeneds","8","3","6","8 January 2019"," Courting the absurd
","This film does not fit neatly into the established cinematic genres, which may account for some of the negative reaction it has received. Its narrative is in turn grotesque, bizarre, comic and tragic - and perhaps Lanthimos has begun to create a new kind of film - the cinema of the absurd. For some, this could take some getting used to as its sequencing will be unpredictable and its tone sometimes uncomfortable.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that the three central performances are of the highest quality, and Coleman in particular is inspired in her portrayal of the lost soul that is Queen Anne. It's not always easy to feel empathy for a monarch, but this was deftly achieved and deserves acclaim and awards.<br/><br/>The cinematography is perfectly pitched and frames the bestial dysfunctionality of the court - around each corner and in every nook and cranny the rich and powerful (mainly men) are behaving like spoilt children, debauching themselves in the shadow of the queen's weakness. The other main protagonists - Sarah and Abigail - are more ambitious, determined and focused in their exploitation of the situation. Nature abhors a vacuum, and Queen Anne's troubled isolation creates one. Meanwhile, outside the palace, there are murmurings of public unrest.<br/><br/>In its unique way, The Favourite is an evocative portrayal of a particular time and space in English history with an exploration of the dynamics of power and their interplay with sexuality."
"javierplameross","8","3","6","7 January 2019"," So clever and intriguin

Also, the pacing of this film is also a bit slow in points and halfway through the fourth act you'll begin to wonder where this movie is going. Lastly, the artsy ending will confuse you. It took me until the next morning finally get the aim of the ending."
"ccamp89","8","3","6","6 January 2019"," Strong 4 // Lanthimos' strongest yet
","It's a bit mystifying that a director as uncompromisingly weird as Yorgos Lanthimos has broken this far into the mainstream. Mystifying, and wonderful, of course. He's a filmmaker with a unique voice, strong creative vision, and, most importantly, the talent to fully realize that vision on screen. Look no further than his first two compellingly bizarre English language films, The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, for convincing evidence of this.<br/><br/>The Favourite is his strongest work yet. It's every bit as offbeat, darkly comedic, and unflinching as his past work but manages to be a tad more accessible, too. His typical comedically stilted and deadpan characters have been swapped for those with decidedly more... color. The emotional hysterics, conniving antics, and general bad behavior of the supposedly high-class characters here set against the pomp-and-circumstance backdrop give the film its beating comedic heart.<br/><br/>And what a backdrop it is. If for nothing else, see this film for its wonderfully over-the-top performances and gorgeous visual presentation. The castle and its grounds are stunning and Lanthimos frames it all with beautiful panoramic shots, natural lighting, and surprisingly well-utilized fisheye lenses. The camerawork is highly dynamic with lots of fast pans and tracking shots that truly capture the scale and space of the castle. And all three leads, as well as Nicholas Hoult in the supporting role, bring these despicable characters to life and lend so much to the entertainment value of the film in their performances.<br/><br/>The story here of opportunism, selfishness, and climbing the social ladder via nefarious methods is certainly something we've seen before, but the irreverent execution and transgressive love triangle at its center add more than enough freshness. It's certainly a timely story as well given the chaotic state of the White House over the past two years and had me reflecting quite a bit on how frighteningly close art can mirror reality.<br/><br/>And while not exactly a crowd-pleaser, the unexpectedly haunting and surrealistic closing moments really struck me. It's one of those endings that catches you off guard, imbalances you, and forces you to think back over the events of the film and the themes therein. What has Emma Stone's character achieved? Where has she left to go? It does an excellent job of grounding the film and bringing its melancholy tones up from below the surface.<br/><br/>My only major complaint is with the pacing and structure. The first 45 minutes or so are absolutely fantastic with every scene feeling vibrant and vital. The tension simmers and bubbles between Stone and Weisz's characters and their interactions give the film its backbone and narrative thrust. However, as a consequence of certain plot progressions in its latter half which I won't detail, this tension fizzles and with it the thrust. The film takes on a somewhat plodding quality and there is an air of anticlimax as we never really get a satisfying catharsis from the rivalry.<br/><br/>It was a notable issue for me, at least on first viewing, but it wasn't enough to significantly dampen the overall experience. And furthermore, I'm nothing but excited that an auteur like Lanthimos is getting as much exposure as he is, especially given his challenging and provocative style. It's exactly what I wish we had more of in the mainstream and gives me hope that future envelope-pushing directors can find their platform too.<br/><br/>Strong 4/5"

","My first reaction to this film was that it was gorgeous to look at, had three great performances and a mean-spirited and pretentious ending. I did find the central question, whether the person whose interests are with Anne's country and who is honest with her versus the person whose interests are with herself therefor is more inclined to make Anne happy is the ""better"" friend to be fascinating. Yet, I also found there to be a homophobic streak in this - with lesbian sex portrayed as a debauched manipulation - and an unpleasant cynical streak. However, when I thought about it, the film firmly seems to side with the ostensibly villain, The Duchess of Marlborough. Even though she commits the sin of ambition (terrible for a woman even now) and is blunt and political, in the end she wants the best for Anne and England as well as herself. Abigail is the villain even though she is the ostensible protagonist. It's a good film and a thought provoking one, but not one I would say I enjoyed."

Unfamiliar with most of the actors in the film, I enjoyed the chemistry between them and the truly comedic moments brought by each individual talents.
The overall plot was wild in itself, there would be moments where you had no idea what was happening but still were expected to believe it as a legitimate part of the story. It was incredibly unique, to say the least.

"markgorman","8","6","16","8 January 2019"," Period drama for the #MeToo generation.
","I am a big, big fan of Yorgos Lanthimos whose two previous deadpan comedic features (The Killing of a Scared Deer and The Lobster) are outstanding movies.<br/><br/>The feature of both of these movies is Lanthimos' extremely black humour delivered in a unique style.<br/><br/>However, for The Favourite Lanthimos has taken a big decision in abandoning the scriptwriting and handing the duties over to Deborah Davis (her debut) and Tony McNamara (lots of minor TV but no cinema history). It's a strange choice of writing team because they don't bring any previous to the mix, and neither are fresh-faced youths. But what they bring is an entirely different tonality to Lanthimos' work and that leaves him to focus on direction, with cinematography provided by Robbie Ryan, who made a big contribution (in my view) to American Honey. Indeed, the cinematography is a major talking point after the writing. Gone is Lanthimos' naturalistic, almost clinical, lighting of the Lobster and ""Deer"" instead, although we again go au natural, it's through a gloom of candle and fire light that renders the screen largely black for a great deal of its 2+ hours.<br/><br/>His frequent choice of extreme wide angle (almost fish eye) lens to capture the scale of the huge palace rooms is highly unusual in cinema and is much more like stills photography. One scene, shot in a long corridor, makes it look like a u-bend when in fact it is completely straight - unlike the principal characters!<br/><br/>But the real meat here is this terrific all female star line-up. In the #MeToo era this is a real vote of confidence in female actors with attitude and sheer quality. Come March it is entirely possible that all of the leads; Olivia Coleman (national treasure that she is), Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone will be career Oscar winners because Coleman's performance is quite brilliant. The other two already hold this distinction and each has a good chance of adding to their trophy haul.<br/><br/>Although, As Queen Anne, Coleman (who gained 2.5 stone to play the gout-ridden Queen's part) is the designated lead, the film is essentially a three player ensemble with some ineffectual men put into bat to be made to look ridiculous and, oh, they do in Sandy Powell's outrageous costumes and Beverley Binda's even more outrageous hair and make up. (""You look like a dead badger"" Weisz tells the Queen as she sets out on a royal engagement.)<br/><br/>The story echoes All About Eve as Queen Anne's favourite lady in waiting, and lesbian lover, Lady Sarah Marlborough, The Wife of the Duke of Marlborough who is leading the war with France, is gradually pushed out of favouritism by one time lady and now servant girl, Abigail (Emma Stone). Although she does not go without fight.<br/><br/>This is where the scriptwriting team get the nod to create a bawdy and vicious rivalry set in a Draughtsman Contract-esque world.<br/><br/>Overindulgence, poisoning and illness leads to all three leads vomiting at least once each, reflecting this world of excess.<br/><br/>The music track is at times intrusive, but to my mind in a good way; it's a sort of early 18th Century version of Atticus Rose and Trent Resnor's soundtrack to The Social Network.<br/><br/>What everyone is talking about is the lead performances. Each is supremely talented and each is given so much scope to truly flex their acting muscles that what results is an acting master-class. In the trailer it seems like a knockabout farce but in reality the movie is actually quite slow-paced with moments of true hilarity and enough foul language to shock some of our more prurient audience members. That said, my wife who abhors the C-word volunteered that it was used to great effect several times in this.<br/><br/>The lesbian relationships Queen Anne enjoyed are worthy of note. In a life that saw her lose 17 children (5 still born and many miscarried) her tipping of the velvet was, apart from a bulimic relationship with food, one of her few pleasures. Both Lady Marlborough and Abigail are adept in their duty to pleasure their monarch.<br/><br/>The first half belongs to Rachel Weisz but Coleman steadily comes into her own as the movie progresses. Emma Stone plays a beautifully judged and paced role in which she will do anything to get ahead - but in the end it's Coleman who wins the day, with the last 20 minutes belonging to her as she suffers the consequences of the vagaries of her life. Her portrayal of Queen Anne as a stroke victim is as good a performance as you will see anywhere this year.<br/><br/>It's a fascinating movie, although I'm not convinced it's quite as good as its hype. That said, for lovers of history and lovers of Olivia Coleman it has to be seen."

","""By fire and by knife, enternally this world advances"". These are the brutal words by which a famous Greek poem/song describes to its main character how our world works.<br/><br/>These are also the exact words and feelings that came to my mind after watching this film. 2 characters that will do whatever it takes to be the favourite/prevailing one.<br/><br/>In one of the last scenes, where Rachel Weisz reveals her true self and love by admitting that love means being sometimes inpolitely honest, the film brilliantly presents to us our true nature. We very often misjudge, hold grudges, do not want to accept reality. And off course (we) people take advantage of each others flaws and imperfections. In the end we have to live with our decisions; in many cases not satisfied and depressed by them (last scene).<br/><br/>In summary, this film gives us a taste of reality in an absurb sureal way. And this is why it is a great movie.<br/><br/>Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz and Olivia Colman are simply amazing.<br/><br/>I would totally recommend people to watch ""The Favourite"""
"JankiSharma","10","6","16","15 December 2018"," Needy women can be favorites
","The movie The Favourite directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (think often of his movie The killing of a sacred Deer) is extremely interesting and tells the story of Queen Anne(excellent acting by Olivia Colman) and her reign and relationships with women between 1707 -1714. Loss of 17 children and Queen Anne's moments of depression, despair and helplessness and attachment to her bunnies are shown very well. Lady Sarah , a married woman (superb Rachel Weisz) and her discipline in learning politics and showing true love, caring and compassion for physically frail and mentally sad Queen Anne are great. And then comes Abigail, simple , nice and loving (my favorite Emma Stone) as a maid but desires to be treated and live like a lady because she knows she is a lady. But then Abigail realizes being nice would never get her what she desires. Abigail becomes hateful and evil and causes lot of pain to Lady Sarah. When Abigail sheds a tear and the scene when she tramples upon one of 17 bunnies is very touching. Terrific movie and I am glad I saw this 119 minute movie . Music is great and the cinematography is very pleasing. Definite Oscars. Emma Stone is nice, childish, graceful, kind, rude, mean and cruel as Abigail. Great acting by Emma Stone. Terrific acting by Olivia Colman as someone in power, rich, depressed, sad, needy, affectionate, afraid to be alone, lonesome . Oscar worthy."

"jboothmillard","8","5","13","10 January 2019"," The Favourite
","The first two or three months of the new year mean Awards Season, I saw a good number of short clips and pictures for this movie, and I had a good feeling it would receive nominations and acclaim, so I went to see it, from Oscar and BAFTA nominated director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster). Basically set in the early 18th century, Britain is at war with France, and Queen Anne (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Olivia Colman) sits on the throne, she is extremely frail and ill due to gout. Anne shows little interest in governing the country, preferring instead to be doing eccentric activities, including racing ducks and playing with her seventeen rabbits, representing the children she has lost over the years. Anne's confidante and adviser Lady Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Rachel Weisz) effectively rules the country by the confidences she passes to the Queen. Sarah's efforts to control Anne are undermined by Parliament member and influential landowner Robert Harley (Nicholas Hoult), who is responsible for bringing in state taxes for the war. Abigail Hill (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Emma Stone) is the impoverished younger cousin of Sarah, she arrives at Court seeking employment. Abigail is formerly a lady in society, but her father gambled away her family's good name, and he handed over his daughter to settle his debts to a German. Abigail is initially forced to do menial work as a scullery maid in the palace, but she sees an opportunity to ingratiate herself with Sarah, and eventually the Queen. Seeing Anne's condition, she uses herbs to aid the Queen's inflamed legs, she is initially punished by Sarah for her presumption. But the remedy eases the Queen's suffering, in gratitude Sarah makes Abigail her lady-in-waiting. Harley approaches Abigail, he hopes to use her as a spy in order to find out about Sarah's scheming and figure out a way to bypass her authority. Abigail initially rejects him, but then she is shocked to discover the secret lesbian relationship between Anne and Sarah. Abigail becomes interested in Anne's homosexual inclination and begins planning her own ascent to win the Queen's favour. While Sarah is focused on the war effort, Abigail takes advantage of her preoccupation to form a close friendship with Anne, who is easily influenced, and it soon develops into a sexual relationship. Sarah soon becomes aware of Abigail's plotting, she tells the Queen she needs to continue the war and double the tax, she also attempts to have Abigail removed from service and sent away. To get rid of Sarah, Abigail poisons her tea with herbs from the garden, these cause Sarah to fall off her horse while riding, and the horse panics and drags her away into the forest, she vanishes for several days. Queen Anne believes that Sarah has temporarily abandoned her in order to make her jealous, so she takes Abigail into her favour. Her first reward is to be allowed to accept the marriage proposal of Samuel Masham, 1st Baron Masham (Joe Alwyn), the marriage reinstates Abigail's noble standing as a baroness. Sarah was found bruised, bloodied and unconscious in the forest, she wakes up with a large scar on her cheek, she is being sheltered in a brothel. Sarah eventually returns to court and issues an ultimatum to Anne: send Abigail away, or she will release the secret letters between her and Anne that detail their sexual relationship to the press. This threat backfires and destroys the relationship between Anne and Sarah, Sarah does burn the letters to amend things, but she is ultimately stripped of her offices and sent away from court. Abigail is promoted to Keeper of the Privy Purse, she uses her status to present what she claims to be evidence that Sarah had been embezzling money, which is in fact an innocent win, but Sarah and her husband are exiled from Britain. Following her victory, Abigail's ego and gluttony for luxury starts to inflate the same way Sarah's did, in a moment of maliciousness she abuses on of the Queen's rabbits, but Anne notices this and takes immediate offense. Anne responds by pulling Abigail's hair and ordering her to massage her legs as a servant would. Anne re-establishes her stature as Queen, and it appears Abigail is forced to accept becoming subservient again. Also starring Mark Gatiss as John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, James Smith as Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin and Jenny Rainsford as Mae. Colman gives a fantastic performance as the erratic, temperamental and often child-like ruler, Stone is good as the fallen aristocrat worming her way up and becoming more manipulative and sadistic, and Weisz is great being the astute and fearsome political puppeteer, and Hoult is memorable as the posh and sneaky aristocrat. The story explores the reign of Queen Anne, through the deceptions and cunning rivalry of the cousins trying to become the Queen's ""favourite"", I certainly questioned how much of the story was based on fact, there is a lot of swearing and adult material going on, wonderfully weird at times, it is well written, the costumes and period detail is great, and the dark material is divine, a must-see historical period comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Outstanding British Film of the Year, Best Original Screenplay, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Editing and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!"
"RforFilm","7","5","13","7 January 2019"," The Favourite is so odd that you'll either love it or hate it. It's characters and relationships make it good
","In any high-pressure position (political, business, entertainment, etc...), power is the most addictive drug anyone can succumb to. Most can tell that once your at the top of something, it's hard to imagine your life before that or after. It really has to do with that subconscious instinct in which all people want to feel important. Once they do become important, it's scary for them to think that no one would want to listen anymore. They have more authority and can feel like a king in their own domain. So the longer they retain that power, the harder it becomes to accept should they lose it.<br/><br/>Today's movie deals with a interesting situation involving three people that are addicted to power; one who is starting from the bottom, one whose been at the top for a while, and another at the top whose mental state is becoming worse. Putting two together is bad enough, but a third one can only create chaos. The situation happened more often then not in a monarch, especially an older one. For the situation within The Favourite, we find a mad queen, her lesbian lover, and a woman who sees potential in a declining crazy person.<br/><br/>It's the early eighteenth century where Brittan is at war with France. Queen Anne (played by Olivia Colman) is suffering physical ailments and is losing her interest in politics in favor of wealthy parties and caring for her seventeen rabbits, which also represent her seventeen children that have passed on. Because of her disconnect with parliament, her confidant and lover Sarah Churchill (played by Rachel Weisz) has so much influence that she pretty much runs the country from ideas she passes onto the queen. At the same time, a new state tax is initiated from a landowner Robert Harley (played by Nicholas Hoult) that proves to be unpopular with the rest of parliament.<br/><br/>One way, Sarah's younger cousin Abigail Hill (played by Emma Stone) arrives in the queens court for a job. Abigail once came from a baron family, but lost it when her father lost her in a gamble. She's hired to work as a scullery maid, but ends up winning the queens approval when she offers herbs that soothe pain from gout. Abigail becomes the queens lady-in-waiting and soon learns about the affair between Anne and Sarah. It becomes a power game when the younger cousin starts to gain a friendship with the queen while Sarah's power is challenged.<br/><br/>The Favourite is the kind of movie that is the example of divisive. People are either going to like this or hate it. I personally liked it enough to say that it works more as a comedy then a historical retelling. The historical aspect is good, but ill get to that in a bit. The reason this works is because of the characters and the relationships their a part of.<br/><br/>This is a movie that belongs to all three of the main stars; Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone. I'm not sure how accurate everything was, but these feel like oddball, but dangerous people I could see within government. Olivia hits the points of carrying a lot of nobility and worsening mental state, yet never leaning too far to one side. Rachel Weisz is great as a serial manipulator whose had years of experience pulling off the job. And of course, Emma Stone is one of the better two-facers I've seen in cinema; playing herself as delicate when she needs to be, and then back stabbing the next. Her performance is almost on par with Scarlet in Gone With the Wind.<br/><br/>As far as the movie goes, this is where people are going to come at a crossroads. Director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster) knows how to make the palaces and costumes feel big with the constant use of wide angles and fisheye shots. In fact, there isn't too much use of movement, even though everything still feels fluid. This is either going to pull people into the story or detract them. It can sometimes be a little distracting as it does try to be more ""artsy"" then it needs to be.<br/><br/>I'll give this seven racing ducks out of ten. The Favourite fits in the same category of Baroque historical movies like Barry Lyndon and Amadeus. It's clear that a mainstream audience isn't going to be as invested as they would for a blockbuster. But that's why I give this more credit; it knows it's audience it's trying to reach. If your hungry for power and a more oddball royalty movie then your used to, then check it out."

I'm not sure what exactly this movie was trying to be but I would recommend it if you had some spare time a liked a period flic... i did however walk away from the film feeling a lot of anxiety because the music was so unbelievably intense and there were so many dragged out close up shots of people's faces not doing anything I felt like it was a never ending fever dream. but pretty good if you arent an anxious person"

"Shoshobe","8","5","13","23 December 2018"," It's Good to Be the Queen
","The Favourite is a movie that tells the real life interesting story of Queen Anne (Colman) who did, indeed, allow herself to be influenced and manipulated by two women that were total polar opposites -- the extremely wealthy and beautiful Duchess of Marlborough (Weisz) who bullied the Queen, and the Duchess' lower class cousin Abigail Masham (Stone) who flattered the Queen. While this serves as the core story-line, the movie takes on its own interpretations to fill in the historical gaps, although many of which are actually based upon reliable sources.<br/><br/>Ultimately, The Favourite is a well-done historical drama with some comedic elements, and packaged in a way that brings the early 18th century English court alive with beautiful sets/locations, elaborate costumes, and dry wit that is typical of English dialogue.<br/><br/>While there are many reviews from others complaining that the movie was boring and lacking on comedic content, perhaps they missed that this is a historically based story intended to be realistic. So you shouldn't expect to see a real 18th century Queen of England to be depicted as a stand-up Sarah Silverman delivering a litany of crude, adolescent jokes. If that is what you are looking for, you probably need look no further than the $1 movie bin at Walmart."

The poor reviews seemed to be more written by people. Made me wonder if a the good reviews were, ahem, promoted by someone with a vested interest? Yesterday the rank was 7.8. That's really over the top high. So, i was curious.<br/><br/>It was odd. The music, or cacophony, was - as i read in prior reviews, not only distracting, it made the thing hard to watch. The acting seemed fine. But the story line was bizarre, it was utterly unrealistic. There was a dance scene - I don't' even know how to describe it. Was it break dancing? Just bizarre - and not in an entertaining way. If it's a period piece, then, try to have some rational relation to what things might have been like then. If it's a modern perspective, telling a story that takes place 200 years ago, then go with that. Sometimes, a blend works. This one didn't.<br/><br/>I would have given it a 1, the points above were so disappointing. But, the acting was fine."

"M_Exchange","5","9","30","2 December 2018"," Dreary, Depressing, Tedious.... Sporadically Entertaining
","If Tarantino directed this film I think it would be titled ""The Hateful Three""--- but maybe the queen character isn't quite as hateful as she is pitiable.<br/><br/>There were times when I didn't want to follow any of their lives just because they were so abhorrent. Usually when people are unlikeable I want to follow them if the comedy is working. In this case, I laughed at very few of the film's jokes. A lot of this story seemed like a study in psychopathy-- especially with Emma Stone's character.<br/><br/>Also, the man who pursued Stone's character reminded me of so many *modern* American men who pursue soulless and uninterested American women just because they're pretty-- women who eventually make cuckolds of them. I rarely flirt with any woman, and when she shows the slightest sign of disinterest to me I withdraw my attention to her immediately. So even many of the male characters in this movie were nauseating to me.<br/><br/>The final shots in the film are tedious to the extreme. When directors got close shots of Steve McQueen's facial expressions they knew that he could emote so much without even speaking lines. In this case, with the extreme closeups of Stone and Olivia Colman, it's painfully pretentious. It did nothing for me.<br/><br/>It has merits, though. The acting is good, and it's generally entertaining regardless of its despicable characters. I wasn't really thinking, ""when is this thing going to end?"" until its final ten minutes."

","Wow! If you ever needed proof that favourable reviews from critics are bought and paid for, look no further. This is the biggest piece of excrement I've seen in many, many years of watching films.<br/><br/>Super annoying soundtrack that gets on your nerves very quickly. The acting has been praised to high heaven which is baffling. The worst miscasting here is Emma Stone who not only struggles with a dodgy British accent but has had very obvious plastic surgery on her face (nose job, eye work), which makes her ill fitting for a period piece which takes place some 300 years ago. Not only that, she's also very prude and chickened out on all the nudity except the minimal contractual stuff she had to do to get cast. And that is very short and poorly lit at that. Why cast someone clearly uncomfortable with such explicit material in the first place? There are lots of actresses who could easily replace her in that part.<br/><br/>Olivia Coleman is all strained camp as the pathetic disease ridden queen. Onenote and silly. Rachel Weisz is good but then again she's always terrific. Very underrated actress in general.<br/><br/>The second best actor in this film is Nicholas Hoult but I have to subtract points for the very blatant and not at all subtle misandrist propaganda peddled in this film. Every male character is a fool, a pervert, a rapist or someone to abuse and step on to gain power. Very disgusting by the filmmakers. And if the women have sex with a man in the film it's an awful chore and something they disinterestedly suffer through. Everyone 4 sure is a lesbian though (that's the LGBTQ-agenda peeking through). F men, am I right?!<br/><br/>The cinematography is appaling with severe abuse of fish eye photography to an almost dizzying degree. The Favourite is being billed as a comedy/musical which is not only bizarre but frankly dishonest. I've never seen such an unfunny film. People saying the F-word and the C-word repeatedly or Emma Stone talking about selling her a-hole to sailors does not a comedy make.<br/><br/>Then we have the glacial pacing to suffer through. It goes on forever. It's only 2 hours but it feels like 2 weeks. I don't mind a long movie so it's not an add thing on my part. If I come across The Good The Bad And The Ugly you best believe I'm watching all of it with joy.<br/><br/>Anyway, to sum this up, ignore the praise by paid shills and critics. This is a vile, overlong, unfunny piece of crap. I'm sure this will win a boat load of awards though.<br/><br/>Awful, awful film and a waste of money."

","Let me begin by saying that this is the best film of the year. The Favourite is simply exquisite, mischievous and irreverent. I've followed Yorgos Lanthimos since The Lobster, and with this film he has proven to be one of the most original filmmakers today.<br/><br/>Everything about The Favourite is perfect. Since I saw the trailer, it was love at first sight. The acting ensemble is absolutely phenomenal. I refer not only to the trio of ladies, but also to Nicholas Hoult. I would nominate them all for their performances. However, the Oscar belongs to Olivia Colman. Her performance has to be one of the best I've seen in recent years.<br/><br/>The Favorite is a true masterpiece because it's unique, eccentric and politically incorrect. In my opinion, it's art in one of its most rare forms. I would easily give this film over 10 Academy Award nominations, with a total of 5 definite wins for Best Motion Picture, Best Director, Best Leading Actress (Colman), Original Screenplay and Production Design.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I doubt The Favourite will win the Oscar for Best Picture as Green Book and Roma have swept most award shows. Regardless, The Favourite will stand the test of time as the cult film it is. The Favourite is one of the best examples why the seventh art is still alive.<br/><br/>Score: 10/10<br/><br/>FJ Medina"

Wounds, ulcers, foul language, blood, vomit, toilet habits, oral sex, rape, mud, drunkenness, capriciousness, hitting, shouting, overindulgence, silly foppishness, humiliation of people and cruelty to animals are all on display.<br/><br/>Now those who know their history will be under no illusions that past times were crude in their way, and by no means obviously more ""elegant"" than the times we live in today. There was anyway still - in the early 18th century - a kind of understandable reaction to Puritanism of the 17th.<br/><br/>It is also more than conceivable that Queen Anne (here played by Olivia Colman) did indeed have a fully-fledged lesbian relationship with her favourite, the Duchess of Marlborough (a strong role for Rachel Weisz). Likewise Sarah's (aristocratic, but on hard times) cousin Abigail Masham (nee Hill) (played here by American actress Emma Stone with a faultless accent) really did exist, and really was another favourite of Her Majesty. So much of what is portrayed in the all-female triangle here might indeed have happened.<br/><br/>And men really were foppish back then.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>In the first place, Anne had tremendous health and other difficulties in her life, and while these are portrayed in near-excruciating detail, this is deliberately done callously and heartlessly - to the extent that I felt moved, and sorry for Anne, just once - at the moment when she took the rabbits from the cages and let them run around, making it clear that they were in some way substitutes for her 17 lost children. The makers claim that there IS sympathy for Her Majesty in their ""black comedy"" film, but I searched long and hard for the sympathy and found it only this once. (I also looked for the comedy, and found that elusive too). But anyway, it is true, painstaking genius of a kind to expunge all other sympathy for a sympathetic figure from a 2-hour movie.<br/><br/>Anne deserves a better, kinder fate than this!<br/><br/>A similar kind of process afflicts the portrayal of my country - the United Kingdom - a polity that actually came into being during the reign of Queen Anne, as conceivably the most earth-shatteringly important ""invention"" in the whole history of human civilisation. This does not appear in the film, and while the ""glories"" of Marlborough's victories in Europe cannot be ignored by it, they are also to some extent belittled and ridiculed, and that is fair enough. While those wars resulted in the construction of Blenheim Palace (a topic that does briefly make its appearance), and while that had a little bit to do with the coming into existence centuries later of one Winston Churchill, they need not concern us unduly in 2019.<br/><br/>Mores seriously, there is not a hint here of the country of creative genius and scientific and artistic assertiveness that was beginning to take shape during Anne's reign. There was a kind of mini Golden Age in those 12 years - as historians doing their own reassessment of history are increasingly telling us; and any form of even minimally straight or fair presentation of that truth strays so far from the intentions of this film's makers that there is obviously no chance that they would even allude to it.<br/><br/>Call that a pity if you will, call it an oversight, or elect to reinterpret the word ""reimagining"" as deliberate/cunning/manipulative/heavy-handed misrepresentation. It's your free choice as a viewer - actual or potential - to do that."

","This film was quite the surprise as going into it, I thought it would be a great film, but oh boy was that expectation surpassed by a significant milestone. This film has some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen. The shot placement is sublime as the shots swivel almost like a remote-control chair. I adored this film. The way the film was shot and acted is evident in its level of craftsmanship that Director: ""Yorgos Lanthimos"" puts into this film is simply staggering and mind-blowing.<br/><br/>In terms of the acting front, all three main actresses shine and are each given their own arcs to overcome and it's really a beauty to behold. To witness how these characters, transform before your very eyes into these dastardly deceitful monsters. By the end I could not tell the difference between either one in terms of their characters and that is most certainly a good thing.<br/><br/>""Olivia Colman"", ""Emma Stone"" and ""Rachel Weisz"" all are wonderful as the three main cast members. The film allows the audience to dive into their characters and see them for what the characters truly are. Horrible people. They seemingly have no sympathy towards the other inhabitants of the castle. They are in for themselves and only themselves and it is simply a true joy to witness the slow and painful deconstruction of each character. Not to mention the film is quite hilarious at points. It's physical and dialogue-based humor hits the spots of aching laughter that it wanted out of me quite triumphantly.<br/><br/>The also really loved the way the film moves through its story. The film runs on a chapter by chapter basis. I believe it benefits massively from that structure because not only were the chapter titles briefly mentioned in snappy and clever dialogue, but because it felt to me like the film was naturally going through the story. Like a sharp minded artist does their artwork. I also loved the way characters talked to each other, it was natural not only for the period that the film was set, but also in its contemporary nature. It never compromised or talked down to the audience. It felt like real dialogue. Things that people at that time would talk about to no end. It was so delightful and like a cup of cool icy water on a hot day, refreshing."

Although the facts were misunderstood, there was at least one subject, and certainly it was gripping. It was a palace film, which consisted of the lesbian relationship of a woman and nothing more. It was very weak in terms of artistic view. It doesn't give any information. There was nothing more than a subliminal message. I'm just disgusted and I'm disgusted with people and relationships.

Women, while always lacking in their contributions to science or art or philosophy, were never absent from the realms of power, as queens and female prime ministers, sometimes hysterical, but often extremely cruel, are well known through history. This movie sheds some light on the intrigue and backstabbing dealings on the court of Queen Anne, and shows that when sociopathy is concerned, women have it all over men, and that evil potential has been cultivated on the British isles, to the benefit of the aristocratic and powerful yet de generate, and via the violent abuse of the Indian and countless other imperial and later shrunken UK subjects, since Anne to Victorian age to Margaret the iron witch.

","""The Favourite"" is a film with lots of visual beauty, and it uses it to distract from lots of ugliness.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The story within ""The Favourite"" is rather uninteresting and petty. It feels an awful lot like an 18th century version of ""Mean Girls."" It relies heavily upon being absurd in order to generate laughs, however it often falls short of bringing laughter. Lanthimos is given way too much credit for this film and is praised for his wacky style. Personally, I don't get it. *Cinematography/Editing: The cinematography is simply distracting. It looks beautiful, sure, but it distracts from the film. The fish-eye lens looks so out of place and ridiculous. Robbie Ryan seems to confuse beauty with duty in this film. The camera moves completely took me out of the 18th century feel. That may have been the point, I just think it is dumb. The editing is on par for what it should be. *Dialogue/Acting: Some interesting dialogue choices. It keeps interest throughout the film. The acting is quite impressive. Emma Stone delivers one of her best performances. She manages to not be cringey which is always a feat for her. Rachel Weisz is brilliant as always. Olivia Coleman shines as the least shiny human being in the film. Nicholas Hoult delivers a great supporting performance. *Music/Sound: Very average work in these departments. *Production Design/Special Effects: The sets and costumes are phenomenal. One of the highlights of the film without question. Every single part of the frame was gorgeous. There are not many moments involving special effects, but they are believable when they come around.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""The Favourite"" is a decent film, but nothing overly special to rant and rave about. It was entertaining and enjoyable, but with likely be forgotten in a few months time, or at least it should be."
"exilednuma","1","3","7","4 February 2019"," Shockingly Awful
","I didn't know really what to expect from this film tbh. I'd seen the trailers but hey they aren't always too helpful. What I do know is that this isn't what I expected. Within minutes of the film starting the first C-bomb exploded. There was many more all gratuitous and unnecessary!
There was masterbation, gluttonous eating leading to vomiting and then more gluttonous eating. The music? Jeez it was awful!
I went with my wife, the cinema was packed out, there was the odd chuckle through the film but there was a lot of silence. This film Is a period drama set in the early eighteenth century. I'm sure there was plenty of debauchery in those times but I'm just not sure what this was about and what was the point.
The ending was an 'oh my god, is that it?' moment.
We sat there for a few moments looking at each other, while looking around the cinema at other cinema goers seeing the look of disbelief at what had just been shown, scratching their heads as they put on their coats.
We walked out, I said to my wife, what the bloody hell was that we've just watched? She said if we'd been at home watching it on tv she'd have left the sofa and done the laundry. A couple in front of us turned and they just said it was weird, well acted but awful all the same. We all agreed we will not be buying the dvd. I genuinely cannot remember the last time I saw a film so awful. I believe this film has been nominated for ten Oscars though I may be mistaken.
A couple of weeks ago we saw Stan & Ollie. A delightful film of drama, history, nineteenth century period settings and absolutely charming. I expected Oscar nominations galore for that and was disappointed to see its lack of....

I won't simplify the plot to avoid spoilers but it really didn't justify a 2 hour film.

"crazychameleon16","9","3","7","3 January 2019"," Yorgos Lanthimos returns with a delightful, dark power play in Baroque England
","Lanthimos has arisen in fame due to being one of the most original film makers in the business and whilst ""The Favourite"" is certainly Lanthimos' most mainstream film and the first time he has directed a film not screen written by him, it is very much his own work, full of the quirks you've come to expect from the auteur. Unsurprising, his cold approach, dark humour and jarring soundtrack may put some off, but I for one, was not.<br/><br/>Set amidst the political turmoil of the War of Spanish Succession and loosely based off historical events (the truth probably involved less cunnilingus), this male dominated world of 18th century England finds three members of the female sex at the centre of its story. It is hard to go further without first discussing those three central performances of the film. Unsurprisingly its triumvirate of Olivia Colman as the volatile and melancholic Queen Anne, Rachel Weisz as the steely, caustic Duchess Sarah Churchill, and Emma Stone as the ambitious, artful Abigail Hill help to steal the show in an acting masterclass. I particularly loved Weisz's portrayal of Sarah Churchill as Queen Anne's oldest best friend, confidante and clandestine lover who users her position to rule the country through the Queen for her family's benefit although she undoubtedly harbours love for Anne. Facing off against her is Stone's Abigail Hill, Sarah's cousin whose father had fallen from grace leaving her as a lowly maid. However once offered the chance by Sarah Churchill to lift herself out of poverty, Abigail will quickly ditch her integrity and will stop at nothing to ensure her future security and prosperity.<br/><br/>At the centre of this salacious story of betrayal and manipulation which would make Tywin Lannister proud is Colman's Queen Anne who cuts a pathetic figure, physically burdened with gout and myopia as well as emotionally ruined by the loss of every one of her seventeen children/pregnancies. Colman's performance draws a narrow line, helping humanise her character whilst still maintaining a great sense of comedic timing as she is browbeaten and flattered by Sarah Churchill and Abigail Hill respectively.<br/><br/>The unfolding high stakes battle is gripping as it is funny, populated with all the vanity and pompous excess to be expected from a Baroque court of a slightly unhinged queen, the men each donned out in outrageous wigs, garish mascara and extravagant clothes in direct contrast to the washed out, colour palette of the women's costumes. Rarely subtle in direction department, ""The Favourite"" features bizarre low shots, distorting fish-eye lenses and is sound tracked to a mixture of baroque music and Lanthimos' characteristic discordant and often overpowering score. Despite an ambiguous and somewhat abrupt ending, ""The Favourite"" was everything I wanted it to be and more, an absurd satire and cynical assessment of human motivation which made me laugh and marvel at some stellar performances along the way."
"2001ASOfan","7","3","7","26 December 2018"," Viewers pay to be reprimanded for enjoying the first two-thirds of the film
","As I left the theater I realized I had just been punished in the end by the director/writers of ""The Favourite"" for earlier laughing at/with their own depictions of royalty and royalty wannabes squabbling and performing cruel acts on each other in their one-up efforts. The ending section is clearly meant to throw viewers into a last-minute depression and sadness for the awfulness of it all after about 2 hours of romping in the sometimes darkly silly childishness of human behavior. It didn't sit well with me, but it will with some others, and that's fine. It's a ""life lesson"" film, then, disguised as a darkly comic romp (trailers for the film are particularly deceptive in making it seem a full-on comedy). Again, fine, but I'd learned this lesson long ago in life, and didn't enjoy the fact I'd spent money to eventually be preached to, in a quietly withering way, that I should feel bad for laughing earlier. The film is admittedly well-made and acted, but it's ultimately a true downer, and depressing as hell."
"jg_1977","9","3","7","24 December 2018"," Best Lanthimos film to date
","As a big fan of Yorgos Lanthimos' previous two English-language films, The Lobster (2015) and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), I was quite ready to dive back into another one of his unsettling and darkly comedic movies, and I'm happy to say, The Favourite (2018) did not disappoint. Although I'm guessing it will take a second and third viewing to be able to fully appreciate The Favourite, I think it's safe to say, that it is Lanthimos' best made film to date. From a purely technical standpoint, The Favourite outdoes the previously mentioned films thanks to its painstakingly detailed set and costume designs, unnerving score, clever editing, and stunning cinematography. However, what makes it the best of Lanthimos' filmography is the writing (thanks to screenwriters Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara), acting (specifically, the main trio of actresses), and Lanthimos' own bizarre directing. Although Lanthimos' credit to this film can't be understated, the screenplay, penned by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, is what sets it apart from The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Unlike Lanthimos' other films, The Favourite isn't nearly as avant-garde nor detached in its story telling. The audience is able to connect to the characters, who are all allowed depth and complexity, and each are given understandable arcs. It helps that this time around, Lanthimos really let his actors act, whereas with his other works, the characters deliver each line completely deadpan, heightening the detachment from reality. Speaking of the acting, this might be the strongest part of the entire film. Olivia Colman offers the performance of her career, making the Queen Anne tragic, hilarious, and endearing. Meanwhile, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz prove once more why they are both hard-hitting actresses, playing off of each other masterfully. As mentioned, it is Lanthimos unique directorial style, how he uses each element in combination, that makes The Favourite so special. In particular, Lanthimos' use of the camera and lighting is spectacular. The Favourite is a darkly comedic, at times unsettling, and smartly crafted film, worthy of being seen on the big screen. Lanthimos has raised the bar for his films, and I absolutely can't wait to see what he does next."

","I was asked whether I liked the movie. After thinking about it I said it was well crafted. The take on the story was fresh, the music matched and both the plot and diversions were imaginative. All of the actors did well and I would not be surprised if Olivia Colman walks away with an Oscar. I anticipated the pace of the movie and the lighting and scenery felt authentic. I guess the issue is it felt like it was trying to be ""cinema"" rather than just a movie. For me, it was like watching La Dolce Vita or Touch of Evil, where I could appreciate the effort, but I wouldn't recommend them to someone that wanted to spend an evening at the movies."
"gortx","Null","3","7","11 December 2018"," Lanthimos' baroque royal menage a trois dark comedy
","Yorgos Lanthimos' THE FAVOURITE is a mordant menage a trois film about royalty. 18th century Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman) is portrayed as a doddering ruler getting played by her attendant, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz). A new servant has arrived at the palace, Abigail (Emma Stone), and she too learns to use her whiles to get her way with the weak Queen.
The screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara is full of biting wit, each character setting out to use their tongue like a rapier. The three ladies take - and dominate strongly = center stage, but the men in the cast including Nicholas Hoult, James Smith and Joe Alwyn hold their own in clear supporting parts. The script, while sharp at times, also lets itself fall prey to anachronisms and modern phrasing - certainly part of the construct, but a bit more polish could have made it less distracting (and, if one of the writers weren't a woman the frequent use of the ""C"" word would have stood out even more).
Lanthimos (working from other writers words for the first time since he debut feature), still manages to put his undeniably offbeat stamp on the project. The cinematography (on 35mm by Robbie Ryan) is baroque in its use of wide-angle lenses (too much so) and the compilation soundtrack combines both period classical music (Bach, Handel) as well as more contemporary experimental sounds by Messiaen and Ferrari. It's an, at times, uneasy blend - as Lanthimos, no doubt intended. The nod to Ingmar Bergman's PERSONNA is carried off with a deadpan Lanthimos twist.
While the actresses carry the tricky dialogue and directorial quirks with aplomb (hard to pick an...ahem...favourite among the trio), the movie eventually bogs down by the last couple of acts (the film is broken down into eight chapters). Once the three main characters are set, there aren't enough surprises to drive the drama. Even the acrid dialogue loses steam as it goes along. THE FAVOURITE is a well played film, but not fully realized."

","Having just been to watch The Favourite today, I think it would be of value to remind myself of an all too important definition... Black comedy, also referred to as Dark comedy, is a style of comedy that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo, particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss. Often used as a tool for exploring vulgar issues, thus provoking discomfort and serious thought as well as amusement in their audience.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Favourite indeed fulfils this definition consistently and delivers accurately and handsomely what was promised by the script. A period costume drama movie like no other. For some reason, Kubrick's Barry Lyndon came to mind whilst watching The Favourite. Mad, unsettling and with quite a liberated approach for the depicted period of Queen Anne's reign in England, Scotland, Ireland and then united as Great Britain. Not the mainstream average period drama by any means and that is exactly its subtle beauty that will without doubt be mistaken by some who will hurry to condemn the movie and award single star ratings. Coleman, Weisz and Stone deliver a top form performance as the female gender takes the central roles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The wide angle/fish-eye cinematography and the lowered camera angle add to the overall opulence, making the three protagonists stand out grandiose. I loved the movie and hope Yorgos Lanthimos brings more of these unconventional movies to our screens. Finally, I watched the movie in a UK cinema with the majority, if not all, of the audience being in the senior age group. No reaction, no laughter!

The fact is that, despite the film being aesthetically high-brow, it does not demand its audience have written a dissertation on 18th-century British history to comprehend or enjoy it. What the film ultimately represents is a battle of wits between two women; one, a longtime companion of the queen who has a lengthy history with her (Rachel Weisz), and the other a disgraced ex-lady-cum-social climber who will stop at nothing to fulfill her own security (Emma Stone). The triangulated narrative is as old as time, but what really sells the film is the witty writing and stellar performances from Weisz, Stone, and Olivia Colman, who portrays the queen.<br/><br/>What I found remarkable about it, among numerous things, was that it seems to cross genres nearly undetected. At times it's wickedly humorous, at others poignant, and sometimes it's even utterly suspenseful. The stakes run high for all of the characters, and both Stone and Weisz play off of one another remarkably well. Colman is also alternately endearing and petulant in her portrayal of Anne, who is in the center of the mess. All of this is punctuated by a phenomenal musical score that alternates between lush and baroque, and something so nervy it sounds as though it belongs in a horror film. The cinematography is incredible, and the costumes and setting is truly something to behold.<br/><br/>I think the only real downfall to the film is its ending, which feels outwardly unresolved, though it thematically makes sense in regard to Abigail's character arc--does she not end where she began? All in all a very well-plotted film that works as a historical drama as well as it does an off-kilter, Machiavellian display of feminine grand guignol. 9/10."
"kenancirik","1","4","11","6 January 2019"," What a waste of time!
","Its just another art movie without a proper subject and story to tell. What a waste of time.

","The film is directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and this is my first film by
this director. I planned to watch his earlier films but I chose to start
with ""The Favourite"".<br/><br/>The storie takes place in Victorian England and this
reminds me of Stanley Kubrick's film ""Barry Lyndon"". Not only because both films
are set in the Victorian era but also the plot of the films is very familiar.
For me that wasn't a bad thing because Lanthimos added something different.
Cinematography style was different:different camera angels and different twists
in the plot.<br/><br/>A little bit about plot(no spoilers).
The story begins with a girl called Abigail.
She lives in a poor family. She decided to visit her distant cousin and try
to get some work. While visiting her cousin she treated the queen's leg and
people of higher runk noticed her. At this moment she realised,
that she can regain her position in society and the whole film we will see how
she tries to do this useing every possible method.<br/><br/>I highly recomend this film for everyone who like me love Victorian era and
for people who like me love Stanley Kubrick films.
I love Victorian era and this film show this period beautifully.
The Clothes, the make up and routine of people and the cinematography
were done very well."

","An utterly boring and redundant movie, with nothing new to say or show. Perhaps the only parts worth watching are the ones involving the rabbits, perhaps the movie was about them rabbits, the others being just fillers. Still, even the rabbits can't justify the waste of money spent in the making. Lovely performances by the three women involved, as always. Could have used them elsewhere."
"bookiemike","Null","2","4","10 April 2020"," It's hard to know which is more pretentious...
","The film itself, or the highest rating reviews?<br/><br/>For some reason, people seem to think enjoying this weirdly filmed, annoyingly scored piece of work makes them in some way more knowledgeable about film making than the non-purist.
Films, this one is not an exception, are made for profit, not just for the feeling of superiority they might engender among their viewers.<br/><br/>Emperor's (or should that be Queen's) new clothes of the highest order.<br/><br/>Where to start?<br/><br/>A few ""C bombs"" thrown in for tittilation value and the playground conversation enhancing lesbian scenes. Not that any schoolboys would watch long enough to get the excitement necessary to produce that conversation in the first place.<br/><br/>A comedy which doesn't make the viewer laugh (or even smile in our case) is not a comedy. Just calling something ""darkly comic"" or ""black humour"" doesn't make it funny when the actual humour is missing.<br/><br/>Some of the camera angles and lenses used could cause a feeling of motion-sickness.
The use of repetitive stringed instrument notes bordering on the intolerable. I assume they are in there to give the impression of tension building. Without any tense ending to a scene when it finally subsides.<br/><br/>A sure sign of a bad film, and make no mistake, this IS a bad film, is that the trailers for it gave NO indication of what it was about.<br/><br/>I STILL have no idea of what it was about. Unless it's just 2 hours of the explanation of a tryst or two!!!<br/><br/>The graphics are as pretentious and pointless as the rest of the film and many of the higher rated reviews I read.<br/><br/>Little bits of nastiness between characters, for no legitimate purpose are thrown in, but any references to real history or events are scant, at best.<br/><br/>Overall a triumph for the director, who obviously knew exactly what he wanted.
Which could have been OK if everyone else could have had a clue what he was thinking.<br/><br/>I truly wanted to find a reason to give 2 stars to The Favouite, especially having looked forward to seeing it for so long - which is testimony to the hype surrounding it paying off - but I couldn't.
The single star is for costume and scenery.<br/><br/>The rest, from the ""story"" to the acting, the camera work, the sound and especially the direction is overblown, tacky and hollow.<br/><br/>Honestly one of the most over-rated films ever made."

","The Favourite tells the tale of two cousins in the court of Queen Anne in 18th century England, as they try to manipulate the Queen at the other's expense. It's a feminist production, even though written and directed mostly by men. The director said he wanted the men in the film to be secondary figures, and the women do indeed walk all over them. In discussing the picture, the director, Yorgos Lanthimos, said the actual history of the time wasn't that important to him. Instead, he concentrated more on the women and their relationship with each other. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but the SJW agenda inserted into a period piece, along with the massive re-write of history, kind of ruined it for me. The acting by the three leads was good, Olivia Coleman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz. Olivia, who played Queen Anne, was especially good, and was rewarded for her portrayal with the Oscar for Best Actress."
"Evestar1997","10","2","4","27 December 2019"," The Favourite: a distorted historical satire of our time
","The Favourite, a ten-time Oscar nominated film, is one of my most favourite movies of the year. The filming techniques are outstanding in serving a dark and humorous theme, while the story represents is critical of the real world and hilarious at the same time.
The story sets in 1860s English court during Queen Anne's rule. Abigail, a pauperized young lady, came to her cousin Lady Sarah Marlborough in hope for a job. Sarah has been a close friend with Queen Anne for years, and is now the lead maid in the court. She offered Abigail a job in the kitchen, but the seemingly innocent Abigail began a surreptive fight against Sarah for Queen Anne's favour at whatever cost. She gradually moves up in rank, and eventually replaces Sarah as the first maid in charge.
Techancially, the movie dazzles with creative camera angles and intricate color design. The clever use of fisheye lens stands out to me as one of the film's most distinctive visual designs. This, on first sight, may appear to be odd because the lens distorts image on both sides of the screen, but it takes in the maximum range of view and creates unparalleled depth of field. In this way, it expands space on screen and shrinks characters. With relatively small actors appearing on the screen, fisheye lens creates an emptiness that is filled with characters' loneliness: there is no friend in the court. Everyone has to fight for herself. It is a cruel world, but also a bizarre one. The employment of slow motion highlights the absurdity of 19th century court life. It both distorts the sound and offers a detailed look at characters' actions that we might have overlooked at normal speed. During the duck racing scene and the fruit throwing scene, the elongated slow-motion technique compels the audience to experience courtiers' bizarre recreational activities and feel the absurdity. In contrast with their debate in parliament, what a disaster it is that these people run the country. The consistency in color is also worth noting. The movie employs two contrasting colors, black and white: Characters are dressed in black and white; Queen Anne's rabbits are black and white; the main corridor is paved with black and white marble. This color consistency not only contributes to a coherent story, but has deeper meanings: the dual color design naturally creates two opposite stances. This corresponds with two parties in English parliament at that time: black represents the Whig party, while white represents the Tory party.This color scheme also accompanies character's change. When Abigail is loyal to Sarah, she often dresses in black, which is the color of the Sarah's Whig party. Towards the end of the film, Abigail shows up more in white as she switches side to the Tory party. Apart from the story,these creative visual design makes The Favourite a stylish film that is worthy of appreciating.
Enhanced by marvelous visual design, the story allows for different interpretations. I see a modern satire criticizing populism: the queen represents us, the regular people who make up the country. We love compliments and susceptible to others' opinions. Both Abigail and Sarah are demagogues, but they are of different kinds. Abigail represents populists: she comes from lower social status and is underestimated by her opponents, but she can cause great chaos with her patronizing words. She caters to anyone with more power than she does and turns on them for her own benefit whenever she has a chance. ""I am on my side. Always"" as Abigail often claims. Lady Sarah, on the other hand, is an elitist: harsh but honest. She has a vision for her country while populists like Abigail only tries to stay in her comfort zone and care only about her pleasure. In the end, Queen Anne favors Abigail over Sarah. In the real world, more and more countries elect populist leaders who feed people with illusionary visions and contradictory promises. In this regard, I believe the movie is more than a distorted history comedy, but a criticism of the real world trend. The distorted shots actually represent our distorted world. However, the movie does offer hope at the end. Even when Abigail has gained great power, she still needs to bow down to caress the Queen's leg. Through an expressionist scene that overlaps the queen, her pet rabbits and Abigail, the movie suggests that Abigail still needs to serve. She is like the queen's rabbits: no matter how much freedom and power she gets, she still needs to serve the queen. No matter how powerful a politician is, she still answers to the people.
Overall, The Favourite is such a great movie both technically and artistically that no one should miss."
"Dar Star","8","2","4","9 December 2019"," Surprised me
","I'm not the type who typically goes for period pieces, but the Favourite is not your typical one. It is never boring at any point and is well done in every detail. The 3 female leads are all excellent, but the character Mr Harley steals the show. Highly recommended."
"mycannonball","8","2","4","19 November 2019"," When everyone wants power...
","It had a bit of a slow start and I wasn't a huge fan of some of the ""creative"" camera work (fish eye lens??). BUT, then once the story got underway, it was very good. The rivalry between the Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone characters as they vied for the Queen's attention and ultimately the security she could provide them was very entertaining. It was also sort of dark and sad and twisted. And just when you found yourself rooting for one woman, you changed your mind and felt for the other woman. It's a story that shows throughout several story threads what a dark world it can be when everyone is trying to gain power. The performance by Emma Coleman as the queen was fantastic. The ending left me feeling a little letdown, but ultimately it also felt like a fitting ending in some ways."
"charlypg","8","2","4","29 September 2019"," Amazing performances and score
","Although at times it may be a little bit slow, this movie is has two of my favourite things. The performances of both three actresses are outstanding, specially Olivia Colman's. Very deserved Oscar for her portrayal if Queen Anne. Emma Stone and Rachel Waiss are amazing as well, and both should be sharing Colman's position as Lead Actress.
Another thing that makes this movie great is the music. It's the perfect companion for the story, and in my point of view, it becomes another character of the movie."
"elmoslively","8","2","4","8 September 2019"," Sumptuous adaptation.
","This is a beautiful looking film, with amazing production design and fantastic direction, not to mention the brilliant Oscar winning performance of Olivia Coleman., who portrays sad and tough times of the barren Queen wonderfully. She plays the woman with just the right amount of insanity.<br/><br/>Rachel Weitz and Emma Stone are also very good in the villainous roles of the Queens right hand women. It's hard to say which is actually the nastiest.<br/><br/>Very good film that takes some time to get rolling along, but once it gets into the 2nd act, it really is interesting.."
"ivans536","8","2","4","7 September 2019"," Lanthimos' Best
","A movie as stylish as any of the director's features, the film is not for everyone, although it definitely ranks as the best movie by the director. With great and creative photography and framing, that somehow feels both period accurate and completely contemporary at the same time. The story is entertaining and trots along at a brisk pace, with very little filler. The acting is great as expected, much more humanistic and relaistic as opposed to the typical detached deliveries that make some of Lanthimos' films so hermetic. With strong performances from both the main cast and the side characters, it's definitely a big recommendation for any gilm lover.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment is that ultimately it seems to have less to say than it thinks it has, so even as the end credits roll, you're left thinking what, if anything, did you actually get out of watching it?"
"Lone_Mh","5","2","4","18 August 2019"," It would be considered as a boring movie...
","The end of the movie was interesting to me, as if we focus on the purpose which the movie was chasing, but the storyline itself goes on slowly and boring in some parts and extra repetition of some routine works of the characters rises up which makes you feel boring about the rest..."
"airsnob-18715","5","2","4","11 August 2019"," I wasn't that impressed. At all.
","The most impressive line in the whole thing was ""Because love doesn't lie!""
If the question of what love is , is still a mystery, we are a sad, sad bunch.
I think the world of art was probably far more impressed with this because it was the shallow man's feeling tale. For someone arrogant , power hungry, and used to the exploits of ambition, this is probably a marvel, and self revelatory. For the rest of us, who long ago examined our need for competition and jealousy, ego and power hungry desperation- it's the lesser offering of so many delicious movies out there about the same exact thing.
Personally I didn't like how they merged modern with history .. it made it less believable and more appeasing the subject matter and really at it' end, insulting to think we couldn't sit through a movie that was actually realistic about history.
I know it was a stab at comedy but ... it just fell short. On every level.
Everyone is going on and on over the script- it makes me wonder what kind of exposure they have to literacy.
I mean with period pieces - just off the top of my head- Rob Roy, Dangerous Liaisons ( with Glen Close) they make this script remedial when we compare. Of course those movies weren't block busters - how could they be? Half the planet literally couldn't sit through them.
So, I felt it was a vapid offering of the same dish, that has been done sooo much better before.
In the end it is just another shallow story about self love and the will to survive, than love or power.
And maybe that was the entire point after all."
"emmahamilton-86644","7","2","4","10 August 2019"," Good but......
","A shame they decided to make the relationship between Queen Anne and Sarah/ Abigail/sexual. The letters between female friends in the 1800s were fashionably passionate, and did not mean they were having a sexual relationship.<br/><br/>Some of the language is far too modern for the period.<br/><br/>However, this is still a good film, showing poor Queen Anne -who really did have 17 dead babies- in a sympathetic light. It shows the the corruption and stench of the Court in the 1700s. Olivia Coleman deserved the Oscar, but I don't think Queen Anne would have thanked anyone for this interpretation of her."

Nicholas Hoult's foppish rogue Harley steals every scene he is in.<br/><br/>Yorgos Lanthimos once again has made a beautifully shot film using mostly natural light. I can't overstate that this film looks gorgeous. Many times over I thought of Barry Lyndon, but with tonnes of humour, foul language, and no Ryan O'Neal to destroy the soul of the film.<br/><br/>I originally gave this 9/10 because I didn't like the use of fish-eye lens, but I couldn't stop thinking of how much I enjoyed it so I bumped it up to 10.<br/><br/>Best film I have seen in a very long time."

"andrewburgereviews","8","2","4","7 April 2019"," Business for the sake of pleasure
","""The Favourite"" can be a strange film at times, specifically during a few montage-like scenes joined by a repetitive pumping sound. They are not going anywhere dramatically, so its a bit uncalled for. Luckily, most of its strangeness is welcoming and reinvigorating and its coming from the self-parodying soap opera of the political leaders of the United Kingdom during the war with the French in the early 18th Century. These are people with responsibilities, but they only use business as a means of self-pleasure and satisfaction.<br/><br/>Yorgos Lanthimos plays with subconscious-driven characters whose problems never leave the walls of the Court. The war never feels like a threat and the outside world is nonexistent. Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is completely ignorant to the political on-goings taking place right in her home, as she is more concerned for the well-being of her ""children"", some dozen of rabbits and she is too absorbed by the tragedies of her past and by the controlling nature of her closest associate Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) who is, technically, the Queen, taking full responsibility. She seems like the only one who cares about her country as she often states. But her motives are more power-driven and of a dominant nature, more to spite the opposition led by the equally-cunning Harley (Nicholas Hoult). Then there is the newcomer, Abigail (Emma Stone), Sarah's cousin, sold by her father at a poker game and coming as a servant.<br/><br/>One of the things this film does best is shift the roles of hero and villain between characters as it goes on. Lanthimos and his fellow writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara carefully assign losses and gains, both political and personal to their characters and slowly moves the viewer's empathy among them. Not that you can feel a strong-enough emotion for any of them as, despite their past, they are too pompous, sometimes childish for you to properly connect with them. As a viewer, I felt a bit left out as they rumble along back and forth, driven crazy by the aristocratic maze of the palace and by the exclusive nature of their circle.<br/><br/>Despite that, though, ""The Favourite"" does an amazing job at humanizing and then straight-up dehumanizing characters of a predetermined level of standards. I loved the in-your-face primordial moments of pleasure, hate, lust, sloth, gluttony which beyond unexpected felt fascinating. Despite its beautiful aesthetics, or maybe because of them, ""The Favourite"" feels refreshing with every disgusting turn it takes. I often looked at the palace during the few scenes taking place outside, and was amazed at how monolithic, grand it looked, only to be exposed in the next scenes to its unstable inhabitants--people charged with history-impacting decisions, yet people who engage in sexual taboos and childish games.<br/><br/>Among these characters, Abigail stands out through her emotional and social transformation from a maid sleeping in a room huddled by dozens of other maids to a true Lady, now taking the side to Queen Anne. But Anne is not stupid, she is the Queen after all. The final scene, in which she calls for Abigail to rub her leg is a symbolic scene. The Queen takes a formal stance, unexpected to Abigail and it goes on for over three minutes. She will never let her power be dwindled again."
"Nathan_Needs_A_Username","8","2","4","6 April 2019"," Movie Review: The Favourite
","The Favourite has been surrounded by a lot of hype recently and so I felt compelled to see it for myself before Oscar season is truly upon us.<br/><br/>Having seen it I have to say that the hype is justified and it will make perfect sense when this is inevitably nominated for a bunch of Academy Awards in a few weeks. Lanthimos is truly one of the best and most fascinating filmmakers working today, it is really saying something that a film this insane could be the most accessible and mainstream work within a directors filmography. Fans of Lanthimos's more 'out there' work on The Lobster or Killing of a Sacred Deer should not be disappointed by his first attempt at a period drama, this film is just as darkly funny and features just as much jarringly impressive camera work as any of the directors previous work. The favourite is full of almost Wes Anderson like 180° whip pans and glorious tracking shots that show of the excellent set and costume design which all looks absolutely beautiful with the use of natural lighting.<br/><br/>A few times during this film Lanthimos uses a fish eye lens that at first is quite distracting but you eventually settle into it the more it is used. It seems clear to me that he is making some sort of statement here or it has a sort of thematic relevance but honestly I have no idea why it is there.<br/><br/>Despite what a fantastic job Lanthimos has done here the reason that this is getting so much attention is for the absolutely incredible performances by the three leads. Rachel Weisz manages to gain a little sympathy from the audience despite playing such a cold and calculated character, Emma Stone completely breaks type-casting with her most physical performance to date playing a character equal parts put upon and manipulative and Olivia Colman finally gets a role that allows her to fully show off her abilities both as a dramatic lead and a comedic power house.<br/><br/>For me the Favourite comes across as a statement on the ridiculous nature of wealth and its relationship to sex and power. Lanthimos is a filmmaker that is just as content to make you laugh as he is to make you cringe.<br/><br/>With fantastic performances and beautiful cinematography this is almost guaranteed a good time at the Oscars, while I personally think that Lanthimos has offered more interestingly twisted work in the past there is no denying the achievement of this film.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Gracie96","3","2","4","4 April 2019"," Not very good, but beautiful sets and gowns

The movie goes into detail how Sarah Churchill (Lady Marborough, played by Rachel Weisz) attempted to control the queen. The Queen and Sarah were political opposites, and Sarah attempted to turn the Queen's loyalties.<br/><br/>One of your typical period films which shows infighting and attempts at sabotage, but not very interesting.<br/><br/>One note on the credits at the end of the movie--the print type is so strange that the credit are impossible to read."

","The Favourite is a lot of fun to watch. It has just the right blend of comedy, tension, and sadness. The performances are stellar, without question. Definitely worth watching. Just remember to overlook a few things: it has very little to do with the Queen of England. In other words, in the end, this could be a movie about any rich old lesbian who never really feels sure about the ""love"" given her by any young beautiful girl. Another thing that bothers me is that too much of the movie takes place in the queen's bedroom, giving the whole production a kind of stage-play feel. And since it feels like a stage-play, you expect sharper, more sparkling dialogue which, for the most part, is missing largely here. Good movie. But nothing to take away."

","A film about slaves of their duty, ambition and life<br/><br/>If somebody asks me, ""What can you say about The Favourite?""
I would say three things: acting, storytelling and cinematography.<br/><br/>Acting is superb.
And I'm not only speaking about the main ladies trio of Olivia Colman (Tyrannosaur, The Lobster, Locke), Rachel Weisz (Agora, The Deep Blue Sea, Constantine) and Emma Stone (La La Land, The Help, Birdman). I'm speaking about entire film acting crew. Regardless of the amount of screen time, the importance of the role or the scene, everyone shows great performance.<br/><br/>Storytelling has its own author's manner.
Division of the film into mini-chapters, subtle intellectual humor, notes of absurdity and expression - only a part of the numerous features that distinguish the film from many other. The viewer who loves such form of art will enjoy the movie, others probably not.<br/><br/>Cinematography by its own rules.
How long and have you ever saw usage of fish-eye lenses in films? Personally, nothing comes to my mind. Here, the authors actively use the super wide-angle picture, and not to emphasize some landscape scenes (which, by the way, are almost nonexistent in the film, since most of the events unfold in the territory of the Queen's Palace), but for the psychophysical addition of scenes.
The second feature of working with the camera is the slow forthcoming of the picture to the desired object, as if from the corner of the room. Overall, the film is made with gray and dark colors.<br/><br/>And near of the all above we can see the name of Yorgos Lanthimos (Kynodontas, The Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer), a director and writer from Greece, who has established himself as the author of experimental and independence cinema, personal style of whom has made The Favourite so special.<br/><br/>Plot is more dialogue based, rather than the composition of the various events. Emotions and feelings of the main characters conveyed beautifully and realistically, as well as their driving forces and fears. Humor is very ingenious and relevant. Although almost all the characters in the film speak in a very fast way, narrative manner is smooth and predictable.<br/><br/>Costumes and scenery perfectly convey the era of England in the early 18th century, but on this, the historicity of the major events in the film comes to an end, as this film is more of a fantasy based on history, a fantasy about personal war and compromises of people between themselves and their own fears."

","The story is good and I like everything Emma Stone does,
It's also a pleasure to see Nicholas Hoult from Warm Bodies.<br/><br/>There are a few characters and you can feel the mechanics of power and manipulations, similar to Dangerous Liaisons.<br/><br/>I like the grotesque scenes, depicting the perversions of aristocratic people.<br/><br/>I have a huge problem with the cinematography though. It almost always uses a very wide lens, almost like a Fisheye, and it's really disturbing.
It's actually beautiful when used in Dolly shots, but when used as a steady cam is absolutely garbage, you can see a huge distorsion in all the corners and borders of the frame,
It just gave me nausea.
It seriously looks like they got only one lens.<br/><br/>(spoiler)
There is also a problematic plot hole for me : When Emma poisons her rival and then she comes back, she....slaps her.
She almost died and she just slaps her, and Emma to say ""I accept your anger for now."" Is this for real ? I expected her rival to just grab a shotgun and chase her down !
Emma just attempted murder, why her rival is so calm ???<br/><br/>Also, sometimes the music can be weird and irritating. Score is good but badly used.<br/><br/>The ending is poor and vague and very disappointing. It's not even an ending.<br/><br/>I have no idea why people expected comedy on some reviews ? It's not a comedy at all. What kind of trailer did you see ?
I recommend as a good acting performance, but godammit with this wide angle lens."

","First of all, funny to read all the negative reviews from the people used to watch only Transformers and Nightmare before Christmas :D
Very rich movie in meanings, excellent exploration of the human nature, brilliant directing, brilliant way of complicating and destabilising gender roles and sexual orientations. It is a powerful feminist movie, with men reduced to funny and ridiculous wigged mannequins while women pulling all the strings. Equally intelligent was the way sexual orientations became complicated to the point you do not really know if the three women were lesbians, straight, bi?... In any case you see them in lesbian relations but only flirting and playing with men.
Brilliant acting also. At least Olivia Colman in particular, and Rachel Weisz are stunning
BUT
I feel powerfully that the movie got so many Oscar nominations and accolades from the US movie industry because it is feminist and queer, and less because of its intrinsic quality. It is a very politically correct movie, fitting like a glove with the political message that Hollywood wants to send in the Trump-era. Otherwise, who can tell us why other brilliant movies from Yorgos Lanthimos, such as The Lobster or Killing of a Sacred Deer, did not get remarked and Oscar nominations? It is only my opinion that those were better than The Favourite? So yes, in terms of directing, screen play, acting, message, the three movies can be compared and yes, The Lobster and Killing of a Sacred Deer were better than The Favourite. They did not get noticed because they were not feminist and sexual queer.<br/><br/>It is OK if Hollywood wants to become more political. It is not OK to award prizes based on the political message and not on the quality, as they claim to do."

"msbreviews","8","2","4","8 February 2019"," Rating: A-
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>The Favourite is one of the most acclaimed movies of last year, receiving multiple nominations at dozens of awards shows and winning a whole bunch of them (2nd most awarded film of 2018, behind Roma). Being a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos' style, I couldn't be happier for him, and I was now even more excited to watch what he produced and directed. This movie is a classic example of an Oscars' tradition of sorts. A lot of audience members make their mission to watch every Best Picture nominee before the big night, and there's always one film that people fail to grasp on why did it get so much praise? Why are critics all around the world absolutely loving what audiences perceive as an ""okay"" time at the theater, but which contains a long, weird and maybe even dull (for some) story?<br/><br/>Well, first of all, this is technically a masterpiece. I mean, every single technical aspect is worthy of recognition. The production and set design are gorgeously eyegasmic. The score is unusual for a period piece like this, but it weirdly works, as it continuously elevates the tension between the three main characters and helps the story flow with an always conspicuous, treacherous feeling. Even the cinematography and the plays with candlelight offer some pretty neat scenes. However, and prepare to be surprised, the costume design steals the show from all the other achievements. This is coming from a guy who has utterly no interest in this particular matter and who rarely talks about it, so I'm as surprised as you are.<br/><br/>It's not due to the costumes being pretty or appropriate to the time period. Almost every movie that tackles these times nail the costume design, but only a few can tell a character arc through it. Even less are capable of embodying the whole screenplay like this Oscar-bait does. Our protagonists have distinct journeys, but their ends all have similarities. One way of understanding the story is through what they wear, which seamlessly represent the arc that each character takes to get where they eventually end up. These layers of storytelling keep the film intriguing, but Lanthimos' uncommon methods plus McNamara and Davis' script will displease some audience members.<br/><br/>The Favourite is that movie that audiences are going to be perplexed about why do critics adore it. There's no secret, really. Audience members don't care about the technical part of films. They couldn't care less about costume design, cinematography, score or how the screenplay is written. They want to be entertained and have a good time at the theater, so I find reasonable if people leave a bit disappointed with one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2018. Lanthimos doesn't deliver formulaic stories, and he certainly doesn't film them in a regular fashion, so I firmly believe the general public isn't really going to enjoy this one. His unique style brings a very different tone, pace and filming techniques that people aren't used to experiencing. Fortunately, there's more than just technical attributes to this film. Three magnificent and powerful performances from Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz, carry the whole thing to safe harbor.<br/><br/>These three actresses deserve every single nomination they got so far. Colman delivers both a hilarious and emotionally heavy display, as Anne. An incredibly fragile Queen with a shockingly traumatic past, whose love and affection is being fought for between Abigail and Sarah. Most of the laughs this movie gives are through Anne and her petty behavior towards her servants. Colman delivers her body and soul to her role, adding yet another fantastic performance to her splendid career. Weisz is just flawless. Sarah's arc is Abigail's opposite in almost every way, and Rachel is remarkably sharp. She doesn't really have a definite shining moment like Stone or Colman have, but it's a consistent and robust display from an actress who needed a return to the spotlight.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's Emma Stone who shines through with an unbelievable range of emotions and expressions. Her performance in La La Land is great, but as Abigail she is outstanding! She handles her character's personality change with an impeccable transition regarding her acting and the only reason why she's probably not getting the Oscar win, is due to the campaign supporting Regina King (If Beale Street Could Talk). Abigail is the character that moves the plot forward by trying to steal Sarah's place near the Queen. Her intelligent and manipulative moves are extremely captivating, as well as her will to gain Anne's love.<br/><br/>Yorgos Lanthimos knows his craft and his weird yet unparalleled style is something that will surely deliver even more divisive and confusing films in the future. From the camera angles to his methods of storytelling, he's one hell of a director-writer-producer! Technically, The Favourite is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the last year. The impressive production and set design plus the addictive score definitely raise the film, but the costume design tells a whole story through what the characters dress during the whole runtime. The screenplay is remarkably-written, filled with complex dialogues and several twists and turns, which lead our characters through eventful arcs.<br/><br/>Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz deliver compelling performances, but Emma Stone is in another level. Her range is mind-boggling, and she carries a big responsibility by portraying the character who changes the whole story. Nevertheless, the movie feels a bit too long, and the story drops its interest levels during the transition from the second to the third act. Basically, I'll put it like this: if you're just a regular audience member who only goes to the theater to eat popcorn while being entertained, The Favourite isn't going to make you eat your whole bucket; if you watch films through a more in-depth look, then you'll be as marveled as I was by the end of it."

Lanthimos stuck with his style which I appreciated immensely. The story line itself was well artifculated and keeps the viewer entertained. It is a period piece, so go into it expecting a traditional British royalty setting.

","It was a quirky film about insanity, intrigues... and Queen Anne. Very originally and bravely put together by Yorgos Lanthimos who understands to do things unconventionally and I think the word unconventional fits this film the best. A very unconventional period piece and even more unconventional biopic - or semi biopic. The three leading actreses- and yes they are ALL lead... are just perfect and share such a fantastic on screen chemistry. I am probably in the minority but I thought Rachel Weisz was the best of them. Sure, Olivia Colman knew how to play insane without overacting and she had a fabulous wit with it but Rachel Weisz was able to command to screen in such a self-secureness and the absolutely right attitude. A grande and unpredictable performance and truly one of Weisz best jobs... and that means something. Olivia Colman is of course great, there is no doubt about it. Everybody who has seen the trailer knew that already. But she did not disappoint and held the quality of her performacne throughout the film. The fun of it was that you never knew what was up with her next. Emma Stone was wonderful as well. She had the best character development of all three, and yes also she went into very unexpected and unpredictable territories. Its the best Actress trio since Moore/Kidman/Streep in ""The Hours"" and also there all of them were lead. Nicholas Hoult gives one of the most underrated performances of the year. What a great supporting turn and he wonderfully played against his image. His scenes with Weisz, especially at the beginning were just candy. The look of the film is great, perfect cinematography and a great choice of soundtrack. Very nice direction and some of the best dialogue works of the year. I must say I preferred the first half of the film more than the last but it still ended up as one of the best and most artistically inspired films of the year."

While I must say that this is not as good as his previous films (THE LOBSTER and DOGTOOTH, to name a few) I think that's because he wrote those ones and this one was written by somebody else. It's still a solid film though and a good watch. Not nearly as boring as a lot of other biopics I've seen. Recommend."

","You relish something. You don't relish in something. Abigail didn't kill the rabbit. Abigail didn't appear to be bad at first. She appeared to be a victim. Her badness and manipulative nature was revealed gradually. The way I saw the end was that Rachel's character, Sarah, had used Queen Anne for her own political purposes but she still had feelings for Anne, maybe even love. Abigail had no real feelings for Anne, or political agenda but just wanted to elevate her position through being Anne's favourite. So at the end, after Abigail has won out over Sarah, we see Anne and Abigail stuck in the rather bleak relationship. Anne as a lonely Queen using Abigail for sexual gratification without real feelings for her, and Abigail discontented but stuck in that role with no real feelings for Anne."

It's not really a comedy, it's not really a biography and it doesn't really have an ending.

They're so bad they're destined for cult status. Anyway, surprisingly this movie makes some sense and various parts of the movie are very good, like production design, performances, decent story with quirky bits thrown in, and so on. The only problem is that it doesn't have any ending. It just gets to a point in the story and stops. I guess maybe they ran out of money. It's a mystery how they got any financing for this movie anyway because despite that it's still a pretty good film, I wouldn't give this director money to produce youtube videos."

I hate period costume dramas, but Lanthimos' last two films, The Lobster and The killing of a sacred deer were both my films of their year. Having watched it, I guess only Lanthimos could make me enjoy a period drama. Whilst not as sinister as his earlier films (and no doubt more accessible to the mainstream as a result), I still found myself laughing out loud uncontrollably at moments which others may have found anything but funny. Olivia Colman is probably going to get all the plaudits - and she was brilliant - but I thought Stone and Weiss were equally great.

"makleen2","7","2","4","3 January 2019"," Sensationalism at the Expense of History
","The beautiful cinematography and wonderful acting in this over-the-top period piece barely makes up for its historical inaccuracy and a grueling 2-hour run time. Written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, The Favourite is artistically filmed, the acting is wonderful, and cinematography top notch. If you're looking for a realistic account of Queen Anne's 18th Century British court, however, you'll be sorely disappointed. The Favourite chooses to enshrine gossip and rumor as historic fact, while delivering a film that is as tedious as it is tantalizing.<br/><br/>As the film opens, Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is deciding whether to continue a war with France after an English victory, or sue for peace. Her natural inclination, and that of opposition leader Robert Harley (Nicholas Hoult), is for peace, but her influential friend and Keeper of the Privy Purse Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz), wife of Lord Marlborough (Mark Gatiss), wants to prosecute the war to the bitter end. During negotiations, a dirty but charming Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives seeking employment in Lady Sarah's household.<br/><br/>Things get complicated when Abigail discovers Queen Anne and Lady Sarah's dirty little secret, and uses it to her advantage to get closer to the Queen. Abigail and Lady Sarah engage in a private war for the Queen's affection, while Robert Harley and Samuel Masham (Joe Alwyn) conspire to use Abigail to get closer to the Queen, wh0 only has time for one friend, I guess. Who will become the Queen's favourite?<br/><br/>Using extreme wide-angles (shot with Panavision lenses) to achieve a sense of expanse even in a small room, the filmmakers capture a delightfully Baroque portrayal of an outlandish and amoral British aristocracy. The acting is top-notch, with Emma Stone giving one of the best performances of her career. Olivia Colman should receive an Oscar nod for her portrayal of Queen Anne. The film, however, could've been improved by cutting at least 20 minutes of silence, screeching violins, and arthouse chapter titles.<br/><br/>Historically, Queen Anne ruled England, Scotland, and Ireland (and then Great Britain) from 1702 to 1714. The film takes place during the War of the Spanish Succession. John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, the husband of Queen Anne's close friend, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, was commander of Allied forces in that conflict. Marlborough was caught between the two political parties in Britain: the Tories and Whigs. Queen Anne favored the Tories, who wanted peace, but the Whigs had gained considerable power alongside Sarah Churchill, who had the Queen's ear and advocated on their behalf.<br/><br/>Sarah was notoriously headstrong and spoke her mind freely and openly, which began to get on the Queen's nerves. In 1711, Queen Anne dismissed the Duke of Marlborough from service over charges of embezzlement. John and Sarah Churchill went into exile a year later. Sarah's break with the Queen was exacerbated by her rivalry with her younger cousin, Abigail (Hill) Masham. Sarah tried to have Abigail removed from the Queen's household, and when she could not, accused Abigail and the religiously conservative Queen of having a sexual relationship (among a litany of other insults).<br/><br/>The Favourite indulges in sensationalism at the expense of history. It depicts Sarah as a jealous lover carrying on an illicit sexual affair with the Queen and omits Queen Anne's great religious devotion and her marriage to Prince George of Denmark, though he died in 1708. The only evidence of a love affair comes from romantic-sounding (but entirely Platonic) letters and rumors spread by political rivals. Director Yorgos Lanthimos admitted he didn't care whether a real love triangle took place between Queen Anne, Sarah Churchill, and Abigail Masham. ""We never really discussed it (the historical accuracy),"" he said.<br/><br/>As a story of two rivals competing for the affections of a monarch, The Favourite is similar to The Other Boleyn Girl (2008), directed by Justin Chadwick and starring Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, and Eric Bana. It is about the rivalry between sisters Anne and Mary Boleyn for the affection of King Henry VIII. Sarah Churchill and Abigail Masham were also related (though distantly). It wasn't uncommon at the time for ambitious families to seek employment at a royal court, and becoming a royal mistress could be very advantageous.<br/><br/>Like The Favourite, The Other Boleyn Girl has little regard for historic accuracy, but where The Favourite imagined sexual trysts where there probably were none, The Other Boleyn Girl turns the Boleyn sisters into innocent virgins. In that film, Anne is depicted as a pure and devoted wife when she met King Henry VIII. In reality, she had already been kicked out of the French Court for sleeping around (King Francis called her ""my English mare""). You know it's bad when even the French think your sex life is scandalous.<br/><br/>The Favourite currently holds a 94% positive rating from critics and 58% audience favorability on RottenTomatoes. Despite winning a litany of praise and awards, it barely made back its $15 million budget at the box office. Why the discrepancy? This is exactly the type of film critics love, and it will appeal to art house aficionados. There's nothing wrong with that. But while general audiences might snicker at the absurd spectacle, they will feel the clock ticking on every single minute of this two-hour film."
"elmercajoo","8","2","4","3 January 2019"," Definitely worth a watch.
","The acting was phenomenal. Top notch stuff. You get really engrossed and lost in everyone's side of the story. The actress that played the queen pretty much stole the show, even though Emma and Rachel's characters were amazing. You really get to see what it could have been like for a queen back in those times. The loneliness you feel, the lack of energy because everyone is sucking it from you, the uncertainty of your sanity. It's all too real in this movie and Yorgos does a great job at getting that feeling across."
"namashi_1","7","2","4","31 December 2018"," Olivia Colman Achieves Greatness in Yorgos Lanthimos's Wicked Tale!
","'The Favourite' is Director Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film to date. Yes, the man who gave us a film like The Lobster (I haven't seen his other works hence I only have that one film as a reference), now presents us a period piece, of power, greed, cruelty and lust. While not perfect, 'The Favourite' is nonetheless an entirely well-made tale, who's wicked behavior is hard to resist. And Olivia Colman, in the film's meatiest role, achieves acting greatness. It's a virtuoso performance from the firebrand actress.<br/><br/>'The Favourite' Synopsis: In early 18th century England, a frail Queen Anne (Colman) occupies the throne and her close friend, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz oozing ease of a seasoned veteran) governs the country in her stead. When a new servant, Abigail (Emma Stone, a complete hoot) arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah.<br/><br/>'The Favourite' is a twisted tale of three complex women who are unable to look at life without power in their hands. What I particularly loved here was the diversity of its principal characters, who have only one similarity: the greed for power. And while not all of their cruelly ambitious motives land as arrestingly as expected, its hard not to be seduced by these women. I really enjoyed the sexual tension as well as the unpredictability among the women.<br/><br/>Having said that, 'The Favourite' has a few shortcomings of its own. Deborah Davis
and Tony McNamara's Screenplay is a little too long and lacks some sharpness. Sure, length is never a problem, but the Writing lacks some bite in the film's latter half. While the first-hour is a mix of sadistic humor and delicious twists, the second-hour is less effective in the same nature it begins upon. But again, these aren't flaws so deep that they take away from an otherwise engaging film. The Writing, for a large chunk of the film, is swift and arresting. Lanthimos's Direction is lush. The man has outdone himself here and has Directed this period piece with sheer class. Robbie Ryan's Cinematography is gorgeous. The Lensman has captured this classy affair with absolute ease. Not one frame lacks beauty. Lanthimos and Ryan deserve Oscar-Attention, next year! Yorgos Mavropsaridis's Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are astoundingly done. The Score is top-notch.<br/><br/>And now to the performances! 'The Favourite' has a strong ensemble cast, who bring in their A-Game. Colman takes the lead, of course. As Queen Anne, Colman is acting greatness at its truest. She expresses grief, pain, jealously, love, fear and humanity, all at once, in a performance that deserves respect and accolades. Colman is the underdog this year, who has left us all spell-bound, with a portrayal so deep and personal, it would be unfair to rank it only among the best of the year. It's much more than that.<br/><br/>Following up to Colman, Weisz and Stone are exceptional. Weisz is quietly powerful as a women who fears losing her power and love, adapting and entirely inhabiting the character for a first-rate turn. Stone is at her most uninhibited and portrays the opportunist to perfection.<br/><br/>And while it's the Women who rule the show without any doubt, the men here also do credible jobs. Nicholas Hoult, in particular, is a complete revelation in a key-role, while Joe Alwyn delivers a yet another impressive performance.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Favourite' is not perfection, but it most certainly is a well-made, gorgeously shot film with some excellent performances, and one that merits an Oscar. Watch It!"

","Everybody requires something different from their moviegoing experience. Some of us need explosions and high-speed chases, and an obvious distinction between the bad guys and the good guys. Some of us need quiet moments of clear introspection or subtle drama.<br/><br/>There aren't explosions in this film- there are deafeningly loud musket shots. There are no high-speed chases- there is plotting, brooding, mind games and manipulation. And finally, there are no good guys in this movie, save for, perhaps, the quietly valiant husband of one of the characters.<br/><br/>""Every man or woman for themselves"" is the ethos of the film, The Favourite, starring Emma Stone, Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz. It is about two women, one of stature and rank (Weisz), another of similar upbringing (Stone), who befell the whims of their father and was left with nothing. Both are power-hungry and will go to great lengths to earn or keep their place as the ""favourite"" of Queen Anne (Colman), depicted as a petulant, emotionally stunted woman riddled with ailments.<br/><br/>Queen Anne ruled England, Scotland and Ireland for just five years, then Great Britain and Ireland for seven more. If you are of a certain mind, this movie will feel to you as if it is a number of years long. I was not one of those people, but I did see the film with one of those people.<br/><br/>It could have been cut by fifteen to thirty minutes and maintained the brisk, sharply funny pace it began with. However, director Yorgos Lanthimos is film-student-as-director, and requires you to feel uncomfortable for as much time as he or you can stand it. Luckily, our one saving grace is that Mr. Lanthimos did not write the screenplay, which was penned by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, an Australian filmmaker.<br/><br/>With his 2015 film, The Lobster, which Lanthimos co-wrote, it was clear that he has a sadistic streak. It landed on some year-end lists of best films, but I'm here to tell you, that movie deserves no accolades, except for ""Best Way to Torture Yourself for Two Hours."" I laughed a few times, but by the end, rather than a lobster, I was a frog, left in a pot that began cold and by the end was boiling over. That movie was pure indulgence of dry, cruel humor drenched in nihilism.<br/><br/>This movie continues to tell the story of the darker side of human nature explored in The Lobster, but the humor is more deft here. The pacing is stronger for the most part, and there is more story to tell, the characters more richly inhabited. By the end, you may be rooting for none of the characters, but you will be won over by the performances, especially Emma Stone, who arguably gets the most screen time, and makes great use of it. Olivia Colman is brilliant as the aforementioned Queen Anne, whose emotions shift on a dime- was the character of the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland based on her, or vice-versa? (There is a nod to Lewis Carroll when she quietly sing-speaks ""Off with her head, off with her head,"" during the first, lighter half of the film."") Rachel Weisz is also great, and perhaps the only reason she is mentioned last is that she is always great, and so it comes as no surprise. She also has less whimsy to work with.<br/><br/>It could be argued that the weakest performers in the film are the men, but that is not their fault. We don't get to see too much of them. The one we see the most of, Nicholas Hoult, is the only actor in the film who feels, instead of an adult with autonomy, like a child playing dress-up. He is ill-suited and miscast as another power hungry player, a member of Parliament and advisor to the Queen, dressed in full man-of-the-court regalia, complete with an artificial mop of grey curls (a wig.) It took me out of the film watching him struggle to speak his lines with any naturalism or nuance. He was also equally as bad in Mad Max: Fury Road. Lowering one's voice an octave and pouting does not a man make.<br/><br/>Men's power over women, and their sexual ownership of them is not painted with broad strokes. Instead, it is merely understood. A few lines about rape and uncomfortable heterosexual intercourse are played for laughs; why take seriously what is innate and unchangeable?<br/><br/>The Favourite is a queer film. The greatest love story is of course, that of power, but there is, at the very least, gay sex. There is also a queer lens through which we view the quite literally ""gay"" dress of the women, and especially men, in this period of English history. High heeled shoes, wigs, and blush: a drag queen's dream.<br/><br/>That lens also pierces through the morbid nature of class, status and wealth and the whims of those who hold it. They race lobsters, rabbits and ducks. They slap each other when they are perturbed. In the opening scene, Queen Anne offers her closest companion, the Duchess of Marlborough, a castle, as a way to ""do something nice.""<br/><br/>The most distasteful scene in the movie is one in which a nude, heavyset man is pelted by blood oranges by a group of men, who ditched the grey wigs for ginger ones, all of them laughing, including the target. All of this is rendered in slow-motion, buoyed by the score. It reminded me of a similarly grotesque scene in Tom Ford's second feature, Nocturnal Animals, which opened on a group of morbidly obese nude women jumping up and down, their tasseled breasts flopping, again in slow motion and set to violin music. While the theme of people and animals (and people-as-animals) as objects and playthings is evident in the film, it felt entirely out of place, and left me feeling like I was watching a film-student who ""couldn't get this scene"" out of his head, and instead of filming it and watching it alone for his own pleasure, had to insert it into an otherwise tightly composed film.<br/><br/>This is a period film written for a 2018 audience. It succeeds mostly at blending surrealism and absurdism with realism, and one might believe every word of dialogue, save for a line about a woman's ""vajeejee."" The sociopathic tendencies of the characters echo that of a titular Mr. Ripley, a groundbreaking character in his own right as a gay man conceived of and written in the 1950s. The innate queerness of the characters of The Favourite is debatable, but what is perhaps more important is watching women get to be as absolutely monstrous as men can be. Women may not get to escape the seductress or mistress label in the film, but it does make for interesting conversation and does posit one main theory: Men use their power to get sex, women use sex to get power, but in the end, we are all animals."

","Of my many projects, one of the least likely to ever see light of day, is a chronological History of the World compiled from feature films. If it does, however, The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) just ensured a prominent entry with The Favourite.<br/><br/>The Favourite is the 7th feature film directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, Greek critic darling with a distinct surrealist/absurdist style whose recent efforts (The Lobster, 2015, and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, 2017) have been showered with prizes and nominations. The Favourite covers different territory but is set to top its predecessors in terms of recognition, I suspect (not having seen the aforementioned films) deservedly.<br/><br/>The Favourite tells the true story of Abigail Hill ( Emma Stone), an impoverished young lady of gentry extraction, and of how she finds her way into service in the kitchen of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) and thence eventually and very eventfully into her favour, to the dismay and aggressive opposition of the previous favourite Sarah, Duchess of Malrborough (Rachel Weisz), the background being, as mentioned above, the War of the Spanish Succession and the fights of the pro-war Whigs and anti-war (as the landed gentry they represented bore the brunt of the financing) Tories for the kings ear, often though the favourites´ voices.<br/><br/>If memory serves, George Clooney´s The Men who Stare at Goats, (2009) started with a caption that went something like ""more than you think of the following actually happened"". I bet that applies to The Favourite, the many pleasures of which include a seamless blend of 18th Century English palatial courtesies and double entendres with crass sexual profanities, although I suspect the otherwise perfect script still errs on the side of pudency in this regard. Other (pleasures) include the high drama/black comedy register Lanthimos chose for this period piece, his first, in many aspects reminiscent of Barry Lyndon (Stanley Kubrick, 1975, the luscious asphyxiated baroque interiors, the pervasive clavichord soundtrack, the stuffy wigs and makeup of men and women, more on this below) with a (mercifully) slight whiff of Fellini (members of the royal household making it an afternoon´s entertainment of throwing ripe tomatoes at a naked wigged man, he cavorting in slow motion like a hairy oversized Botticelli cherub trying simultaneously to dodge the tomatoes and hide his privates) and a perhaps unconscious nod at Fritz Lang (women with facial scars, but maybe that´s just me). And not least the high octane histrionics of the main characters, a perfect schoolgirl triangle in an adult (well...) world. Bette Davies and Joan Crawford in their heyday wouldn´t have topped Stone and Weisz, and no Golden Age parallel occurs for Colman, but her heartbroken half-demented disease-ridden tantrum-prone Queen Anne doesn't steal the show (the other two don´t allow it) but adds to it much more than its share.<br/><br/>The Favourite is a rollercoaster ride of Shakespearean proportions, its power like that of the aforementioned Barry Lindon, deriving from the very same proposition: what it takes to go ""up"", or back ""up"", in life in a cripplingly stratified society."

"stefannemanja7","6","0","0","19 June 2020"," Analysts...
","With films like ""Dogtooth,"" ""The Lobster,"" and ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"" Yorgos Lanthimos' internationally acclaimed works have been concerned with looming domestic dynamics and battles among couples, siblings and families residing under one roof. Those household idiosyncrasies and preoccupations of the Greek auteur now find a new habitat in early 18th Century England, with the fiendishly eccentric and entertaining costume drama ""The Favourite."" Even if this unique absurdist has not exactly been your cup of tea previously, he might finally win you over with this deliciously ""Dangerous Liaisons""-esque and thoroughly female-driven period film, co-written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara.<br/><br/>Lanthimos does not share a screenplay credit with the duo-an anomaly and a welcome departure for the filmmaker, who usually co-writes with Efthymis Filippou with his signature formality. But this is a suitable, if not refreshingly looser canvas for his proven sensibilities, which then gets stretched over a twisty love and power triangle among British Royals. For all its expansiveness, the Royal Palace in ""The Favourite"" is nothing more than an intimate home of familial duels, with compartmentalized walls that serve as pillars of confinement. In short, it's a perfect ""Lanthimosian"" playground, complete with an array of mischievous backstabbers, tight corsets and a dash of eroticism.<br/><br/>Only sort of based on a true story and laced with plenty of creative fabrications, ""The Favourite"" follows Queen Anne (Olivia Colman, in an instantly iconic performance), one of the lesser-known monarchs of England who reigned in the early 1700s during the war with the French. An occasionally distracted and often irritable royal figure with a mysterious skin condition, overall poor health and a soft spot for luscious desserts, Queen Anne lives with her trusted friend and lover Lady Sarah Churchill (an authoritative and stiff-upper-lipped Rachel Weisz, terrific) and tends to her 17 rabbits that tragically fill an emotional void for each of her failed pregnancies. The duo's royal order, however imbalanced, gets disturbed by the arrival of the calculating, mud-covered ex-aristocrat Abigail Masham (a menacing Emma Stone, like you've never seen before), who humbly accepts a position as a servant while courting an agenda of her own to restore her glory days. Initially, an unsuspecting Sarah lends Abigail a genuine helping hand, only to quickly realize the treacherous intentions of the double-player. Various complicities reach an urgent state after Abigail works her way into the Queen's chamber as her new personal handmaid, and eventually, crawls into her bed as her lover. A poisonously competitive streak amid the trio commences in due course, while a number of male stakeholders (played by names like Nicholas Hoult and Joe Alwyn) wander in and out of the picture.<br/><br/>It would be unwarranted to define ""The Favourite"" as a timely feminist film with regards to its handling of female power in a male-dominated world. And yet, there is a certain timelessness in its old-fashioned frankness about a woman's fight to get what she wants and demand what she deserves by any means necessary; brains, sexual appeal or usually, a combination of both. Often satirical, ""The Favourite"" also grasps the complexity of circumstantial, patriarchy-defined enmity among females, obliquely bringing to mind everything from ""The Women"" and ""All About Eve,"" to ""Mean Girls"" and ""The Handmaiden."" As amusing as it is to follow the misadventures of the infinitely witty and resourceful Abigail as she plots against her Queen and Lady Churchill, ""The Favourite"" deserves credit mostly for rising the desperate humanity of its female characters up to the surface, as they get challenged by their respective demons around social status, undignified competition and physical appeal.<br/><br/>The impeccable ensemble of players in ""The Favourite"" are thankfully allowed to deliver their lines with actual vocal fluctuations. In other words, the customary woodenness of dialogues that mark many of Lanthimos' previous films is felt only in moderation here. Still, the filmmaker can't help but indulge in excess occasionally, especially when he reaches for a fisheye lens to disorienting effect-the physical scale of the palace and its grounds is evident enough without that surplus. Fortunately, that forgivable glut doesn't lessen an otherwise splendid package, elevated by legendary costume designer Sandy Powell's original, mostly black-and-white creations (a monochrome palette must be one ingenious way to work around budgetary constraints) and Fiona Crombie's seductive production design. Lanthimos' most accessible movie to date, ""The Favourite"" is simply awe-inspiring in the way it harbors serious themes and anxieties about womanhood underneath a deceptively feather-light surface."

","The bad reviews are all correct. The good ones are wrong. This is an awful movie.<br/><br/>I have seen the Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, but I did not realize that they were done by the same person who also did this movie until after I watched this movie. Had I known that, I wouldn't have watched this movie.<br/><br/>I watched a DVD screener on a stresming site, and I'm very glad that I didn't pay for it; not even through Netflix.<br/><br/>This is not a comedy. If this made you laugh, well then, anything will make you laugh, and I wouldn't want to be friends with a person who literally doesn't know what comedy, or even good dark comedy, is,<br/><br/>I'm starting to think Rachel Weisz really just wants to be a porn star. She's about as sexy as a BIG old tree stump, but she keeps going for these super creepy-trashy character roles, instead of sticking to things like Denial, which had meaning and was based on a true story and a real character. Her hair always looks dirty, and she always sounds like she has a cold.<br/><br/>I know this movie is trying to pretend to be clever and highbrow about having this ""deep"" message, that actually isn't deep, and that message is quite simply that what you think is good is actually bad, and what you think is bad is actually good blah blah blah. Wow that's profound. It fails so miserably at cleverly and humorously delivering that message that you don't know if the ending is kinky or creepy or sad or ehat. Most people who actually make it all the way through the movie, rewind the ending two or three times to make sure they are seeing the ending. And then you sit there and say ""Well, what was the ending?""<br/><br/>And the scenery is nice, because it's England, but you can't see anything in the windowless or nighttime candle-lit areas, because I think they actually really only used candles for camera lighting, so most of it is just dark with flickering lights and shadows.<br/><br/>I didn't care about any of the characters. They were shallow, and the only thing that they exhibited was selfishness; nothing else, because even when they were supposed to be trying to care, they just didn't pull it off I had no sympathy for them. The romping in the forest wasn't cute or funny, it was just stupid. The food scenes were gross; the bedroom scenes were icky and ridiculous (but not in the way that makes you laugh because it's a comedy). I couldn't tell the men apart, because their wigs and exaggerated make up made them all look like the same person, so I didn't know who was whom half the time.<br/><br/>And gee, Collin Farrell missed his chance to be in a third one of the pieces of crap that this guy puts out. Or maybe he finally realized what a mistake he made twice over by being in both The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer.<br/><br/>Don't waste any of your precious minutes on earth watching any of these three movies.

Why spend a fortune on location shooting in castles if your just going to drop the ball with script details?

I will always downgrade a movie for having thematic sex and little or no nudity. I don't care what era the movie is filmed in, or what the cast may be comfortable with - if the movie requires sex, then it requires 'sexiness' and nudity.

","This movie is beautifully filmed, except for a few continuity glitches like modern hybrid roses appearing in bunches of flowers. However the script is untrue, unfunny, unbelievable, disconnected and absurd. Rubbish in a word. The syntax and meaning traduces and betrays the truthful, coherent, sophisticated language which was widely spoken in the period, as is evident in the works of contemporary writers such as Swift, Defoe and Alexander Pope. Much of the sound track is unforgiveably unmusical and gimmicky for a score which is supposedly suitable for musical ambiance in the era of Handel and other great composers and librettists of the day. This film, as its idiotic scriptwrters and director have apparently conplained ['...'is not meant to be historically accurate...']. It would be more honest of them to say that the whole concept is a clumsy mixed metaphor, confusing different periods of English cultural history, trivialising important political events and misrepresenting and belittling historical characters. This mixed up confusion is applied in equal measure to the dialogue, with grossly vulgar and gratuitously smutty swearwords and snidely sexist 'witticisms' interlarded with reasonably coherent observations and grating asides such as ""I guess that's all right then"". Sadly, though the cinematography is beautiful, the script, the dialogue and the action are uniformly unsatisfactory and make this film, almost unwatcheable.... however much the studio's paid hack critics try to rescue it, cheerlead for Oscars etc.
What a pity...but hats off to the cinematography."

","I am not a very good reviewer, however this movie shook me to my core and I feel the need to share the experience I had with this movie. Possible spoilers ahead.<br/><br/><ul><li>The acting was phenomenal, particularly from Coleman, the chronically ill Queen Anne/the main star of the show. Her toss between extremely tranquil to the hysterical is seamless and awe-inspiring. Her comedic timing and subtle facial expressions is something worthy of an Oscar alone. Stone and Weisz are on par with Coleman, with their subtly feisty scandals and mischief that they put themselves into in order to be in favour of the queen is something that kept me on the edge of my seat.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The filming and directing style of the movie is another aspect that I thoroughly appreciated. Particularly the fish-eye lens that is used in that majority of the long shots, in which the camera moves from one side to the other. The decision to use that style is incredibly unique and not something I quite understand but appreciate.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A scene that I just want to pick out (spoilers ahead), is the scene where Sarah walks in and finds Abigail topless in bed next to Queen Anne. When Sarah walks out and into the corridor holding nothing but a lit candle, which is the only light source provided for the shot. Sarah is the only being shown in the shot, whereas her entire surrounding is completely black, perfectly symbolising her current state of loss and confusion. Absolutely stunning!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The slow burning progress of this film was so well done, I found myself progressively edging towards the edge of my seat. So many twists and turns, so many shifting of the balance that takes place in the film, the time flies by without you realising it. By the end of the film I realised that I had held my breath for quite some time.</li></ul><br/><br/>Again, I am not a very good reviewer, so I am not going to write anymore and pretend I am an expert in film, but this film is so unique in its style and form, and so raw in its acting and the realness yet absurdity of the time it takes place in, I just wanted to share my thoughts and views."

"kpentlanduk","10","4","13","13 January 2019"," If you love film you should recognse this IS a masterpiece.
","I have seen this movie twice now.
Anyone who gives this less than a 9 - please ignore their view. They are not into movies. That simple. That might sound completely pretentious of me but truly. Anyone giving this a bad review... it is beyond my understanding. You can dislike it sure. But you cannot as a film fan hate this.<br/><br/>What you have here is a masterpiece.
The Favourite is not at all a comedy. It absolutely DOES have comedy liners of genius delivered by a female trio who all deserve the highest of praise. It is not a comedy though. This movie is deadly serious. I don't hear enough praise for this film from the feminist crowd complaining there are not enough strong female leads. This has three. Quite possibly three of the finest most powerful figures to grace cinema. and oh how they mock the men. and boy do the men deserve to be mocked.<br/><br/>Quite why the Golden Globes placed this in the comedy/musical category will forever be a mystery and a big mistake.
It is very very hard to pick which actress gives the best performance. Rachel Weisz probably but only by the tiniest of margins.<br/><br/>My first viewing I was captivated. Mesmerized. I was in a small crowd. some people laughed at the oddest moments. Everyone seemed to find a different section hilarious. My favourite comedic line was about 'bathing in cream to soothe haemorrhoids' but there are so many swift sharp comedy blows. The script is magnificent. Again I stress this is not a comedy. I don't even want to gategorize or pick a genre. A period piece, a drama? A comedy...
The Favourite is so many things.<br/><br/>On my first viewing I left the cinema feeling like I had quite possibly watched the most perfect film. Genuinely a film of perfection. Is that possible? Certainly the best movie of 2019 and 2018. By a long long way.<br/><br/>The Directors last work 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' unsettled me so so much. I have watched that twice and on second viewing again it shook me to the core. The Favourite excels though in every way. It is way more accessible than any of Yorgos Lanthimos previous work. The historic elements are plainly and clearly stated yet never overstated. Characters are introduced with such ease and lines of such power. The glorious mesmerising spectacle of it all made me feel gluttonous. Greedy. I felt a passion and desire for the spectacle of it all. and felt shamed. Which I believe is the point. Queen Anne tries as she might to enjoy simple pleasures but all they do is bring back the panic of loss. Watch her face as she begins to enjoy a piece of dance, or music. Then watch as the pure panic sets in. She is terrified of a simple life pleasure dare it be taken away. I think Olivia Coleman said something about Anne being absolutely allowed to act however she pleases. Anyone going through such suffering is justified to act mad, eccentric, greedy and naughty. Of course they are. The Queen Anne of whom I knew nothing about before this movie is not a pathetic figure however. She has strength. Assuredly. She is not someone to be mocked and laughed at.<br/><br/>You have three main characters all striving to forget their pains through pleasure and power. A never ending life struggle. We all have this struggle and the message sent here is power obviously corrupts. Greed, love and lust will never conquer the pain you feel. No one ever truly wins. Manipulation to get what you want is a prominent theme and again providing the same result. Temporary pleasure then deep loss and pain.<br/><br/>This film caught me at a very sombre melancholic period of my life and I felt every single intimate agonizing second. This will be a movie I watch into double or maybe even triple figures. Laugh with the script and madness of it all. Bathe in its beauty for as long as you can and possibly quite possibly you will never reach such dizzying heights again. The ending was glorious and made complete sense to me. What you make of it... well that's for you. I am sure many people will take many different things from this masterpiece.<br/><br/>A bad review should never be one of them. Ignore them and get to the cinema as soon as you possibly can.<br/><br/>Masterpiece."

Ok, so they use a fisheye - if that is the right term - lens. So what? Chris Brady's review below says more clearly than I can what else I thought. Timing isn't great for awards. I'm not sure a film that focuses on the use of female sexuality to gain power will go down too well these days with industry insiders.

"dom-lerose-8","Null","3","9","17 January 2019"," Wickedly original.
","It's the early eighteenth century and Great Britain is at war with France. An unstable Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) holds the throne in England, her trusted friend Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) governing for her while the queen deals with an injury. Along comes young Abigail (Emma Stone), Sarah's cousin, who works in service for the queen and soon forms a close bond with her, infuriating a jealous Sarah and triggering a tense conflict between the two women over the queen's attention.<br/><br/>In what sounds like a generic timepiece, director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster) generates one of the wittiest and most original films of the year. From the very beginning, The Favourite promises a fulfilling and unconventional film-viewing experience. What makes this film work so beautifully is how it uses wickedly irreverent and brutally honest comedy appropriately, not overusing it to the point it becomes unrealistic. Instead, the film plays out comically in a natural way, our characters acting and being presented as naturally flawed people instead of just their titles as queens, servants, or wealthy lords.<br/><br/>The tension that rises builds so organically and is executed to perfection by our three main characters. Olivia Colman as Queen Anne is a riot to observe, her outrageous behavior and erratic nature the perfect combination of fun and unpredictability. Emma Stone, an actress who I personally find irritable in her films, is charming, deceiving, and hilarious, her combative scenes with Rachel Weisz exuberant and show-stopping. Weisz, channeling a woman as cold as ice, is at her all time best. Witnessing these three brilliant performances match up against each other forms multiple scenes of twisted comedic gold and tense conflicts that explode into something truly special.<br/><br/>Lanthimos does a good job reminding his audience to laugh at his characters and not with them throughout their quirky journey. We're never told who to root for or who to side with, instead presented with various women whose actions and personalities you loathe, yet would want to have a laugh with. Lanthimos also excels at not drowning us in historic detail, instead focusing on the people involved with the historical conflicts occurring and not the conflicts themselves. The unconventional storytelling methods and charming vision The Favourite possesses is a wildly original work that while looks pretty (the costumes and production design are stunning and realistic), presents a disastrous mess that quietly unfolds into subtle chaos."

"richarddillomes","8","2","5","5 August 2019"," A favorite among this year's Oscar nominees
","Everyone loves a good story about the royals, right? The extravagance, the clothes, the palace, all the things that we can only dream of but will never have. So to get a peek for a short period in their lives piques our interest, and what's a story about the royals without a scandal or two? In the early 18th century Queen Anne is suffering from depression after losing all of her 17 children, majority to miscarriages and stillbirths, but is surrounded by political maneuvering and finds comfort between two cousins competing for her attention and pushing their own agendas. Duchess Sarah (Rachel Weisz) has been busy acting as Anne's right hand woman, waging a war with the French as well as the opposing political party that she barely has time to comfort the queen. Enter Abigail (Emma Watson) who seizes the opportunity to rise back among the aristocrats after their family's fall from grace due to her father's wrongdoings. The power struggle between the two is enough to give a whole new meaning to having tea in England.<br/><br/>The film is as quirky as it can get (will also remind you of last year's quirky nominee 'The Phantom Thread'): the wigs had their own trailer, natural light was used as much as possible due to the warm weather (they're in England!) and the beautiful seemingly authentic costumes were made from recycled materials, some from EBay. They were on a tight budget that after using some wigs and costumes for one scene they'd deconstruct and recycle it to be used for another. This while costume designer Sandy Powell was also working on the costumes for Mary Poppins Returns, both of which she's nominated for Best Costume. If I were to bet on someone from this team winning an Oscar, it would be her. The three main cast (all women!) did very well for themselves as well: Olivia Colman for Best Actress, Rachel and Emma are both vying for the Supporting Actress. If Olivia Colman wins, their ensemble would be all Oscar winners: Rachel for The Constant Gardener and Emma for La La Land. For the latter, this is the 4th Oscar nominated movie she's in (if my count is right), after The Help, Birdman and La La Land. I remember in Birdman I said given the right roles she has a bright future ahead. And based on her statistics, out of all her total nominations of 63, she won 31 of them giving her a 50% win rate. Nothing to laugh at for someone that started in The House Bunny and Easy A.<br/><br/>The film though admittedly did not set out to do an accurate depiction of what really transpired, still made a great point of the following items which are still relevant in today's times: a powerful leader with flailing health, manipulated by an aide with her own agenda (someone local comes to mind); that being a good ruler has nothing to with gender but women are less likely to go to war; and the eternal question of whether you want the kind of love that's sweet but fake or the kind which is brutal but honest (kinda like news, too.) As one character in the movie said: Favor is a breeze that shifts direction all the time. The question is which side will you be on when it all falls down?"

Worse yet, how low or to what degree will these two women stoop to maintain it to get into the 'favorite' spot? These women know no bounds and are truly despicable and devious. As Queen Anne's health deteriorates and her desires...'widen', the women tend to her every need. This is a very dark film. The two bratty woman manipulate, claw and scratch into Queen Anne's good graces. This was also much more frisky than anticipated and semi-surreal at times. Not sure I'm buying the fish eye lens shot choices. Unless it is intended to help to accentuate the surreal or absurd atmosphere of the film. I didn't realize this was from the same director as The Killing of a Sacred Deer and The Lobster both of which I enjoyed watching more and both were very strange and creative; although I felt this was less uniquely creative.

A movie that simply grinds on in depicting a historical figure as so pathetic is hardly great cinema, and what's worse is that even the storytellers here, meaning the script writers and the director, have no sense of direction or moral compass regarding any of the scripted characters.

Instead it is a dark (both literally and figuratively, they used practical contemporary lighting; candles, fires, torches) humorous, and intentionally anachronistic look at Queen Anne and the rivalry between the Duchess of Marlborough and her Cousin Abigail. I'm not a historian so I have no idea how true any of the plot is, but wow is it entertaining. Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are sniper tongued, empowered women who would seem to be transplanted from the Red Keep of Westeros. Witty dialogue, great costumes and awesome cinematography are what the viewer has to look out for.

"nyancatcandy","9","2","5","16 March 2019"," A masterstroke from the entire film crew
","When it comes to unique story telling and unique character this movie doubtlessly excels. It really is refreshing to see three strong female leads, who are not defined by their gender, rather than pompous men playing worn out heroes. This movie provides for a whole new colour to the spectra of films.<br/><br/>There are many brilliant things about this movie. For starters, the acting is absolutely spot on, especially the three leads, Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz. But the side characters are perfectly poetrayed as well, by the likes of Mark Gatiss and Nicholas Hoult, giving the feel of actually being in 18th century England. Not only that, but it gives the the movie a feeling of beeing complete, that there is no question about a characters appearance.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I really liked the distinctive use of different camera shots, like the fish-eye lens used in some shot. This coud've easily flopped, but it turned out a big success making the shots feel more solitary. The directing overall is very nice by Giorgos Lanthimos earning him the Oscar nomination for best directing well deserved.<br/><br/>Another thing it was nominated for, was Best Costume, which it definitely should have won. There are so many different clothings, dresses and suits, all so well done to the slightest detail, adding to the already realistic and wholesome feeling of the film.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so good is not only its virtue, but the exceptional story telling and character developements. Throughout the film we see major changes in characters as the three mains engage in an intense love triangle with Stone's and Weisz's character toying and manipulating Olivia Colman's fragile queen. The ending to this tale had me shocked in my seat at the theatre. Though at first the ending felt abrupt, you soon realised what a brilliant ending it was and how it reflected back upon the wole movie.<br/><br/>But not to mention, the most oustanding about this film is Colman's performance. It is dazzling, ravishing, tantalizing and sensational, one of the best performances of recent time, and a very very very well deserved Oscar for her.<br/><br/>Some of the critique against this movie is unanswered, as this film is truly a masterstroke from the whole film crew. It is one of the most complete films I've seen, and it is staggeringly good."

","This film is just so incredibly boring to watch, that's it's first and worst offence. At least films like The Room and Birdemic are entertaining. Me and a friend of mine went to a private screening in London, just me and him and we constantly had to joke around and crack wise to stop ourselves from falling asleep. Other than that the acting feels very weird, like it did in the Lobster, difference is here that this is supposed to be based in reality and on true events so it just comes off as bad. There's a lot of randomly sexual scenes throughout as well, I like a roll in the hay as much as the next guy but every other scene there's just people having it off for no particular reason, either in the background or front and centre for all to see. The film looks stunning at times with the sets being a true spectacle and the framing of the actors and locations being near masterful but sometimes the camera does this very weird and disorienting pan and it just ruins it. The film also has virtually no plot, there's obviously the film's namesake of the characters fighting for the affections of Olivia Coleman's queen but it all feels very inconsequential due to the film's very abrupt and pretentious ending. The film also has a subplot about the war which serves to shift peoples loyalties but is far too focused on and drawn out for such a simple task. The film's humour also almost exclusively boils down to posh people swearing which is somewhat amusing the first couple times but it loses it's novelty very quickly. The only good things I can say about the film are that it's set design and costume department are beautiful along with it's use of natural lighting and static cinematography. Can't give it any more than a 4 out of 10 I'm afraid and that's being generous."

There were parts of the film that unsettled me and made me uncomfortable, which I think is half the fun.

But Olivia Coleman really stole the show, anytime she wasn't on camera I was missing her. She was such a tragic, fascinating, emotional character and I couldn't get enough. She absolutely killed it.

","This movie is not a historical drama - it's about Brexit!<br/><br/>Queen Anne is England/UK
Lady Sarah is The European Union/EU
Abigail is the East European workers who migrated in millions to the UK after the extension of EU in 2004 and 2007.<br/><br/>Abigail has only one goal - to secure herself by winning the queens favor. This is only posible by marriages. So she poisons the relationship between Anne/UK and Sarah/EU. This long lasting relationship is built on history, love and deep dependence. When the bond is broken, Sarah/UK gets of and flee the UK with a small scar on her face, while Anne/UK is hemiplegic (both on the left side).<br/><br/>With Sarah/EU gone (Brexit), Anne/UK is left ambulated and alone, just realizing that Abigail/Immigrants really doesn't care about others than themselves and certainly not her rabbits (the replacement for her dead/missing children).<br/><br/>On the other hand Abigail realizes that she has prostetuded herself to an old sick queen, whom she must nurse and obey though she will never be respected nor thought of as an equal. Abigail is a rabbit herself and she has let the rabbits out of their cage to breed without any control.<br/><br/>Moral of the story: Maybe Queen Anne/UK didn't like the domination and honesty of Lady Sarah/EU - but without her she is helpless and the country will fall apart.<br/><br/>Oh and why did the director dress this movie in a historical drama and classic BBC-style? I think he probably wants a certain kind of people to watch the movie.

","Three character leads, all female. Quite a feat in itself. There's the queen. Two competing females surrounding her. Two male characters supplementing those functions. Plus a lover. Which makes for a nice geometrical figure, a hexagon one might say, and the narration balances it out very nicely, in the natural top-to-bottom way. Thus making for an intellectually and aesthetically pleasing experience.<br/><br/>The film employs a few techniques you would normally consider gimmickry, like the application of very wide angle shots, but here they're effectively not. I.e. where wide angles are often combined with closeups for the distortive effect, in this movie they actually do provide you with panoramic views of even small places, and organically blend into an overall coherent visual concept.<br/><br/>There's some sources the film appears to draw from, like The Draughtsman's Contract and Barry Lyndon, but it confidently implements its own handwriting throughout. Locations, costumes and production design are superb. Music fitting. The color palette leans more towards a natural tone. Lighting is great. And personally I very much appreciated what seems to be a complete absence of steadicam photography.<br/><br/>Overall one of the very, very few contemporary films actually worth the price of admission."

","The Favorite is a movie with strong women (the men are mere eye candy) who quarrel malevolently."
"VVMini","9","2","5","28 December 2018"," Mesmerizing and hypnotizing
","""The Favourite"" combines an everwinding script with technical excellence and powerhouse acting, making for an overwhelmingly positive, almost hypnotic experience. It's easily Yorgos Lanthimos' most accessible movie, which still makes it very absurd and satirical by you average movie standard, but storywise feels more conventional than his previous outings, which I consider to be a positive thing. Whereas for instance ""The Lobster"" felt a little absurd for the sake of being absurd, the absurdity in ""The Favourite"" comes from its absurd settings and characters, inspired by real life British politics and the monarcy in the 18/19th century. It is absurdity that makes you think 'Man, life was weird back in the day', rather than 'Look at that character doing silly things because the writer wrote them as silly'. It's exaggerated but still largely believable.<br/><br/>There are a few areas in which ""The Favourite"" excels beyond its overall solid script. On a technical level, the camera work is top notch, constantly twisting and turning, making use of all sorts of different camera tricks to highlight the absurdity of the setting. I especially love what they did with the lighting, constantly making use of natural candle light to only focus on the characters' faces and drown out the dark background. There's an especially beautifully shot scene between Emma Stone and Nicholas Hoult's characters taking place outside at night entirely in the dark, seemingly only lit by old school braziers. It gives the movie a much more authenthic feel.<br/><br/>Musically, it's pretty great too. There's your average choiry, organy score that you'd expect from a period piece, which is executed very well. More impressive are the moments where the music becomes very minimalistic, nothing more than a constant rhytmic drum, which gives off an incredibly hypnotic vibe that could last for 10 minutes at a time. It does a great job in drawing you in.<br/><br/>However, it's the acting which truly makes this movie stand out. The main trio of actresses are all exceptional in their own very distinct way. Rachel Weisz plays the more distant, seemingly harsh and coldhearted character who you believe can turn to murder at any time. Emma Stone on the other hand plays the instantly loveable, somewhat clumsy and endearing character that only Emma Stone can play. What's great about these two performances is that over the course of the movie they become much more layered and there's more than meets the eye for both characters. Your sympathies constantly shift between the two, which is a testament to both the writing and the versatility of the actresses.<br/><br/>As amazing as Weisz and Stone are, it's Olivia Colman that truly steals the show, like she does in anything she is in. It helps that she gets the more meaty scenes in which she can let loose and go all in, but it's her quiter moments and her subtle facial expressions that truly sell her performance. She can go from absurd, childish, and over-the-top, to heart-broken and introverted and back all in the course of a single scene. She has the most absurd things to say and do, but she's also the most human and loveable of them all. I'm stoked that Colman's finally getting the recognition she deserves, because I genuinely believe she is the best actress working today.<br/><br/>Despite me being overwhelmingly impressed, there are some flaws that I need to address. In particular, the movie struggles in its third act to come to a conclusion. The story seems to fold onto itself a few times, and extend beyond a natural ending point, making the movie seem longer than it truly is. At the end, I thought I had watched a 2,5 hour long movie, when in reality it was under 2 hours long. The script could have used a little thightening up in that regard, particularly because it also loses some of its trademark absurdity by the end, making you slightly lose some interest.<br/><br/>These minor storytelling faults not withstanding, I did genuinely love this movie. It may not be for everyone, and that's entirely fair since Lanthimos' previous movies weren't really for me either, but the combination of technical excellence and superb acting alone makes this movie a must-see in my book."

"sweidman-28016","9","2","5","18 December 2018"," Amazing
","The Favourite Review:<br/><br/>The Favourite is Yorgos Lanthimos's new comedic period piece centering around the reign of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) in the early 18th century. Sarah (Rachel Weisz) is the caretaker of Anne and basically runs the country for her. Eventually, Sarah's relative, Abigail (Emma Stone), is employed at the castle and it becomes a battle between Sarah and Abigail to become Anne's favorite. This movie was in my top five movies to see this year so I was super thrilled to get the chance to see it. Yorgos Lanthimos has directed two movies which I really like, The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer. He always has great direction to his bizarre movies. This movie is amazing and his best yet. The story is dramatic, comedic, and crazy. The three women brought so much to the film. I can't picture anyone else to cast differently. Olivia Colman has her best performance yet. She's nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Actress Comedy/Musical and it's between her and Emily Blunt for Mary Poppins Returns. Both Stone and Weisz are nominated for Best Supporting Actress. If there was separate categories for Supporting Actress one of them would win. They equally did a fantastic job. The character dynamics were amazing. There was so much development and shifts that made the characters so interesting. Along with the shifts in the characters there were great shifts within the story. There are many twists and turns within the story that were executed well. The screenplay may get nominated for Best Original Screenplay, like it was for the Golden Globes. Probably won't get nominated for Best Director even though Yorgos Lanthimos did such a good job. The cinematography by Ryan Robbie was beautiful. He's done cinematography for A24 films but has never been nominated and probably won't for this. There is no score, like all of his movies, but the pieces picked out worked very well with the story. The production design could get nominated because it was so extravagant. The costume design was really good. And the makeup and hairstyling was good, but it wasn't in the Oscar Shortlist. My only critique was there were only a couple slow spots but I didn't make too much of and impact on the overall product. The Favourite is a fun, beautiful film that is a big Oscar contender. It is getting very good reviews on all platforms, except for audience score on Rotten Tomatoes (60%) but IMDb is by the people and it has a 8.3/10). I would highly suggest seeing it, though it's a limited release and won't be anywhere around here (I had to go to Madison).<br/><br/>My Grade: A"
"aciessi","8","2","5","9 December 2018"," Play the Favourite
","Yorgos Lathinmos might have just made his masterpiece, or so it seems, because The Favourite is as uniquely a product of his twisted world as it is a marketable indie Hollywood film that nobody would expect from him. He's come a long, far way from his Dogtooth days. Yet, that spirit still lives on. Films that make you cringe and gasp at the sublimely grim existences he allows to to explore. The Favorite is deeply unsettling. But at the same time, whimsical, vulgar and hilarious. I'd say watching The Favourite after watching Dogtooth similar to drinking bourbon after swigging gasoline. One burns just a little bit less, but it still burns.<br/><br/>The victorian era of Great Britain has never been more salacious. It's the story of two women, Sarah Churchill and her cousin Abigail Hill, vying for the affection and favor of Queen Anne. As the bloody politics of Europe swirls around the men in parliament, the women of the kingdom settle a battle just as bloody and perhaps even more vicious. Fame, glory, and yes, even sex. Advising the Queen is a royal honor worth having, and Abigail wants in on it. But she needs to shiv Churchill and throw her out with the royal garbage. This becomes a devious, fascinating spectacle. On top of this, Lathinmos comes at the era itself with nothing but good humor. Picture Milos Forman's Amadeus colliding with Monty Python, and you get the absurdity of The Favourite. Don't make the mistake of taking the subject matter too seriously, because even the characters don't. Between debating politics, the kingdom partakes in such sophisticated pastimes as duck racing, fire eating, throwing fruit at portly naked men and dance competitions that look more in line with the 21st century than the 18th.<br/><br/>This movie is begging for me to love it, and in many ways, I do. The originality is off the charts. You won't see any movie this season as wild as The Favourite, and for a stuffy-looking period piece, thank God for that."

"ignorethisspam","8","3","10","8 December 2018"," Terrific movie, terrible soundtrack
","Great movie! REALLY annoying soundtrack. Imagine this: you have a stringed instrument-- maybe a violin, maybe a cello, and you have a bow. You scrape the bow across a string, producing a short sound like a quarter-note, then you pluck that string with your fingers. The result is a a sort of a brief hoo-hah sound. Now repeat that for what seems like 20 minutes. And make it REALLY loud. Hoo-ha, hoo-hah, hoo-hah. After the first 10 minutes, I'm no longer suspending disbelief: I no longer feel like I'm in 18th century England. I'm sitting in a movie theater being annoyed by this loud noise from the speakers. After a few more minutes I start to wonder: is this actually the soundtrack, or did the fire alarm go off? I look around the auditorium to see an audience of people who are also looking around the auditorium to see if they're the only ones in extreme discomfort. Eventually the hoo-hahs stop, but they pick up again briefly later in the film, once again pulling you out of the queen's bedchambers and dumping you into a theater seat. One of the lines in the film refers to ""five of the birch,"" meaning that the character is about to be whipped with a cane. I wouldn't want to do that to this film's soundtrack composer or musical director.<br/><br/>But I would pay to watch it."

","I have witnessed how the careers of non-American filmmakers who were once nonconformist, critical and rebellious, changed when they received awards from Los Angeles, New York and, to a lesser extent, European film festivals. I am not questioning the awards, for I believe that when someone deserves a prize, it is fair to grant it. The unfortunate thing is that, to guarantee a position in the factory of mainstream cinema, some filmmakers who previously questioned the bad side of ""what is established"", become submissive and conformist when they receive Oscars, Globes and other awards; others lose the strength of their radical positions, while a few renounce the cultural force that their first films had, which were made in their homelands.<br/><br/>Two illustrative cases are those of Spaniard Pedro Almodóvar and Mexican Alfonso Cuarón. In the first case, although the man from La Mancha preserves the ""Spanish cultural brand"" that has made his cinema always attractive, his recent films conform to a catalog of common places in melodrama, applauded by a group of moviegoers who never saw his imperfect and corrosive, passionate and exemplary cinema that he made in the 1980s. Then there is Cuarón, the traveler who, from his applauded debut in Mexico jumped to Hollywood, to little princesses, Harry Potter and Dickens, recovering his original cultural stamp each time he returns to Mexico, although «Roma», his 2018 movie, shows him as an orchestrator of an excessively elaborate exercise for the Netflix era. Both men are talented and know their trade, there is no doubt about it, but from «Matador« to «Hable con ella» there is an abyss, similar to that between «Sólo con tu pareja» and «Gravity».<br/><br/>Now the ""evil eye"" has touched Greek Yorgos Lanthimos. Here the transformation breaks one's heart. He even poses differently for the photos now: from those, in which the daring novice appeared in the projections of «Dogtooth», to those of Yorgos 2019, it has rained a lot. He already directed Kidman, Farrell, Weisz, because he also has talent and know his trade, of course... If in the next installment of the Oscars to 2018 films, I had to choose between Cuarón and Lanthimos for the Best Direction award, I would give the prize to the Athenian.<br/><br/>It is true that «The Favourite» is the kind of costume piece that the British have been making for centuries with their eyes closed. They are perfectly assembled, resplendent and cold, whoever makes them, including Taiwanese Ang Lee. This version, however, is more passionate, Mediterranean and some features of the Lanthimos of «Dogtooth» and «Alps» persist, as postmodern licenses in language, in a few scenes such as dance, and in the use of music. It also has three performers at the peak of the acting profession (Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz and Olivia Colman) to illustrate this historic portrait of the struggle for power, tinged with eroticism and opportunism. The stories of women in love have always sold a lot. Both men and women lose their composure with an erotic triangle of women, especially when one is Queen Anne of England with her sufferings of gout.<br/><br/>And, yes, concessions to fashion are welcome to develop a career in the West and guarantee a job. But the court intrigues extended for two long hours... and I, at least, could not help thinking ""Pity of Yorgos ...!"" A fact, in my opinion, very important to take into account: unlike his four previous features (""The Lobster"" and ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", in addition to the two already mentioned), this was not written by Lanthimos and his co-writer Efthymis Filippou. It is a pity."

","'The Favourite' is somewhat of a mixed-bag. It certainly tries to do something different with the 'period-drama', and Lanthimos' distinct style and the fantastic performances are evidently what makes it distinct. It is also clear, however, that this is the first time in which Lanthimos isn't directing his own screenplay. In terms of the narrative, this definitely isn't Lanthimos fair and this is what really lets the film down. It's never exactly boring, but you are also never really fully invested in the story and, overall, the piece feels extremely long. The core conflict between the three lead characters doesn't seem to have a lot of development, either, and it's hard to really care about them much. Sure, there are a few good scenes that explore the character of Queen Anne deeper, but I felt that, in a picture that really relies on the relationships between its core players, they are only glimpses of what should have been. Personally, I don't think that the humour really landed and this is likely something that limited my engagement in the film - it is a 'black comedy' after all - yet in my screening there were quite a lot of belly laughs, so I suppose if the humour works for you, then the film will be much more successful. Luckily, despite the weak characters and plodding pacing, Lanthimos and the cast keep it from being bad. It's definitely not my favourite Lanthimos film, but it makes for a unique 'period piece'. 6/10"

","This film promised much but delivered very little. It looks great; the three central performances are all excellent, and the cinematography, costuming and locations are all superb, although the score is a little jarring at times. Sadly, the entire edifice is a house of cards, built on the shaky foundations of a vague and unfocused script. Too many scenes add little to the plot, which advances in lurches reliant on the characters of Sarah (Weisz) and Abigail (Stone) doing inexplicable and self-destructive things for no obvious purpose other than to bring about their own downfalls. Anne (Colman) is supposed to be the unpredictable and mercurial character, but hers is actually the most consistent. This movie is best summed up by the scene in which one character fires an unloaded pistol at another, describing it as a great jest that they must find a use for later. They never do."

","Using historical characters to provide a drama, putting words in their mouths and making them do things that do not affect the course of history is fine but this film goes way beyond that and ultimately disrespects the characters and their descendants, much like Amadeus did to Salieri and his descendants (yes, he had some, contrary to what the film would have you believe: Mozart was unfairly treated in this film too). Abigail Hill/Masham joined the queen's court in 2004, when Anne's husband Prince George of Denmark was still alive and he lived until 7008. The absence of Anne's husband is the central fiction and fabrication of the film and is so gross a misrepresentation that it overshadows whatever other merits this film may have. Oh, and there were never any rabbits in Anne's living quarters, and the costumes of the characters belong to a later period. Imagine a drama about the court of Queen Elizabeth II set in, say, 2000-2004 where Prince Philip is dead and the characters wear clothes from another era. Absurd."

However, it is a very well-made movie, in all aspects, and the acting is good. This film is sure to receive an Oscar nomination for best picture. It has all the ingredients that the Academy likes in a movie. But, what this movie lacks is a solid ending.

"themadmovieman","8","2","6","28 December 2018"," Hugely funny, immensely clever, visually gorgeous and palpably tense throughout
","As we've come to expect from director Yorgos Lanthimos, The Favourite is a devilishly funny and fiendishly clever affair, complete with a quirky and bizarre story that's interspersed with moments of real darkness, all furthered by a leading trio of fantastic actresses, and beautiful visuals as far as the eye can see. It may not be quite as 'out there' as some of Lanthimos' other works, but there's no doubting the brilliance of The Favourite from start to finish.<br/><br/>What's most striking about this film, in comparison to other pieces from the director, is that it's actually a rather accessible watch, yet still doesn't do away with the unique brilliance that makes Lanthimos' films stand out so much. So, while The Favourite may not have the thrilling weirdness of The Lobster, nor the terrifying deadpan nature of The Killing Of A Sacred Deer or even Dogtooth, it manages to blend a more accessible style of cinema with that unique style in such a way that it still makes for a thoroughly entertaining watch throughout.<br/><br/>Now, when I say entertaining, I mean that this is the sort of film that goes to dark places, and puts an evil grin across your own face, whether you like it or not. Its story centres on the rivalry and lust for power of two women in the court of Queen Anne, and while that plot makes for brilliant excitement, intrigue and tension, it's played out in such theatrical and often even comical fashion that it's impossible not to love every single minute of the characters' backstabbing and Machiavellian movements.<br/><br/>Complete with a striking and brilliantly tense musical score throughout, as well as the striking cinematography and gorgeous production design, the suspense and fire between the two women vying for the Queen's affections - to become 'the favourite' - becomes stunningly palpable throughout, with the film's middle act in particular seeing all hell break loose in court as the balance of power begins to shift immeasurably.<br/><br/>Of course, there's no denying the role that the three leading actresses have in this film, and Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone and Olivia Colman all do a fantastic job from beginning to end. Weisz puts on a strikingly steely and hard-knuckle persona, perfectly encapsulating the scheming and calculating nature of her character as she seeks to maintain her position of power, while Emma Stone proves a fiendishly exciting contrast, playing the cute and innocent handmaiden on the outside, but with just as much, if not even more, intentions for power burning within.<br/><br/>In the middle of the rivalry between Weisz and Stone's characters, Olivia Colman gives a fantastic performance as a frail, tragic and aged Queen Anne. Not only does she often provide brilliant comic relief to the dark and scheming battles between Weisz and Stone, but Colman also brings the film's most surprising and riveting dynamic, the role and thoughts of she who is being fought over, something that a lot of films with similar premises fail to pick up on.<br/><br/>So, with great performances and a thoroughly exciting story throughout, there's only one thing that could make The Favourite any better, and that's good humour. Once again, the movie isn't quite on the level of The Lobster when it comes to delivering on the insane comedic front, and there are admittedly parts of its first and particularly third acts that feel a little low-energy in that regard.<br/><br/>However, at its best, the movie is a non-stop laughter fest that combines the intrigue and drama of its fascinating and exciting story with no-holds-barred, off-the-chain comedy, particularly during its exceptional middle act, where the film erupts into a thrilling and hilarious masterpiece all at once. There's a case to say that the best comedy and best thrills peak a little too early, and that the final act is a little underwhelming, but after such a stunning middle portion with some of the best filmmaking of the year, it's a very tough act to follow.<br/><br/>Overall, then, I loved The Favourite. Another brilliant gem from director Yorgos Lanthimos, the film is devilishly funny and thoroughly exciting from beginning to end, complete with beautiful visuals and music, three stunning lead performances, riveting dramatic tension, and fantastic humour."

","These type of offbeat period dramas are typically not my cup of tea. I just don't find a lot of them to be interesting subject matters but heck, I was excited for The Favourite. Not only do I love Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, but Yorgos Lanthimos' last film (The Killing of a Sacred Deer) was an insanely enjoyable near-masterpiece. But I wasn't thrilled with The Favourite. It doesn't get interesting until about an hour in, and at that point it had already almost lost me. With that said, once the turn of this movie begins, it's like a trainwreck you can't help but keep your focus on (and I mean that in terms of story, and in all the best ways).

Although this film does force us to imagine what it must have been like to live without an effective treatment for gout, it absolutely drills the point into our heads. The scene in which a woman is dragged by a horse through the forest is agonizing. Have movie-goers reached the point where they must have their noses rubbed in agony before they get the point?

","Undoubtedly, The Favourite is extremely entertaining, but it is still very ""Lanthimos"". The film reverses time to 18th-century England, and the story is taken from the real event between the Duchess Sarah Churchill and Queen Anne. Curiously, unlike most orthodox British court dramas, the primitive etiquette and political laws of the upper class society have been reduced to the fringe, and the movie has been replaced by the strange and absurd triangle love talk under the power structure. Absurdity always is the first consideration for Lanthimos to build a character survival system.Lanthimos uses a large number of wide-angle lenses, fisheye lenses and low-angle upward shots to create a grotesque, alienated atmosphere.For most people, these lenses may not be as visually comfortable, but when you choose to accept this shooting method, everything are full of other charms."
"williampsamuel","10","1","2","22 April 2020"," An Outrageous, Gleefully Offensive Comedy Masterpiece
","It is rare to find a film that is at once as highbrow and lowbrow as The Favorite. It's an almost stately period piece filled with the finest costumes and sets, as well as the most refined accents and outlandish wigs, which concerns itself with court intrigues and addresses matters such as parliamentary politics and the royal finances. It's also an outrageous, dirty minded, and sometimes downright lewd sex comedy not unlike the works of Jude Apatow. And this massive dichotomy is what makes it all so much fun.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the fierce competition between cousins Sarah Churchill and Abigail Masham for the favor of an aging and increasingly addled Queen Anne. It all starts subtly and mostly innocently enough, but rapidly becomes more outlandish and deeply bitter until we're not sure everyone is going to come out alive. All boundaries of decency and believability are crossed well before the end, but that's half the fun.<br/><br/>It's notable that while there are certainly protagonists and antagonists, there is no-one who could be remotely describes as a hero or heroine. Aside from Queen Anne, who is extremely mercurial, rather needy, and increasingly detached from reality, practically everyone in this movie is ambitious, scheming, backstabbing, and incredibly petty, if not downright b*tchy. And it's a far more interesting movie for it. There is something fascinating and deeply shocking about watching these educated, wealthy, supposedly refined nobles constantly bickering, cursing like students at a public high school, and ""romantically"" pursuing each other with all the fervor and subtlety of drunken frat bros and sex starved sorority girls, while somehow maintaining a façade of genteel manners when anyone is looking. It's rather like a regency period Mean Girls.<br/><br/>And what girls they are. Emma Stone is in a rare form as Abigale. Intelligent, cultured, conniving, and utterly ruthless in her climb to the top, she's equally willing to betray her closest friend or jettison her own dignity, and we can't help but root for her most of the way. This may be her best performance to date. Rachel Weisz is also very good as Lady Sarah. Though not as outrageous or conniving as Abigale, she is extremely strong willed, resolute, and not at all above being a catty B when it suits her.<br/><br/>And Olivia Colman is priceless as Queen Anne. Capricious yet oddly stubborn, she's begging for attention and affection one moment, then erupting into mad tantrums the next. She would be a petty tyrant if she had the ruthlessness to be tyrannical. Instead she's like that rich, crazy old great aunt that everyone in the family has to pretend to like. Or perhaps an unruly toddler who must be very carefully coddled to sleep. And her comedic timing is impeccable. Just when you think she's calmed down and the argument has passed, she says or does the darnedest things. The whole movie's like that really, delivering the biggest shocks and laughs with no warning.<br/><br/>From a historical standpoint, this is mostly utter nonsense. But for a comedy which makes no claim of historical accuracy, this is hardly a problem. What I do consider a problem is the unfortunate inclusion of the ""fruit throwing"" scene. At the very least it could have involved better looking people, perhaps with more clothes. And admittedly it does get a bit slow in one patch towards the end. But those are very minor faults<br/><br/>This is a very unconventional blend of elements which easily could have pushed the film apart into a disjointed mess full of wild tonal shifts. Or overemphasis on any one part could have dragged it down into overwrought soap opera clichés or boring crassness, like the recent Sherlock Holmes spoof. But instead the filmmakers and cast have carefully walked the tightrope, delivering results that are oft fascinating and wildly funny. I don't know why this didn't win best comedy at the Globes, because it surely should have."

If there is no unconditional love in world, Sarah's emotion to queen is more sincere compared to others. Their daily life is so lovely even involve bicker. Exploration of love is expressed through a sense of absurdity in this movie. Anne and Sarah know each other so well and they have too much confidence in their relationship that they dared constantly challenging the other's bottom line, but forgot to maintain their good memories in mind. A real friendship can give you strength at last, but the relationship itself is fragile.
A sentence in a poem goes like that, ""If I knew my thought of you would be like this so tangled, might as well we had never acquainted."" Being emotional and subjective is dangerous, because love has limit."

","In the film, the director uses a large number of wide-angle lenses to shoot the corridors and rooms of the palace, so that the characters in the space are always in a strange and distorted environment, showing the strangeness and distortion of the aristocratic ecology. In addition, while showing the ecology of the upper nobility, the film also shows a way of thinking about women: their struggle with each other is more about jealousy and contempt for dominance dominated by emotional thinking; and the queen shows The result is a mixed image of ""feminine dominated by perceptual thinking"" and ""power offenders without female thinking""-she switches between the vulnerable heartbreaker and the powerful power , Showing weakness, controlled obedience, and strong ruthlessness in taking up power after injury, as well as tangle in expelling female nobles. Regardless of what kind of political animal it becomes, women are, after all, the existence of emotional thinking and subjective emotion. This film can be said to be a thorough ""female movie"".<br/><br/>But unfortunately, there are actually male politicians in the film-the opposition party leader tried to use Stone to probe the queen's political decision, so the script can also include political and gender-related content, and can be perfected into a film version The ""feminine perspective"" possessed can also be combined with the concept of ""darling"". However, the play still stays at the level of emotional entanglement between women, and stops at ""make the level of female entanglement the most delicate"", and becomes a kind of exquisiteness."

","Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. Starring Emma Stone, Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, Nochols Hoult, James Smith, Joe Alwyn, Jenny Rainsford, Mark Gatiss. (R)<br/><br/>Debilitated Queen Anne (Colman) rules England in the early 1700s, though her close friend, confidante, and sometimes-lover, the ambitious Lady Sarah (Weisz), handles most of the governing duties herself. But then a new, young servant, Abigail (Stone), arrives, who reveals herself to be an even more cunning schemer for the affections and favor of the queen. Deliciously clever and witty costume drama, with moments of absurd and explosive humor that are all the more outrageous set against the ornately stuffy trappings, but it's also a fascinating study of character and rivalry among the three sharply-defined women. The most accessible (and also the least daring) of director Lanthimos' work to date--most likely, the result of him directing a screenplay he did not write himself (credited to Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara); what the film lacks in his typically outlandish conceptualization, it more than makes up for in waggishness and visual splendor. Plus, there's Stone, Colman and Weisz giving three of the most memorable performances of the year; all were nominated for Academy Awards, with Colman winning.

"joebloggscity","8","1","2","2 February 2020"," A darkly comedic homage to All About Eve
","Not an obvious story to put to screen, but a lot of credit here to this director. First and foremost, this isn't very accurate history so take it as fiction despite the real life characters, and the language & actions are very disputable.<br/><br/>Anyhow, we have a story set in early 18th Century England under Queen Anne, a Stuart monarch many even in England know very little about. Not exactly the most exciting monarch that country (or any of the British Isle countries) have had. So, we have really here a story that is a near homage to 'All About Eve' as we have a Queen who is partially disabled being twisted & controlled by here First Lady (Lady Sarah) but things take a turn when young Abigail comes onto the scene, with power & scheming one & all.<br/><br/>It's actually a very dark comedy, and very sexual (surprisingly so for a story of the era). It's paced wonderfully with lots of pompous hypocritical characters (so little has changed in poltics).<br/><br/>The real strength is the acting, the film is almost peerless. Rachel Weiss, Olivia Colman and Emma Stone are just perfect in their triangle of love, politics and scheming. Really this film does more for female acting promotion in film than any number of superhero movies. It's powerful showing the strength of the females controlling things, and the men alongside them almost passive trying their best by pleading with them to get their way. The parliamentarians stuck in a war situation so there is no compromise possible.<br/><br/>The film is excellent, and all the plaudits are well deserved. There are aspects that maybe could have been better handled, as the twisting of history leaves me a little uncomfortable, but by no means the worst offender in film history. Highly recommended to one and all."

Sensational framework.
Magnificent photography.
Great dialogues.<br/><br/>So let's jump to the possible defect of the clearest film of all, the ""cut-off"" ending for inattentive looks:<br/><br/>I imagine that the last scene may have seemed brooding to some. However, the idea seemed to me to be exactly that of generating a latent nuisance but well contextualized. The winner who, when he realizes, is the loser. Abigail was just another rabbit in the queen's life. Sarah lost what most earned her lifelong efforts, power, but made it clear that Abigail wouldn't exactly be a winner either. Queen Anne, always imprisoned by her own ghosts, ends up doomed in the shadow of her own madness. The film is about the verb ""to lose"".<br/><br/>It remains to be made clear that the last scene is one of the best done rape scenes in the history of cinema. Their empty faces. Of the queen who, in theory, should feel the pleasure, and stares melancholy at the horizon. Of Abigail who realizes that what she had fought for could be, in short, her prison. Rabbits gently enter a background that, however, does not remove the features of both."

"dogacol","7","1","2","13 May 2019"," Anti-climactic
","There is a certain calmness that haunts Yorgos Lanthimos' works I quite enjoy. He uses the silence and drone music very well. Even though The Lobster (2015) was bit of a disappointment, Dogtooth (2009) was a beautiful film. I hope he makes more Greek-language films. I was surprised he attempted such a British film with this one. I would not have expected a period piece especially an English period piece from Lanthimos. Nevertheless, I think this is a well-made film. There are only a few moments where I was put off, where I lost my concentration. Even though I love drone and ambient music, the J-cuts he used along with these sounds were a bit too long. They could have been shorter for a more dramatic impact. Also, the film should definitely have been longer. The ending was anti-climactic, matter of fact the whole film was kind of monotonous. Not that there is anything wrong with that but the subject of the film demanded a bit of epic-ness I believe. The story is heavy on its own, the beginning was very big and symphonic but that faded away quickly towards the end of the first act. If only the film had studied the story more, and experimented less with superimpositions and drone/ambient soundtrack it would have been a more effective film. The plot was very weak when compared to the idea of the film."

I know it didn't have a single admirable character But, it was a harsh time when rules we follow don't apply.

The direction is too much though, with very wide lenses and an editing style that brings too much attention to itself. And a horrible use of music. The film is also split into sections, or chapters, but for what reason I can't guess. Style over substance maybe but luckily the substance is very strong."

"Magow-Intermean","9","1","2","23 March 2019"," The Farourite Review ðŸ’¸ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’°
","It's 18th Century England. War rages with France. But there is a bigger battle royale unravelling in the court of the declining Queen Anne (Colman): a fight between her loyal counsel Sarah Churchill (Weisz) and new arrival Abigail (Stone), Sarah's down-on-her-luck cousin. If you can decipher the artsy, spaced-out font, a quick gander at the end credits of The Favourite reveals character names including 'Wanking Man' (Paul Swaine), 'Nude Pomegranate Tory' (Callum Lewin) and 'Fastest Duck In The City' (Horatio). This pretty much tells you all you need to know about Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos' down- and-dirty period misadventure. As uncouth and unleashed as Merchant Ivory is buttoned up, it's part ribald romp, part pointed character study, part cat-and-mouse psychological thriller, part historical-political machinations. Yet buried in its black, raucous heart is a melancholic ode to foiled love and unfathomable loss. Deriving much of its emotional wallop from three pitch-perfect performances from Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, there is so much more to The Favourite than pelting naked conservatives with rotting fruit. Shot through with playfulness, it takes place in a beautifully debauched world of slow-motion duck races, gloriously modern courtly dances and c-bombs dropped with aplomb. There are lots of cinematic touchstones here - from the coolness and candlelight of Barry Lyndon to Fellini's Satyricon and All About Eve - but this still feels uniquely Lanthimos, cut from similar cloth to The Lobster and The Killing Of A Sacred Deer. His weapon of choice is the wide angle lens, making Anne's world even more lonely, a simple walk down a corridor even more treacherous. And he makes The Favourite unrelentingly physical; characters fall in mud, are splattered with blood, vomit, have Sapphic sex (never exploitative), get dragged behind horses and deliver a swift kick in the balls. Divided into eight chapters, the story spins on a gripping, delicious power struggle between Weisz's Sarah Churchill and Stone's Abigail Masham for the attentions of ailing Queen Anne (Colman): the former motivated by love; the latter by status. Stone imbues Abigail's scheming with relish, spinning from innocent and helpful to devious on a dime. Weisz's Sarah gives as good as she gets, using in-jokes and her shared history with the Queen to keep in with her. She has the least showy role but Weisz makes Sarah's complex affection for Anne affecting and true. Yet, as befits a Queen, Colman rules. She has a ball as the seemingly barmy Queen Anne, be it shouting at page boys, sporting make-up like a badger or devising weird parlour games. Yet she also movingly illuminates how the character's quirks - 17 rabbits - mask a world of pain. It's a mercurial performance, at once big yet fragile, providing a little chink of light in a ruthless dark world."
"mertafor","7","1","2","26 February 2019"," Great acting, plain story
","It's interesting to see such film gets so much hate and love from people in the same time. There are certain ""love it or hate it"" kind of movies but I think this is not one of them. I'd say it's an average story, definitely not boring, but also not fascinating.<br/><br/>Great acting, costumes and decore are the highlights but after investing 2 hours into a movie, they are not enough saving the day. But great acting will leave some memorable moments I'm sure, especially Queen Anne character (got the Oscar for it and deserved it)<br/><br/>By the way I had the feeling that I'm watching a Paul Thomas Anderson movie at first. The tone and especially disturbing (but this one is failing) soundtrack made me feel that director's style is a bit too much influenced by him. Also one other thing I'm glad I haven't seen this one in theater.

"TheJohnnyPHreak","7","1","2","21 January 2019"," Beautifully Shot Period Dramatic Comedy With Excellent Performances
","Period dramas aren't in my wheelhouse. But I will see anything with (almost) Rachel Weisz. The Favourite when I saw the trailer the first time interested me but not enough to run out to see it. Months passed and it starting getting on tons of top ten lists. Then I was listening to the SlashFilm podcast and there were multiple people just raving about this film. And there was an element about the film that piqued my interest. More about that later. I had not seen a film from Yorgos Lanthimos before viewing this. I've heard mixed things about The Lobster and The Killing of Sacred Deer. They are both on my watchlist now. One thing I had read is that those films were odd and maybe because he was directing from his own script. This time around he was shooting from a script by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara.<br/><br/>The film takes place in 18th century England, following the relationship between Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) and her faithful aid Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz). Lady Sarah governs in the Queen's sted as her health is failing. But Sarah's cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives, her charms win Queen Anne, leading to a bitter rivalry and fight for the attention's of Anne and to be her favorite. At times this movie is utterly hilarious. There were moments I was laughing out loud. But then moments when it was hard to watch these three women just tear each other apart. And they do tear each other part, mentality and psychologically. It's such an entertaining watch because I didn't know where the film was going.<br/><br/>All three leads are excellent here. Colman is the standout because she has a wonderfully honest portrayal of a woman in power who's health is failing. She's gone through so much in her life she's quick to cling to anyone who is kind to her. But from the start we know she's not in the right frame of mind. I see exactly why she's one of the front-runners for all the lead actresses categories this award season. One person I definitely think needs more attention is Rachel Weisz. As Sarah, she's tough, firm but kind and caring. There is a genuine love that Sarah has for Anne. She just knows that Anne isn't always thinking clearly. Sarah makes the tough decision that Anne can't make which puts in not in a good like with parliament, one member which happens to be Nicholas Hoult as a biting member named Harley.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is good here. For the longest time, I was a ""hater"". But lately with her roles specifically this and Birdman, I'm starting to enjoy her on screen. For me, this is the best I've ever seen her. She takes what she wants as Abigail, having a rough past, does everything she can to get to where she can be content. But is she really content? All of these women want to be happy but do everything in their power to be totally miserable. I did not see elements of the loving relationship between Anne and Sarah. It's not shown off in the trailer but it's a key part of the film. Abigail uses her knowledge during a passionate moment to gain an upper hand. That spins the story upside down.<br/><br/>Lanthimos shoots this so well, with many pants, long takes and interesting use of fisheye lenses. The movie is beautiful to look at. Like a good oil painting, the cinematography will transport the viewer to this version of the 18th century. There are moments when modern-day traits show up. The dance during the middle of the film is hilarious to the point I really thought the actors on screen were going to start a breakdance battle. Even with the setting, the still film to engage on a dark comedic level. But it doesn't get as dark as expected. I thought things might get horrific. But it seems Lanthimos wasn't to show how horrible can be without being physically horrible.<br/><br/>I will say that the end, even though there was no way to for a happy ending, the film's end kind of let me down. I was expecting more. Maybe one last act of villainy or a character trying to get redemption. But no one is redeemed, everyone gets what's coming to them. The Favourite was entertaining with a great job by the lead actresses, all who show be get some recognition during this award season. It's dark, funny, depressing but overall a nice trip to a time that was in a country going through turmoil. I'm happy with my first feature from Yorgos Lanthimos. And very happy to see he didn't play up the LGBTQ factors for but let it play out naturally as a key point to express how much some of these characters love each other. I'm excited to see his previous films and see what he can come up with next."

Lady Sarah is banished, but you get the sense that some day, she'll figure out a way to get one of her letters through. After all, you end up rooting for her. You want her messages to get to the Queen, and you want the Queen to wisen up and realize that Emma is a lying scoundrel.

The swearing alone was atrocious, there are only so many times you can hear the 'C' bomb...
Did the camera operator accidentally slide the camera to fish lens? or was that a deliberate move which was for zero visual gain.
Oh and the 5 minutes of the one continuous note on the violin being played was absolute torture, I swear that note is the base note for all car and house alarms = auditory hell.

","Movies about actual people and events tend to strain the facts, and this one is no exception, creating sexual tensions between the three main characters when no one really knows if these affairs occurred, especially between the Queen and Abigail. But never have sexual tensions been so incredibly dull. The movie is simply about one woman replacing another woman. That's it. There is no humor, no insight, no theatrics, no enjoyment, no anything other than the slow relentless movement of one story. If this entertainment had been written for the Queen in its actual time, she would have the right to execute all the writers involved. So spare yourself two hours of boredom. Go elsewhere."

It shows the true nature of relationships between maids, queens and other court ladies. And men.. But it all comes down to one thing.. Bare survival.. That was the thing that I liked the most about the Favourite.
What bothered me most was queen Anne's character. Sure, Coleman did great acting job but her character is pretty much repulsive to me.
Stone was ok but definitely not her best work.
Weisz, on the other hand, was superb and I wouldn't mind if she takes home one statuette at the oscars.<br/><br/>BUT that doesn't mean that the movie itself deserves so many oscar nods because it is not something that we already haven't seen."

"owanitall","9","2","7","9 February 2019"," Spellbinding and alive
","I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about watching this film. After Mary Queen of Scotts I felt no desire to see any more Royals and their Courts with all their scheming and self importance making it impossible to feel for them. But The Favorite proved to be a different kind of a movie. It has a Royal alright, and her Court, and lots and lots of scheming. But the alchemy between acting, direction, and writing conjured up characters that are living, breathing human beings. Every single one of them, even men in those ridiculous wigs and, in case of the character played by Nicholas Holt, ridiculous makeup.<br/><br/>But of course, the film belongs to its three female leads. Olivia Coleman plays a heartache of a Queen - increasingly unwell, depressed, and lonely, belittled and down right bullied into believing herself incapable of governing on her own. She is the most sympathetic character in the film, but Coleman makes sure she's not too sympathetic. Sarah (Rachel Weisz) is the Queen's childhood friend as well as her lover. Weisz has perfected playing characters who may or may not be what they seem (Oz The Great And Powerful, My Cousin Rachel). Here she often appears to genuinely care for the Queen. But at other times she acts like a manipulative bully. Is her loyalty really to Queen Anne? Or is she in it for herself and her husband's advantage? Maybe both? And finally Abigail (Emma Stone) - a scrappy little upstart with an almost unbelievable gift for scheming. This one states openly that her loyalty is only to herself. She seems to be a mean creature with no morals, yet I couldn't help feeling sympathy for her. Determined to never go back to what she came from, she is stuck in a permanent survival mode and quite miserable.<br/><br/>Add to these three brilliant characters creative use of musical score and editing and the movie is so mesmerizing, I didn't want it to end, and so spellbinding, I didn't care if it took creative liberties with history. I still haven't looked any of it up. Don't want to break the spell."

"howard.schumann","8","2","7","20 January 2019"," Delightful skewering of the aristocracy
","Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos (""The Killing of Sacred Deer"") whose previous films have expressed a rather jaundiced view of humanity has found a most appropriate target for his cynicism in his ""mainstream"" comedy, The Favourite, the story of sickly 18th century British monarch Queen Anne (Olivia Colman, ""Murder on the Orient Express"") and the greedy confidants who compete for her affection and power. The film is mostly fictional and Lanthimos has warned us that, ""anyone who comes to this movie looking for a history lesson is in the wrong movie."" If you think, however, that its depiction of the debauchery prevalent in Queen Anne's court is exaggerated, perhaps you are unfamiliar with the history of the Tudor monarchs who made use of murder, torture, incest, child abuse, and the burning of heretics to solidify their power.<br/><br/>Written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara (""Doctor, Doctor"" TV series), and shot by Robbie Ryan (""The Meyerowitz Stories""), the film is presented in eight parts (each given a cutesy title) and filled with the ""light"" music of Bach, Handel, Purcell, and others to provide that 18th-century touch. Olivia Colman delivers a powerful and convincing performance as the frail, gout-ridden queen who cannot get around without crutches and eventually a wheel chair and has to rely on Lady Sarah, (Rachel Weisz, ""Disobedience""), the wife of military commander Lord Marlborough (Mark Gatiss, ""The Madness of George III""), and eventually the upstart Abigail Masham (Emma Stone, ""Battle of the Sexes"") for physical and emotional support.<br/><br/>Abigail, a distant relative of the queen, who arrives at the palace caked in mud after a fall, asks for a touch of generosity but ends up as a lowly servant. Nonetheless, the resourceful maid moves rapidly up the court ladder while telling us (before we discover for ourselves), ""As it turns out, I am capable of much unpleasantness."" Both confidants of the queen soon engage in a bitter power struggle that leaves us longing for any likeable characters in the film. While The Favourite posits a lesbian love triangle, female sexuality is relevant only as a weapon rather than an element of the heart. Queen Anne herself cuts a pathetic figure as she takes care of seventeen rabbits in her quarters, sadly representing the number of children she lost through miscarriages, still births, or early childhood deaths.<br/><br/>While not in the best of health or state of mind, Anne still yields considerable clout (often through Lady Sarah) as she faces off with the overmatched Tory leader Lord Harley (Nicholas Hoult, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"") over whether or not to increase the land tax to pay for the continuing war with France (he's opposed). The only other male character of note is young Baron Samuel Masham (Joe Alwyn, ""Boy Erased"") who courts and eventually wins Abigail's hand in marriage. The film, however, is mostly about female empowerment but, in this case, there is only a difference in degree between male and female ruthlessness and the pigeons that are shot and killed on the palace grounds do not distinguish whether the bullet came from the hand of a man or a woman.<br/><br/>The verbal game playing is replete with quotable witticisms, sexual innuendos, and gratuitous insults. Much of it, however, is simply crude and filled with the anachronistic overuse of the ""c"" and ""f"" words. There is, however, much to admire in The Favourite. The physically ornate interiors of the palace are graciously designed by Fiona Crombie (""Mary Magdalene"") while the black and white period costumes created by Sandy Powell (""Wonderstruck"") present a believable 18th century atmosphere. The best part of the film, however, is the Oscar-worthy performances of Colman, Weisz, and Stone who take pleasure in their palace intrigue and in their delightful skewering of the aristocracy.<br/><br/>As for the purpose of all these shenanigans, director Lanthimos explains in an interview: ""I wanted to make all that (the bigger picture) quite simpler so that it's a film that feels relevant to us today, so you could imagine this happening anywhere in the world or anytime or place. Pare down the politics so it's easier to understand the repercussions that come from the decisions that these three, or the actions that these three women take."" The question must be asked, however, whether the world needs another reminder that cynicism is not the most productive ground of being in which to live one's life, whether displayed by men or woman, aristocrats or commoners, presidents or film directors."

","Music
As this is set in Stuart times, I had at least expected some Stuart music, harpsichord sort of thing but no. There is a constant discordant fog horn which was totally out of place and put me off from the start.

I had been informed this was a comedy. if you find comedy in someone who loses 17 of her babies and goes slightly madder and sadder with each loss, then this is for you.
Historical accuracies
I expect historical accuracy and there are certain inaccuracies but also there are anachronisms such as when Emma Stone repeats the f word as a swear word. This wasn't a swear word at that time. With all the money spent on this why put a 20/21st C swear word in a film set in 18th C film?

I imagined a story about two women battling for a Queen's attention, and it is that, but it's also a portrait of women vying for power in a very unbridled way while the Queen is barely able to cope. Lesbianism is involved though not really graphically.<br/><br/>The story is quite good though dark in the end. I'd hate to have to sort out who should be singled out for their acting. I'd have to proclaim cowardice and give it to the three female leads equally. Clearly Olivia Colman had the worst of it, her Queen Anne is not a very admirable woman, but Olivia gives her depth and breadth that is very impressive. Emma Stone has the most conventional role in that her character is engaged in a struggle against misfortune. But Ms. Stone has an unusual ability to make her roles seem somehow pure human nature and I was always a little happier whenever the camera focused on her.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz does her best work that I'm aware of. Her strength of character comes through very clearly and is really the center piece of the movie. There's no way it would have reached the heights it does without her and Nicholas Hoult who somehow make the 18th century come alive in a very engaging way.<br/><br/>Not a movie for everyone, because of its hard imaginings, but a wonderful piece of work that is sure to garner an avalanche of awards despite its director's daring spirit. The skill in display is a very rare treat."

With a promising cast, good direction, and a unique twist to normal films, I went in eagerly to see what awaited. What was the verdict? Robbie's reviews here to share his opinions as he reviews:<br/><br/>Movie: The Favourite (2018)<br/><br/>Director:
Yorgos Lanthimos
Writers:
Deborah Davis, Tony McNamara
Stars:
Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz<br/><br/>
LIKES:<br/><br/>The Acting
The Setting
The Costumes/Makeup
The Character Development
The Strategy
The Presentation, mostly<br/><br/>Summary: Film festival features are seldom squandered out of acting, and the Favourite is no exception. Rachel Weisz succeeds in her abilities as the lady of the manor, with poise, regality, and a cunning nature fitting of the character designed. Stone's transition throughout the movie is admirable, starting on end of the personality spectrum, yet showing the evolving psyche of the players of late century politics. Colman as well is an integral piece, ushering in the role and acting as the key pillar for this mad state of affairs.
But acting aside, The Favourite stands out for it's beautiful setting, with the location team and set crew working hand and hand to fashion a fitting battlefield for our femme fatales of the silver screen. The manor and all its hallowed halls and manicured lawns will take you on that international trip to historical England, immersing you into the themes at hand. As such, the characters themselves are quite dashing in their costumes, every politician, maid, and governmental officiant a welcoming tribute to the paintings of old. The leading women in particular have ravishing costumes and makeup, helping to unleash the full effect of the movie.
Yet it is the character centric story that really takes all the aforementioned strengths and pulls them together. The Favourite's focus on developing all the characters, including a few secondary characters that at first seem mere parlor tricks. As the film progresses, the strategy at hand also starts to evolve in a Game Of Thrones like technique without so much blood and murder, as inner wants and jealousy lead to some rather interesting choices. And all of this is presented beautifully in the film work's techniques. Odd angles and dark hallways mirror the tone of the movie, as a haunting soundtrack of European orchestra plays in the back adding more to the emotions of the characters. Presenting all of this as if it were a Shakespearean play only adds to the ambience of the movie, and helps this film stand out a little more in terms of artistic wonder. Yes, it certainly feels like a Thespian tragedy at hand and a nod to this approach and helping it shine in victory.<br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>The Pace at times
The Animal Cruelty
The Inclusion Of Seedier Culture
The Ending's Finesse<br/><br/>Summary: While artistic and brilliantly presented, the movie for me ran a little slow at times. The opening of the film did its introduction well, with the first couple of acts taking time to introduce the world in appropriate detail. Eventually as the rivalry develops. Things really start to take off, only to slightly take a rather large detour that offset the pace disrupting the very thing I fell in love with on the movie, with the end probably being where the steam was fully lost. Certainly some of the loss of detail comes in with the focus of documenting every move in this game of human chess, which I didn't mind.
Instead, the real loss of pace came from some of the extra details added for more of a cultural reflection of the times (details Shakespeare loved). While some of the animal cruelty showed the off the past times of the British high life, I did not need to see the repeated defeat of the small creatures, while other times were just unnecessary quirks that seemed forced and rushed in at the end. In addition some of the seedier shots such as rape, self-pleasure, and other acts of hazing didn't quite add anything to the story or feel of the movie, when my main goal was to see the power play between the two champion actresses. Sadly, this semi-focus on the animalistic side of the characters sort of deterred from the plot for me and added unnecessary length to the movie.
And like my fellow reviewers, I do agree that the film's ending did not quite suit me given all the build-up. It ends rather vaguely, and although it mirrors the Greek Tragedy's delivery, it did not quite have the same satisfaction that those ancient playwrights had. Instead, it seemed that the Favourite had a rather rushed, messy finish that gives you all the pieces you need to draw up your own conclusions of what occurred. Outside of throwing off the pace in the final two acts, the ending just didn't deliver that last punch I had wanted, or at least in the manner I wanted.<br/><br/>
The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Overall the Favourite is worthy of much of the praise it received from the festivals. The presentation is beautiful on many levels as it deters from the usual linear fashion, and it seems to really pay tribute to the tragedies that this tale is based on. In addition the story really speaks out to the culture and darker parts of history that sometimes don't get told in the text books. Yet, it's ironically that very presentation that took some of the flair away from the movie, as getting lost in the grimier aspects of human nature threw off the pace of the film and left the ending a semi-complete telling that could have used twenty minutes more to flesh out the final number with that woman's scorn I think we wanted. Overall, the movie gets points for its presentation style, but it may not quite have all the categories needed to warrant a trip to the movies in my opinion. Still, give this one a try at home if you are looking for something.<br/><br/>
My scores are:<br/><br/>Biography/Comedy/Drama: 7.5
Movie Overall: 7.0"
"jdesando","Null","2","7","12 December 2018"," Witty and raucous, even the jaded will be delighted.
","As a period, drama about baroque palace intrigue, The Favourite, concerning early18th century's British Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman) and her courtiers, is a pleasant companion piece to the intrigue-laden Dangerous Liaisons. Only this time the Queen has her eye on her two close female attendants, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz), who has been with the queen since childhood, and Abigail (Emma Stone), a former lady arriving at the manor to be a lowly attendant. The principal location, the Jacobean Hatfield House estate in Hertfordshire, is a regal playground for shenanigans fit for pets in cages, like bunny rabbits.<br/><br/>Part of the perfection of this killer comedy is the set design with tapestries and furniture as ornate and beautiful as you'd expect in a fine museum. The palace is about as gorgeous as Blenheim, and the costumes are as plush as the draperies. In short, the mise en scene is to die for baroque. This attention to detail is what can be expected of director Yorgos Lanthimos, whose Killing of a Sacred Deer and The Lobster were memorably rich while spare at the same time. In Favourite the occasional use of a disorienting wide lens to survey the house and landscape while furiously moving is worthy of Orson Welles at this wildest.<br/><br/>However, it's always about the people, and this house of liaisons and deceptions is two hours of putdowns and poison; not a moment is dull. Abagail's co-opting the Queen's affection from Lady Sarah provides the spark for the fire between the two ambitious young ladies. Without being too obvious, the film speaks powerfully about the need for women then and now to employ serious wit to get around the male-dominated world. The battle has further significance because the Queen needs all the help she can get, and these ladies are ready and willing. Along for the contest are factions of British politics, vying for the Queen's attention to a real-world battle with the French.<br/><br/>As the credits roll, some of the film's eccentricity becomes evident: ""Nude Pomegranate Tory"" and ""Fastest Duck in the City"" remind how silly and yet shocking it can be. Notwithstanding the chapter headings like ""The Mud Stinks,"" from Handel through Vivaldi to modernist Anna Meredith, the music counterpoints the raucous doings, which are accompanied by biting, crisp dialogue.<br/><br/>Through it all the determining factor is the off-balance Queen, whose whimsy could bring down a kingdom. The comparison can be made to contemporary times, where a chaotic White House begs for overthrow or at least complete dysfunction. History repeats, and if it must, we'd do well to look back a few centuries when palace intrigue appears highly amusing but through a camera lens, frightening."

"apryla-58795","3","2","8","15 September 2019"," The rabbit that Emma Stone steps on should have got an Oscar
","So...wow! Um not sure what to make of this. I'll tell you one thing I know now for sure-I'm so glad I didn't live during those times. Life was so awful back then. The Kings and Queens were mostly immature bratty ignorant spoiled children and they ruled terribly. They were basically told what to do by their advisors (yes it's like that today too BUT besides a few bad apples most of our Presidents have been intelligent individuals who have had education and experience with the military. They had to prove they could lead the US before getting the job whereas back then they just got their positions because of their place in the family gene pool). It's awful how many people lost their lives to the guillotine by a lie or just a temper tantrum thrown by a King or Queen.<br/><br/>I think this movie showed that no matter how you start out in life your station can change and you could find yourself becoming something you wouldn't normally due to the change in circumstances. And it doesn't have to always be negative. If you suddenly become rich you're most likely going to start acting and behaving differently because mindset comes into play. In this case one's station went down while the other one's went up and they both changed their actions accordingly. It must've been so hard to be at the whim of someone else's desires or wants and needs. The poor servants had it the worst! The women were violated sexually or beaten for slights. The men were yelled at by the Kings or Queens just because there was no one else around. What terrible horrible bleak lives they had.<br/><br/>I don't think Olivia Coleman should have won an Oscar for this but then that's usually the case isn't it? Sometimes you can't understand why some people win and others lose. OC is a good actress (even though she's hard to look at on-screen) but she wasn't the main thing here - it was RW and ES's movie.<br/><br/>I don't like RW. She doesn't have much range because she doesn't seem to act in anything but these types of movies-playing scheming baddies-however she did well with her role if only because she's had lots of experience playing these kinds of characters. I'm sure audiences might feel that she did a great job but to her she probably felt like she could do that role in her sleep just because that's what she always does so I'm not sure how much acclaim she should receive for playing the same character in yet another movie.<br/><br/>I liked Emma Stone until I saw this movie-her quirkiness works well in some movies but it was out of place in this. That is just not how a person would act if they'd have been a servant in those times and no one would've been able to do the things that she did and get away with it so it's really hard to get into her acting because you are very aware the whole time that those things wouldn't be happening. Plus it really makes me sad that yet another actress who was naÃ¯ve and innocent at one point has fallen prey to the cesspool that is Hollywood. These actresses start out shunning nudity but through the constant pressure of Hollywood pushing depravity these actresses start to believe that taking their clothes off is ""necessary"" to the scene and they become obsessed with making sure they go ""method"" as they know that's a surefire way to get acclaim. Next thing you know they've convinced themselves it was their idea to do nude scenes-that's what happened here-ES was the one begging the director to let her do it. I just kind of lost a little respect for her because I thought that she was smarter than that and I didn't think that she was that desperate since she's already won an Oscar so I'm not really sure I understand what that was all about. It wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>Nicholas Hoult has not impressed me in anything since About A Boy. He was not right for this and didn't do a good job.<br/><br/>Joe Alwyn A.K.A. Taylor Swift's boyfriend-I like him but he added nothing to this. There was no heat between him and ES at the beginning like there should have been before she turned on him. He was forgettable.<br/><br/>This movie was very slow and boring and I knew there was a reason I had hesitations when I would see it in my queue. This isn't the worst thing I've ever seen but I don't get the hype at all. What was up with that last scene?! Was it supposed to convey that ES realized she wasn't the favorite and was bereft because she got what she wanted but then realized she was still miserable? IDK. Also what was up with RW saying she was ready for a change right when the guards were coming to get her husband? It's almost like she knew that was gonna happen and suggested it just to make it seem like it was her idea and not decided for her. And what was the Queen thinking at the end? Was she gonna get rid of ES or keep her or what?<br/><br/>Lastly - the music was so annoying. I just wanted to turn the volume off so I didn't have to keep hearing the same note. Plus I didn't get what the sounds were at the beginning and ending during credits. What was it suppose to be and what was the significance of having no music and just sounds we can't see and don't know what they are?<br/><br/>Don't waste your time with this-it's ridiculous and I don't think anyone would refer to this movie as their ""Favourite""."

Why? Why make up a story using real people's names, places and events?

","Apart from Rachel who is playing OK and the queen who is acceptable, the rest are average at best. The costumes and the interiors were beautiful, as it is the case with all Hollywood movies, but they got lazy when thinking about dialogues (not at all in the spirit, nor form of the time), about the plot, about the depth of the characters, about the very little importance of men, in a time when women really did not matter and about the protocol at court. I would not call it a historic movie as the characters are thinking, speaking and behaving very modernly. This is at most a drama about power, manipulation, decadence and homosexuality, with people dressed in 18th century costumes . As with all films I saw in more than a decade, the 18th century is portrayed as a decadent time, so it can fit all eccentric exaggerations, the ideologically oriented director wants to: gays, aggressive language, immorality, imaginary dance styles, pornographic sexuality, duck races and so on. Out time is decadent and by comparison those days were not at all. Very disappointed as a historian, to never see a historic inspired movie that was actually interesting, since the Perfume (2006). Nobody researches the mentalities and behaviors of those times, cause if they were really brought to life, they would cause protests from the politically correctness oriented minds of today."

"stevewalt10654","1","2","8","7 February 2019"," Misses on all cylinders
","I went to see this film assuming it was a period piece concerning Queen Anne. I had no preconceptions. I did not know it was advertised as a comedy. I agree with all of the negative reviews. I actually thought they were almost too kind. The movie had no focus, no plot, no depth, and aside from the performances, no redeeming qualities.
Very early in the film, when Abigail cuts her finger on what appears to be a sliver of glass while scrubbing the floor and then carries on as it she was mortally wounded, I knew something was amiss. Putting together a comic-drama is a difficult task. The writers, producers, and the director of this movie all failed miserably at the attempt.
""Fargo"" is a perfect example of this genre done well. The Favourite was not a comedy, not a drama, and not a comic-drama. It was just a mess.
Olivia Colman gives an Oscar worthy performance as the queen. Rachel Weisz (Lady Sarah) and Emma Stone (Abigail) are excellent in their roles but I do no think they deserved a nod. There was simply no depth to their characters. Where they came from or how they got to be who and where they are, on an emotional level, is completely ignored. The queen has ducks running all over her bedroom that supposedly represent the number of her children, yet she never mentions one of her offspring. I have not seen any of his other films, but it this is an example of Yorgis Lanthimos' work, count me out.
The cinematography was amateurish. Robbie Ryan makes one bad choice after another, difficult to do given the canvas he had to work with. He seems to view light as an enemy. For some reason, he shifts his style to the point of ridiculousness. Wide angle lens used here, panoramic lens used there, and fisheye shots sprinkled throughout that add nothing to the film.
The costumes lacked any spark or ingenuity. Aside from the principals, there were only two costumes: one for women and one for men. There was an opera recital scene in which the attendees, all women, were indistinguishable. Was it a group of nuns?
The sets didn't fare much better. OK, I'll forgive the mish-mosh of period pieces all over the place. I can't forgive the obsession with tapestries on every wall, ceilings that were 300 years ahead of their time, or the fireplaces that were half the size of the real thing during that period.
Many have said this was ""the worst movie I have ever seen."" I'm not sure I would go that far, but it is definitely in the running. On the other hand I am sure that the music (if you could call it that) WAS the worst I've ever heard. It was so painful to listen to I almost left the theater. I can't blame the composer as there was none. The score is comprised of numerous compositions just thrown together presumably by the director and/or the three additional producers.
There were other things that did nothing but annoy me: The aristocrats throwing tomatoes at a naked guy for entertainment, the man having intercourse with a prostitute at a brothel - nothing exactly wrong with that - but standing up with his clothes on?, Sarah getting dragged through the forest by her horse for what seemed like an eternity, and the sex scenes that all involved masturbation, none of it reciprocal, and natch, like the ""John"" in the brothel, everyone is clothed at the same time. There is a lot of throwing up for no evident reason. The actresses just grab a pot and heave at whim.
The end of the movie made no sense at all and for the vast amount of viewers at my movie house it was a WTF moment. At the same time it may have been the best part of the movie as it indicated this tragic waste of time was over with.
Still there are many critics I respect who have opposite views. For the life of me I don't understand what they see in this. That said, if you still want to see it,wait for HBO. It won't cost you anything and you can always turn it off anytime you wish."

","Three excellent actresses and a script with potential ruined by no ending, irritating music and annoying direction. Clearly the director watched Citizen Kane (and tried to copy low-angle camera shots) and Barry Lyndon (filming with candle-light). While Welles used darkness and shadows for effect, this guy decided that shooting half the film against bright windows would be artistic but was just irritating. The director is nominated for the David Lean Award - another David Lean he certainly isn't. I can only assume that three strong female characters and weak or unpleasant male characters as well as pretentious film-making wowed the critics and Academy voters, sadly they all forget that being PC does not make a film entertaining or great."

"JonathanWalford","4","2","8","1 January 2019"," The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly
","The Favourite is a beautiful looking film - there are stunning wide angle shots especially of scenes at the sprawling Jacobean Hatfield House that stands in for Kensington Palace where the real story took place (Kensington was unavailable for filming since it currently houses a dozen or so members of the royal family.) The acting is also excellent, especially the parts played by Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone. As for the rest of the film, there are issues..<br/><br/>The trailer implied this was a comedy - it is not. You could call it a dark comedy, but that would mean you find violence, sexual misconduct, bullying and all forms of behaviour that rely upon someone's misfortune amusing. Also, the story is based on historical truth, but not facts. The timeline of the actual events is compressed from over a decade to perhaps a year, and period gossip and innuendo is presented as having actually happened (the lesbianism subplot is pure conjecture.) This lack of historical accuracy bothered me at first but there are plenty of clues for the viewer to get that this is a loose interpretation - a re-styled version of history.<br/><br/>Someone who knows the period will spot that this is a superficially accurate period film. The costumes, which are very effective, are artistic re-imaginings of c. 1705 period dress. The costumer, Sandy Powell, uses a strict black and white palette (colours that were used minimally at the time) for women's court dress, and many anachronistic textiles and decorative techniques including laser-cut vinyl. Some gowns are pure imagination. Queen Anne's white velvet gown with ermine tails was not based on anything the monarch ever wore. There are many images of Queen Anne wearing many different gowns, so this was a conscious decision to distort the truth.<br/><br/>If you missed the fashion clues, there were other anachronisms and artistic licenses dotting the film. The dance sequence near the beginning includes moves from the gavotte, waltz, jive, and hip hop; the pooled draperies; visible hot air vents; flowers used in arrangements that weren't yet introduced to English gardens; the lack of floor coverings...<br/><br/>So take this film with a grain of salt. It is beautifully styled, but so far from the facts that the only truth that remains are the names of the characters. The usual response to this type of criticism, is that 'It's not a documentary', and I agree. But must history be so fictionalized to make it interesting? In our world of alternative facts and truthiness, this film will become history by those who don't google the facts."

"blanbrn","9","2","8","29 December 2018"," A different take and twist on a historical genre filled with betrayal, power, greed and intimacy.
","""The Favourite"" is one film as you watch it does have some historical context, yet it differs in many ways for it's twist of dark heart like comedy and it's very blunt and naughty like with intimate feel. Yet still it's typical 18th century England in times of sibling rivals, war, and the court of the queen and themes of power, greed, and betrayal are so common. Set in the scheme like rabbit filled court of Queen Anne(in a well rounded turn from Olivia Colman) her relationship with Lady Sarah(Rachel Weisz) is just fine until Sarah's cousin Abigail(Emma Stone) arrives then trouble stirs up as a plot of tricks and put downs lurk in the palace. As the old adage always says three is a crowd and this is true for this trio of ladies as the relationships are very toxic and filled with drama and change only wild and naughty like intimacy moves all along so well.<br/><br/>Overall the picture is a good spin and twist on loyalty and trust, or not to trust for that matter as charm and being on the throne with the Queen is highly desired in times of war and political difference, it's high drama and a little wicked blood sport of hierarchy. So view this palace as it has plenty to offer."

-Anne as an Oscar vehicle had insufficient lines or facets of personality to show depth and character development.

-they were all self-serving but seemingly without sufficient motivation for their actions.
-there was no character definition, any of the lines could have come out of anyone's mouth.
-there was just insufficient story to sustain a movie and what there was remained unresolved.
-the lesbian relationships were degraded to merely jostling for power, this was shallow and petty.
-the ending was abrupt and merely suggested Abigail was revealed for the schemer she was to Anne.
-the music jarred and was repetitive in some sections<br/><br/>I would add there was a steady steam of people walking out of the auditorium who thought is was certainly not their favourite.<br/><br/>How can this even be nominated for an Oscar when compared to The Shape of Water or Three Billboards, last years offerings."

","Let me start to say that yesterday i saw the Lobster of the same director Yorgos Lathimos and i Hated it, yet this movie i just Love it. And because of it, i went this see this movie with a lot of doubt, but this movie was great.
This movie is a huge improvement over the Lobster, even if it can still be a sinister movie, and weird in it's own way.
The thing is that the Budget is a lot bigger, being a Medievel 18 century England setup helps a lot, and this movie has a lot more straightforward script without ambiguous interpretations has the Lobster did. And there are no dull momments in this movie, (except the last thirty minutes, The movie should have been shorter), and the pace of the movie feels right this time.
The Favourite, is a exceptionally well scripted movie, with great clever dialogue and a top-notch dark humour that puts a smile to your face has the movie develops.
To explain the Plot of the movie is a easy task. It's the story of a ill Queen(Olivia Colman), that has a women of her confidence (Rachel Weiss) that makes the countrys biggest decisions in her behalf. Then arives in her castle, a women (Emma Stone), that starts working has a servant, but wants to be so much more. She is a manipulating witch, that with many schemes will rise and take the place of of the trustworthy helper of the Queen from Rachel Weiss Character. The Rivalry between the Two, define the movie, has the one who gets the Queens Favour at the End is the Favourite.
The Actors Performances, are amazing. With Olivia Colman with the leading role has the Queen(Oscar Winner in this movie), she is just Brilliant, i remember in the Lobster as the Hotel Manager, but frankly besides these two movies i didn't remember seeing her at all. She was Great and deserved the Oscar without a doubt. Rachell Weiss, should have have th Oscar for supporting role as well, i loved her role as a all controling sort of Villain, being in the end the Queens true love. Emma Stone the true Villain, and Nicholas Hoult do both also great performances, with great depth, as evil intelligent Masterminds. Of course the director and the great plot helps the intensity of the performances a lot.
The Deception, Rivalry, Intrigue, Revenge his all shown in a very humourous and clever way. Of course you can see from a mile away what will happen in the movie latter on, but even predictable the movie ending manages to be rewarding and algo satisfying...
The Ending is Fair, because everyone gets what they deserve.
I give this one a 8 out of 10, which is a lot more that o given the Lobster (2 out of 10) Yorgos Lathimos must be praised for this well done Masterpiece"

"DeBBss","8","1","3","5 January 2020"," A Great Blend of Yorgos Lanthimos
","Yorgos Lanthimos' style of movies are unique than any other style. All of his movies end in an unsatisfying way, not giving you what you always get from the average Hollywood movie. I'm a fan of Yorgos' movies, because his movies always give me this feeling that no other director can give. The Favourite gives that unsatisfying ending that you always get from Yorgos' movies; the only difference between The Favourite and Yorgos' other movies is the dialogue and acting. There's no upfront dialogue, and the acting is human like; personally, I prefer The Killing of a Sacred Deer's acting style more. Since this movie is more Hollywood, it would make sense to enjoy it more than his other movies.<br/><br/>The Favourite tells a true story of Queen Anne's relationships, between two different women, and it tells the story fairly well. An issue of Yorgos' movies are the pacing, but for The Favourite, it's paced well. It didn't take too long for the audience to pick up exactly what was going on. I liked the inhumane characteristics of Abigail, and how she disguises those characteristics throughout the film; as it shows how deceitful others can be.<br/><br/>The acting is done fairly well, the best performances were done by Emma Stone and Olivia Colman. Olivia does the best performance as she embodies a frustrated Queen perfectly. Rachel Weisz does what she can do best with this character, that character being an emotionless right hand servant to the Queen. Emma stone plays a character that is somewhat like a sociopath. Having a character that is a sociopath is necessary in a movie such as this, as it gives more emotion to an audience that is watching a movie about three women in a mansion.<br/><br/>Yorgos' directing style is all over The Favourite. There are long shots that are wide, showing the viewers the entire room or landscape. The film got two Oscar nominations for best editing and best cinematography, and it's all well deserved. Yorgos Mavropsaridis is the editor, and he gives it that Yorgos Lanthimos style. The music plays a big role in giving the film more taste; making scenes more intense.<br/><br/>Overall, The Favourite is a movie that the critics would love and the average audience would dislike. There are reasons to love and hate this movie, as some say that it has no purpose or that's slow. I love this movie as it's unique, and it makes you unsettled and maybe even depressed. If you're a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos, then this is the movie to watch. If you're just bored and want to watch a movie, then don't watch this movie, because you might be even more bored."

"benps","9","1","3","1 December 2019"," The Favourite
","The Favourite is from director Yorgos Lanthimos, and takes place within the backdrop of 18th century England, where we follow an ageing, frail Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman), whose affections are fought for by close friend, Sarah (Rachel Weisz), and Sarah's cousin, Abigail (Emma Stone), whom begins to work under Anne as her servant.
The Favourite entails a mixture of different genres, creating great variety. It mostly stands as a dark comedy, however, it never acts afraid to subtly arise itself as an intense thriller neither, nor is it to distinguish itself a romantic tale. Nevertheless, The Favourite is compelling at its core, and completely subverts the stuffy, pretentious nature commonly associated with royal period pieces.
The Favourite acquires stunningly rich attention-to-detail in its presentation, as Lanthimos adds great personality to the film, as well as voicing it with a sense of wonder and passion, in addition to having a strong even balance of maintaining the constant shift in tone throughout the film. The Favourite also looks aesthetically great, as the cinematography is wonderful, most of it based solely in the impressive techniques Robbie Ryan used in order to shoot the film largely with the usage of natural or candle lighting.
The Favourite features an wide range of talent in its cast, Olivia Coleman being the most scene-stealing, watchable of them all for me, however, Rachel Weisz made a strong turn as the films primary antagonist, and not only did Emma Stone's British accent work near flawlessly, but the progression that both she and the writing showed in her character was highly impressive.
The Favourite is also written with marvellous talent, as well as being paced and edited together skilfully, consisting of a soundtrack made up of classical music that complimented the visuals, and featuring very competent production and costume designs that bought the frame of time within the film to life increasingly more.
The Favourite was only problematic for me in two areas, as some fish-lens angles that were used didn't exactly work well for me, and the music was used to a repetitive extent, only very occasionally however, and none of this detracted The Favourite's level of brilliance for me in anyway. Its unarguably one of 2018's most well-made films, its often funny, its often intense, its always riveting, it has great things to say about the concept of empowerment and how fighting the obtainment of it can sometimes override our basic human dignity.

","Queen Anne was one of the few British monarchs still to have had her story committed to film and this was the Oscar winning result. Olivia Coleman stands out as the cantankerous and temperamental last of the Stuart's to reign; but otherwise the performances fall rather flat. The rivalry - and sometimes pretty vulgar visualisation of it - between Abigail & Sarah Churchill doesn't quite work for me and the foppish Nicholas Hoult is a parody of something from ""Blackadder"". It moves along quite sharpishly, and the craft skills behind it all are second to none, but I can't help feel that the subject matter - and the triplet of three strong women in leading roles earned it more attention that the film actually merited."

","This bizarre little gem holds the best performance of 2018. Olivia Colman has proven herself to be one of the greats over and over again in a wide array of TV shows and Indie films. She is at the top of her game here as crazy Queen Anne, caught in a battle between two women, played brilliantly by the always magnificent Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone. She's tragic, hysterical, scary, and ultimately loveable.<br/><br/>Yorgos Lanthimos definitely has a style. If you've seen The Lobster or The Killing of a Sacred Deer or even Dogtooth, you know what I'm talking about. Funny, uncomfortable, cold, disturbing, distant, beautiful, and tragic can all be words to describe his films. Most of the times an audience member may experience all of these things within a single moment while watching his films. The Favourite is no different.<br/><br/>The Favourite is truly a beautiful and absolutely hysterical film. It's definitely his funniest and most accessible film. He creates a world in which his characters speak in both a period style and a contemporary style. Rachel Weisz feels very period and cold while Emma Stone is warm and contemporary. You expect Stone to roll her eyes, pull out her cellphone, and take a selfie. It creates a brilliant comedic tone throughout the film. The dialogue is also absolutely brilliant and the cast makes it shine.<br/><br/>This is a deeply effective film that I expect many will hate. It's certainly not an easy film to watch and it does require a specific sense of humor. I found myself thinking about it for weeks. That final shot, much like the final shot of The Lobster, will spark debates among you and your friends for months after watching."

It's billed as a comedy; hmmm, I chuckled twice but if it's dark humour you love, this is for you. Compelling, strange with lots of lovely rabbits (and as Stone has commented, all well cared for) Glad I've seen it. Wouldn't want to see it again."

Too much fish eye. I liked it, it was fitting in same cases, it was new and good use of it, but it was too much. Low light shots could have been better but I'm not here to teach that cinematographer.

They could have easily achieve the same.)<br/><br/>Overall, it was all good until the very end.<br/><br/>I liked The lobster more.

","Based on true events: in 1708, Great Britain's Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) struggles with various health issues as her attention is desired by two female companions. One is Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough (Rachel Weisz) who uses her good relations with the queen to manipulate political situations on behalf of herself and her husband. The other is Abagail Hill (Emma Stone), Sarah's poor cousin who is trying to gain a higher social status.<br/><br/>Like many other recent films, ""The Favourite"" has the handicap of incomprehensible mumbling, most often from Weisz. It doesn't help that director Yorgos Lanthimos has chosen various scenes to include music that overpowers the actors' voices. Despite this liability, the film intrigues for the most part including high achievements in the period sets, costumes, and cinematography.<br/><br/>Colman does a fine job in the film's most fascinating role. On the one hand, Queen Anne is a hapless twit whose character and intelligence are below her fortunate accident of birth (how often is this the case?). On the other hand, she can be a likeable soul who is vulnerable and overwhelmed with responsible matters that rarely interest her - thus, she is easy to manipulate.<br/><br/>""The Favourite"" is a fine story of hyper-ambition and social climbing that encourages a vicious rivalry. It also tells the sad, old well-known story that the one who tries to slay a demon often becomes one in the end despite the best intentions before the rivalry."
"gradyharp","6","1","3","7 March 2019"," 'Oh it is fun to be Queen sometimes!'
","Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos has directed dance videos, television commercials, music videos, short films, theater plays and a few movies. He has a strange view of history and finds the secrets and bad habits of 18th century England under the brief rule of the gouty, slightly mad (in the film's stance) Queen Anne and with the screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara we have an entirely unique view of England's royalty and court manners (or lack of them).<br/><br/>The production company offers a rather clean overview of the ""story"" - 'Early 18th century. England is at war with the French. Nevertheless, duck racing and pineapple eating are thriving. A frail Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) occupies the throne and her close friend Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) governs the country in her stead while tending to Anne's ill health and mercurial temper. When a new servant Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah. Sarah takes Abigail under her wing and Abigail sees a chance at a return to her aristocratic roots. As the politics of war become quite time consuming for Sarah, Abigail steps into the breach to fill in as the Queen's companion. Their burgeoning friendship gives her a chance to fulfill her ambitions and she will not let woman, man, politics or rabbit stand in her way.'<br/><br/>What actually happens on the screen is naughty, spicy, indulgent and colorful X-rated survey of the sexually discordant reign of Queen Anne. Not only is there excessive raw language (were those words even in the vocabulary in the 18th century?) and considerable acting out of various forms of sensual release and nudity, but the pace is spinning, accompanied by an at times unbearably raucous 'musical score' (except for the actual insertion of classical tunes) by Komeil S. Hosseini. Granted, Olivia Colman has the work's version of Queen Anne down pat, including the post CVA weakness in her left side at film's end, and both Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz make their strange roles credible (well...?...). They are supported by James Smith as Godolphin, Nicholas Hoult as Harley and Joe Alwyn as Masham, as well as some of the most beautiful castle interiors - in lush color and bizarre lens distortion - on film.<br/><br/>The film feels much longer than two hours, but then the time spent on the sexual proclivities maintains a strange sort of voyeurism-type attention.

"lavatch","Null","1","3","7 March 2019"," Acid Wit is Not Enough to Save This Slow-Burner
","""The Favourite"" has to be one of the most overrated films of 2018. The filmmakers take the relatively little-known reign of Queen Anne and deconstruct the Queen and her court into a post-modern pastiche of proto-feminist clichÃ©s.<br/><br/>The most troubling aspect of the film was the self-conscious attempt to distort history without any clear purpose other than a mordant humor evolving out of unpleasant characters and situations. It was unclear why John Churchill, the First Duke of Marlborough would be brought down from his rightful heroic place in history to a cuckold, whose military exploits are completely misrepresented in the film.<br/><br/>It was clear that the goal of the filmmakers was to focus on the three women characters of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough; Queen Anne; and Abigail Hill, Sarah's impoverished cousin. It is Abigail who becomes the catalyst for the film's action in her capacity as a devious social climber. More than a survivor, she is a plotter of palace intrigues whose amoral actions are entirely self-serving.<br/><br/>In the director's approach to this dramatic material, he devised a labored pace to the film that included long pauses and meandering scenes with characters wandering around the palace. It was an incongruous aesthetic choice to have the slow pacing along with the acerbic wit of the characters. The result was an Oscar Wilde play conceived in slow motion.<br/><br/>In grading this film, it is worth no more than three stars, one for each of the three central characters: the fussy Queen Anne, the scheming Sarah, and Abigail the survivor. But overall, it doesn't add up to a cohesive whole, and, sadly, it is difficult to genuinely care about the three dynamic characters."

","After seeing films at least weekly for decades, my wife and I wandered into this one with the barest inkling--only half a review from a NYC daily which led me to think it was a historical film set in the reign of Queen Anne.
I was expecting something about the Stuart pretender and the Hanovers, The War of the Spanish Succession, Marlborough and his wife, the duchess of Marlborough, Mistress Masham, yes--they were there--at least the ladies--Whigs and Tories, barely--Swift , Pope, Addison and Steele--so much for the history. But the sets were lavish. I spent most of my time looking at the paintings on the walls as well as the sets and the furniture. The actors were alright--not that they had so very much on their mind, other than crude ambition and lust for power, not very much more subtle than in any soap opera.
What was new was the bald viciousness of men and women at every opportunity. It was like watching schoolboy bullies--male and female, acting out their crudest impulses at every opportunity,
I cannot believe that that language would have been tolerated if spoken by a man to a man in even in the bawdy Restoration and these years which followed it--if a man had used it on a man, he would have been whipped , or been skewered from gizzard to groin--let alone uttered by a subject to a monarch--and ladies to each other , as well as to men. More fakery.
Apparently, some of the public found the pelting of a fat, naked eunuch with oranges as hilarious as the players in the scene pretended it was.
There was only one thing which seemed to really interest this film maker: that was the sex between the duchess (who was, in reality, if not in this film, the wife of the most influential Englishman of his era) and the queen and the way in which her protegÃ©e took her place between the sovereign's bloated legs.
All this lesbian play--how historical was all this? Or is this another example of the displacement of a set of homoerotic male fantasies projected by a male author onto the screen in female guise?
One motif runs through it: Mud."

","With films like 'The Lobster' and 'Killing of a Sacred Deer', Yorgos Lanthimos has created another macarbe masterpeice that defies modern day story telling and delivers a film that more than holds its own against the directors cult hits. 'The Favourite', starring Olivia Colman plays Queen Anne, England's overbearing and tortured ruler who is at war with France. She is flanked by assistants, military strategists, politicians and her trusted advisor and secret lover Sarah, played by Rachel Weisz. The Queen has little interest in governing her country, she prefers to engage in eccentric activities like racing ducks and playing with her 17 rabbits, each representing a child which has died at childbirth. Not only is she waging an expensive war with another country, but battles with a mryiad of diseases including gout have her writhing on the floor in pain like a wounded animal. Sarah tends to the Queen's every need, her confidante's tollerance to the volitale and childlike ruler never seeming to disrupt their taboo love affair that remains the pairs sole selfish focus in a time of international uncertainty and turmoil. The relationship between the two is disturbed when Sarah's young poor deprived cousin Abigail, Emma Stone, arrives at the palace seeking employment, she has had a rough, working class upbringing and now visions herself rising out of her slumber and into the world of aristocracy. If Sarah isnt aware of this, the Queen most certainly is as Abigail works her way into her majestys inner cirlce of indulgance and lust, putting Sarah on the outs. As Abigails cunning dirty plan comes to fruition, Anne's gluttenous lifestyle spirals out of control and Sarah finds herself out of the running for the Queen's unnerving affection. Lanthimos has directed an instant classic, inviting the viewer into the inner sanctums of an unconventional royal existence laid bare by the thrilling contest between two servants whose purpose for contol differ greatly. Each female character weilds power at one point during the film, but the great allurement about 'The Favourite' is that we get to see their vunrebility and inevietable sorrow."

A good dramedy has a good mix of comedy and drama. There was a lack of flow for the plot and drama, one could get the basic gist but so much was not explained or left out it felt disjointed and all over the place.

Both Anne and Sarah outlived all their children and in Anne's case must have affected her already poor health. However making fun of this seems a rathe dismal approach compounded by some ridiculous scenes - the dancing for example - which were not funny, just puerile.

","From the director of The Lobster & The Killing of a Sacred Deer comes yet another idiosyncratic feature, this time a period comedy set in 18th century England. The Favourite may be more accessible than Yorgos Lanthimos' previous efforts but the film certainly isn't devoid of the absurd, whacky elements that define his works.<br/><br/>The story takes place in 18th century England and focuses on the power struggle that erupts between a frail queen who occupies the throne, her close friend who governs the country in her stead & a new servant with an agenda of her own who steps between the two after she senses an opportunity to realise her ambitions.<br/><br/>Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the first act is an absolute riot that finds the Greek filmmaker doing what he does best with a series of quirky moments that help set up the stage while introducing the relevant characters whose arcs only get more complex as plot progresses. The story is straightforward but the execution leads to one wicked ride.<br/><br/>The skilfully executed technical aspects provide excellent assistance, starting with the sumptuous production & costume design that brings the period setting to life in splendid detail. The exquisite use of fisheye lens, smooth camera manoeuvring & low-light photography provide its frames a bizarre but lifelike quality that's all the more uplifted by its eclectic score.<br/><br/>But it's the female trio that power this film. Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz & Emma Stone lead the show with outstanding inputs and their chemistry with each other only intensifies with time. All three of them get to have their shining moment and make the most of their screen space. But Nicholas Hoult also deserves a mention, for his supporting act doesn't go unnoticed in a film steered by terrific actresses.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Favourite is a tale of power, passion & politics bolstered by first-rate performances from its leading ladies, and marks another fascinating entry in Yorgos Lanthimos' steadily rising career. The third act doesn't really hold as strong as the first two but there is no denying that it's a well crafted & smartly executed work from a filmmaker in prime form. Worth a shot for the powerhouse performances it has in store. And the power dynamics at play. And that duck race!"

Wide-angle lenses are used in many shots to show the entirety of a room, displaying our subject small in the frame as if trapped inside something bigger than themselves. The fish-eye lens also gives the audience the view of peeking into this world we don't belong to see all that it has to offer, from its glamour to its garbage. But where this film truly shines are the performances by the three female leads: Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, & Rachel Weisz.

I have a hard time with stories that do not make me suspend disbelief.
It does not take away from the director's competence, but I doubt, after seeing The Favourite that I will ever see another of Lanthimos' projects.
The ending of this film could have tied up this story emotionally: this is the reward of unscrupulous ambition. But, I kept wondering, Is this it?

","To tell this kind of story...<br/><br/>why make it about Queen Anne., Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough, and Abigail? These are real people whose lives can be researched.
Queen Anne loved her husband and had many children by him. Sarah was PASSIONATELY in love with her husband, the Duke, Winston Churchill's ancestor and one of the greatest military strategists and leaders of all time. Sarah was NOT bisexual or gay. Abigail Masham, not sure, but very doubtful she had an affair with the Queen.<br/><br/>If you want to see a more accurate portrayal of the Sarah-Anne relationship, get The First Churchills, a TV series from the BBC, from your library's interlibrary loan or Amazon or wherever. I think the release date was 1971.<br/><br/>The movie has many other inaccuracies: Anne was a few years YOUNGER than Sarah, in this film she is quite a bit older. Sarah had light hair, they couldn't even bother to put the correct wig color on the actress Rachel Weisz. The men are not portrayed realistically at all. It's fine to take a few liberties with history, but The Favourite goes way beyond this. If it were being played strictly for comedy, that would excuse this, but it is not. It is too dark for that. The Blackadder series was better, that played British history entirely for laughs and therefore no accuracy at all was expected.<br/><br/>Also, I agree with reviewers who thought the language and swearing were too geared toward 2018 moviegoers. Why not just do a film about a Lesbian triangle and woman power then, why revise history yet again to this extent?"

","I always hate Rachel Weisz in films. She always picks roles where she plays an unempathetic sociopath where she desires success at the expense of other characters (see The Shape of Things for the quintessential example of this). However in this film, Emma Stone plays her foil, who assumes her role better than she can, and in doing so, becomes the antagonist. This rather clever turnabout makes The Favorite an enticing watch until the end in which she is given no respite, despite her cleverness and her seemingly unbreakable accord with the queen. This makes the film seem rather one-sided and a bit hard to believe, despite Stone's clever rise to glory. The erotic lesbian scenes help pique the viewers interest in an increasingly disappointing war of political enemies, but it is not sufficient to save the film. The overall concept is brilliant, but the execution hints at a twist that never comes. The end is possible, but improbable, disappointing, and feels lazy."

As the movie gets closer to its conclusion the story doesn't hold up, and when it ends we are left wondering, ""What is the symbolism of all the rabbits running around the Queen's bedroom?""<br/><br/>The movie also uses some interesting, but sometimes annoying background music.

Certainly when I went through school plenty of time was spent looking at Elizabeth 1st and Queen Victoria, but Anne was barely mentioned. As such was looking forward to finding more about Anne from the Favourite as this focuses on the reign of Anne.<br/><br/>In particular the Favourite looks at the complex and evolving relationship between Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), Sarah(Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone). Whilst this is very well played by all the actors you can't help but wonder how true to life it is. Something tells me this has been given a 21st century slant to make it more interesting for our current culture. Having said that you do get to know more about Queen Anne and it's well worth seeing the performances of the trio of actors."

Finally a star for three solid performances by the principles.<br/><br/>The Favourite often played like a live action cartoon with oddly placed physical comedy in dim or dark backgrounds.(Ex. the dance sequence or Harley shoving Abigail off a garden wall on a nighttime stroll) Or tight nearly motionless shots filling the frame like the final sequences of the film.<br/><br/>It was very flat, dark and superficial but not in the good noir way I think intended. That one dimensional quality pervaded the character's treatment as well. I really couldn't figure what POV or context the director wanted me to have. Was this a comedy, satire, historical drama, tragedy or what?<br/><br/>Certainly drama wasn't the target for there was too little depth afforded the character's to elicit empathy. The most human was the queen and she was treated the most cruel by the other characters and the production. Who cares if a lonely sick monarch of 300 years past may or may not have been gay or if she used those same manipulative and deceitful subjects around her to warm her bed.<br/><br/>So comedy must have been the default but it was cruelly handled in so many ways. Right through to the ending. I sadly found it a mean spirited sleezefest. There's enough of that everyday in the news and TV. I couldn't get home to shower fast enough."

It sounded as though someone was trying to learn to play the violin. The pace was too slow and the right atmosphere was not created in order for the audience to respond to the witticisms and visual comedy. Here was the opportunity to play one favourite off against the other. At one time one of them could have been winning and the situation could have changed quickly to put the other in front, but it did not work. What should have been funny lacked timing and the pathos was lost by the unsympathetic characters. Did we have to suffer the explicit sexual scenes? Then there was the ending, if it could be called that. Left high and dry as the main characters pondered their past and future, but in a situation that was a big turn off. A bit like the whole film."
"NBates1","5","1","4","17 January 2019"," Weird film that had potential
","Well, I do not really know where to start. First of all, the performances of the three leads and their interactions are fantastic. They really are the best thing about this movie. Between them, though, Olivia Colman definitely shined brightest. That however, does not mean that any of these characters were even remotely likable, or had any redeeming qualities. Queen Anne, while she delivered some memorable funny lines, was completely out of her mind. The Weisz character was very unpleasant, domineering and condescending, while the Stone character was nothing less than a snake; cunning, manipulative, and quite evil.
The rest of the film was a bit baffling. There is always an attempt for a story arc that never really comes through. Is it the sad life of a troubled and childish queen? No. Is it about the deep and complex relationship between two people who care about each other (Colman and Weisz)? No. Is it about an impoverished young woman who wants to finally amount to something and gain back her rights as someone of good family? Again, no. The story attempts to mix all of these elements, and the result is a weird, somewhat incoherent and eventually boring mess. The ending was unbelievably underwhelming. The very strong language was strange and out of place in this setting.
The fish-eye camera was completely unnecessary, and pretentious if I might add, while the film also looked very dark. The costumes and production design were great, as were the hair and makeup. The music was really annoying and awkwardly placed.
While the Queen did have some humorous moments and lines, this is certainly NOT a comedy.
All in all, with a definite story arc, this film could have had potential, but ultimately a somewhat incapable director turned the concept into a mess."

Maybe, but the acts of comedy, pathos, ingenuity were there are points, but not enough. I do not think that was all the fault of the director entirely, the script had much to do with it, as did other things.<br/><br/>The man characters were fascinating, and watching another 'tables turn ambition film featuring women' was quite nice, especially with Stone and Weisz at the helm of the 18th Century's take on it, and Colman putting forth a great performance in it all as the (bipolar?) Queen Anne. That wasn't so bad, just not<br/><br/>What bothered me is that I kept thinking from time to time while watching, ""What if ... Ken Russell did this film'?""

Acting was good all-around, especially Rachel Weisz as the Lady-in-Waiting to Queen Anne.<br/><br/>But what was needed was a timeline and a sense of location.

","I like lots of movie genres and I try to remain positive about my thoughts on them, mainly because the people reviewing here seem to have a love or hate relationship with the whole thing. And often reviewers are polar opposites of what the consumer thinks. Some even go so far as to say that the extreme split indicates a masterpiece or a bomb and they are on the masterpiece side. Not hardly. It's pretty middle of the road with a couple of highlights and a lot of low lights.<br/><br/>I think Olivia Colman does a wonderful job. Best actress Oscar? Not really. Rachael Weiss did a pretty decent job. Emma Stone, who I love, was only adequate. The plot was plodding, difficult to understand what they were saying, and too long. We didn't really learn anything about Lady Marlborough or Queen Anne, other than alleged homosexual desires which is not based in fact. One reviewer pointed out that it's really a remake of 'The Three Faces of Eve"" but not as good.<br/><br/>The score for the music, as many have commented, is terrible. It's worse than that. It's so disjointed that I found myself examining how silly the scene actually would be without the music, something a good movie score composer would never let happen. The music supports what's on the screen. Not in this case. It this case, I think, it's supposed to bring out a heightened sense of drama and suspense. In this respect it fails miserably. It's the worst part of the movie.
Also the funky camera shots, especially the fish eye lens shots look amateurish and are unnecessary.
If you read the trivia section on this i tkhink you'll see part of the problem: no budget with which to make it. The costumes were recycled throughout the shoot which is about a shoestring budget as you can believe. How can you make a ""masterpiece"" with no financial support? You can't, is the answer. I""m the only person on earth who hasn't seen ""A Star is Born"" but I'm guessing Lady Gaga did a better job as best actress.<br/><br/>I waited until it for hit Redbox and I'm glad I did. I would have hated paying full price for it.<br/><br/>So. If you're bored and feel compelled to spend money, then this is for you. Otherwise stay away. Watch at home, but only if the overall themes of the picture of jealously, hate, deviousness and conspiracy have no meaning to you and you're willing to watch and believe then, then do so by all means"

","From a production quality standpoint, this is a great movie. From an enjoyability standpoint, I hated it. The problem with setting out to make a movie that bores and annoys the audience is that you might succeed. I can only compare it to The Man With No Face in that regard -- great movie if you can stand being bored to tears and slightly nauseated. I found the interpretation of the period to be extremely plausible and well-done, despite exaggerations of foppishness and liberal attitudes. Some say this was comedic... nothing close to a chuckle ever stirred in me, though I will grant it seemed to be trying on some level. Putting so much power in the hands of three women was refreshing if unlikely. So great movie for film critics, terrible movie for almost any other purpose."
"lurpak","4","1","5","12 January 2019"," Hype over substance
","A disappointing film, I honestly cannot see what everybody's is banging on about.
Seemingly filmed on security cameras with wide angled lenses which distorted the vision, cut with on obtuse period of a single piano key alternating a beat with a rusty saw being played with a violin bow, this fastly became the most uncomfortable film I have ever had to endure. I noticed that I was physically furrowing my brow in subconscious distain for the filming. Which spent too long in the beginning jumping around between the characters for you to comfortably establish any sense of direction.
Nothing original in the script, typical follies of the period, a little jealousy and skullduggery between rising factions of the established order and the new. The film seemed to make its entire story based on those simple concepts that are usually an overplayed stereotype in all royal household films...pick any, it's there...how this became such a phenomena eludes me entirely. Olivia Coleman, whome I love, was wonderful, but her character which was a version of blackadders queen Elizabeth but with a weaker temperament and vulnerability.
It seems that when we brits make a period drama, which is nothing more than a film for tv, some forces come into play which destine all concerned for globes, oscars and awards that are totally undeserved. It just proves the sewn up, hypocrisy and old boy network that these awards really are.. they need scraping and replacing with genuine, unprogramed awards for invocation, creativity and delivery...not yet another rehash of a period drama, or holocuast cliche that seem to be guaranteed award candidates by the mere fact of making them."
"shadden66","4","1","5","12 January 2019"," Pretentious
","Yes, that's the word that comes to mind if I could review this movie with one work only: pretentious<br/><br/>From script, to the acting, to directing and - most of all - the editing.<br/><br/>Not all the acting was bad. Olivia Coleman was very good. Not just her line delivery but her body motion for that subtle edge it gave her role. I cant say the same about Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone. I like both these actresses but they were so stale and boring in their roles. Tiresome to watch at times.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with this film was the editing. This movie got chopped to pieces imo to make the delivery of their lines to look clever and quick witted. Dizzying to watch it moved around so quickly - that is NOT a sign of good acting but POOR editing. This film could have been much better with longer scenes to really let the punch of those lines sink it - IE look at that last scene with Queen Anne and Abigail: Only a few lines but the power they had when standing (and kneeling) there saying nothing.<br/><br/>If only the entire movie was like that one last scene.."
"meechamp","3","1","5","11 January 2019"," Upon the whole, pretty bad
","Solid acting by the three leads and sumptuous sets; these don't come cheap yet the screenplay was diabolical and, along with chaotic directing, mucked up what might have been a watchable film.
Period pieces have to convey the atmosphere of the times and in huge measure this hangs upon the use of language. Saying ""OK"" and ""paranoid"" doesn't exactly chime with a 17th century setting now does it? Only missing was ""cool"".
I don't believe the screenwriters were deliberately trying to be hip but they constantly lapsed into modern usages which blew the thing for me as I kept growling ""They'd never have said that!"" Then there was the constant use of crudities: ""F"" and ""C"" words - gratuitous use which perhaps was designed to bring relevance to a younger crowd, used to rap.
While some of the sound-track included decent 17th century music, there were episodes of monotonous repetition which really jarred the senses.
It was hard to follow the plot which was luckily pretty simple - and I hated the use of the fish-eye lens, especially in the corridor shots - what purpose did their distortion serve? I can take it straight, dude!
Despite the sound though uninspired acting none of the three characters was likable or, frankly, even interesting - it would indeed be hard to be interesting given such lines to say - or such direction.
And then there's the fact that this is stated to be a comedy - well, perhaps I have no sense of humour left but I saw almost none - very little wit even. Except one rejoinder which went something like""<br/><br/>""Will this be rape or seduction?""
""I'm proposing marriage ..""
""Rape, then.""<br/><br/>As I said, the sets were sumptuous - I'll give it three stars but hope not to see it again."

The screenplayers fill in the gaps in historical records with only the worst humanity can possibly offer. There are no noble feelings, no significant wish to transcend filth and corruption, which is very historically inaccurate.

","The Favourite tell the story of the later years of Queen Anne, a monarch not often shown on the big screen, and the character shines with the brilliant performance of Olivia Colman.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is very good, as we see the back and forth between Emma Stone's Abigail and Rachel Weisz's Lady Sarah. The rivalry between these two was very well done, and it played for some great comedic scenes. However after this passes, the movie slows down even more, and becomes boring. As nothing really happens afterwards, other than a few political scenes.<br/><br/>This is the type of movie a selected number of people will love and respect. It has good writing and is acted brilliantly. However it is very, very slow. The entire film takes place in the Queen's Palace, and we are treated with very well done production and costume designs, but we revisit the same rooms and halls, and it gets bland. Also this film is categorised as a comedy, and it tries so very hard to be one, some of the comedy works, others doesn't. A movie like this should have been a straight up drama, considering the topic, and the performance by Olivia, which is one of the best of the year. But it plays for laughs way too much, and feels goofy and over the top at times.<br/><br/>Other than the great production and costumes, the movie also has a very unique cinematography style, something I haven't seen in a film before, it uses strange angles and zooms, and relays a lot on long takes, which is always a plus. Most of the other background characters are wasted, but do provide some comedic scenes.<br/><br/>The Favourite is a very well made movie, just a boring one.

","The trailer for The Favourite is misleading, stringing together all the fun bits to create the impression of a light-hearted drawing-room comedy, whereas the film itself was something else. Not that it wasn't good, mind you; aside from its obscure overlong ending, it was ok.<br/><br/>In the early 1700s, Abigail (Emma Stone), a young former aristocrat whose station in life has fallen, applies for work in the court of Queen Anne. She begins in the scullery, but soon becomes a lady-in-waiting to the powerful Lady Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough (Rachel Weisz). The domineering Sarah, Queen Anne's lover & trusted advisor, more often than not sits in for the ailing Anne & in effect rules in her stead. Meanwhile, Abigail, endears herself to Anne by soothing her gouty leg with a rustic herbal remedy apparently unknown at court.<br/><br/>By the time Sarah - belatedly recognizing a potential rival - dismisses Abigail, the queen is sufficiently beguiled to add Abigail to her own retinue. Abigail soon contrives to supplant Sarah as the queen's favorite. When Sarah haughtily insists that the queen dismiss Abigail, Anne answers ""I don't want to. I like it when she puts her tongue inside me.""<br/><br/>What makes this film worth watching at all is the outstanding performance of Olivia Colman as Queen Anne. Ailing, cranky, vulnerable, imperious, cosseted, frivolous & browbeaten, Anne is a goodhearted queen with the very best of intentions, but far too muddleheaded to fathom affairs of state. When - after gifting her beloved Sarah with a palace - she is told ""This is a monstrous extravagance . . . we are at war,"" Anne replies ""We've won."" When told that the war is not yet over, she is taken quite aback. ""Oh! I did not know that.""<br/><br/>What Favourite lacks, it seems to me, is an ending - tho not for lack of trying. The telling moment when Abigail, now well ensconced as the queen's spoiled favorite, casually squashes one of Anne's beloved rabbits with her foot - not fatally, just meanly enough to demonstrate her sense of power & her potential cruelty - could have been the ending. We're shown how quickly the underdog we originally rooted for, once risen to power, becomes the new oppressor. Stop there.<br/><br/>But no, the rabbit's cries wake the by now partially paralyzed queen, who, horrified, tries to rise from her bed, falls & then struggles to her feet as Abigail rushes to her. ""Rub my leg"" Anne commands coldly & Abigail reluctantly kneels to obey. When she suggests that Anne should lie down, she is told ""You shall speak when asked to."" Claiming to feel dizzy & needing to ""hold onto something,"" she grabs Abigail's hair & presses down on her head while the kneeling Abigail struggles to support Anne's weight while still rubbing her gouty leg. Her distress, both physical & mental, is clear on her face, as is the slow realization that she is no more than a helpless rabbit herself. That too would have been a good place to stop.<br/><br/>To belabor the point tho, we watch the two women sway together in this position, their faces now superimposed on one another for an interminable two minutes until finally the rabbits are gradually superimposed on both of them till they're blotted out. So what's that all about then? We're all just helpless rabbits? Is that some kind of revelation? Shoulda quit while they were ahead."
"kateprice","2","1","7","13 January 2019"," Burlesque at best
","The play QUEEN ANNE* enjoyed a successful 4 week run on the London fringe during July and August 2014. It coincided with the 300th anniversary of the death of Queen Anne. She died on 1st August 1714. Since then, various organisations have jumped on the Queen Anne bandwagon including the makers of the film THE FAVOURITE.
I saw THE FAVOURITE a couple of nights ago. Much of the acting was excellent. The settings and costume were splendid and elegant. One recognised Hampton Court. The dialogue was, at times, witty.
It is normal in historical movies and plays to focus on one or two aspects of the real history and ignore the rest. This is spectacularly the case in THE FAVOURITE. No-one really knows whether Queen Anne and Sarah Churchill and Mrs Masham were bi-sexual. In a way, this is unimportant. Anne was very lonely especially after the death of her much loved husband George of Denmark. She was vulnerable. Male friendships were tricky for a queen; hence female friendships were more intense.
The sadness is that the success of Anne's reign has been passed over. She transformed herself from a person with an under confident dependency on the wily but beautiful Sarah Churchill to a queen, worthy of being the final incumbent of the house of Stuart. She saved England from yet another civil war by helping to guarantee the Protestant succession in the persona of George I of Hanover. While he may not have been the most charismatic of kings, he was a far better choice than the ""Old Pretender - James Stuart -father of the more famous Bonnie Prince Charlie of later years. If he had succeeded Anne, civil war would have followed. The English Civil war finished in 1660 a mere 5 years before Anne's birth, so it was still much in everyone's minds. People were still talking about it and suffering the damage done in its aftermath to society and family and economy.
In comparison with this giant omission, fictitious fabrications such as Anne's keeping of seventeen rabbits to represent her seventeen dead children or the attempted poisoning/ murder of Sarah Churchill by Mrs Masham are mere banalities. But it leaves one saddened; saddened that the character of a courageous woman should be so travestied: she cannot fight back. She is dead. People knew little about her before THE FAVOURITE was aired. I am not sure that they have been appropriately enlightened.

","Yesterday I had the chance to watch the extraordinary movie ""The Favourite"" and I wish to share my feelings related to it.
Firstly, I have no idea why this movie was even nominated for ""Best Picture"" - after spending so much money in the theater I was expecting to see something creative and interesting with my friends, but I just fell asleep after 20 minutes. ""The Favourite"" is just boring - boring plot, predictable characters, annoying score. The soundtrack of this movie was supposed to be stylish and touching but I can compare it to a loud noise which gave me only frustration.
7.7,7,8/10 - I just can't believe you gave this high score to a such tasteless movie. It was a weird experience - the constant repetitions of the word ""c***"" and the puking scenes were extremely unpleasant. There was just no development and the end of the film can be described as ridiculous.
I still have to say some good words about this movie, because I saw something positive in it. Emma Stone is once again great during these 2 hours and she is in a league of her own - Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz are not on her level, although it seemed they tried hard. The huge surprise from me was Nicholas Hoult whose supporting role is on a really high level - I see in his face a new Hugh Grant (17 years after ""About a boy"") and expect to see him in more movies in the future.
""The Favourite"" has too many sins and I can surely say it didn't deserve so many Oscar nominations. I would probably give an Oscar to Emma Stone, but the other nominations are ridiculous."

There were important historical facts that the movie could at least include to convey a message to the viewers , after all it was about real people, yet all the time we were seeing the Queen's sexual affairs and how they were playing games with each other. The annoying continous sounds were there only to irritate the viewer, as the chapters that had no meaning,just a bad imitation of Tarantino's style.

","Enjoyable bawdy comedy that unfortunately loses a bit of steam towards the end, but still contains a trio of terrific performances.<br/><br/>Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) sits on the English throne, beset by depression and confusion she allows her confident and childhood friend Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) to speak for her and guide an increasingly disgruntled parliament through a war with the French. Sarah fallen cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) joins her household initially as a maid, but soon begins to climb the social standing within the court. Abigail's social climbing eventually puts her at odds with Sarah for the affections of The Queen and it soon becomes apparent that one of them has to go.<br/><br/>I liked a lot of the style choices that director Yorgos Lanthimos makes here. The film has a very naturalistic look and often uses a wide-angle, or even a fisheye lens in the exterior scenes. Humour wise, it's pretty consistently funny, though often relying on swearwords and vomiting to get that across. Performance wise it's excellent. Colman is the standout, and it's pretty amazing to see her ascent from UK sitcom roles all the way up to Oscar nominations, via things like ""Broadchurch"" and ""The Night Manager"". Weisz and Stone aren't that far behind, definitely worthy of their nominations. Nicholas Hoult too is great as Harley, the leader of the Tory opposition in Parliament, he pouts, kicks and moans his way through another fabulous comic performance. Mark Gatiss, always great, surely can provide his own costumes now, the number of times he's played in period roles recently.<br/><br/>Where ""The Favourite"" wasn't quite as successful for me was the storyline, particularly towards the end. Without trying to give away any spoilers, I was hoping that there would be one more comeback for the lady who is forced to leave court, not particularly because I favoured her, just because she seems to resign to her fate too easily, but as it stands it ends as a bit of an anti-climax.<br/><br/>Preferable to ""Mary Queen Of Scots"" for me but not one I'll feel the need to revisit very often."

","The Favourite is a period farce, exploiting the ills of a weak British monarch, Queen Anne, and the ambitions of two court ladies who are vying for power and money, using sex as a weapon.
So what is new? The ancient Greeks knew all about ambition or the scheming female mind. Shakespeare borrowed material avidly. Both the Greeks and the Great Bard knew their way around the human heart and navigated expertly past the Scylla and Charybdis of every passion imaginable, examining what is lowly and petty, but also what is noble and lofty. The old Masters were no fools; they knew the exact extent of the depthless pit to which humanity can stoop, from Medea to Lady Macbeth.
What is new is that the old Masters did not sweep everything under the carpet - even if that is a royal one. They did not equate all actions under the guise of mirth. They did not hide the vacuousness of ambition behind a royal costume, did not curtsy when faced with a cute line or a pair of blue eyes, did not hesitate when the time came to place a value on human action. They took their audiences to human hell, again and again. But they brought them back, too! The audience knew a fallen hero, but they also knew a hero who rose again in all the glory of redemption. There was a clear delineation between noble and low, divine and beastly, light and darkness.
The Favourite makes no such distinctions. Everything goes. In the labyrinth of the palace corridors, viewed through the distorted, elliptical lens of Lanthimos, who admittedly knows his stuff, the audience becomes witness to a dirty game of sex and power. And if we are left starving for a little moment of kindness and simplicity and pity, mainly for ourselves, a moment that might redeem humanity, Lanthimos will not relent. A persistent sound, reminiscent of that other vacuous film, Irreversible, which was built around the brutal sodomy of Monica Bellucci, reverberates persistently through the palace corridors and through our mind, sodomising again and again our need for a little hope for our human selves. The cacophony shreds to pieces any notion of redemption, as an ugly, fat, ailing, lost Queen Anne - chapeau to the performance by Olivia Colman - stumbles through the artfully ornate chambers of the palace, screaming: Where am I?
I will tell you where you are, your Highness. You are in the land of the postmodern artefact. The land where, as Jameson, the Marxist critic would say, a random cannibalisation of old styles is carried out with dexterity, a land where the Grand Masters and the old hierarchy of what is ariston and what isn't, are meticulously muddled up, dressed in pomp and duck races and a little seemingly innocuous fun, as men and women cannibalise each other senselessly. But the fun is not innocuous and the parody is but a pastiche, that fails to condemn that which it parodies and does not provide any alternatives for that which it supposedly cauterizes. Because it does not cauterize and therefore does not heal. The wound remains open, much like the wounds on the legs of the Queen, much like the pain for her seventeen dead babies or her need for a friend. And much like our need for the artist, to come along and clear up the mist of any doubt and present us with the perfect diamond of our humanity. We are more than that, more than a quick hand job in the dark, more than a desperate pleasuring with the tongue in return for a title of nobility or a handful of golden sovereigns. Much, much more than that. Art has an obligation to itself to go past the Scylla and the Charybdis, wave to the sirens from afar and then reach the rightful place of its destination.
That is the real palace, the real hegemony."

","Like many great historical films, after watching The Favourite I am driven to discover more about a topic I knew little about. As I was with First Man. However the whole movie for me was ruined by the cinematography.
Far too many scenes look like the were shot on a super wide angle Gopro. Resulting in footage that look like it had been shot through a cheap fisheye lens. Totally distracting and rather than being immersed in the film I had to keep thinking 'why is this shot is so badly filmed'"

","I have seen many many films that have been dismissed by the masses and found them to be rather entertaining and enjoyable. This film however is the complete other end of the spectrum. After reading the reviews given by ""professionals"" I was in great spirits going to the screening. With the other 10 people in this screening we were left extremely underwhelmed having chuckled at a few witty statements in the film and finding the rest of the film absurd or worse. The trailers show the best bits of the film and the rest is absolute swill. Please avoid this if you wish to maintain your sanity and money."

","The Favourite has been a favourite amongst the critics but the disparity between the masses and critics is pretty telling (one person on google pretty much admitted to being closed minded and simple by saying they shouldn't force arty stuff on the masses). They were disappointed at not getting exactly what they wanted, but anyone with any knowledge of the films of Yorgos Lanthimos will expect absurdist humour rather.<br/><br/>Like The Lobster that is exactly what we get, even though The Favourite is slightly more accessible than the strange parable that was Lanthimos's first English language film. The Favourite is dominated by the three leading ladies who all give powerhouse performances with Olivia Colman tipped for award success. It's a film powered by three women, one of whom is a pawn in a psychological battle between two strong women. It makes for enthralling viewing to watch three great performances battle for supremacy on screen as two of them fight for the third's favour, using whatever dastardly means springs to their deadly and deranged minds.<br/><br/>As enthralling as their battle is, the longer it goes on the more depressing it becomes as we watch two women essentially exploit a weak, frail and childlike Anne playing her as a mere pawn in their own psychological game. One begins to feel sympathy for way the Anne is exploited more than gripped by the psychological battle between Abigail (Emma Stone) and Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz). Colman really is perfect in the role, that's high on melodrama, giving it an erratic vulnerability that highlights her character's childlike and temperamental personality.<br/><br/>Yet it still feels that the film eventually peters out. Much of the film's setting and costume design does brilliantly evoke the classic period dramas but the frequent use of the word c*** is an oddly jarring experience as it's not one that's common in stuffy costume dramas (but of course The Favourite isn't your typical costume drama). At first, it feels rebellious and daring but when it begins to get tiresome and repetitive, losing all its sting, you just sit there thinking ""Come on Yorgos...grow up"". This also relates to a lot of film's raunchy humour which feels oddly awkward and shoe horned into a film that didn't need it (on the other hand the absurdist humour is more rewarding comedically).<br/><br/>Where Yorgos Lanthimos excels is in the beauty of the film (with exception is the ghastly soundtrack). The longshots, extravagant costume and set design and the use of natural lighting is greatly reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's classic Barry Lyndon (which is also set during the 18th century). The film is good, but doesn't win my favour."

","I saw ""The Favourite"", Olivia Colman-The Lobster, Hot Fuzz; Rachel Weisz-The Lobster, About a Boy; Nicholas Hoult-X_Men:Apocalypse, About a Boy and Emma Stone-La La Land, The Amazing Spider_Man 2.
This is a period piece-specifically, 18Th century England-that is loosely based on actual events. Olivia plays Queen Anne, a rather sickly queen that has let her long time friend Lady Sarah run every day queenly type events. Rachel plays Lady Sarah. Winston Churchill is a descendant of Lady Sarah. Olivia has gout-among other problems-and has to use crutches or a wheel chair to get around at times. Olivia and Rachel have more than just a friendly relationship going on. When Emma-Rachel's cousin-comes to town, looking for a job, things get real cat fighty like when Olivia takes a liking to Emma. Rachel is very jealous-wanting to keep Olivia to herself-and the games begin, each one trying to fend for Olivia's good will. Nicholas plays a politician pushing for his own agendas from Olivia. The movie is comical but it's not a comedy, like it is being advertised as. I would have liked it more except for the ending-it was just a little weird.
It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-maybe with a better ending-but it would be alright, as a rental."

","All 3 actresses are spectacular in their roles and the story is almost interesting enough ... a love/power triangle between 3 women. But in the end I was left feeling like I only got an inch of dessert instead of a whole slice. The film never made me laugh. Sorry ... naked man having fruit at him might make a pubescent boy laugh? And Stone jerking of her newly betrothed while telling the camera her plan? Just. Not. Funny. It's jolly good fun to poke fun at upright royalty. There are way better films than this one that do that."

","But story is boring.<br/><br/>I couldn't get involved with any character or the plot. A bit overdone in costuming throughout made it close to laughable.<br/><br/>If you are a 'royals' follower/history buff this movie may have greater meaning for you.<br/><br/>It's too long and the story is not an attention grabber."
