"NightBiker","10","162","195","15 November 2008"," A VERY fun movie for old and young alike
","Its an animated movie about a dog. GIVEN, its a 'kids' movie. Unlike many animated movies, the dialog isn't full of innuendos or 'hidden' humor that only adults would 'get'. Its easily understood by kids, the animation is top-rate (as would be expected) and the characters are engaging and easy to enjoy. I admit that even though I love animation, I went to this sneak preview with a few misgivings. The trailers didn't look all that exciting, and I didn't expect to see anything I hadn't already seen. On one hand, I was right. The animation WAS very good, but nothing that hadn't been done before. But on the other hand I was pleasantly wrong. The formula works perfectly for Bolt. It was fun, didn't have any 'dull' spots, and while my theater was filled with a fairly consistent mix of children and young teens, and a relative smattering of adults, everyone seemed to enjoy it. Laughter was pretty consistent among the old and young, and at the end of the flick I heard something I rarely get to experience in theaters these days: applause. Granted, the adults were the ones applauding, and I joined in enthusiastically. The wife and I agree that this was one movie where we felt we got more than our dollars' worth. Thats a rare treat. Bolt did not disappoint on any level -and will find a spot in our library when the DVD eventually hits market. I fully expect this movie to do very well."

","Standing out in the crowd is not always the easiest thing to accomplish for an animated film, but above what you may expect, against WALL∙E's heart, and Kung Fu Panda's slapstick hilarity, Disney's Bolt jumps forward as simply the most fun. <br/><br/>What makes Bolt noteworthy as well as a success on its own terms is its ability to take an age-old message about being true to oneself and finding your inner hero, and mesh it with a unique storyline that ends up spawning what, at first glance at least, seems wholly unique. Coupled with the expectedly bright crisp animation and stellar voice work, makes Bolt better yet, and a sure contender for best animated film at this years Oscars. Bolt also reclaims the original song work of Disney past, conceived between its also star and teen sensation Miley Cirus and Jenny Lewis and both compilations are memorable and sweet. Bolt never dives for the heartstrings, but scores its emotional points through well developed characters and thoughtful situations. <br/><br/>Bolt opens with a very entertaining action sequence in which Bolt (voiced to surprising effect by John Travolta) and his master Penny (Miley Cirus) are chased by well equipped super villains which plays out in the vein of The Incredibles. The genetically altered canine can leap helicopters in a single bound, melt evil with laser eyes and destroy villains at a whim with his super-bark. It is soon revealed that the action speckled lives of Penny and Bolt is in fact a hit television show, which requires Bolt to be kept in the dark about the nature of his existence; in brief, he actually believes he has super powers. But after a cliff-hanger ending of an episode in which Penny is taken, prompts Bolt to escape, determined to reclaim his friend and master. Embarking for the first time into the real world he haphazardly enlist the help of a very reluctant cat (Susie Essman) and a fan-boy err...fan- hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton) and along the way learns, and earns, the true stripes of a hero and that of friendship. <br/><br/>If everything I mentioned above was not enough to make you see this film, I can also reveal that Bolt is an at times hilarious send-up of the movie industry and genre clichés. Propelled by the hilarious supporting voice work including Malcolm McDowell, Dietrich Bader and James Lipton the blend of comedy, drama, and flat out entertainment value is unmatched. Also worth an enthusiastic mention are the pigeons that show up throughout the course of Bolt's adventure. Not only (as with all) is the voicing perfect but the physical humour implored is gut-busting, with the feathery fools twitching their heads in a pigeon- esquire way during their meetings with Bolt to glorious results. <br/><br/>If you have a chance, you obviously should see this film in 3-D, however it is still well worth your money viewed in a traditional medium. Bolt is a reminder of why Disney was such an animation juggernaut and it is pleasant to see them recapturing some of their past glory. And just in case you want it mentioned bluntly, yes there are many jokes that older patrons will more then enjoy. It is always refreshing to see an old formula revamped so effectively and certainly always welcome to see a movie that can put a smile on faces of all ages. <br/><br/>8.5 / 10.0<br/><br/>View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
"radioactive_man21","9","163","205","9 November 2008"," Bolt brings back true Disney
","I have been anticipating the release of Bolt for several months. I had an opportunity to see a screening of it and it exceeded all my expectations. Bolt is a wonderful movie with a good story and heart, something that Pixar has done well but Disney has struggled with. I believe the addition of John Lasseter to Disney Animation has made a significant impact on the quality and continuity of this film. Yes, it is CGI. You may ask, ""Why is Disney doing CGI when Pixar already does?"" All the studios are doing CGI right now. I have been very impressed with Pixar's CGI detail, however the detail in Bolt is even better. Creating a dog with fur that gets dirty, wet, wind-blown and looks real is very impressive (at least it is to me). In addition to better detail, the color and light of this film is so true to life, you'll think it's the real thing.<br/><br/>I laughed, cried, and was on the edge of my seat. Disney has created some lovable characters who will definitely win the hearts of millions. Congrats to the entire Disney Animation studio, well done."
"Apemangalore","10","79","104","14 February 2009"," Easily my favorite Disney film, and perhaps my absolute favorite movie of all time
","The 2000s have not been very kind to Walt Disney Animation. While there has been the occasional Emperor's New Groove or Lilo and Stitch, the majority of their films from this decade have been rather mediocre (most notably 2005's Chicken Little, which - ironically - remains the studio's highest-grossing film of the 2000s). With that said, I initially had some doubts about Bolt, despite hearing that it would be Disney Animation's first film supervised by Pixar founder John Lasseter. The surprisingly positive reviews posted shortly before the film's release convinced me to buy a ticket. Thankfully, I was forced to eat my words; welcome back, Disney.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Bolt, a white German Shephered who has spent his entire life on the set of a TV show in which he portrays a ""superdog"". As a result, he believes that the events on film (and his super powers) are real. When he is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood soundstage to New York City, he embarks on a cross-country journey to reunite with his owner and co-star, Penny. Along the way, Bolt teams up with a jaded alley cat named Mittens and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino who also happens to be an extreme Bolt fanboy.<br/><br/>First of all, the effects in this movie are unbelievable. Everything in the movie looks so realistic and yet doesn't contradict with the animated cartoon-esquire characters. Also, while Bolt is obviously the star of the movie, the real comedy comes from his unlikely companions. In fact, my favorite character of the bunch is Mittens the cat, voiced excellently by Susie Essman. Very seldom do I hear/see a character and say ""I can't imagine anybody doing a better job playing him/her"", but Essman really brings a lot to this already memorable character. And though I found him to be pretty irritating at first, some of the best lines in the movie come from Rhino the hamster.<br/><br/>Lastly, in one of the opening scenes we see Bolt as he is in the TV Show to set the understanding of Bolt's world. Seriously, that was made of awesome. The scene was action packed and full of excitement. I would watch the show that Bolt is in. If I had to have a complaint, it would be that it takes some ideas from several other films (such as Homeward Bound, Toy Story, and The Truman Show). That said, it still manages to feel like its own film, and with grace.<br/><br/>With terrific animation, an incredibly heartwarming story, and some of the most endearing characters I've ever seen on film (animated or otherwise), Bolt has not only become my favorite Disney film (Pixar included), but perhaps my absolute favorite movie of all time. It feels strange saying that, especially considering that I didn't even expect to like the film, but I simply can't think of a movie that I've loved more. It's also one of the very few films that manages to bring me to tears every time that I watch it, and when a movie is able to affect me on that kind of level, it automatically becomes a winner."
"Gordon-11","Null","52","67","13 January 2009"," So delightfully entertaining!
","This film is about a dog that believes his friend is in grave danger. What he does not know is that he is the star of a reality TV show.<br/><br/>Who would have thought ""Bolt"" would be so thrilling and entertaining! The opening action sequence is rushed with adrenaline, it excites me even though it is an animation! The plot is intelligent, interesting and fun, the great thing is that it entertains without the need of any toilet or gross out humour. The super-bark and laser eye scenes are so hilarious, in a cute and mesmerising way. In addition, the transition of Bolt from being a super dog to realising he he has no powers is very well presented, that it makes me feel sad for Bolt. The animation is flawless, and all the characters in the animation are super cute. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of ""Bolt"", I think it makes perfect family entertainment."
"g-bodyl","10","44","59","30 March 2009"," Truly A Disney Film!
","I can't remember any film produced by Disney that I ever disliked. Every movie they made, whether it's Pixar or not, is a great movie to watch. Bolt is no exception. In fact, this brings Disney to another level.<br/><br/>This film is about the bonds of friendship between Bolt, a ""superdog"" and Penny, a young actress. Bolt thinks he has super powers but he he obviously does not. He realizes that when he takes a cross-country trek with a mangy cat and a weird hamster to save his human companion.<br/><br/>I guess you could say the voiceovers are great. John Travolta and Miley Cyrus certainly did a good job.<br/><br/>I liked the music in this film. I shouldn't be surprised because Travolta did star in Grease thirty years ago. The duet with Cyrus is a great song.<br/><br/>This movie deserved to win some bigtime awards. The only reason this did not happen because Wall-E overshadowed this film.<br/><br/>This is one of the best Disney animated films this decade. Actually, most of them are great animations. Anyway, I rate this film 10/10."

","I was really not expecting much, was looking to one of those generic ""newgen"" 3D animations but, oh, I was so wrong. I can easily say Bolt is pretty much at par with Wall-E, the 2 21th century animations that conquered my heart.<br/><br/>Few times I laughed, few times I had watery eyes, and it's impossible not to adore the characters and be at the edge of the seat as you follow the story. Also really loved the ""authentic"" finale with Penny and Bolt. <br/><br/>The Real D (my first ever 3D glasses movie too) was the cherry on the cake with the astonishing graphics."
"aes64","10","88","126","13 November 2008"," Extremely entertaining - especially in 3D
","We got the opportunity to see this in a sneak preview in 3D and were very entertained. Great plot, great animation and the 3D was amazing. Sometimes felt like Bolt's head was towering over the audience. Good thing he didn't drool!<br/><br/>All the characters were great. The pigeons were great comic relief. It's amazing the amount of detail the animators put in. Watching the way the pigeons moved their heads was entertaining in itself. Rhino and Mittens were also hilarious while having more depth as well. A lot of Rhino's great lines were in the preview but didn't exactly play out in the story the way they seemed like they were going to. Even with that, he was hilarious. Obviously the plot is predictable but it's a very fun story. We were laughing out loud throughout this movie. <br/><br/>Skip Bond and see Bolt."
"jonconnormustlive-46298","7","6","6","3 December 2018"," A fun action packed Disney adventure
","Bolt follows a canine actor known for playing a super hero on a TV show, he is supported from his owner and must find his way back to her, all while believing he truly has super powers.<br/><br/>Bolt is loads of fun! There are lots of creative action scenes, plenty of funny jokes, and even some emotional scenes.
Bolt has the makings of a Disney classic, but it does come up a little short of the usual Disney magic.<br/><br/>Firstly, the story lacks depth, the story basically tells itself in the first 30 minutes, then fuels the rest with action, comedy and drama.
Secondly Miley Cyrus proved to be an annoying choice for voicing one of the main characters, not only is she an ear-sore, but she struggles to express different emotions vocally, her voice feels fake and just detracts from the overall film.<br/><br/>Luckily there's still plenty good in Bolt, it's definitely a great choice for a family friendly action comedy!"
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","16","20","12 February 2009"," Lost Super-Puppy, Answers to the Name of Bolt. If Found, Please Contact The Incredibles...
","I've read that Bolt is the first computer animated feature to come from Disney Studios since Pixar's John Lasseter took control of it, and it's easy to see the Pixar presence in the movie. John Travolta and Miley Cyrus provide the celebrity voice talent for the movie, about a dog who stars in a superhero TV show but who is just as unaware that he's an actor as he is that he's a dog. <br/><br/>Remember at the end of A Bug's Life when they animated together some outtakes where shots from the movie were messed up because of various mishaps on set? I thought that was one of the most charming ideas in an already fun and entertaining movie, and in Bolt they have taken that and centered an entire movie around it. Bolt and Penny are a team battling the evil green-eyed man, who has kidnapped Penny's father and are attempting to extract information out of him. <br/><br/>Between shooting sessions, Bolt lives in a trailer, unaware that Penny is going home to her real life and that the world returns to normal when he's not around. He believes that he is exercising extraordinary restraint in not using his superpowers to teach a lesson to a couple of wise-cracking alley-cats who tease him through the roof vent of his trailer at night. <br/><br/>Through a series of unfortunate events initiated by an encounter with the cats, Bolt finds himself accidentally shipped in a box to the east coast, from where he must travel across America in the real world in his quest to become reunited with Penny.<br/><br/>In watching a movie about a cute superhero who suddenly finds himself in the real world and must gradually accept the heartbreaking news that there's nothing special about him, it's impossible not to think of Buzz Lightyear, who suffered through exactly the same situation in Toy Story almost 15 years ago, but even though this seems to point to a disappointing characterization weakness in the movie, it is the characters who are the most interesting.<br/><br/>There is nothing particularly fresh or interesting about Penny, who is really nothing more than a catalyst to drive Bolt's adventure, and even Bolt himself is giving us a predictable performance of a dog who thinks he has superpowers, but the characters that he meets along the way are the best things about the movie.<br/><br/>He encounters a hardened alley-cat in New York named Mittens who has been bullying pigeons into making regular food donations to her (a clear homage to the bullying grasshoppers in A Bug's Life). She and Bolt become tied together with a leash and he forces her to help him get to California. But it's the even smaller characters that are the most interesting and charming. The Italian-American pigeons that Bolt meets in New York, who just know that they know his face from somewhere but can't quite place it, are incredibly well-animated and cleverly voiced.<br/><br/>But my favorite is Rhino, a superfan of Bolt's TV show whom Bolt and Mittens meet in a trailer park on their way to the west coast. Rhino will be a popular favorite character from the movie. He's overcome with excitement at meeting his hero, and it provides a unique comedic situation when both he and Bolt think that Bolt has super-powers, while Mittens must pacify them in order to get what she wants. She has been dragged scratching and screaming into this situation, and her disbelief at her miserable luck provides a good portion of the movie's comedy.<br/><br/>The family content of the movie plays up the ongoing cats and dogs rivalry that I don't remember seeing this directly portrayed since the relatively disappointing 2001 film Cats & Dogs. In one of the movie's more amusing sequences, Mittens teaches how to beg, and he successfully gets one trailer park family after another to offer food to his puppy-dog begging skills. When Mittens tries it, she gets a frying pan flung at her. <br/><br/>The movie knows how to work the comedy of a computer animated feature, which is why it was nominated for a Best Animated Feature Oscar and is also why it's a lot of fun, but beneath the clever screen-writing and occasionally amazing animation, the standard-issue cartoon-messages of never abandoning a friend in need make the rest of the movie pretty un-spectacular.<br/><br/>Bolt deserves to be nominated as one of the best animated features of 2008, but it also deserves to come in behind Kung Fu Panda, the second best animated feature of the year, and WALL-E, which will win."
"Vartiainen","Null","5","5","5 June 2016"," Pixa- I mean Disney at its finest
","Lets face it, the early 00s were not kind on Disney. The Renaissance was over, their loyal target audience was in college and thus not interested, Pixar was doing the whole CGI thing way better than them and all in all they seemed to have lost their touch. Until this film. Oh sure, it's still very much like something Pixar would have done and a bit missing on that Disney magic, but it's still a very good film that allowed them to get back on their feet.<br/><br/>And when I say it's something Pixar would have done, I mean that in a good way. Kind of. The plot features a dog, raised to believe he has genuine superpowers, suddenly being separated from his loyal owner Penny and now having to make his way back across USA to reunite with her. All the while having to learn that the world does not in fact play by his rules. Sounds like a Pixar movie, doesn't it. But then again, Pixar is a great film studio so that's not exactly an insult.<br/><br/>And the story and the characters are very good in their own right. Bolt, the eponymous main character, is very gruff and no-nonsense, but also delightfully naïve about the realities of the world, while Mittens, his new cat sidekick/helper/kidnap victim is pretty much the exact opposite. And then there is Rhino, a hamster trapped in a plastic ball and also one of Bolt's biggest fans. Rhino is awesome.<br/><br/>And yeah, it's kind of silly that I keep complaining about the fact that it's so much a Pixar film. It does make it seem a bit artificial in a way, because you know that they're copying much of their good material. But it's a good film, when all is said and done. Do see it, if you have the chance, is what I'm saying."
"Mihnea_aka_Pitbull","10","37","55","23 December 2008"," The best animation of the year
","""Wall-E"" was superb, I love and admire it/him, but ""Bolt"" does beat it! While the above mentioned (excellent!) movie did have some slow, insipid and predictable moments, in the spaceship setting - well, ""Bolt"" is coherent, self-consequent and true to itself from beginning to end! <br/><br/>The script is based on a treasure of meanings: the world seen by the eye of a dog; the difference between fantasy and reality; the role of the audience in an entertainment project; and, first and foremost, the main idea: A DOG'S SUPER-POWER LAYS IN HIS FAITHFULNESS! Anyone who ever owned a dog knows how true (and sacred) a fact is this!<br/><br/>Further, the same script is really intelligent - well structured and built up, with a solid dramaturgy and a captivating narration, right from the beginning. The starting premise, as expressed professionally, is: <br/><br/><ul><li>WHAT IF a dog, loyal with his life to his master, plays next to her the part of a super-dog in an action TV series? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>BUT WHAT IF, for him to act well, the trick is to make him believe that everything is true, and his super-powers are real? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>...AND WHAT IF he gets lost by accident, and has to face the REAL WORLD (and his REAL SELF) to get back to his master? </li></ul><br/><br/>...And this is how starts this truly initiatic trip, from New York City back to Hollywood, for the engaging Bolt, his acolyte Mittens (the stray cat who begins by being his sarcastic hostage, only to become his main supporter), and Rhino the hamster, his devoted fan. While the script continues in the same compact and fast-paced spirit, the direction adds up to it by being more than just adequate: it's expressive, enriching, imaginative, creative, bright. And what an admirable humor, what an elegant satire, what a perceiving look all over the American society, from the East Coast to California...! <br/><br/>Of course, one should add that the graphics are superb, and the 3-D DOES WORK, friends and neighbors - it ceases at last to be just a cheap trick, and invests the story with style and perspective (not only at an optical level!) <br/><br/>One last word, and the most important: yes, I'm an old bastard, harshly dragged along thousands of movies - but, when Bolt chose to die next to Penny, I wept."
"davidhicks-1","10","9","11","15 February 2009"," Exceptional!
","I think the title of this review, in my opinion, sums up Bolt in one word. The adorable characters and the action-packed sequences left your emotions going all over the place in this one of a kind animated adventure.<br/><br/>The outline story is about a dog, but this dog is slightly different from the rest, he is a legend of the small screen as the star of his own TV show, Bolt; a super-dog that will do all it takes to protect his owner and best friend, Penny. There is just one big problem, Penny is Bolt's actual real owner, who never gets any time with Bolt outside filming for the TV show, and Bolt believes that the show that he stars in is actually for real. He believes he has superpowers and is always on the looking out stop the 'green-eyed' villain from getting hold of Penny.<br/><br/>One day in film production, a scene featuring Penny being kidnapped by the bad guys sends Bolt running out of the studio and going to look for Penny believing that she really has been kidnapped.<br/><br/>The film sees Bolt in the real world (where he has no super powers) and discovers who he really is. Along the way he 'captures' a cat (who he sees as a villain) called Mittens, and bumps into a rather hyper-active hamster (Rhino).<br/><br/>The films has a mix of genres, and Rhino provides a lot of funny dialogue, which works really well.<br/><br/>Another treat in this film is that you can see it in 3D, and it really makes it so much more realistic, I loved how the 3D made the action sequences so realistic. at you from the screen, one bit that really sticks in my mind was the syringe coming at you! I would definitely recommend seeing it in 3D.<br/><br/>However, there is one thing that, for me personally, made this fantastic. From what I've heard and read many people have said that it was 'hilarious' and a great animated comedy. For me, I don't think the comedy was the best bit. What I really liked about this film was that it had heart. I loved watching Bolt making discoveries about himself that he never knew about (e.g. the window on the trailer scene) which was full of warmth, music in these scenes in particular worked very well indeed. It left you feeling really emotional. But then it was a scene near the end that really did it for me, after all the action, the heart and determination of Bolt really did bring a tear to my eye, something I don't think any other animated film has ever done. Was it the 3D that made it so realistic (you could almost feel Bolt's fur) or the great work done on the animation, a combination of both? Never have I come out of an animated film feeling so emotional. Before seeing this film I read a quote from the chief creative officer of Disney animated studios who said that he believed in the words of Walt Disney himself ""for every laugh, there should be a tear"". They got it spot on in 'Bolt'.<br/><br/>Overall, I can't express enough how awesome 'Bolt' is. By far I would recommend you see this one of a kind film."
"Feral113","10","20","29","17 February 2009"," Wow, this is Disney at it's best
","Now don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of animation and I loved recent films like WALL-E and Kung Fu Panda, but this one is without doubt the best animated film this year or the last.<br/><br/>Bolt is a hilarious, funny, sometimes sad and incredibly enjoyable film. The characters are highly memorable and the story far more engaging and exciting than most other animations, yes WALL-E included.<br/><br/>It carries the classic elements of a children's story, combined with a modern day setting. Think Dick King Smith's 'Find the white horse' mixed with 'The Incredibles' and that gives you a scope of the feel of this film.<br/><br/>Without doubt this is a classic that brings back Disney's claim to fame. The plot is clever, with several homages to earlier Disney films and will keep you engaged all the way through unlike in WALL-E or Kung Fu Panda, which are both brilliant (The latter more so) but have some scenes where you want to leave the cinema quickly and go buy more sweets until the good stuff comes back.<br/><br/>WALL-E will beat this film in rating (Thought this one deserved to be better) for the simple reason that more people will pay attention to a film about a little lost robot, than a film about a dog who thinks he has superpowers. Go into the cinema, with an open mind and no prejudice, i.e. 'said film' is better so I refuse to enjoy this!and you'll see exactly what I mean. Trust me I didn't think it would be good but Wow was I wrong.<br/><br/>This is an excellent film with none of those, 'Geez i'm glad the kids didn't understand that joke' moments which makes it all the better than films that try to sneak those in every so often. Bolt is awesome!<br/><br/>I wont give you any spoilers other than rhino the hamster is hilarious and all three of the main characters will make you laugh out loud, I've never been in a cinema with so many people laughing before! Long story short, watch this film, trust me, it's engaging where others are not, its funny and the characters are lovable. This is Disney's best yet, that includes anything PIXAR have done and deserves to win whatever awards it's nominated for. Great for kids and adults alike, you wont be disappointed. It has those great moral undertones everyone seems to be such a fan of on here too! No seriously though, they work. very well.<br/><br/>Enjoy the film and watch out for Styrofoam!"

","Over the past few years Disney track record in new movies has been questionable. With the exception of Meet the Robinsons (which I quite liked), Disney has done nothing but pump out rehashed ideas in the form of inane sequels to classics loved by my generation or weak under developed characters. Well not this time. I managed to see an advanced screening of this tonight with my daughter and it had both of us highly entertained. Bolt the ""super"" dog was full of funny and emotional characters the likes of which Disney has not produced in a while. And for once the comic relief characters, of which there are many, did their jobs and pulled even the slowest of moments out of the trash and send you rolling in the aisles. Rhino the hamster was my personal favorite. After seeing this movie all my daughter could say was how awesome it was and ask if we could see it again. I had to remind her that it actually does not come out until next week. Well to sum it up I would recommend to children young and old and while I have not seen it yet in 3D I plan too because it was easy to see that 3D is going to make the movie even more exciting."
"cjd-16","8","16","23","15 November 2008"," A Near-Perfect Family Comedy
","It's official. Disney is finally back! ""Bolt"" is a return to the old formula of having a story that works on both the level of entertaining the kids with jokes, and keeping the parents watching with a touching character-based story.<br/><br/>At its base level, ""Bolt"" is quite possibly the funniest animated film that Disney has ever made. And thankfully, the best humor was not wasted on the movie's trailers. You think you've seen it, but oh, there's so much more! The audience at my theater, kids and parents alike, were laughing like crazy throughout the film, including one joke that kept them laughing for a good minute afterward. (I wouldn't dare spoil it here.) Rhino, the little hyperactive TV-obsessed hamster who has no idea how small he is, steals the show. Almost everything that he does is worth a good laugh, and all of his humor is perfectly in-character... not annoying in the least bit, unlike the Disney sidekicks of the 90's. And there are no fart jokes or potty humor, or other such overly-easy kid-friendly jokes that make adults smack themselves on the heads. It's classic character-based humor, which everyone can appreciate, throughout the film.<br/><br/>The movie's base premise, a character who thinks he's something extraordinary when he's really not, may sound like a rehash of ""Toy Story,"" but it isn't. They only sound similar on paper. The execution, and what the film's drama and basic plot points focus on, are completely different. In ""Toy Story,"" Buzz's ignorance was self-induced, while in ""Bolt,"" Bolt's ignorance is the fault of the studio, who keeps him ignorant for the sake of making a more convincing show. ""Bolt"" is more of a story about love overcoming cruelty than a self-actualization one.<br/><br/>As a serious film, ""Bolt"" works for the most part. The first 30 minutes or so, from the opening pet shop scene to the end of the Ohio trailer park scene, are spectacular, showcasing the lightning-fast action scenes that Bolt thinks are real, plus using the wonderfully detailed and subtle character animation, (which is remarkably lifelike,) to capture the tender Penny-playing-with-Bolt moments. You really feel for Penny and Bolt because of how believable the animation is, and those first images of them together really stick in your head throughout the film.<br/><br/>The only place where the story fizzles out a bit is in the middle and some parts of the end. The parts where Bolt actually learns that he is not in fact a super dog, and has to cope with it, were not redundant, but they certainly weren't inspired either. It kind of rushes through them, and doesn't dwell on them, which makes such an intense change in character a lot less significant than it could have been. (This is not a spoiler, by the way... the plot shifts in a completely different direction once this part, which everyone knew was coming, is over.) I personally think this lack of perfection is because the team had only 2 years to finish the film after Sanders left, and didn't have time to iron out the story and dialog in the middle. This keeps the movie from being a masterpiece. If the whole film was as good as the first 30 minutes, it could have been. As is now, it is still a sensational family comedy achievement, but falls just short as a serious character-study film.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, ""Bolt"" is one of Disney's best films from the last 10 years, and is not to be missed. The kids at the theater unanimously loved it, especially loving the hamster. If you have a family, don't miss it! If you like good light-hearted comedies, don't miss it! If you're a lone Disney fan holding out for the return of the near-perfect character, music, and epic animation, though, you might have to wait until next year's ""The Princess and the Frog."" ""Bolt"" is certainly a treat, but is still just short of the levels of the 90's Disney Renaissance."

It made you feel like you were right there helping out Bolt and his friends. The character traits and development were well done. From the pigeons of New York to the pigeons in California every character had their own special personality. The graphics were superb and it made you feel as if the movie was real. John Travolta does the voice of Bolt. I wasn't sure if at first he was a good choice, but he made Bolt his own. Miley Cyrus was really good as the voice of Penny. She did well and her timing was great, but the real character that made this movie was Rhino the Hamster. He steals every scene and you and your kids will be quoting his lines for weeks to come. I saw take your kids to see this and don't worry it is great for adults too."

Over the past couple of years I have seen some awful films, Monster House and Cars are two that come to mind.<br/><br/>Bolt, to be honest I wasn't looking forward to seeing it, but I am glad I did, I loved it, it wasn't overly preachy or sentimental. It was well paced and didn't try to be something it wasn't. There were no innuendo jokes that were there for the parents and the thing I did notice was that the parents were laughing a long with the children. <br/><br/>Some wonderful lines, good animal characterisation, and a kick-ass hamster.

","I saw this on a flight out west, so picture and sound are impossible to judge and comment on, but I was able to enjoy the cute story. It is an old one, about the bond between two people being stronger than the situations around them. The two ""people"" in this story are a little girl and a dog.<br/><br/>As the movie begins we see a fantastically powerful and faithful dog named Bolt (voiced by John Travolta). As the scene goes on we eventually realize that we are seeing the filming of a TV series on a set. We further see that Bolt doesn't really have any special powers but the scenes are set up to fool even Bolt, and he thinks (as a dog may be able to ""think"") that he really is a super dog.<br/><br/>As script fate would have it, Bolt finds himself in the real world, and accidentally in a shipping box headed across the country to New York. There he escapes and soon finds out his super powers are not super anymore. Much of the middle of the movie involves Bolt's escapades in trying to get back to Hollywood, and partner up with Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) who he thinks is his real owner instead of just an actress.<br/><br/>Penny also considers herself more than just an actress, and missed Bolt, while studio bosses try to convince her that a different dog can play Bolt, since ""the show must go on."" <br/><br/>SPOILERS: Bolt eventually makes it back, with the help of a cat and a hamster in a plastic bubble. At the studio Bolt makes it just in time for a big fire in the soundstage, one that the fake Bolt runs from. Meanwhile the real Bolt rushes in and saves Penny. They are reunited, more than just two actors."

","Ridonculous! Bolt has the audience in the pad of his paw from beginning to end.<br/><br/>A white American shepherd who plays a hit TV series' superdog hero, Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) leads a Truman Show life: he thinks his superpowers are real and believes that his sci-fi adventures with his person Penny (Miley Cyrus) are serious. When Bolt accidentally strays from the confines of his studio lot world, he embarks on a real-life quest to find his person and protect her from the evil Dr. Calico. He gets into true-to-life troubles himself, encountering genuine characters along the way: a trio of pigeons, Mittens the alley cat (Susie Essman) and fan-hamster Rhino (Mark Walton). Ally McBeal's Greg Germann provides the voice for Penny's scheming Agent, while The Drew Carey Show's Diedrich Bader is the voice for the Veteran Cat.<br/><br/>It may be executive-produced by Pixar's John Lasseter and has tinges of his comedy stylings, but Bolt is fully a Disney creation. Having Lasseter on board ensures that the adults in the audience will probably have an even better time than the kids. The animation is impressive, as it delivers the drama and emotion, as well as the laughs and the Fully Awesome action! It would just be really difficult not to smile and swoon at Bolt and his sidekicks. Watch it and have a good day guaranteed!"

","I watched this at a screening w/ the directors. it was completely totally awesome. =] I had an awesome time. The movie was fantastic. I saw some of the production work (final and storyboard) phase of the movie and I could tell already that this movie will touch the hearts of many and especially pet lovers.<br/><br/>The film - I really enjoyed the beautiful lighting and how Disney just blows the minds my mind with it. The different colors used to set the moods, the different palettes at different locations, the patter, and etc to set the environment as he travels across N. America. I can see the old traditional side of Disney is coming back especially with John Lasseter heading up the creative side. The color to this movie really does set the mood and the beautiful details and painterly affect developed by Disney really made the movie just much more unique and emotional... with the soft brush effects.<br/><br/>You should not go into this movie criticizing it because of Miley or what not... or whatever... go in open minded. =] the movie will take your breath away. Especially the action scenes at the beginning of the movie - completely astounding and breathtaking.<br/><br/>I love the script it was creative and it really hits the heart and soul. As much as this story has changed throughout the production... it still stays true to the main theme. The movie brought tears to my eyes during the climax of the movie when Bolt realize he was not a dog, or when Mittens tells her past life... the movie in itself has so much depth. The entire Vegas scene (Vegas being fake... etc etc.) It really takes you on this journey across North America and you can really emotionally feel what Bolt is going through as he travels and seeing that open landscape... what is real. (pay attention to Bolt's fur color as he travels across N. America. =] They put a lot of thought process into this.) The composition of the movie was great I loved it. the camera angles used was awesome. I think Chris and Bryon and the rest of the creative team did a wonderful job. they put a lot of thought into the characters and its development. Again, the character development in this film did meet its marks. I loved the animation and the subtle movement of the ears on the animals. I loved the anticipation to it and just everything about the Animation... it was mind blowing. I loved the jokes they were very creative. I would go say more, but I'll leave it short and simple. =] You just have to watch this film."

","BOLT may not be in the same class as WALL-E but it's still just as entertaining, touching and genuine as any other great animated films that have more than meets the eye. I like watching movies like BOLT because you're bound to not only... have a good time but you'll also get that mushy feeling from its heartfelt story. No matter how tough you think you are, the themes of friendship, family, loyalty will always get you every single time. Definitely a must-see! Especially if you have pets If I were to say anything against BOLT's graphics and animation, it would be like having watched the movie with my eyes closed because the fact remains, the amusing 3D visual effects that this movie treats you with will guarantee the most absolute thrilling, adventurous fun a family can enjoy. They say God is in the details, you'll be hugely impressed at the extent that this movie is willing to go to bring us the most surreal looking dogs or cats or pigeons, just as good, if not better than some of the other CG animated movies I've seen in recent years.<br/><br/>Once again, the story will keep you at the edge of your seat. The fast-paced action sequences when BOLT is the show's superhero dog or even when he's not the superhero dog he thought he was. It can often be silly and yet you're glad it is.<br/><br/>There's one character, the hamster named Rhino who is just the funniest sidekick since Dori in Finding Nemo. Rhino will get you laughing and laughing and you will beg for more.<br/><br/>I gotta give props to John Travolta as the voice of Bolt, Travolta's got the ability to connect with his character and the audience, I'm aware it's just voice work but it's still hard work to make it convincing, he's got the comedic timing and the determination that is BOLT, the dog who is in total denial,.. motivated only by its hope that its person, Penny, will love him back.<br/><br/>Watching BOLT is a lot like watching TOY STORY 2, there's that unlikely friendship and teamwork themes to it and at the same time, it's also about how the toy/pets' owners or the humans often would get to a certain point where they'd abandon their toys or their pets resulting in... stray animals walking the streets. The network show that got Bolt famous easily replaces him with another dog, that's how much one can take something for granted. BOLT could be like a spokesperson for animal shelters and adopt-a-pet organizations everywhere. It is truly a movie that's good for everyone of every age."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","38","74","26 November 2008"," Tough to rate, it's cute but very unoriginal
","Bolt, I honestly don't know what to say about this film because honestly I feel bad about saying this, I love Disney so much, but this movie didn't do anything for me. First off this was one of the strangest casts, I do like John Travolta, but I just couldn't see him as Bolt for some reason, his voice just threw me off completely. Miley Cyrus, this movie became more about her and I think they were just trying to attract her fans to this movie. The only thing that I really did enjoy from Bolt was the hamster, Rhino, he was just absolutely cute, he could have been annoying, but he's like the ultimate fan that loves you so much that it turns around and you like him right back. The animation, it was decent, 3-D is just becoming so huge this year I think. The story is just The Truman Show with a dog, it also kind of reminded me of Homeward Bound, so this is something we've seen before.<br/><br/>A super-dog named BOLT, whose days are filled with danger and intrigue-at least until the cameras stop rolling. When the star of a hit TV show is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood sound stage to New York City, he begins his biggest adventure yet-a cross-country journey through the real world to get back to his owner and co-star, Penny. Armed only with the delusions that all his amazing feats and powers are real, and the help of two unlikely traveling companions-a jaded, abandoned house cat named Mittens and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino -Bolt discovers he doesn't need superpowers to be a hero.<br/><br/>While I wasn't into this movie, I think it's a great family film, especially for the kids, it's a guaranteed fun time for them. The characters are cute, but it's Rhino and Mittens who steal the show. I don't know about you, but I think this movie had a little bit of a rip off from Animaniacs, those pigeons in the beginning reminded me too much of the Goodfeathers and Mittens reminded me a bit of Rita, if you've seen the show, you know what I'm talking about and will agree with me. Bolt is worth the look, but I'm not that impressed with it, watch it with the kids and for the fun 3-D stuff. The story is just a little unoriginal but the characters make it worth your while.<br/><br/>6/10"

","After numerous duds, Disney has finally brought some quality entertainment on screen. Perhaps John Lasseter had a lot to do with it. The animation is similar to that of Pixar, detailed, vivacious and colourful. The story moves at a steady pace and even though it isn't anything new, it has its own charm and the adventurous feel. I loved the characters Bolt, Mittens and Rhino. They form a very entertaining trio. Travolta, Essman and Walton are great together. The Penny character is clichéd and Miley Cyrus's bad voice acting doesn't help much but thankfully she's not the main lead. I am also additionally glad that none of her songs appeared in her soundtrack other than the one she terribly sang with Travolta. The pigeons were laugh-out-loud hilarious. I loved how they moved their heads in a darting motion. If one took notice, the three pigeons in the beginning move differently from the three that appear in the end. 'Bolt' is the Disney movie that one has been waiting for. It's probably been ages since they have had a winner (the last one being 'Lilo and Stitch'?) and it's good to see them back with something solid."

","This is a children's film in the modern mold. That means it has to have cinematic values that effect and impress, and at the same time sport an acceptable message. Usually it about the value of family and finding self; here it is both. That means that these films have a built in bicameral tension, one foot in the future, danger, adventure and the other in manufactured notions of domestic comfort.<br/><br/>Regular readers know that I am a student of folded narrative, a simple example being what we have here: a film world within a filmed ""real world."" There are all sorts of narrative advantages that result from this device and they seem to work better when the film is animated. Something about acknowledged abstraction. The tip-off is in the first seconds where you see that the girl is redheaded.<br/><br/>Supposing you can tolerate or are immune to the dangerous ""message,"" this will be great fun.<br/><br/>There's a sort of metastory here, like that one of fifty years ago when Disney changed the nature of cinema everywhere. Here it is Pixar  and specifically John Lassiter, changing film AND Disney.<br/><br/>Pixar has three signatures; you can see them all here plus a quote.<br/><br/>The first is the obvious: the ability to render and move three dimensional characters in ways that more acutely convey the dramatic effects. All of these ways have their origin in ordinary theater well before film. But here they are engineered to be conveyed in ways impossible with real humans.<br/><br/>Pixar was the first and for a long time the only animation studio to actually worry about the story. Disney now in this does as well.<br/><br/>Pixar still is the gold standard for experimenting with the use of space. I mean that both in the sense of framing the scene physically and with the camera. The combination of the two is especially advanced. As with the acting, the goal is to do things that work and enhance the goals of the narrative, but which are not physically possible with ""real"" sets and cameras. You can see that used here, especially in the movie-within chase scenes at the beginning, which notably are more extreme than the rest in all three of these values.<br/><br/>Quite apart from the general Pixar influence, you can see it in each of the three script teams.<br/><br/>The basic script team owns the story with the pretty sophisticated notions of folding and redheads.<br/><br/>The comic script team owns the gerbil. He's probably a quarter of the film and 80% of the laughs. You can see his importance in the folding as well: when you do something as here (where one character is ""bolted"" in/into two folds), you need to have an observer who similarly spans the two. Hence the gerbil. But then he was turned over to the comic team.<br/><br/>You can also see the influence of a third team, which I am sure came from Pixar. They own the pigeons. There are three main groups of three, plus others scattered around. Their rendering and motion can be traced all the way back to ""For the Birds."" All their jokes are Pixar in-jokes. All their mannerisms are more nuanced, and I imagine that they were actually used in educating the Disney crowd. In true selfreferential style, they left references in.<br/><br/>For instance, when we first meet some pigeons we see the theatrical personalities in their head cocking. Then they talk about it and instruct Bolt in how to hold his head (to extricate from a fence). Later, we see a similar tutorial from the cat to the same character for begging. Students of animation will know this as an exercise to move Disney away from their similar keynote scene in ""Lady and the Tranp"" of 50 years ago.<br/><br/>There's the Nemo joke, tied to aliens and when we first see aliens in the ""new"" film within, it uses a shot taken, yes, from Nemo which in turn is patterned after Ridley Scott's film. Not ""Alien"" exactly but ""Bladerunner.""<br/><br/>Check out how the ""moviewriter"" pigeons send one off to get whole grain (which is not whole wheat) and how that is mirrored in the all-important introduction of Mittens.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Bolt the dog (voiced by John Travolta) is the star of an espionage television series. His owner, teenager Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) is his co-star. On the show, Bolt possesses ""super"" powers and is able to stop trucks with his paws, start explosions with his ""stare"" and outrun the bad guys. However, he lives on the set, in his own trailer, and never leaves the premises, not even to go home for the weekend with Penny. Consequently, he is unaware that he is an ordinary dog but, instead, he truly believes he is a superdog. Therefore, on the day that two pestering cats entice him to leave his trailer, he finds himself out in the ""real"" world. After a mishap, he ends up in a delivery truck to New York City, far away from Hollywood. Still thinking his special skills will get him home pronto, he is in for a rude awakening. But, through the help of a stray cat named Mittens (Susie Essmann) and a hamster named Rhino (Mark Walters), he begins the long cross-country journey. Will he make it? This film was cute and fun, with very nice animation and a clever script. There is a touch of violence, especially at the beginning, for the world of the superhero is rarely without danger, even on a television show. So, perhaps the film is unsuitable for the very youngest viewers. However, the cast is wonderful, with Travolta doing an excellent job as the voice of Bolt. Cyrus, too, is touching in her role as Penny, while Essmann and Walters are really superb additions to the film. All of the lesser characters are voiced very nicely, too, especially Malcolm McDowell as the pipes of the main heavy. The animation is colorful, skillful and very realistic, resulting in an attractive movie. Then, too, the score is quite fine, with Travolta and Cyrus doing a duet near the film's end. All in all, if you care about quality films for families, bolt out the door and arrange a viewing of Bolt. Everyone will be yapping with delight as the film runs its course."

","Story-wise, there's nothing remarkably new about ""Bolt,"" Walt Disney Animation's latest feature to hit the screens, but considering its patchy recent filmography, it's certainly a step to the right direction for the animation studio, now headed by Pixar-meister John Lasseter. While it's far below the sophisticated narratives and well-drawn characters of Pixar classics such as ""Toy Story,"" ""The Incredibles"" and this year's ""Wall-E,"" ""Bolt"" nevertheless charms its way to the screen with its eager-to-please lead character and diverting visuals.<br/><br/>Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) is the canine star of a TV show where he plays a superdog whose lifelong mission is to protect his ""person"", Penny (Miley Cyrus), from the evil forces around them. Problem is, as the creators of the show fervently believe that the show's success lies mainly in its realism, they have gone to great lengths to lead Bolt into believing everything is real and everything seems to be going well.<br/><br/>That is until a studio mishap has Bolt improbably shipped across the country from Hollywood to New York. With the help of Mittens (Susie Essman), an alley cat who strangely knows more about dog ways than Bolt himself, and Bolt-fanatic hamster Rhino (Mark Walton), he goes on a long cross-country tripping to find his way back to Penny.<br/><br/>Byron Howard and Chris Williams direct a calculated script by Williams and Dan Fogelman where nothing is terribly special, especially if you're not a dog-loving tween girl (I do love dogs, though), though it has enough sensitivity (that's Lasseter working) up its sleeve for some unashamedly touching moments. And with its cheery visuals, lively characters and a breezy pace, it also has enough going for the adults as well as the kids. It's safe harmless stuff."

He works with his owner, Penny, in a action shown on TV. Bolt runs away when Penny leaves him for the night. He goes all over the place to find her and meets some other animals along the way. The characters in the movie are all very creative and funny, especially the hamster who turns out to be a big fan of Bolt. There is also a character named Mittens (a stray alley cat) that Bolt meets about half way through the movie. This may not be the best animated film you will ever see, but it is still one worth seeing. I would recommend this movie to anyone- not just kids."
"Ostrumation","Null","2","2","17 May 2010"," Surprisingly Good, A Return to Form for Disney
","I had my doubts. In the recent years, Disney feature animation has had hits and misses. ""Bolt"" sounded like a very interesting concept four year before its 2008 release, when it was to be directed by Chris Sanders (""Lilo & Stitch"") and to be titled ""American Dog"". The idea had potential, but it was eventually scrapped. When I saw the trailer for ""Bolt"", I felt both satisfied and disappointed. I take it back...<br/><br/>If anything, ""Bolt"" shows that Disney is going in the right direction in terms of storytelling. It's too bad that Disney threw it out against big blockbusters and it couldn't make a massive amount of money at the box office. It's a shame, because this probably Disney's most Pixar- ish film. You could almost say it was as good as Pixar. ""Bolt"" sported a great story, fine performances and some great action scenes, along with some emotional content in the story.<br/><br/>TV superstar Bolt believes he is actually a superhero, until he sees the world for the first time outside of his trailer and the studio. His adventures pair him with a sarcastic cat named Mittens and the obnoxious hamster named Rhino, who is a huge fan of Bolt. Bolt goes on a cross-country trip to find his owner Penny, and on the way, he realizes he's not really a superhero, as it was all a television show.<br/><br/>The entire set-up for that was perfectly done. That's what made ""Bolt"" different from the other Disney films, it was unique and it was unpredictable at times. It had a different storyline. What also worked was the action sequences. The film was very fast-paced, it started up with a short intro and a thrilling action scene and throughout the film, it was an action-packed adventure. Aside from that, there was a good narrative and great characters. The comedic bits were very funny for a modern Disney film.<br/><br/>""Bolt"" felt very Pixar-ish. ""Meet the Robinsons"" also felt like a Pixar effort, as Disney seems to be going their direction in storytelling. If Disney keeps this up and their attempts to revive traditional animation, they can be a top dog in the animation industry. It has some small flaws that keep from being a perfect 10, but it's definitely a Disney film worth watching. To this day, I wish I had seen it in theaters.<br/><br/>A 9.6 out of 10."
"bkimbrell0","8","10","18","22 November 2008"," Bolt (2008)
","Perhaps I went in to the theater with expectations that were a little too high. I did enjoy many aspects of this film, such as the many Pixar references and the spoof of the Hollywood entertainment industry in general. The gags involving the pigeons from around the country was clever, and I loved the heavy national theme of this film. When I first heard about Bolt I was hoping for a scene like the one in which we see Bolt, Mittens, and Rhino traveling through the United States from East to West, and I was happy to see that they delivered in that respect.<br/><br/>I found the plot to be a little unoriginal, as it reminded me of Homeward Bound, Finding Nemo, and even a little bit of Toy Story 2 all rolled into one. The Toy Story 2 similarity (Involving Mittens), however, was done very well and quite subtle, moreso even than Toy Story 2. I guess I've just been spoiled by Pixar, but I think it's clear that Disney Animation Studios hasn't quite broken out of its tendency to cater specifically to children, and I feel that Bolt is no exception.<br/><br/>I did appreciate the imagery very much though; I felt the animation and settings were superb. It had a real sense of culture in addition to its emotional content, which is what reminded me of Finding Nemo. I actually think the best part of this film involves a certain character learning to let go of the Hollywood lifestyle and live more simply, with the help of those around him; that seemed to be a very universal message, and should have been the main plot of the film, I feel, because it was done so well, and was very heartfelt and sincere. I think this is a story that is going to hit home the hardest for animal-lovers, as they will be able to relate best to the main plot, but I feel that everyone can find something about this film to relate to and laugh about, no matter what your age or geographical location.<br/><br/>A respectable 8/10."

When he is lead to believe his owner, Penney, is in trouble, he escapes to try to save her but somehow ends up in New York City.

Unfortunately though, it never raises itself above that level, it never delves into the greatness of Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>However, it does show promise from the outset with fresh animation and a brilliant cast, perfectly pressed into the moulds of their characters. John Travolta is by far the stand out as Bolt, the naive canine, he provides the character with a depth that not many animation films seem to have nowadays.<br/><br/>Miley Cyrus is, surprisingly, good in her role as Penny, the dog loving kid who can't stop until her four legged friend is found.<br/><br/>The story is adequate, again with depth which isn't at the moment a necessary feature of an animated flick.<br/><br/>Apart from a good cast and a decent storyline, Bolt falls somewhere in between Monsters Inc and Cars; whilst it may do its job as a good family film, it won't set your soul alight."

As a result he believes that all the events that happen around him are real. When he is accidentally shipped from his home in Hollywood to New York City, he embarks on a cross-country journey so that he can be reunited with his owner and co-star, Penny. Bolt soon finds himself with two companions, alley cat Mittens, and a TV obsessed hamster Rhino.<br/><br/>The characters throughout are engaging and easy to enjoy and relate to. The effects in this movie are well executed, so much so that everything in the movie looks so realistic, yet does not contradict with the fact that it is actually an animation.<br/><br/>Even though the story is centred around Bolt, it is hard not to mention the two unlikely accomplice's Mittens and Rhino, who to me somehow steal the show. Not only are they both entertaining with their witty comments and sarcasm, but at the end of the day they are very endearing. And it is a Disney film, so it's nice to see them all have a happy ending, as an extended family together.<br/><br/>It is hard not to make comparisons after watching Bolt. A superhero who suddenly finds himself in the real world and must accept the heart-breaking fact that there is nothing special about them; I don't know about you but all I can think about is Buzz in Toy Story.<br/><br/>As with all classic Disney films, there is an underlying positive message to give to all. In Bolt's case the message is be true to oneself and find your own inner hero. But in a completely different direction this is like Disney's version of The Trueman Show. Watch and you will see."

","Bolt is Walt-Disney animation feature that tells the adventures of Bolt, a dog actor, and his quest to find his master after a series of events brings him to the other part of the USA.<br/><br/>The story uses well-known traditional stories, a dog going back to his owner after traveling hundreds of miles, and the story of a character that believes the world that surrounds him is real and not built to make him believe so. In fact, you find the same elements in the old classic Lassie, and in the modern classic The Truman's Show. In that regard, Bolt is a revamped Lassie with a Truman's syndrome. These elements are well mixed and twisted to create an original, enjoyable and humorous adventure of love, faith, and identity.<br/><br/>I found the first minutes, with puppy Bolt adorable. Then, I was quite irritated with the first minutes of the action movie, until the original story starts. So, if you don't feel appealed by the James-Bond-ish persecution, just wait a few minutes and give the movie a chance.<br/><br/>The characters are very likable, especially Rhino the overweight excitable hamster, masterfully voiced by Mark Walton, the mater-of-fact but helpful cat Mittens, voiced by Susie Essman, and the several groups of pigeons that appear in the movie, which I found hilarious. Bolt's sweet confused character is voiced by an almost unrecognizable John Travolta, while sweet Penny is voiced by another unrecognizable Miley Cyrus. In fact, all the dubbing is terrific.<br/><br/>The animation is very good, especially the gorgeous mate-painting backgrounds, which portrait with accuracy and lyricism the diversity of the USA's landscapes, and make the trip through the country real and believable. Some of the details of the vegetation are just amazing, as well the landscaping layout, house architecture, the colors, and a magnificent lighting. The drawing of the leading characters is just OK, a little bit chunky and lacking in detail and limited movement for both Bolt and Mittens. However, the ensemble is very good, and the dubbing helps tremendously to make the characters come to life.<br/><br/>An lovely family film with great animation, entertaining plot, characters and soundtrack"
"MartinHafer","8","3","4","26 September 2009"," Slight but very charming
","The plot concerns a dog (Bolt) who doesn't realize that his entire life is just a TV show. So, when he accidentally gets lost in the real world, he cannot understand why his super-powers have disappeared. And so, until he meets a wise and worldly cat, he flounders--unable to figure out how he got there or how to get back to the little girl he loves.<br/><br/>This is not the deepest story I have ever seen for a computer animated movie, but it was quite charming and fun--something that many other family movies could emulate. In fact, compared to previous Disney-produced CGI movies (other than those from the separate Pixar unit), BOLT is a significant improvement--both in story and in animation quality. If you don't believe this, just try watching CHICKEN LITTLE some time--it lacks the charm and universal appeal of BOLT. In other words, CHICKEN LITTLE was purely for very little kids--adults would mostly be bored by the film. MEET THE ROBINSONS was a bit of an improvement, but with BOLT I could finally enjoy the movie along with my kids.<br/><br/>Fun, well-animated and different. While not exactly a must-see, this is a very good film."

","In Bolt, a TV-show canine (John Travolta), who doesn’t know he’s on a TV show and therefore has no super powers, races across the country to find his TV girl-owner (Miley Cyrus), convinced she’s in the clutches of the evil Dr. Calico, the bad guy on the show. Aided by a cynical alley cat and a hamster in a transportation ball, Bolt must fight the forces of gravity and the other laws of physics to be reunited with his Penny in this sweet, charming Disney animated film.<br/><br/>It’s encouraging to see a good Disney-only animated film for a change. Bolt does what an animated movie should do – it has a quick pace, it’s humanistic, it’s funny, and it’s adventurous. Oh, and there’s character growth. It’s no surprise that the intended audience – little kids, not me – found this entertaining, on average.<br/><br/>Bolt, an American White Shephard, escapes from his trailer on the set of his hit television series and finds himself shipped to the East Coast. Thinking that his Penny is in imminent danger from the man with the green eye (played with the usual maniacal glee of Malcom McDowell), Bolt tries to use his super powers – super speed, the ability to shoot lasers from his eyes, a Super Bark – to rescue her. Of course, since he’s just a normal dog, these super powers don’t work, but they do lead to some hilarious physical comedy.<br/><br/>One departure this movie offers is the casting of unknowns in key roles. Mittens the Cat is played by Susie Essman, and the scene-stealing Rhino the Hamster is voiced by Mark Walton. Who and who? And yet both actors are perfect for the roles. Sometimes it pays to cast someone based purely on their fit for a character, rather than hiring a “name” actor and letting their celebrity overtake the character completely. Which is how Disney did it for years and years; when the studio enjoyed its resurgence in 1989 with The Litter Mermaid, it cast Buddy Hackett amid character actors, and the landscape of animation changed. Next thing you know, you had Robin Williams in Aladdin and James Earle Jones in The Lion King. Not that these were bad casting choices, but they represented a change from olden times, for the most part.<br/><br/>Travolta is excellent as the intrepid, resilient, and initially deluded Bolt, a canine who learns that his super powers come from within him. Why, he had the power to save Penny all along! All he had to do was click his heart together, and.. Oh, never mind. The point is, Bolt learns that help can come from unlikely sources (a cat!), and comic relief is always welcome (a hamster!) And Cyrus – who has limited screen time, compared with Travolta – is spot on as the innocent Penny, who pines for her lost pup. In fact, if it weren’t for an extended musical montage (sung by Jenny Lewis), this would have been a great movie instead of merely a very good one, but you can’t please everyone."

"angelocrus","7","4","6","31 March 2009"," Uhm, well, cool for the kids...
","The first minutes of the movie are actually dark; living into something you thought was real but was not. Bolt thought he was a superhero but he was just an ordinary dog- cute and cuddly and used. When I realized what is going on I kinda wished he was actually what he though he was. He was played really nice by the people he trusted, with all that busting power and importance- he was just a dog.<br/><br/>But in fairness, this kiddie movie lifted up as it goes by. The atmosphere became the usual element of a kiddie movie which is adventure and fun. Animal cartoons ""anime"" is a product of frustrations of the reality, when one rich person cannot deal with reality; he resorts to something like cartoons. No dogs can really talk; special effects on a living actual dog might be insensibly costly.<br/><br/>This movie made me rethink a hero does not have to the big stuff heroes always do which was presented at the beginning, because all that big stuff hero thing are fake. (I'm talking about charities and pictures and media.) The real hero is the one who is not afraid of doing the right thing even if all the people turned their faces away from him. Like Bolt we know at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>This is not another hero movie, this is presentation of reality. The hamster in a cage, the cat who at first abused the weak- lives in a camouflage, the actress, the birds, and Bolt. You know what I mean."

","i think it's safe to say i'm a huge Walt Disney fan i have been for as long as i can remember, i knew the words to the little mermaid song (part of your world) when i was 4. I've rarely seen a Disney film which i don't love. apart from of course ratatouille and the wild, honestly i have valid reasons for not liking them, Ratatouille first off, infuriated me with the year long add campaign which went on from valentines day 2007 until the DVD was released in Febuary 2008!! the on going ads just irritated me! as for the wild, it was a Blatant RIP-OFF of Madagascar (DREAMWORKS- the people who made Shrek, for those of you who seem to think Madagascar was Disney!) the only thing i liked about the film was Eddie Izzard! But recently since Pixar and Disney become one and John Lasseter from Pixar took the reins over at Disney Animation Studios. the films admittedly have made a fantastic impact upon the film industry, and especially me! Bolt is the first Disney Animation since John took over, it is the story of a young dog, who is the star of a television show in which he defeats bad guys, saves his owner penny and has awesome super powers, until of course, Bolt is safe in his trailer, then the set is taken down, of course Bolt is the star of a TV show with his owner penny, of course he is deluded into believing that he actually has these super powers.<br/><br/>Bolt accidentally gets shipped across the country to NYC, bolt being under the impression that it is the work of the GREEN-EYED MAN, vows to somehow get back to Penny, of course his powers aren't real.<br/><br/>Bolt faces the journey along with two sidekicks, Mittens an alley cat who helps but to understand his true dog self, and Rhino the eccentric, lovable, chunky, Bolt worshipping hamster! Rhino too believes that Bolt is a superhero and his courage and determination makes him somewhat remarkable.<br/><br/>The film is definitely one which will make any animal lover cry (once, twice ... three times maybe!) and the comic genius of both Rhino and the Pidgeons is absolutely outstanding! The small cameo roles of the pigeons will no doubt keep you entertained with their mannerisms and their Ridonkulous Accents and stereotypes.<br/><br/>It's a film i definitely recommend for any animal lover, young or old, it is definitely the best Disney film i have seen for a long time, it has knocked Cars from my number 1 favourite Disney movie.<br/><br/>I think it's safe to say that Disney have taken a new turn and have come back on top thanks to John Lasseter."

It all runs very fluidly and the characters are very well developed throughout the film, to the point where you genuinely like each of the three main characters, at the least. A dog a cat and a hamster working together? That's got to be funny and it was! As far as animations go this is up there with the best, I'm very surprised it hasn't got much more attention.

The story is good but it leaves you the sense of already been watched previously and the plot is pretty convincing although a little predictable. It is pretty enjoyable for the little kids but the adults will spend a really good time too. It is funny and it has pretty good action and adventure. The cast of voices is very good featuring John Travolta as Bolt and Miley Cyrus as Penny. The characters are very funny, specially Rhino the hamster and all the bunch of pigeons that appear throughout the movie. The animation is excellent already a constant on all Disney movies and if you watch it on 3-D even better.

","I saw this movie on Saturday with my girlfriend and we absolutely loved it. I can't remember having this much fun watching a Disney flick besides for Wall-E, but before that, jeez, Aladdin comes to mind. Yet this movie along with Wall-E were really, in my mind, the boosts that Pixar needed to really pick up from their last few films, that one with the rats (not Ratatouille), Shrek 3, Shrek 2, and others. Bolt is a heroic dog on a television show, yet he has no idea that it is a show and he believes that he has all these superpowers and what not. When Penny (his owner) is ""kidnapped"" he flees the set in hopes of finding Penny. Little does he know of the dangers that await him.<br/><br/>Bolt is voiced beautifully by John Travolta, who I was skeptical about at first considering how old Travolta is and Bolt looking like a very young and restless pup. Yet Travolta's energy and charisma bring a wonderful dynamic to the brave lil pup. I hate Miley Cyrus, but her voice can be quite charming at times, I was actually drawn in by her. Mark Walton does the voice of Rhino, a fat hamster who is Bolts biggest fan. His crazy antics and adorably funny lines such as ""I eat danger for breakfast"" we'll have you laughing throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>The pigeons in this film are, like others have stated, truly stunning. Their motions are perfect, including one beautiful scene when they fly off. The delay of the lift off to the actual movement of the wings is unbelievably choreographed. Great job on the pigeons Pixar! The animation of this film is great, definitely on par with other Pixar greats like Wall-E and Shrek.<br/><br/>Overall, a great family film. I would recommend this to anyone who wished to avoid the Twilight crap, or someone who is just looking at watching a movie with some great laughs, along with some subtle comedic references to other media, and just altogether fun.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I find most animated films of late to be very entertaining. The best are the ones with a lot of humor. There are exceptions to that (""The Polar Express,"" for example) but humor seems to go hand-in-hand with animated feature films.<br/><br/>I say all of the above because this Disney animated film, ""Bolt,"" wasn't too funny. Thus, at least for me, I didn't think this was involving and entertaining enough for me to care about the story much after the first half hour. I didn't find the characters appealing nor the story and I thought the graphics were overrated.<br/><br/>I disagree with most of the national film critics who thought this was great. ""Penny,"" voiced by Miley Cyrus, was a bit aggravating and John Travolta doing the dog's voice was just too weird. Maybe I'm just not used to hearing Travolta's voice on animated films, but it just did not sound right here. It would up being a distraction from the story, and I see other reviewers here agree with me on that one.<br/><br/>They lost me early on when the dog was shipped a long way in a box with no room to breathe, no air holes, and yet.....no problem. Hey, I know it's just fiction and a fun, animated movie but let's have some sense of realism on things like that.<br/><br/>I'm normally easy to please with animated stuff, so it's unusual for me to be disappointed as I was with this one."

","I have been a big Disney fan all my life. After quite a solid Renaissance, with only Hercules and Pocahontas lacking that extra Disney magic, the Disney movies of the 00s have been mixed. Emperor's New Groove and Lilo and Stitch were great, on the other hand Home on the Range and Chicken Little were forced, predictable and forgettable.<br/><br/>Bolt did have me interested, but I wasn't as enthused with the initial casting of Miley Cyrus, who I can't stand. Actually in the movie, she does okay and her character is quite cute.<br/><br/>While it is far from amazing and far from a Disney classic like Beauty and the Beast, Pinocchio, The Lion King, Bambi and Sleeping Beauty, Bolt is one of the better Disney movies of the 00s. It does have its rushed and predictable spots, especially with the ending, and the human characters excepting Penny aren't as appealing and aren't given as much attention to detail as they ought to have done.<br/><br/>But what does compensate are some stunning animation with excellent character design, amazing colours and beautiful background art, a rousing soundtrack, a fast-paced and heart-warming story overall and witty scripting. The voice work is top notch, while John Travolta is suitably eloquent as the title character the real plaudits go to Susie Essman as the best character of the movie Mittens and Malcolm McDowell as Dr.Calico.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a surprisingly enjoyable family movie and one of the better Disney efforts to come out so far in this millennium. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"

"Otoboke","Null","3","5","6 February 2009"," A welcome eye opener to where the animated film industry may be headed.
","It's getting to the point now where, introducing the latest three-dimensional feature with an introductory paragraph relating to the history and general makeup of the 3D movie is becoming redundant. In today's cinematic climate, it is quickly becoming common to see 3D glasses being handed out every month or so; for those of us who have shared in the gimmick up until now, it's not exactly a promising sign, but it's a product of change we must accept nevertheless. Yet there are reasons as to why I always discuss the similarities between such features before going into details and that is simply because, like many other subgenres such as the ""J-horror"", the 3D movie usually sticks to traits which work as a deterrent to entertainment. Sure, the images are stark and glossy- they pop out at us and briefly take us aback, but then we slowly begin to realise that everything behind all this glitter is ironically flat. Of course, there have been rare exceptions to this general rule of thumb, and yet most seem to the stick to the same adage of your average 3D attraction at theme parks; distract first- tell a 'story' second.<br/><br/>Then there's Bolt; Disney's latest animated feature touting anthropomorphised melodrama aimed at kids but not completely useless for adults. They're been doing it for a while now, but not necessarily in ""true 3D"". As a somewhat sophomoric experiment for Disney, one would expect Bolt to be hard pressed in finding its feet, and yet this is thankfully not the case. Instead, those guys from the Magic Kingdom have delivered a 3D experience that although suffering from many defects- at least doesn't pander to the technology that drives it. Indeed, rather than tell a story that feels weak and formulated for the sake of dazzling, Bolt dazzles through its characters and story which although comes off as tiresomely derivative and predictable at its worst moments, at least delivers on something other than cheap sparkle distractions. The result is a heart-warming experience that engages for the most part in a traditional manner whilst providing some awesome sequences for the eyeballs to chew up all the same. It certainly isn't perfect, no, but it's a fine effort nevertheless and a welcome eye opener to where the animated film industry may be headed.<br/><br/>For all intents and purposes however, it 's certainly worth noting that while Bolt certainly does offer a breathtaking and very impressive tour de force of animation technology, the spectacle of the movie could still be just as effective in regular two-dimensional rendering. The movie's plot which centres around a brainwashed dog who goes astray in the real world only to find out he's not what he thought he was, is the first and foremost attraction to what is on offer here. Following a sweet, albeit overly familiar Buzz Lightyear complex of realizing your disillusions have been brought on by outside forces (here, they are represented by the special effects of Hollywood), Bolt tells a story that works on a literal and very touching, emotive manner for those less occupied with the intellect; granted, the pacing is irregular throughout act two which mostly follows a mundanely formulated animal-buddies-road-trip structure, but bookends one and three deliver many punches that never feel as cheap as those moments within the middle. Most importantly however, children will love it; it's sweet, funny, thrilling, slapstick and emotionally rewarding.<br/><br/>For all the more reserved of viewers however, perhaps escorting the little ones to the cinema selflessly, Bolt isn't a misfire by any means. Sure, around half of the aforementioned qualities won't do much to invigorate the senses, yet the movie does well to work in a simple, albeit welcome allegory of disillusionment caused by the glitter and glare of TV screens, movies and celebrity magazines. In a sense I was taken aback when I was suddenly thinking about Fight Club in all its counterculture, frustration-and-disappointment-through-false-expectation thematic material, but pleased all the same. That's not to say that Bolt in any way starts overtly preaching or giving lessons on the crushing realities of life in the manner to which Fincher did ten years back; no, here the moral is closer to that of The Wizard of Oz than Jack's gloomy existentialist nightmare, yet it's this fine blend of intellectual substance loosely tying together a soft, sugary story that makes Bolt a much more rewarding experience than your average tepid animated fare.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned, the aesthetics present here are wonderful; in fact, I feel no unease at claiming Bolt to be the best looking 3D animated film to date. Sure, it's a niche market at this point in time, but that doesn't detract from some of the movie's breathtakingly crisp action sequences that test the medium to its capabilities. The performers do a fine job too; it's nothing as remarkable as everything that surrounds them, but most do a fine job with what they are given and never succumb to the distant numbness sometimes associated with big stars playing polygon puppets.<br/><br/>Conclusively I must reiterate that while Bolt does have its fair share of wonderful moments, a distinct lack of such during the movie's middle act inevitably hurts the momentum and overall impact of its greater parts. Nevertheless, those looking for a heart-driven tale filled with sweet characters, thrilling action and some genuinely laugh out loud gags, could certainly do a whole lot worse than taking a trip to catch Bolt. That being said, it's also a testament to the movie that I didn't grumble on and on about the evils of that often flat third dimension; Bolt showcases the idea that 3D can be more than a cheap gimmick to sell tickets. Instead it offers such technology as a well intended after-thought that only adds rather than detracts to the real reasons we as audiences sit down to watch movies in the first place.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"
"DICK STEEL","9","3","5","5 December 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Bolt 3D
","To echo the biggest fan in the film, Bolt is fully Awesome! Or at least the 3D version of this film, especially the first 10 minutes where we see the superdog in action, showcasing super powers such as his eyes shooting laser beams, speedy acceleration, super strength, and his signature super bark. These are the avenues where 3D gets put to good use, but don't expect every aspect of the film to come flying toward you from the screen.<br/><br/>Disney continues its fascination with the canines this year, having seen the likes of Beverly Hills Chihuahua, its collaboration with India in Roadside Romeo, and now, venturing into the 3D arena with Bolt the superdog. Man's best friend probably never had so much cinematic exposure in the same year, and 2008 ends off with an American Shepherd being the star of the show.<br/><br/>Like The Truman Show, Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) is brought up as the unwitting star of a Hollywood television series, and is totally clueless to the world outside of its sound studio. Thinking that everything's for real, he becomes the perennial fish out of water, having been accidentally shipped from Hollywood to the Big Apple, and thinking that his person Penny (Miley Cyrus) is in mortal danger. Hence comes the road trip back to where he belongs, together with some serious questions asked in dealing with culture shock as he discovers his mortality and his being nothing but a normal mutt.<br/><br/>Joining him in the adventures are a cynical cat Mittens (Susie Essman) who shovels the cruelties of the real world down Bolt's throat to awaken his idea, as well as a very zealous fanatical fan in hamster Rhino (Mark Walton). There's nothing groundbreaking here in its character development because it's tried and tested formula, as you'd come to expect everyone ironing out their initial differences to come through stronger as a combined unit than individuals out to fulfil their objectives - Bolt wants to return to his owner, Mittens just wants to rediscover love lost, and Rhino, well, is simply enjoying every minute spent in hanging around his idol.<br/><br/>There are plenty of laughs coming from the initial half of the movie before Bolt's attempt to unlearn what he has learnt. The downside of course is that most of the funniest parts of the movie, already made it to the trailer. That aside, there's a very powerful message contained within for the young in reminding them not to abandon their pets, which is almost THE message that gets put into an animal-friendly/centric movie. Love and Friendship are the usual themes used through which to tug at your heartstrings, with enough moments to go ""aww"" and fight that tear or two in staining the 3D glasses which have to be returned. And of course with any dog movie, Loyalty is never far behind.<br/><br/>For a few dollars more, you can choose to watch the 3D version of it, and trust me, it's worth every minute and every cent extra, even if there aren't many moments where you'll duck at objects flying towards you. It's quite obvious that unlike Journey to the Center of the Earth that the set action pieces here aren't designed explicitly for this format, but it still offers extremely good digital quality in the rendering of images that pop and provide you that extra dimension, so realistic that there will be moments where you'll be tempted to reach out and pseudo-pet the dog for a job well done. Visually, Bolt 3D is stunningly beautiful with wonderfully designed characters, and photo-realism aside, it's Disney at its best in designing characters with visual and character appeal, that can translate easily to merchandising dollars.<br/><br/>Bolt 3D lives up to its novelty, and will instantly become a fan favourite amongst the kids and adults alike. I can picture busy cash registers for Christmas already."
"zardoz-13","8","3","5","3 December 2008"," ""Bolt"" Is Movie To Bark About . . .
","The new animated 3-D Walt Disney family flick ""Bolt"" is pretty doggone funny. Combine elements of the Arnold Schwarzenegger epic ""Last Action Hero"" (1993) with the dogs trekking across America in the 1963 Disney classic ""The Incredible Journey,"" and you'll have a fair idea about what this cute canine comedy delivers. ""Bolt"" is the first Disney animated feature produced by the Mouse House since Pixar genius John Lasseter of ""Toy Story"" fame assumed creative control. Like previous Lasseter movies, such as ""Cars,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" the animation in ""Bolt"" is something to bark about. The incomparable 3-D digital projection is what distinguishes this lighthearted flick. Meanwhile, ""Mulan"" co-scripters Byron Howard and Chris Williams, who teamed up to helm this hilarious hokum, drum up a lot of jokes about a deluded doggie who dreams that he possesses super heroic powers. ""Pulp Fiction"" star John Travolta furnishes the voice for the feisty German shepherd puppy, and Disney singing sensation Miley Cyrus voices Penny, the teenager who adores Bolt at first sight when she spots the little nipper at an animal shelter.<br/><br/>The premise of ""Bolt"" is as fetching as it is far-fetched. Boltcomplete with a jagged lightning insignia across his ribsbecomes the top dog of a prime-time, Google Generation, sci-fi TV show. The contemporary equivalent of Lassie, our four-pawed protagonist shows no fear in a crisis. In the context of the show, Penny desperately searches for her father who has been abducted by an evil Bond-type villain, Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell of ""A Clockwork Orange""), flanked by two haughty cats. Before Penny's poppa got kidnapped, he enhanced Bolt with cybernetic powers that make this man's best friend as powerful as Will Smith's ""Hancock."" Bolt's prime directive is to protect his 'person,' Penny (Miley Cyrus of ""Hannah Montana""), from Dr. Calico's black-clad henchmen. Bolt is so strong that he can smash head-first into a car and send it spinning end-over-end 50 yards in the air. He can turn eyes into molten lasers and burn through anything. Furthermore, he can hightail it down a street faster than a greyhound on afterburners and leap above a hovering helicopter's whirling rotor blades! In reality, however, Bolt is nothing more than an average bow-wow. Network TV executives have fooled our hero into thinking that he has cybernetically enhanced brawn. After Bolt has dealt with the villains and gone back to his trailer, the technicians step in and remove the debris. The dead and the wounded get up and brush themselves off. Network executives refuse to let Bolt out of his trailer for fear that he will discover the truth about himself. Nothing Bolt does is real; it's the result of carefully staged special effects. You can see the resemblance between Bolt and the ""Toy Story"" character Buzz Lightyear. Everything changes radically for Bolt when two sarcastic cats lure him out of his trailer. During a frantic chase, Bolt traps himself accidentally in a box of pink Styrofoam that is shipped off to New York City. In the Big Apple, three moronic pigeons lead Bolt to a cynical, declawed, black alley cat, Mittens (Susie Essman of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""), and our deluded hero takes her hostage so that he can find Penny. Leashed together like Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier were in the 1958 civil rights thriller ""The Defiant Ones,"" Bolt drags a reluctant Mittens across America to Hollywood. Along the way, Bolt realizes that he is an ordinary mutt. He succumbs to hunger pangs and begs for scraps at an RV park in Ohio. Infinitely wiser than Bolt, Mittens helps the whelp make his transition from super dog to normal hound.<br/><br/>At the Ohio RV park, Bolt and Mittens encounter Rhino. Rhino (voiced by Mark Walton of ""Chicken Little"") is an energetic hamster who rolls around in a transparent plastic exercise ball. His favorite pastime is watching TV with his sphere balanced on the remote control so he can channel surf. The clueless Rhino worships Bolt as the super hero of his dreams and accompanies Mittens and Bolt to Las Vegas where they dine off left over casino buffet food in dumpsters. Along the way, Bolt discovers the simple pleasures of riding with his head stuck out a window of a moving vehicle, his ears sailing in the breeze, with his tongue trailing from the corner of his muzzle like a pennant. Just as Bolt is ready to surrender to the brutal, harsh grind of everyday life, Rhino refuses to let his hero sink into self-pity. Actually, this highly strung little hamster steals the show once he joins them, especially in a scene where Bolt and he rescue Mittens from an animal pound.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with ""Bolt"" is its anticlimactic plot. Nothing after the electrifying first scene can match Bolt's clash with Dr. Calico's attack choppers and the phantom motorcyclists that blast away with missiles at our genetically-altered hero. The finale at the studio where Bolt finds that he has been replaced by a doggie double is particularly heartbreaking, but co-directors Howard and Williams don't let us down. The animators do a splendid job of replicating Travolta's facial expressions on the snout of the heroic canine and Travolta reads his lines with admirable restraint. Children should enjoy the antics of these talking animals, and the fantastic 3-D digital projection will knock the eyes out of the adults who are worried about surviving this 81-minute comedy without reward. Watching ""Bolt"" in any format other than 3-D is a waste of time."

","My local paper thought the movie was mediocre, but good kids entertainment. I would have to disagree. I thought it was much better than mediocre - by a long shot. And my son loved it, too.<br/><br/>While the movie was predictable for the most part, the action sequences were as good as anything in the Incredibles (though perhaps a little more fantastic), and the story had some heart in places. The interaction between Bolt and his com-padres was a bit under-developed, but it worked for the most part.<br/><br/>Parts of the movie are very funny, and some of the bit characters (including the pigeons) are well sketched and a riot. They definitely show the touch or philosophy of John Lasseter.<br/><br/>The 3D aspect is cool and great for the action sequences, but the glasses are always a hassle."
"maine_310","8","3","5","30 November 2008"," Who knew this average dog could be such a superhero.
","When I first heard about this movie I wondered how they were going to pull off the fact that Bolt believed he was an actual superhero and I must say it was very convincing. I loved every minute of this movie, it had me laughing from beginning to end.<br/><br/>I warmed up to Bolt from the beginning, not to mention Penny, I truly believed her dog was more that a superhero, but a best friend 'man's best friend'. I also warmed up to Mittens the cat and Rhino the 'crazed fan- sidekick and friend' of Bolt.<br/><br/>I noticed that among the animals you were able to hear them speaking and when it came to actual people, the animals went back to their original tongues. It made me wonder whether or not animals have their own tongue that only they understand and we only hear 'roofs and meows', but the writing was well executed, even the little details made a big difference.<br/><br/>The storyline was believable and well-done.<br/><br/>I loved how the pigeons pledged war on the cat, I really believed Mittens was like the Mob-cat boss in their town. It was cool to see Bolt soften her a bit. Still at one point I thought they were going to give Bolt and Mittens a love story-Cat dog, I admired their love-hate relationship though.<br/><br/>""I have a sponge"" Blot's weakness, classic.<br/><br/>The pigeons Mittens easily bullied certainly got their revenge. I loved that. Everything remained in character, like when the dog began sniffing Bolt's butt. I understood, Bolt wasn't really exposed to that kind of behavior, but that dog was just too funny.<br/><br/>""I'm sorry do you want to sniff mine first"" Some things were a bit far fetched, like Bolt not ever bleeding in his lifetime, until he actually ventured out into the wild. Somethings weren't explained, like Bolt's ability to move in lightening speed and jump over the helicopter, without a scratch. Still that didn't take away from the amazing delivery of this movie which only made you sit-back and enjoy every bit. I loved how they explained his super strength and Bolt's naivety about his superpowers 'The dog has to believe it'. The laser eyes were also well-explained and very humorous.<br/><br/>Rhino was also a catch, what's a story if you don't have that one thing that is your supporting hand,in this case 'paw' and Rhino was it for Bolt. Rhino didn't come off cheesy at all, his owner was the typical stay at home grandma who tuned into every show including the commercials, of course the hamster would turn out an obsessed television fan. Bolt, what a way to give animals hope.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was the pigeons that acted like even more crazed fans when Bolt was in Hollywood.<br/><br/>They even offered advice for the series.<br/><br/>""Wait for it.. wait for it... Aliens"" Then again who better to watch television all day but a bunch of pigeons flying by the local television sets, on your window.<br/><br/>I hope they make more Like this one, I really enjoyed it."

","And, BOLT continues to preserve that sacred Disney tradition.<br/><br/>The dog of the title is a white German Shepherd puppy who's been raised to believe that he truly is a super-powered canine crime-fighter. But, through a certain string of circumstances, he is separated from his child-star owner Penny. Forcing him to team up with cynical, streetwise alley cat Mittens and hero-worshipping hamster Rhino in order to re-unite with her.<br/><br/>This film has something for everybody. The younger kids will love it for three reasons. The sweet sub-plot of a naive, overly-sheltered pet making new (animal) friends. Plus, the comedy relief supplied by regionally different pigeons. And, of course, Bolt trying to perform in real-life the stunts he does on his show...and failing (""It must be the Styrofoam!"").<br/><br/>Grown-ups and older kids, meanwhile, will love it for the semi-good-natured way the movie pokes well-deserved fun at the business side of show business. Especially, as personified by that obnoxious agent/manager!<br/><br/>In short, folks: if you want an unhappy ending? Watch the first five minutes of the 6PM news. If you want the polar opposite?

"Jangobadass","8","3","5","30 November 2008"," A Doggy ""Don Quixote""
","It's been a long time since I've wanted to see a Disney movie that didn't have Pixar or Hayao Miyazaki attached to it. For whatever reason, the past several films Disney has made by themselves have failed to live up to the standard of classics like SNOW WHITE, PINNOCHIO, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and THE LION KING, to name a few. Only time will tell if BOLT will be lucky of enough to held anywhere near the regard those movies are, but it's certainly a step in the right direction.<br/><br/>I'll go ahead and admit it's nothing that hasn't been done before (just once can't we have talking animal movie that doesn't involved a journey of some kind where the characters learn things about themselves and some life lessons?), but it has so much humor and heart that makes up for it's clichés.<br/><br/>The movie sure starts out good enough, with little Penny getting Bolt, a frisky and active puppy, from a pet store in a scene I thought was kinda sweet. Then we flash forward 5 years later to the action parts. As you probably know by now, Bolt is the star of his own action/science fiction TV show, where he uses super powers to regularly save Penny from the henchmen of the evil Dr. Calico. The tone setting scene for the show is like an entertaining cross between Lassie, James Bond and a little of the Matrix Trio (only better). Only Bolt doesn't know it's fake, as the studio does what they can to make him think he really is a super dog in order for him to give a better performance. The situation is made a little worse because Calico's cat (who's in on the sham) taunts him nightly for fun. There's also the fact that he and Penny really care for each other, having a relationship I found fairly touching and doubt most Timmies and Lassies ever had.<br/><br/>One day, the show ends shooting with a cliffhanger and Bolt escapes his trailer to rescue Penny only to end up in a box that's shipped from Hollywood to New York. With the ""advice"" of some pigeons, he takes a stray cat named Mittens hostage and forces her to help him get back to Hollywood & Penny and along the way they get help from a hamster named Rhino, who's a fan of the show.<br/><br/>The movie is helped by a colorful cast of characters. Bolt is the canine version of Buzz Lightyear or Don Quixote, completely deluded into thinking his powers are real. Seeing him talk old fashioned heroic dialogue at the beginning of the movie bought a smile to my face, and then when he starts doubting his powers and finds out they aren't real, it brings some depth & pathos to his character. Mittens makes the perfect straight man to him early on, street wise and sarcastic, then helps him learn to act like a real dog. And then we learn something about her past that makes us feel some sympathy for her. Rhino is as delusional, if not more so, than his hero, and could be the kind of pudgy, excitable fan boy one encounters in real life at various convention. And Penny is a likable girl who truly cares for Bolt and is even forced to make some hard decisions about her feelings for him. And there's a good supporting cast, from the pigeons to Dr. Calico to his cats to Penny's Agent, who keep things lively. And it's made even better by the great voice acting of the cast.<br/><br/>I'd like to talk about the great animation, but enough people have done that and all I'll say is that the animals, especially the pigeons, move like their real life counterparts.<br/><br/>There are some pretty funny jokes here. Almost everything with Rhino and the pigeons will get some laughs. The pigeons are made funnier because different groups of three are encountered who have the same character design, but have different color schemes and accents. And for a while Bolt thinks his powers were taken away by the Styrofoam packing peanuts in the box he was shipped in and we get a clever running gag about Styrofoam being his kryptonite.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe was said before, as we've seen the story before. And there are times in the middle it drags just a bit. And near the end, things got a little hokey for me.<br/><br/>However, this is still the best non-Pixar movie Disney has made in years as far as I'm concerned. If they can keep it up, they can get back on the right track to being the kings of animations again."
"mr_popcorn","8","4","8","17 December 2008"," A truly memorable affair
","The animated movie scene is on a roll this year. It started with Dreamworks' Kung Fu Panda, then with the joyous Pixar gem Wall-E and now, with Walt Disney's heartfelt treat, Bolt. This movie is just fun from the minute it starts until it ends and they didn't forget to put in some heart which then makes some lasting impression to the audience. You will laugh at Rhino the hamster's overeager attitude and snappy dialogues, Mittens the cat and the pigeons were great comic relief but the star of the show Bolt, is the one who truly shines. He's just too darn cute in his Truman Show world, they gave him a distinct memorable character and John Travolta's voice work gave it life. Bolt's person, Penny who is voiced by tween popstar Miley Cyrus fit the character well. Seeing as this is her first time doing a gig like this, I can say she got the job done and very professional, I might add. As long as she's doing voice over gigs and gets second billing, that's fine by me.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think what made this movie really work is John Lasseter. The Pixar brainchild who transferred to Disney. He gave Bolt a touch of Pixar that we all know and love but still separates it from other animated movies and giving it a distinct trait that we all knew and love in Disney classics like Snow White and Cinderella. All in all, Bolt is one of 2008's must-see movies, trust me, you wouldn't want to miss it for the world."
"anacpcruz","Null","2","3","27 December 2016"," Full of Friendship
","This movie seriously reminds me of the Disney works from the 90's, full of friendship, adventure, good feelings and vibes between a dog and his owner. The all concept and storyline is very clever, and in the middle also brings the touch of reality with the difficult but relevant theme of companion animals abandon, and the black holes of Hollywood multi- million dollar cinema industry. Bolt offered us an extreme positive message – unconditional care and love are far more valuable than self- interest, money, fame or notoriety. On the other hand, the viewer is also presented with a huge amount of humor and action, brought by another amazing characters like the pigeons or the hamster. Over all, we are facing another huge hit and magical work by Disney brilliant animators."
"caseynicholson","9","2","3","25 January 2015"," A Fantastic Animated Film that Will Appeal to Adults
","Last night I watched Disney's ""Bolt"" animated feature from 2008. I knew very little about the movie going into it, and I imagined that since I had heard less about ""Bolt"" than I had about some of the other animated features in recent years (""Brave""; ""Big Hero 6""; etc.) that perhaps the movie would be a flop. I must say that I found myself pleasantly surprised with the film, and it made such a good impression on me that I've given it 9/10 stars.<br/><br/>The movie follows the story of a dog named ""Bolt"" who happens to be a television star in Hollywood. Bolt's adventure takes him across the country before working his way back to Hollywood where he's trying to reunite with his ""person"" (i.e. owner), Penny. Bolt is voiced by John Travolta and Penny is voiced by Miley Cyrus, both of whom do great jobs in this movie.<br/><br/>If I had any one word of criticism for ""Bolt"", it would be the way in which the film portrays the dog as a movie star and shows behind the scenes footage of his career. For example, you see producers and agents talking with the show's cast, and you see graphics people working at computers to edit the show for production. For me, there was a bit of an uncomfortable vibe there, inasmuch as the way that it's done takes away from the magic of the movie a bit. I felt bad for kids in the audience, many of whom might be seeing a movie for the first time, and who were seeing that movies and TV shows in general are all sort of fake. That in and of itself takes away from the film a bit, but then you throw in the fact that the way in which it was handled might be a bit hard for some younger children to really ""get"", and that raises questions as to whether or not the script for this movie was very well thought out. <br/><br/>But, no sooner than I say that, I have to admit that if you can get past the whole ""behind the scenes"" thing that is featured in the movie and just take it for what it is, the film itself is outstanding. This is why I say that the movie will appeal to adults just as much as it does older kids who won't have a problem comprehending the behind-the-scenes technique. Once you're able to forget about whether or not your four year old is going to understand what's happening on the screen and enjoy the movie just for yourself, you'll probably really enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Last but not least, I'd just quickly remark about how amazing the CGI effects are in this film. That's nothing out of the ordinary for computer animation these days, with lots of other movies using similar techniques to offer up stunning computer generated visuals in feature films, i.e. ""Shrek"", ""Monsters Inc."", ""Toy Story"" and the like. But as someone who has only seen a handful of those movies that are becoming more and more plentiful, ""Bolt"" reminded me of what a fantastic age we live in in which animation can be so incredibly sharp, detailed and defined.<br/><br/>All that said, if you're watching this movie as an adult or if your child is old enough to understand the somewhat awkward behind-the-scenes technique of the script of this film, then I imagine that you'll find yourself loving ""Bolt"". It's a neat film with great graphics and an engaging story that you may enjoy as much if not more so than your kids."
"zombiefan89","10","2","3","31 December 2014"," Character Development done PERFECTLY!
","This movie's plot is one of the most creative Disney came up with yet! However, It's the characters that really sold me on this movie! Every one of the main characters are fleshed out and believable despite being talking animals! The most striking is Bolt's realization that his world is a TV show! It also shows how disposable and replaceable actors and actresses are when corporations are involved! Bolt and Penny being effortlessly replaced when they choose to go back to a normal life. It was also interesting how grounded everything was in reality despite the premise. People can't understand the animals, but the animals can understand the humans to great degree. Overall, it was definitely worth the buy! Despite being a kid's movie, the plot wasn't dumbed down, and it was enjoyable for adults and kids alike!"

The problem is, this is the only world he's ever known, and when he accidentally gets shipped off in a crate cross-country, he thinks his powers are real and doesn't know how to function in the so-called ""real world."" He gets teamed up with a cat and hamster in his quest to reunite with his ""person,"" Penny, and hilarious situations abound as he tries to enact his ""superpowers."" As you can imagine, towards the end, I won't reveal it, but he does wind up in a situation where he has to be the ""hero.""

"preston_peace","10","2","3","1 September 2014"," A fast-paced, well-directed animated feature.
","I love ""Bolt"" because of its story and how it tells it. ""Bolt"" echoes ""The Truman Show"" but asks what would happen if Truman secretly escaped. Bolt has been basically lied to his whole life and led to believe he was some kind of messiah sent to protect millions but finds his whole life is a joke for a low-rated television show. Even the event that leads him on his adventure was just a way to get higher ratings. His first interactions with real world are frightening, funny, and cute which is the point. The Director of Bolt's show succeeds in creating a character that would totally embrace the fake world around him, yet he fails to create a character with an identity outside of his fake world.<br/><br/>After Bolt escapes, there's really no villain. There're only unfortunate events. That's another thing that makes Bolt work: there's no one that the viewer can point to and say that's the bad guy. Sure, there are jerks, but no one is really a villain. The viewer can't blame the Director for creating Bolt; after all, the Director just wanted to make the show as believable as possible. He didn't want Bolt to get hurt, yet he wanted perfection. After getting perfection, people got hurt.<br/><br/>The movie isn't about grand villains; it's about figuring out what life is like without grand villains."
"natashabowiepinky","8","2","3","11 February 2014"," Two paws up!
","Every time I watch this film, I like it a little bit more. That's three times I've sat through it, and my ever-growing appreciation has increased it's rating from 7 to 8. Huzzah! There's an action packed plot, decent CGI, appealing characters and some great lessons about pet ownership. What's not to love? <br/><br/>Bolt thinks he's a superhero dog from a TV show... when in fact he's just a regular pooch. Accidentally knocked out and transported from Hollywood to New York, he is forced to team up with a snarky cat called Mittens (My favourite, both for her species AND her sarcastic demeanor) and a hyperactive hamster who goes by the name of Rhino to find him way home.<br/><br/>Bolt's cluelessness about the outside world (he's lived in a studio for all his life) and his attempts at performing his non-existent powers are the basis for much hilarity, along with Mittens's ever sardonic remarks and Rhino's never-say-die attitude (in comparison to his size).<br/><br/>But there is something deeper here, about the unspoken bond between an animal and it's owner. Bolt KNOWS his 'human' loves him, despite her being an actress... and Mittens was absolutely devastated to be abandoned on the streets of the Big Apple, unloved and declawed... (A disgusting practice which is thankfully outlawed here in the UK). The speech she gives about why she doesn't trust people late on is heart-rending to the core. Rhino, on the other hand escapes from a trailer park during the movie... and we never hear from his owner again. Well, he seems happy enough...<br/><br/>As I've shown, rewatchability is high due to the little things you'll miss along the way, and the end result is one of the most purely joyful ways you can spend 90 minutes. Especially if you're an animal lover. Guilty as charged. 8/10"

","Oh Bolt! How I love you! This is by far one of my top favorite animated movies of all time, and I'm not even a John Travolta fan! My favorite thing about this movie is the opening. If you watch this with someone who doesn't know what is going to happen, the opening credits are fun to watch them be surprised by. I love a good twist! I thought John did a fantastic job (probably because I didn't have to look at his actual face, which was really only good for Grease) and even Miley didn't annoy me the way she usually does. The hamster was a fantastic addition and is pretty much everyone's favorite character. The pigeons were so well animated I was keeled over laughing from how life-like they were and their New York accents just made it that much better! <br/><br/>I won't sum up the plot because if you haven't seen it and don't know what to expect from it, there is nothing I can say that won't give the opening credits surprise away and since that is my favorite part about it I refuse to ruin that for anyone.

","I wasn't sure I would like this one when I saw it on the TV schedule. I seem to remember it not doing all that well at the box-office when it was released. I shouldn't have worried; it has all the best bits that go into a Disney animation plus a heart-warming story to boot! But more of that later, here's a bit about the plot first.<br/><br/>Bolt is a dog, not just an ordinary dog, he's a dog with superpowers! Penny, his human, and her father put him in a device that enabled him to run like the wind, be as stronger than a speeding truck, jump further than anyone, gave him laser vision and a super-bark that will destroy anything in its path. Each day, he saves Penny and they go back to the safety of his trailer, but one day she is taken by the evil Dr. Calico and Bolt is left alone in the trailer. Determined to find Penny he escapes into the real world, a world where his powers no longer work. He finds a cat, Mittens who, he believes, knows the whereabouts of Dr. Calico's lair. She eventually tells him it is in Hollywood, a long way from their current location, New York. And so, taking Mittens with him as insurance, Bolt begins a journey that will change his life. On the way they bump into his number-one fan, a hamster called Rhino. But that's all I'm going to say about the plot, don't want to give too much away now.<br/><br/>A really well animated film, in the Pixar style as I like to call it. Some great gags and some really engaging characters combine to make this an enjoyable experience. Good performances all round, so honourable mentions go to; John Travolta as Bolt, Smiley Virus (ok, Miley Cyrus) as Penny, Susie Essman as Mittens, Mark Walton as Rhino and Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Calico.<br/><br/>Over all a really enjoyable movie with some great characters and some really good sight gags and one-liners. I wasn't so sure about the music but then I'm not a big country music fan. It was also nice to see dog and a cat getting on together in a Disney film for a change! It does happen in real life you know! (ok, minor rant over). So, enjoyable, engaging, heart-warming, funny, exciting and recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.7/10"

Bolt is a movie with a true heart to it, if you will. <br/><br/>I also applaud Disney for the portrayal of rescued animals, and I hope that this movie perhaps may have inspired people to adopt (after proper research of course) their next addition to their family. <br/><br/>I truly recommend this to the whole family, both young and old!"

","Lovely film. I'm odd as I'm 18 years old and still cry at movies like this. It's a touching piece of cinema. Bolt has tons of character, as does Mittins the cat. I actually hadn't heard of this film at all but gave it a shot anyway. And I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>The story itself is brilliant, and brilliantly told too. Bolt - who thinks he has superpowers is lost and sent to New York, he finds out his superpowers were fake (all part of a TV show) and does a road trip back to Hollywood. I wasn't expecting the story to be so good.<br/><br/>In terms of art style I wouldn't rank it too highly as it seems every animated film is capable of this type of stuff, but the points where the characters aren't talking still shine. Bolt is a hyperactive dog, and this is a hyperactive movie. It works well.<br/><br/>The voice acting is superb. Unlike Madagascar, the voices fit with their characters, John Travolta does a superb job of Bolt and Susie Essman does a great job with mittens. They're subtle performances and don't stand out too much like they do in other animated films (aka Madagascar, where none of the voice actors are particularly good).<br/><br/>There are a few points in this movie that are really funny. Namely the bits with Rhino and the Pidgeons. Again... All superb voices. The bits that are funny surpass the competition. Ice Age (2 and 3), for example, are no where near as funny or touching as this movie.<br/><br/>The ending (no spoilers) is lovely. Well worth watching. Again and again. I'm off to find a BluRay copy!"

Like every other Disney movie this movie too scores high in its animation of course, awesome story line, cute humour and endearing characters.<br/><br/>The dog (an American White Shepherd) in the movie is made to believe that he has super powers and his aim is to save his person 'Penny' from the green eyed evil Dr. Calico. But destiny had some other plans and Bolt escapes from his reel world in search of Penny who according to him has been kidnapped by Dr. Calico. In his quest to save Penny he meets an alley cat Mittens (voice given by Susie Essman) who loves to bully the pigeons and Bolt's ardent fan Rhino (voice given by Mark Walton), who by the way is a hamster.<br/><br/>The camaraderie between the three is splendid and absolutely fun to watch. Mittens like a good friend gives realty check to Bolt and Rhino with his zealous spirit makes Bolt believe that nothing his impossible and always cheer him up. Don't miss watching the pigeons. They are quick, intelligent and enterprising. I loved the performance of Rhino. He was simply awesome, no actually beyond awesome, he was beawesome!!

Voices of the characters are very good, especially John Travolta, since I didn't realize it until mid in the movie since it fits the character so perfectly. The most important lesson of the movie teaches kids that you don't necessarily need to be a super hero or have special abilities, fly or shoot laser to help others. You simply can be a friend's, or the family's hero by just being there for them in the time of need and help and support them to the best of your ability. I would definitely Recommend this movie for any family movie night or any one that is the fan of Disney movies."
"poe426","10","2","3","26 April 2009"," Smitten with Mittens...
","Just one of the unfortunate consequences of so many home foreclosures over the past couple of years in this country has been the abandonment of household pets. It's not a happy story, nor one that gets a whole lot of coverage. (It happens to have happened to my sister.) For a Disney film to even touch upon this subject is surprising (LADY AND THE TRAMP notwithstanding)- and commendable. My favorite of The Three Mouseketeers is, of course, the streetwise Mittens: her sad little tale of woe, blurted suddenly in a moment of emotional vulnerability, is enough to make this one of the more memorable animated features of the past several decades, and it gives the movie its considerable Emotional Impact. I honestly don't remember the last time I choked up watching a cartoon cat spill its emotional guts. A tip of the hat to all involved: you blew ME away, anyway."

","When I saw the previews for Bolt I wasn't expecting much. Your typical kid's film, really. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Bolt and recommend this film to others.<br/><br/>The voice acting was very well done. Mark Walton, the voice of Rhino, really stole the show here. I was a bit disappointed that they used Miley Cyrus for Penny because it seemed like a cheap advertising gimmick but she did a half-decent job.<br/><br/>The animation was superb. The action scene and the very beginning of the film is very well done and the rest of the film is a treat for the eyes as well.<br/><br/>I loved the characters, and although the plot was predictable and not very original the lovable and funny characters made up for it. I rarely laugh at movies but Rhino the hamster made me chuckle many times.<br/><br/>Overall I recommend Bolt to anyone expecting a fun movie. It's not up to par with many previous animated movies but regardless it's still very entertaining, even if you don't like kid's movies."

","I loved it and I have no kids! Whoever wrote this movie really cares about animals, the cat is very real and a true voice of reason. The cat was my favorite from her voice to her lessons. Anyone who doesn't like this movie, I'm sure must have gotten offended by the cats comments about fickle people de-clawing their cats and then abandoning them. People who do that make me sick. There is never an excuse to get rid of a cat you have selfishly de-clawed. The characters are fantastic and the casting was flawless. This movie has the perfect mix of Disney magic and reality! I would think this movie would teach a child loyalty and faithfulness, truly an all around classic."

","Bolt is by no means a dog of a film, but he does not teach any fresh tricks to an ancient genre either.<br/><br/>It's a fish-out - of-water tale, if the fish were a dog actor raised to think that he's a superhero who suddenly discovers himself without his power, and the water was the way he's compelled to move from New York to Los Angeles.John Travolta gives a good vocal performance as the title dog, Miley Cyrus does the same as Bolt's co-star (the two sing a duet over the closing credits), and Mark Walton gives a lot of laughs as Rhino, a television-obsessed, overweight hamster (one likely has to do with the other).<br/><br/>The tale is predictable somewhat, but it's nice and happy and first-rate animation.It's the first feature since John Lasseter took over the creative doings at Disney Animation from Pixar's genius-in-residence, and although it works at kid level, it doesn't give the layers of pleasure and wonder that the finest offer from Pixar."

The main character's the star of a hit show that co-stars his owner Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus). Unbeknownst to him it's just a show and a freak accident causes him to get lost and out into the real world where he learns it's harder to survive than it is on the show.

"kate-stuart","8","1","1","9 April 2018"," Bolt review
","""Well I'm still yet to see an animated film that can topple the mighty 'Toy Story', 'TS' still sits on its throne with the number one spot. But Bolt is a nice film, very sweet, very nice, a touch of emotion and you have a good solid performance.<br/><br/>The story is as usual pretty unoriginal but it still works well, it has a touch of 'Lassie' in there and 'Homeward Bound' with the cross country trek to find the owner but this does give it a soft touch that can pull at the heart strings in places.
It starts off kinda weak, your not too such what the films tag is or where the plot is going but it soon starts to pick up when Bolt reaches NY.
It looks great with some very detailed fur action going on and brilliant movement copying with other animals such as the pigeons. The funniest parts tend to be with the funniest character...that being 'Rhino the hamster', an almost Jack Black type rodent haha not an overdose of humour in the film but most comes from Rhino.<br/><br/>Solid film for all but still cant compete with the mighty 'Toy Story' trilogy."""
"SophomoreSlump","9","3","6","15 December 2008"," The BEST action adventure movie for kids in a long...long...time.
","Bolt (voiced by the talented John Travolta) is a pooch that was found by his person, Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) and was altered by Penny's father (voiced by Ronn Moss) into an ultimate and indestructible canine partner. He's strong. He's fast. And he has Super Bark. That and the fact that he doesn't know that he is in a TV show and that he is the most convincing animal actor ever, since he's not in on the whole scheme.<br/><br/>One day, after a demand from the studio that the director make a more thrilling and suspenseful storyline (a.k.a. cliff-hanger ending), Bolt breaks out of the studio, trying to find Penny, whom he thinks is really kidnapped by the evil Dr Calico (Malcolm McDowell), who really doesn't exist. Being swooped away from his former life, he now has to make his way home (the studio). Easy enough, except the fact that his power is now disappearing...at least that's what he thinks. We get to see him finds his way home, while making friends along the way.<br/><br/>This is the BEST action adventure kids' movie I've seen in a long time. And to think that Disney did it alone (without the help of Pixar) is very overwhelming. Although not nearly as good as Wall-E, Bolt does deliver, it has energy, the story develops nicely and in the end, it's a very fun movie.<br/><br/>It's pretty much like The Truman Show, except Truman accidentally got out, and THEN found out that the world in which he used to live in wasn't real.<br/><br/>The vocal cast is very impressive. Travolta sounds very young and quite the hero he portrays. Cyrus did the best she could with her character, which is not in on the action for most of the movie. But what really DELIVER the movie are the supporting casts. Mark Walton is the one that stands out, voicing the deranged and slightly mental hamster, named Rhino, who is also the biggest fan of Bolt. He is everything you see in the trailer and more. He's funny, loud, and wants to be in the action (being Bolt's #1 fan and all), and he keeps blurting out crazy and funny quotes. He introduces himself to Bolt by saying, ""I'm lightning quick; I have razor-sharp reflexes. And I'm a master of stealth."" Funny considering he's a fat, round hamster who does nothing all day but watch TV. And when he sees a guard at the animal shelter, he quotes, ""I'll snap his neck."" <br/><br/>The cat Mittens (Susie Essman) spends the entire movie trying to convince Bolt that he's not a superhero and that it's okay to be ordinary. This is a good lesson for the kids.<br/><br/>Finally, does this movie bring anything new to the animated world? Perhaps not. But considering it wasn't made by the giant company like Pixar, it's quite an achievement. This is what I want from Disney in a long time. Well done!"
"rockgodes","6","6","16","24 November 2008"," Was expecting more...
","I felt like Bolt was a wonderful children's movie, but left nothing for adults to be entertained by. I didn't think the one-liners were very witty, nor did I think the story idea was very original. I like the idea that Bolt didn't know he wasn't a super hero, but after that idea I didn't seem to find anything original in the rest of the film. COME ON Disney! GIVE US SOMETHING NEW!!!!! They should have put more humor for the adults that are the majority of the audience for the film. The graphics were well done, but I felt since it was in 3-D there should have been at least A FEW places where things really POPPED out at you, there were ample opportunities for this too considering Bolt's action TV sets etc."

","I have been awaiting this film ever since my workplace (theatre) started playing the trailers in the lobby, which was around mid-July or so. And tonight, I was definitely not disappointed (thank you sneak peek!) Bolt is an animated feature about a dog who has superpowers and saves his ""person's"" life on a day to day basis - or so he thinks. After being duped into thinking Penny was not okay at the end of a scene, Bolt makes a run for it to rescue his beloved Person. And lo and behold, he ends up in NYC! It's a long-winded journey back to Hollywood, full of plots, schemes, hamsters, cats, and learning how to beg. Bolt won his way into my heart easily, and I don't think he'll disappoint fans everywhere!"
"kyle-cruse","8","3","7","22 November 2008"," The biggest delight of the year
","It's been a while since I've been this pleased with a film I've seen in the theater. ""Bolt"" was a film that all ages could enjoy. It was not only very funny but a very touching movie as well. John Travolta and Miley Cyrus were perfectly cast as the voices of Bolt and Penny, respectively. The plot twist toward the end, which I won't give away here, was one of the most pleasant movie surprises I've seen in a long time, and I had to check my tears at this point. The opening scenes are some of the most exciting action-packed scenes I've ever seen, especially for a kids movie. Aside from all of this, ""Bolt"" may not be the most original movie I've ever seen. It has elements of previous Disney films, such as ""Toy Story"" (1 and 2) and ""The Incredibles."" It's not entirely perfect, as some occasional supporting characters can be annoying after a while. Nevertheless, I was able to overlook all of that considering how much I enjoyed and was touched by this film. It's easily the best film Disney has released since ""Enchanted."" A few more pleasant surprises like this each year would be great. This is the first film I've seen in a while that I've been eager to recommend. Great for kids and adults, and worth paying to see at the theater.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"theloneraven","9","3","7","22 November 2008"," A surprisingly entertaining movie
","I saw the trailer a couple times and was not impressed at all. But we decided to go and see it anyways when we found out it was also being shown in 3D, since my girlfriend is a big fan of anything 3D. I'm sure glad we did.<br/><br/>The trailer just doesn't do the movie justice. The dialogs were very well written with plenty of wit and humor. Doses of reality of life were added to the old dog-trying-to-rescue-girl-owner plot, making it less corny and more moving. The voices were also done quite well-I was especially impressed by Susie Essman as the jaded stray cat. Although I have to say throughout the movie, I had to fight very hard against the image of a bald middle-age guy with an expanded waistline overlaying a cute and cuddly dog.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Bolt is the best animation so far this year."
"robert-710-767167","7","2","4","29 April 2012"," Brilliant concept, pretty well executed
","The movie starts out as an almost cheesy crime fighting adventure film with superheroes and gadgets and the whole deal. It lasts a few moments before finally the reveal at the end of the ""show"" that it's actually just a TV show and is all fake. From there on you know interesting stuff's going to happen.<br/><br/>One of the twists though, is despite nearly everyone knowing it's a TV show, the dog, which is one of the superheroes, thinks the show is real life. He thinks he really has powers and really needs to save his owner who (in the latest TV show) ends up being taken but not rescued (as a response to a request from someone from networking). So he's off in the real world to try to find her, in the meantime she thinks he's gone forever.<br/><br/>I really liked how they mixed the TV studio concept with friendship. I'm into video editing and I really enjoy seeing how people make TV shows and movies and despite from a slightly fictional world it's still cool to see how their TV show could have been ""made"" if it were real life.<br/><br/>Anyway, I want to rate it 8 but it's not quite there to make the full rounds. It did a brilliant job with the ending and I really enjoyed it, but I don't feel it's a 7 either. It's like a 7.5. But IMDb doesn't let you do that, so I'd just rate it as 7.<br/><br/>So I rate it 7.5 out of 10."

It has a couple of tear-jerking moments about lost love and abandoned pets, but it isn't maudlin or belabored. This would make a great date movie rental. If your date doesn't laugh or shed a tear throughout the entire movie, dump them FAST! They might be a sociopath. Other than Travolta and Miley Cyrus, there are few big names in the cast, though a few gems such as Malcolm McDowell (""A Clockwork Orange"", etc.) and cartoon stalwarts such as Phil Lamar, but the acting is flawless, demonstrating the wealth of talent in ""voice acting"". I have no idea how well this movie works in other languages, but in English, it's a must-see."

"smfinkel","10","2","4","13 December 2008"," A transcendent movie
","The best movies transcend their subject matter. Rocky won Best Picture and Rocky Balboa (Rocky VI) should have because the focus of the movies went well beyond boxing and appealed mightily to those who had no interest in the sport. And so it is with Bolt!, a Disney movie.<br/><br/>On the surface, Bolt! is an animated kid's movie about a TV super-hero dog raised on a TV set,who never sets foot outside the studio. He is enormously believable in his TV role because he truly believes he IS a super-dog. The enemy falls at his superbark, walls tumble before him, iron bars bend in his paws, his Boltstrike causes bad guys to collapse as he valiantly saves his little girl partner Penny from doom.<br/><br/>Then, to enhance his concern for the next show, a kidnapping is staged. Penny is kidnapped, but only until tomorrow's show. But to Bolt, it is real. He escapes to save her and by a fluke is transported across the country. When he breaks out, he is not in Hollywood, but in New York..and in the never-before-seen Real World.<br/><br/>Slowly (and humorously), he realizes that his Super-powers are not real. But his resolve never weakens. Told repeatedly by a cat he picks up that humans do not really love animals, that a fine free life awaits him on his own, that Penny has replaced him by now and shorn of his powers, Bolt's relentless drive to return and save Penny from danger shines like a beacon on his cross-country voyage back to Hollywood and the girl he loves.<br/><br/>Along the way, he picks up the hilarious Rhino the hamster, a big fan of his show. Rhino talks like a macho movie hero ""(""it's a good day to die!""), but he is of course a hamster. He believes in Bolt, the superhero. In the end, Bolt is forced to deal with a very real danger without his powers and with only his hamster sidekick and his courage as allies.<br/><br/>In sum, the movie offers great humor,excitement and a display of nobility of character you won't see often. Take a kid or go with adults. Either way, you won't forget Bolt!"

Fast-paced and footloose, the comedy and heart is equally balanced in this winning comedy of errors. (Directors:Byron Howard & Chris Williams)"
"abecipriano","8","2","4","7 December 2008"," Good entertainment value
","With many good animation flicks in 2008, Bolt has rightfully cemented its place among Disney/Pixar's masterpiece CGI/animation collection over the years which began with Toy Story over a decade ago. While it will not be a classic like Finding Nemo nor as good as one of my favorites, The Incredibles, it is a very enjoyable animation movie.<br/><br/>Bolt has the right touches of heartwarming moments, action sequences, and funny scenes (some of Bolt's thunder were stolen by a hamster inside a ball named Rhino so watch out for them), and the concept was quite different in that the protagonist thinks he is an actual super dog. That was new.<br/><br/>My wife and I saw this, and we have to say that we left the movie theater feeling good and entertained. It will have to be tied with Wall-E for 2nd best animated movie that I've seen in 2008, behind Kung Fu Panda and ahead of Madagascar 2. I went into this not having as high expectations like when I went in to see Madagascar-Escape to Africa... my expectation coming in was just OK; it was comparable to when I went to see Kung Fu Panda (which was far exceeded by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, and the rest of the Dreamworks' team). So it was a pleasant surprise that there was something different to the plot, and that the funny moments were well placed.<br/><br/>The movie may be less star studded compared to KFP or Madagascar 2; sometimes in the other movies, you can imagine the famous actor while he's delivering the funny line (say, Jack Black as Po or Chris Rock as the Zebra) so it's a little different with Bolt because neither John Travolta nor Miley Cyrus is as well known for their over-the-top comedic voicing, but I think that the casting was quite solid.<br/><br/>The guy voicing Rhino was pretty good, especially considering the producers could have gone with one of those well known ""big"" comedy guys like James Belushi or Kevin James. But here was a guy voicing a really funny character pretty well, so kudos to the movie's producers for going against the grain and not following the usual Hollywood thing and hire someone well known.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was well-paced, the story was simple but clear, and there was a good balance of entertainment value.<br/><br/>Something worth watching, guys! Enjoy!"

Instead, it let the audience get there themselves.<br/><br/>The opening scene is absolutely mind-blowing - the graphics and stunts felt like I was watching something out of the Black Knight or the Matrix - it was outstanding and really got you going at the start.

Particularly I find sometimes tiring and must add eye-rolling to see the typical boring way to portray dogs as good and cat as evil or mischeavous; it's been done to death, it can frankly be a bit tedious to insist on that absurd rivalry. Nowadays you don't really see that kind of repetitive dynamic recklessly thrown into a movie plot, fresh ideas were desperately needed in order to turn around animated films depicting animals as characters.

The balance between reality and fantasy of the animated medium itself provokes one of the strongest storytelling experiences made for just this technique. It is a perfect almost seamless version of an oral history, wrapped in a classic moving canvass. The storyline from THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998) together with THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY (1963) threads this movie into an emotional and surprisingly humane movie about the essence of human and animal relationships, about fame and fiction and meaning. Except for the moderate irritation of the stretched plot points that detract from the rest of the emphasis on reality in an animated medium such as how does a hamster roll so fast as to catch up to a moving truck and such, this movie delivers strongly. 8/10."

","This film in my watchlist happened to be on Amazon Video on our brand new television set, so I decided to knock it out given its obscurity in the Disney animation canon. It isn't as appreciable as Meet The Robinsons from my experience, but then again, I did view this when I was feeling somewhat fatigued. While the story and writing are comprised of some things that aren't necessarily original, the animation is highly fluid (which surprised me, to be honest) and highly complements the assortment of action scenes, especially in the ""movie within a movie"" that is the Bolt series. Bolt himself is not just likable because of the cuteness factor exploited in the introduction; I appreciated his general steadfastness towards Penny, contributing to the movie's highly effective heart. Penny is especially relatable to the common child actress, who often develops bouts of negativity as their career continues, to the point that it affects their work. It was really painful (in a good, and I don't mean masochistic, way) to witness Bolt's recasting given the character and ""character within a character""'s relationship with movie and MWAM Penny. The other characters are generally less essential, but do contribute more to this movie's message of cooperation and perseverance that prove especially important to audiences involved in cinema. As I said, it isn't as original in execution as it is in concept compared to Meet The Robinsons, but it still shows that Disney had come a long way from Chicken Little even before the dawn of the Neo-Renaissance. If you appreciate dogs, movies within movies, or Disney, then I expect that this movie will please you. It's fine for most others as well."

","I enjoyed this slice of Disney fun. No songs which makes a nice change (although Disney do great music). Travolta does well..it seems he is a better actor behind a microphone than in front of a screen. The beginning of the film is cleverly done and hooks you instantly. Although the rest of the movie does not keep this pace and excitement, it is still a great buddy movie with lovable characters and a decent journey to follow. Bolt definitely shows off some significant leaps in animation with some nice effects on the animals and the environment. Not at Pixar's level of course, but still with a CG sheen that now defines the later Disney films. I particularly loved the pigeons throughout...the characteristics are spot on, as are the little nuances used in the animation. Brilliant."

","I love all of Disney's films, but Bolt is one that stands out from the rest. Upon seeing the trailer I was eager to see the film and I wasn't disappointed!<br/><br/>Bolt and his owner Penny are the stars of a popular TV show entitled 'Bolt', which is about a dog who gained incredible powers in order to protect his master. But there's one thing: the director of the show goes to great lengths in order to convince Bolt everything is real because 'If the dog believes it, the audience believes it'. Because of this, Bolt can't have a normal life and spend quality time with Penny, who is tired of her life and the fact that she isn't allowed to bring Bolt home after filming. Ratings for the show are failing as every storyline is the same and ends with Bolt saving Penny from the evil Dr Calico. To save the show from being cancelled, the director created a cliffhanger ending with Penny being kidnapped. Bolt is horrified and escapes his trailer to find Penny, but in the struggle, he ends up on the streets alone. Still believing Penny is in danger, he is determined to get back and seeks the help of streetwise kitty Mittens and Bolt's biggest fan, the hyperactive hamster Rhino. But as time goes on, Mittens makes Bolt realise he has been living in a fantasy world and shows him how to be a 'real' dog.<br/><br/>Personally, I love it. This is one of Disney's greatest films and I can watch it again and again without getting bored. I adore Rhino and if you do too, then you will love the animated short 'Rhino'.<br/><br/>I think Miley Cyrus as Penny was a serious case of miscasting, but she isn't in most of the film so I can forgive and forget.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a film to watch with the family, something to watch alone or to give to the little ones, then Bolt is a sure thing. The entire film is very feel good and you will love the perfectly fitting soundtrack."

Otherwise they cannot sense their environment anymore, even the sight is muted by the plastic material.

"Jodro2","3","4","12","8 January 2013"," Different movies bolted into one
","This is three entirely different movies bolted into one. The extended opening sequence shows Bolt as the superhero in a sci-fi TV action programme, with lots of shooting, explosions, creepy characters and military hardware, and is far too scary and aggressive for young children.<br/><br/>Then there's an extended Bolt-in-Hollywood section, with lots of nods to the adults, in which virtually everyone is cynical and extremely unsympathetic, while Bolt with his delusional pumped-up ego also was hard to warm to. The (in-)jokes simply weren't funny, and everything left such a sour taste in the mouth that I switched the movie off after 38 minutes... my two kids (10 and 7) didn't protest, which says something.<br/><br/>I later watched the rest alone to be able give this movie a fair review, and discovered the lengthy cute though also rather predictable middle section, which is suitable for younger kids, but probably would bore the over 10s. The end section is a kind of Frankenstein attempt to bolt all elements together, and in doing so tries to be all things to all people, and rather predictably failed. The movie is beautifully drawn, but the story simply does not hold together, and only the hamster provided some laughs.<br/><br/>Finally, is it just me or is an obsession with military hardware and uniforms and violence beginning to creep into all American children's' movies? The relentless exposure of kids (and adults) to military-style footage, costumes, weapons, communication, language, action, etc implicitly legitimises war. IMDb's Parents Guide section, with its endless lists of ""facts"" without providing any context, also has has become totally useless in warning us which kids' movies glorify the military and violence, and which don't. ""Arthur Christmas"" is another example: no warning whatsoever that Santa's exploits are presented like a military operation, complete with flak jackets and the lot."
"cashflow2","4","3","8","22 November 2008"," Good Entertainment - Not a blockbuster.
","As far as Disney titles go - this movie hits the mark with regard to pure entertainment value. The story moves along quickly and it was enough to keep my 4 year old's attention throughout. Parents should also find a few on screen gags that will keep them immersed in the film. Throw in a few explosions and some mild peril and it's also a winning combination for older kids too. The effects are good but not ground breaking - such as the slow motion ""Matrix"" type effects which have been overdone in so many movies nowadays. The animation itself is nothing new - same old same old as far as shape, texture and quality. Another area where I think it falters a bit is in the predictability of the story line. If you watch the trailer before going in to see this movie, you will be able to predict basically what will happen at the end. This is after all a Disney movie so to even imagine a less-than-happy ending is impossible. I would recommend this movie to others as a solid Disney adventure movie - a good way to pass an afternoon. Is it a ""must see""? Well, I saw it on it's opening weekend where the theater I went to (In a huge well populated mall on a Saturday afternoon) was about half full rather than being packed like I imagined it would have been for a Disney flick released right before Christmas."

","Now why do you take the 3 poster characters and add two only mid in the film? Because it had a really slow start.<br/><br/>The first 10 minutes we get one of the worst action spy flicks in history. Choppers (both) on standby, bionic superdog, a small kid with an attitude of all MI6, cheesiest villain in the world and much like that just happens. Then we get a crummy explanation that it's all a movie (which we knew from the start from ads and trailer so cut it down to 5 min) with ""plausible deniability"" candid camera for the dog alone. The audience (kids) can tell that Lassie is faking it? Better yet, explain how they change the scenery the size of a city, or how the dog can leap propeller blades. The entire ""a bad movie inside a movie"" doesn't work.<br/><br/>We get a sanity break with realist ""to the point"" Mindy, and the cats, and the look alike henchmen with the set crew, before Bolt gets extracted into the real world and we get the plot of the film (at about 25 min). After that it's the same old ""Travel coast to coast to find true love"" with a ""fight to be loved"" in the end. The montage music was too distracting to enjoy the montage itself.<br/><br/>Mittens improves the movie with animal street experience and intelligence. Rhino, the fan geek parody hamster, was a plus  we don't see these characters in big parts, so this was slightly original. But his ""I'm also 1/16 wolf and part wolverine somewhere"" made me ""If I had kids, they would ask how is that physically possible"". My favorite were the henchmen small speaking parts, they actually seamed more alive and with a life than the girl. And what's with the agent? How many pins did he put up over the series? How Bolt learned to talk and read before he learned what hunger was? Who paints the bolt on Bolt, because the bolt smears? The first bunch of pigeons are blind by pigeon standards and dumb to fly away from the cat. The second are even worse and annoying. I agree with the hamster on ""no aliens"" part.<br/><br/>Some compare this to The Truman Show. It's more like canceling the Truman project in the mid of film and giving Truman the boot. Plus Truman wanted to leave and we are left to wonder when he does. Bolt is just to predictable and the jokes about him and his actions are worn out.<br/><br/>So I gave a 3/10 because of Mindy, Mittens, Rhino and the henchmen. Would have been more if they didn't plummet for 10 minutes at the start. Hope the creators are smart enough to quit while they are ahead and not ever make a sequel."

Quite reminiscent of films like Ice Age and Finding Nemo, parents wont mind seeing this, in fact they might chuckle as much as the little ones.<br/><br/>Its about this dog (Bolt) that is made to believe he has super-powers in order to extract the best performance in a action-filled TV-show.

Along the way he encounters some seriously funny (albeit somewhat annoying) characters that help him in his quest, with becomes as much a tale of self-discovery.

"bob the moo","Null","2","5","9 March 2009"," An enjoyable family adventure
","Bolt and his owner Penny are superheroes, thank to a treatment from Penny's dad, Bolt has powers greater than your average dog and endlessly has to use them in big action sequences. Or at least, this is what he thinks. The reality is that none of it is real and it is just a TV show, with the facade kept up to ensure Bolt gives a great ""performance"" each week. Chance separates Bolt from Penny though and sees him accidentally shipped to the other side of North America. Once free from his packaging ""prison"", Bolt surmises that this is the work of his nemesis and sets out to locate and rescue Penny. The other animals he involves in his quest meanwhile, wonder how to break the news to him that he is, well, just a dog.<br/><br/>There is a downside associated with Pixar making so many good animated films and that is that the bar is raised so high that ""good"" films are judged harshly against criteria that they weren't really setting out to achieve. This happened to Bolt, although it fairness it doesn't help itself in the comparison stakes by essentially being the Buzz Lightyear part of the Toy Story films. It ended up being criticised for its lack of depth for adults and how the sentiment is just that, rather than emotion. This is perhaps unfair because Bolt came out in the same sort of year as Wall-E did, the latter film dominating all before it and rightly so.<br/><br/>What Bolt delivers is a plot that allows for comparatively simpler emotion that is just about enough for adults without being too much for children, the message is simple and it is delivered well. The majority of the film though is about comedy and action. It opens with a greatly inflated action sequence from one of the bolt TV episodes that shows good awareness of the action-movie genre and entertains as such. From here it goes the familiar path of self-realisation along Bolt road trip back to Hollywood and this aspect is perhaps not as complex or as engaging as it could have been but at least it is entertaining. Most of this comes from the side characters as Bolt himself drives the plot more than the laughs. The animation is impressive of course and the direction is good, again with its visual references to other things and also the delivery of shots that would not be possible in ""real"" action. I saw it in 2D so I can't comment on the 3D effects.<br/><br/>The voices are good although the stars don't really steal the show as they can do. Travolta isn't anything special but does the job as Bolt without bringing a lot to the character that isn't delivered by the animators. Cyrus is OK and gets to sing the song in the film as well. Essman and of course Walton are the real good turns though, mostly due to them having the better material  likewise the pigeons, who are all good characters. McDowell, Bader, Lipton and a few others add colour but have smaller roles.<br/><br/>Bolt is not Wall-E and in fairness it should not be judged by that yardstick. However, what it is is an enjoyable family film that delivers a good plot, great animation and regular laughs  and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that."
"mechachan15","9","2","5","30 December 2008"," Bolt is a movie that will surprise you!
","I had low expectations when I went to this movie in theatres. I knew vaguely what the plot was: A dog thinks he has superpowers but really doesn't and gains new friends. Don't get me wrong, I was excited to see this movie, I just wasn't expecting it to be so good. Right off the bat, the movie draws you in with an adorable sequence of Bolt as a puppy meeting his future owner, Penny, for the first time. Right after this scene, the movie gets a much darker tone for a couple minutes as Penny and Bolt find out her father has been kidnapped. A long scene follows where Penny and Bolt are racing to the airport to save her father from the bad guys. After this part of the movie, we find out the none of this is real and Bolt is the canine hero of a popular TV show. We find out that Bolt has been led to believe that everything that happens in his TV show is real. Meaning, Bolt would have superpowers and be fighting against a notorious supervillian. Through certain circumstances, Bolt believes that Penny has been kidnapped by the TV show's main villain. It's all fake of course and his owner wasn't really in danger at all, but poor Bolt is led to believe otherwise. Bolt accidentally gets sent thousands of miles from his home and must find a way to get home and save his owner. Along the way, Bolt gains new friends in a witty stray cat and a lovable geeky hamster. In the movie, Bolt finds that his powers are not real. Despite realizing that everything he has believed is a lie, Bolt knows he has to make it back to his owner. I won't give away the ending of this movie, but let's just say it's very touching.<br/><br/>Bolt has amazing music and animation. In some scenes of the movie, you could swear your watching something in real life( for instance, the first scene that shows clouds). Disney knew precisely what they were doing when they made this movie. This movie shows that, while superpowers are awesome, they don't make a hero.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie twice in theaters so far. I would recommend at least seeing it once on the big screen. You may want to explain the movie a little bit to children, as certain things can be hard to grasp for little kids.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie 9/10 for amazing score, animation, and story."

","I really do have a problem with movies, that try to be SO clever, when in fact they are not. I won't spoiler anything big, I'll only talk about the beginning of the movie, but I still wanted to warn people who are not ready to read anything about the movie, before they go watch it or rent it.<br/><br/>The problem here is, that while we get treated to an action movie, without apparent cuts, without any obvious special effects (yes I know it's animated), the fact that the first couple of minutes are a movie within a movie is a big cheat. Not because you might get fooled to think that is the actual movie, before they pull the rug under your feet (there are other movies, who had these beginnings too), but because everything that happens there just couldn't happen.<br/><br/>I know it's animated, so in fact it couldn't happen either way and then it's a movie, so it isn't real by definition. But still the main Dog (Bolt) does stunts, that he isn't able to do. Leaps/jumps as if gravity didn't exist, just to have a problem jumping in the ""real world"" ... I can't laugh about that, because it ain't funny to me, because in the end, he couldn't jump that far in the first place.<br/><br/>So everything that gets build up in the first minutes is a big cheat, which doesn't work and therefor isn't funny in the progress of the movie, when all the ""superpowers"" get smashed (even the stunt driver explanation doesn't work and don't get me started on ""where do they put their cameras? Everywhere? With a focus on everything?) Again, that might seem short sighted for some, but I couldn't enjoy the movie as much as I would have loved to (and the Hamster is really mostly funny, plus a ""nice"" cat). The flow of the movie isn't right, if things get established ... but actually aren't established, because they are lies/cheats. If you can overlook that, you might enjoy the movie more than me (I still gave it 4/10, because it has it's moments, that aren't inspired by some false predicament in the beginning)"

","I liked parts of Bolt, but it has so many flaws and logic inconsistencies that I eventually had to shelve a 'normal' review and remind myself that 'it's just a kid's movie'. Funnily enough I never have to do that with Pixar films.<br/><br/>Bolt (John Travolta) is a scrappy little white superdog with a spunky little 12 year old tomboy owner named Penny (Miley Cyrus). They adore each other and spend each day saving both each other and society Only they aren't. It's all merely a top rating TV show in which everyone is in on the ruse except Bolt himself – he is apparently a better actor when he believes it is real. At the conclusion of each day saving the planet Penny takes Bolt to his trailer, gives him some food and a hug, and leaves until next time. There is no offscreen cavorting or playtime. (Which if you think about it is especially cruel once you realise why.) Bolt is frankly amazed one day to find that he does not actually have a superbark, laser eyes or the ability to leap dozens of metres. This unfortunate day happens when he is accidentally posted across the country from Hollywood to New York, immediately deciding he has to get back to LA as Penny is no doubt worried and susceptible to evil without his protection.<br/><br/>Now without effects, hidden stunt wranglers and choreographers Bolt is merely a little dawg, even his distinctive bolt shaped marking on his fur proves false. He cannot do anything super or extraordinary, and pain is now very real. What he can do is talk – but of course – which enables him to converse with a scrawny streetwise alley cat named Mittens, who Bolt bullies into providing him with assistance in getting cross country.<br/><br/>Along the way they meet a hamster named Rhino, who is not only aware of Bolt's TV identity, but who considers himself Bolt's biggest superfan. He tags along to form a trio of furry fun, only he never leaves his exercise bubble along the journey, a cross country trip that was never destined to go smoothly.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in Hollywood Penny has already realised her buddy is lost and is desperately trying to track him down even as the TV studio exhorts her to move on and find another dog to play the role the show really must go on with or without Bolt.<br/><br/>Bolt has a couple of reasonable action sequences – most notably the opening few minutes before the audience is let in on the facts – and a few reasonable jokes, mainly from Rhino the deluded hamster.<br/><br/>I found Travolta a strange choice as Bolt the dog, I know he boasts 'star power' but is that really a determining factor when the audience is always going to be predominantly children? Miley Cyrus is a similar 'name' choice, but at least she sounds like a young girl.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 5 / 10. Ultimately Bolt never proves itself as anything more than a kid pleaser, and even then it is bettered by many other films. The opening sequence grabs you and Mittens and Rhino are reasonable kid's flick characters, but Bolt collapses under its own lack of logic.<br/><br/>Put another way my 4 year old gets to watch a movie per week in 30-40 minute installments. He has seen maybe 10 films including Bolt. He continually asks for Nemo and Toy Story again and again. Bolt hasn't been mentioned since first viewing furthermore I don't plan to offer it up as an option."

","Sadly, having just seen the film it's been proved to me that for the most part, the nomination process for the Best Animated Feature Oscar pretty much is limited to the films that get the most promotion and make the most money. Therefore, those who nominate the films will bother to sit down and watch it, and since it's the one they remember at least hearing about, BAM! It gets nominated.<br/><br/>About an hour into the film, I found myself just checking the DVD timer to see how much longer the thing was going to run. The story was OK, but all in all it wasn't holding my interest, and the hamster character was being shoved down our throats in an over-the-top ""Hey! He's cute and manic and therefore, he must be funny!"" way. John Travolta and Miley Cyrus didn't seem to be clicking for the main voices either, they were just rather ordinary. Malcolm McDowell was hammy but for that particular character, it worked. Susie Essman was the only voice actor who seemed to try to give her character, Mittens, a real soul that transcended just being a ""cartoon voice"".<br/><br/>Fortunately, the last 20-25 minutes got more interesting, with the fake-out of Penny supposedly falling in love with the ""new"" Bolt, plus the rather dramatic pacing of the climactic fire and rescue. For this, to go the Siskel and Ebert route, the film overall gets a ""thumbs up"". However, I can't see ""Bolt"" being all that remembered and revered years from now. The Disney films from the last decade that people almost never recall immediately are such ones as ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" and ""Hercules"". In 2019, ""Bolt"" will likely be parallel."
"Koosh_King01","Null","2","6","23 March 2009"," Shallow and predictable
","Bolt is proof that not everything Pixar produces is gold. On paper the idea behind the plot is okay. But...well, here's what I didn't like about it: The whole idea that Bolt never, ever noticed the film crew, or that all of the show's effects were on-set, is just dumb and unbelievable. Probably they did this to avoid making Bolt look stupid, but it just makes him even dumber for never noticing - for instance in the scene where he holds the car off the bridge; they could do that in no other fashion than with wires, especially with the actor inside, and for Bolt to not notice them or notice whatever is really holding the car up, is ludicrous; how did the crew even set that scene up? Did Bolt really carry the car with the guy inside it all the way across town to the bridge?. A ready-made excuse for him to notice the film crew but still not know it's a TV show would've been to have him believe they're a documentary crew always following him around.<br/><br/>The human adults (excluding the actors playing Dr. Calico et al and Penny's mom) are all such obnoxious jerks. I hated this. The snobby director, the cold TV executive, the annoying ""hip"" assistant? They're all such a bunch of slimy creeps and stereotypes. Usually Pixar is above this. They make the TV executive mildly likable, but just when I thought the assistant was going to redeem himself by showing some concern for Penny, he reverts back to his old self just so we can have some (unneeded) comedy with Penny's mom throwing him out of the ambulance, and, ultimately, so Penny can take the moral high ground and quit. A better ending would've been Bolt continuing to do the show but also be a regular dog in his time off.<br/><br/>The only likable humans were the animal shelter guards. They were hilarious (""Spicy eyes!"" indeed). And they disappear from the film as soon as they're introduced.<br/><br/>Ultimately I think the movie would've been better off if they'd just done the entire movie like the opening sequence. Maybe downplay the absurdity of it all to make Bolt less powerful, and Dr. Calico and his henchmen more of a genuine threat, and just do a plot where Penny is kidnapped for real and Bolt's weakness IS actually styrofoam and, de-powered, he has to enlist the help of Mittens and Rhino to rescue Penny and her parents from Calico and save the day without his powers. The same as the actual movie only he would've really had powers to begin with, and there'd be less pretentious moral posturing. Instead Pixar basically decided to do a retread of Buzz Lightyear's character arc from Toy Story, but with a dog.<br/><br/>Of course, had they done it that way, people would've accused them of ""doing The Incredibles with a dog,"" so I guess Bolt just can't win.<br/><br/>So what is there to like? It has its moments. As mentioned, the guards at the animal shelter were a riot, and so was Rhino most of the time. Mittens had her moments, too. And even though he has perilously little screen time, Dr. Calico was a hoot as well and so were his two cats. So basically all of the little details worked, but the big, main story involving Bolt and Penny was clichéd and above all else was just dull and uninteresting."

","Bolt is another animated hit from Disney and features a dog, a cat, a hamster, and a sweet-hearted young actress. This feature is about a loyal young dog who uses his super powers to protect his owner from the forces of the evil green-eyed man. However, early in the film, the audience finds out that the poor pup is being tricked into believing he has super powers by the movie studio so that his acting will be more realistic for their hit action show. It takes an unlikely pair in a cynical alley cat and an obnoxious hamster to help him realize his value as a regular dog. The animation is quite good, but the 3D doesn't add much in my opinion. The CGI is plenty good by itself with its crisp and clean realism and its bright colors and lighting. John Travolta, Miley Cyrus, Susie Essman, and Mark Walton's voices are perfect for the characters, especially Essman's as Mittens, the cat. The soundtrack is good, but too much attention is being paid to ""I Thought I Lost You"" by Travolta and Cyrus, which was recently nominated for a Golden Globe. Instead, one of the highlights of the movie is when Jenny Lewis's ""Barking At The Moon"" plays during an especially sentimental sequence. Adults and kids alike should get good value from this film."
"dvc5159","6","2","6","7 December 2008"," Disney learns from its past mistakes. Great!
","Yes, it has seems that the comeback of good-quality family movies from Disney is near. Having learned their mistakes from duds such as Underdog and The Shaggy Dog, Disney presents to you ANOTHER dog movie... but wait! This is a whole lot different and better in every aspect. Taking a new premise with a predictable story is no surprise, but the filmmakers add heart and soul to it, thus making it another Disney classic.<br/><br/>Take the characters for instance. Their designs and voices are so convincing to the audience; it makes them cute and lovable as ever, and makes you just want to hug them. Travolta adds likability to the title role, and surprisingly, so does Miley Cyrus as Bolt's owner/co-star Penny. Susie Essman adds wit to her feline character and that hamster is just very funny.<br/><br/>The cinematography is great, the special effects a treat for the eyes, and the music score by John Powell is rousing. (Coincidentally, during Bolt's ""mission"" in the beginning, Powell's score contains shades of his Bourne scores).<br/><br/>Overall, a pleasant surprise from Disney and definitely a step up. A must watch in the cinema for a fun and great time with the family and friends.<br/><br/>Overall: 8/10"
"Contra-2","8","2","6","29 November 2008"," Strong outing from Disney - voices a bit weak
","Overall I thought Bolt came together very well, hitting all the notes of humour, action and some genuinely poignant moments. The only area which I found a bit weak were the two voice leads, Travolta and Cyrus depend far too much on their physical personas in their acting to convincingly inhabit their characters, frankly they are a bit boring.<br/><br/>The exception was Mark Walton as the hamster Rhino. Who is this guy? He nailed his part, and obviously had a lot of fun with it, a very impressive performance.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, this movie was much better than the trailers suggested. Or perhaps it is because the trailer itself didn't try to include all of the ""best bits"" of the movie, like so many do. Not a bad idea to tone down the trailer a bit so that the audience can still be surprised by the originality and spunk of the script."
"keiichi73","8","2","6","22 November 2008"," Skip Madagascar 2, this is the one to take the kids to
","In Bolt, a small American White Shepherd dog has amazing adventures, not realizing that none of it is real. The little guy (whose voice is provided by John Travolta) is actually the star of a highly rated action show for kids, but the show's director is a believer of method acting, and wants the dog to think the things that happen to him on the show are real to get a more natural performance from him. On the show, Bolt the dog travels with his young human owner, Penny (Miley Cyrus), cross country searching for Penny's father, a scientist who has been kidnapped by the diabolical madman, Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell). Bolt has been genetically enhanced to have super canine abilities (actually special effects that are performed right there on the set), and uses those abilities to battle Calico's forces.<br/><br/>The concept of an actor on a TV show living in a make believe world, and not realizing his every move is being filmed by hidden cameras reminded me greatly of the Jim Carrey drama from 10 years ago, The Truman Show, and made me wonder if this was going to be another look at the same idea aimed at a much younger audience. The movie drops this idea fairly early on, and turns into a standard road trip comedy, but I wasn't disappointed. The film has plenty of wit, charm, and heart to go around. Bolt is forced to hit the road when he believes Penny is in danger. The most recent episode ends with a cliffhanger where the girl has been kidnapped by Calico. After the shoot, Bolt is sent to his private trailer as always, but believing that Penny has actually been kidnapped, he breaks free and ends up accidentally inside a shipping box which is sent to New York City. In his strange real world surroundings, Bolt initially doesn't understand why his ""powers"" don't work like they usually do. He's still determined to track down Penny, even in his supposed weakened state, and forcefully brings an alley cat he finds named Mittens (Susie Essman, wonderful here) along for the ride, believing that she has ties to the evil Dr. Calico and can tell him where his human is.<br/><br/>The relationship between the delusional dog and the street wise, sarcastic cat is at the heart of Bolt, and also what makes the film work above all else. I loved the way that Mittens the cat begins to train him in the art of being a real dog. Bolt has been living a fantasy his entire life, and has never even experienced the joy of playing with a chew toy or sticking his head out an open window with his tongue flapping in the breeze. With so many animated films forcing the idea that animals are just like us, only with fur, here is a movie about a dog who learns to enjoy the simplicity of a natural life. I liked that angle, and I liked the way that Mittens slowly warms up to Bolt's situation. She's a cat with a past, as she used to belong to some people who were forced to abandon her when they moved. She doesn't understand Bolt's devotion to Penny, as she believes humans can only hurt. The spot on vocal performances by Travolta and Essman add a lot of the heart the character's hold.<br/><br/>Also along for the trip is a pudgy little hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton), who is familiar with Bolt through watching his adventures on the ""magic box"" from his cage. He's mainly there to provide comic relief, and though kids will likely enjoy him, I found him a little grating. Fortunately, the movie never allows him to distract from what works. I was surprised by how sympathetic Bolt is, and how much I ended up caring for the characters. Even young Penny gets some effective moments. The preteen actress has always felt bad about having to lie to the little dog, and make him think their adventures were real. When he runs away, she feels responsible. As mentioned earlier, Penny is voiced by pop singing sensation and actress, Miley Cyrus, and this movie hints that she may have a future after the Hannah Montana fad comes to an end. <br/><br/>The film is wonderful to look at, too. The visual style is bright and vibrant, and the character designs carry a lot of personality. When we see Bolt as a puppy at the very beginning of the film, playing with a toy, it's filled with much more character and emotion than any of the live human actors can muster in this weekend's other big release, Twilight. I also greatly admired the attention to detail in many of the film's settings. There's a brief montage where the three traveling animals visit different landmarks as they make their way cross country, and a shot of them watching the famous ""water show"" outside the Belagio hotel in Las Vegas looked like the real thing. This movie makes even the well animated Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa pale in comparison. The fact that this movie has some actual soul and heart behind it, unlike that mediocre cash-in sequel, certainly helps.<br/><br/>Over the years, the Disney studio has been trying to catch up to the works of Pixar with some of their own in-house computer animated films, and the results have up to now been middling. (Does anyone really remember Chicken Little or Meet the Robinsons?) Bolt is by far their best effort to try to capture the tone of a Pixar film, and while the film takes a few wrong steps (mainly with its unfunny comic relief character), it's definitely the closest they've come to their league. Bolt proves you don't always need original ideas as long as you have a lot of genuine emotion and likable characters on your side."
"camwilcox","8","1","2","15 April 2020"," Underrated adventure film.
","Bolt is a super dog that works with their owner ""penny"" to save her father from the EVIL DR. Calico.<br/><br/>No, in fact bolt is a fairly average dog who's whole life was raised in a movie set, internally he thinks he's a super strong dog but he's really not. One day he escapes from supposed movie set, and has to adapt to being a normal dog while meeting a few friends that teach him the ways of being a normal dog, all the while bolt is still trying to get back to his owner.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't have a villain which is vital for most movies to carry the story, and despite being released in 2008 it still holds up, the good parts overrule the bad parts though, I think this movie is the best dog/cat movie I've ever seen, it includes tropes from movies like ""the matrix"" in the film That are used on the movie set bolts in, and the idea that bolt believes that he's in this fantasy, action world is really interesting, and is totally unprepared when he has to come clean about who he truly is.<br/><br/>Eventhough this movie has got a mediocre response from critics, the concept behind the film is really cool, however having bad bits (especially the dialogue) I think it was a decent movie, and if I was the director, I wouldn't be so disappointed."
"metalrage666","5","1","2","24 January 2020"," It was ok. Decent animation, Ok story.
","I never saw Bolt at the cinema and at the rate they're churning out these animated movies there's no way you pay to see them all, so I generally wait for these to be shown on TV. On watching Bolt, I felt that this was very similar to most modern animated movies of the last 20-25 years, the story is ok, the humour at times feels forced and cliched, but almost none of these movies are timeless, no matter how many Hollywood A-listers they rope in to do the voces.
I admit that Bolt did hold my interest right up to the end, so that's a win for me and I did like the idea of The Truman Show-esque feel where Bolt really believes he has superpowers and is not just the star of an action series and the whole Lassie Come Home middle section where Bolt is separated from his ""human"" and traverses the country to get back to Penny has funny parts but it's not Toy Story or Monsters Inc funny. It's easy to see why kids would love this and would want a Bolt of their own, I mean seriously, who doesn't love a cute dog and who wouldn't want to see a loyal pet reunited with its owner?
The pigeons were the funniest characters in this. With them only having bit-roles, similar to the Penguins from Madagascar, they didn't become boring.
Overall I'm glad I didn't pay to see this, but it's worth seeing.
P.S, please don't put your hamsters in those ridiculous plastic balls as seen in this movie, it's unnatural and it terrifies them."

"BoydudeReviews","8","1","2","17 November 2018"," An energetic, heart-warming animated film.
","This film, in my opinian is possibly the beginning of the Disney Revival era. The story and characters felt like how old disney was before it went down hill in the 2000's. All they did was make direct to sequals to classics and made very boring, uninteresting films, with the exception of Lilo and Stitch. But then this film came out and I was blowb away. I didn't see mucb of the trailers back when I was 11. So when i got the DVD for christmas, I didn't know what to expect and I loved it. I have watched this film so many times. And even as a 21 year old adult, I still think it holds up. The animation is really good, the characters are amazing, but it is the voice acting that really shine's. John Travolta as Bolt was an amazing casting decision and tbw other voice actors. My only critisim is that, while she can act very well in this film, Miley Cyrus's voice is so recognisable that it is a little disstractinf, but it is still ok. I would say the climax is the best part of the film. I 100% recommended tbis film. Ever since John Lasseter became involved with Walt Disney Animation, his influence have really helped the studio create better movies, which would result in the disney revivil era. 😁👍🏾"

"nmholland","8","1","2","22 May 2016"," An Exceptional Animated Film by Disney
","Bolt is directed by Byron Howard and Chris Williams and is the very original story of a dog that regularly stars in an action/adventure television show. Despite it being a fictional television show, Bolt, the dog, believes in every second of it. When he mistakenly gets shipped from Hollywood to New York, Bolt must, with the help of new companions Mittens the alley cat and Rhino the small hamster, get back to Penny in order to save her from the threat that he wholeheartedly believes is real.<br/><br/>Bolt is, as far as animated films go, one of the most underrated films ever created. With its combined amazing voice acting, animation, and very clever writing, Bolt is a great film, with a lot of style and substance. Coming from Disney in a dark streak of theirs, Bolt didn't have any expectations from me, yet it impressed me on every level. The low amount of recognition Bolt gets is unacceptable, because it is a substantial film.<br/><br/>The voice acting is what really elevated Bolt to the next level. The talent of John Travolta, Susie Essman, and Mark Walton add for a great team littered throughout the film. John Travolta pulls off the brave, big hearted Bolt with a passion that live action actors can't usually bring to an animated movie. Both Susie Essman and Mark Walton as supporting characters Mittens and Rhino back up the lead role with a large amount of vigor, and play their characters considerably.<br/><br/>The animation is top notch for the standards held these days, and impressed me greatly. The animators smartly knew to blur the background while giving the foreground much detail, which, overall, made the characters pop like a bubble. Each and every character stood out, be it Bolt, the superdog, or Penny, his ""human."" Although the background was blurred, like mentioned above, it doesn't look cheap. None of the animation looks rushed, and it all looks very clean.<br/><br/>My main issue lies with some conveniences thrown into the plot. Despite Bolt's target audience being smaller children, it was obviously directed somewhat to an older age as well, proved by its tear inducing moments cluttered throughout the movie. At certain times in the plot, the characters may be in a place in which the writers didn't seem to have a plan to get out of, yet, soon enough, a large factor in the film will suddenly purpose itself, and everything will work out for our heroes. Although this issue isn't that prominent, it really bothered me, and took enjoyment away from film altogether.<br/><br/>The clever writing in Bolt impressed my on a very large scale. Almost all of the dialogue, particularly between the characters of Bolt and Mittens, is absolutely flawless, with great banter and sly exposition thrown in the middle of it all. Once thing going for this is the difference between their species, a dog and a cat. Their characters' contrast added for a great relationship between the two of them; a relationship the entire audience can relate to.<br/><br/>Another minor issue I found in Bolt was the slow exposition. Due to the extravagant plot, the film takes its time to set up for the adventure that's about to come. Once the adventure kicks into gear, the film begins to move very quickly, but the exposition seems to drag on just a tad too long. If the script would've removed a few unnecessary characters, namely a pair of annoying cats, then the first fifteen minutes (or so) may have moved faster.<br/><br/>The last thing I have to mention about Bolt is the fantastic score. The musical score, composed by John Powell, is absolutely golden. Every single minute that any sort of action was taking place, the score was pounding, demanding that the audience sit on the edge of their seats. The viewer already cared about the characters, and their goals, but with the astounding score booming from the speakers, the audience begins to care all that much more about everything that's taking place in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Bolt is one of the best animated films that Disney has made in a long time. Pretty much anyone will relate to, and enjoy, this excellent movie."

","After the very good Meet the Robinsons, I tried not to have too much high expectations for Bolt, as two good ones in a role for Disney animated movies in the 2000s were rare. However, after watching it, I was also pleasantly surprised! It's an interesting story about Bolt, an American white shepherd, who is the star of a fictional TV show, but has lived his whole life on the set and believes he really has superpowers. When separated from the studio by accident and believing his co-star, Penny, really got captured, he sets off on a journey to rescue her. Along the way, he meets Mittens the Cat and Rhino the Hamster and learns the truth about himself.<br/><br/>This movie started very heavily on the sci-fi stuff and seemed like a copycat of the motion picture, The Truman Show. In addition, some of the characters including the movie agent and the studio manager acted too superficial. However, what ultimately resulted was more than just typical Hollywood superfluous stuff and cliché action heroes; there were actual meaningful adventures and drama, from Bolt lost in the city when trying to find Penny to him learning the truth about himself and life in general. I've also found that the character Mittens was witty and humorous, especially when she appeared oblivious when Bolt actually thought she was partly responsible for Penny's disappearance. The growing friendship and teamwork that the animal characters eventually formed were also meaningful and gave the movie heart.<br/><br/>The CGI animation is colorful and detailed (I especially liked the various cities), and the direction is well-paced - it makes you eager to find out how everything will unfold at the end. Like Meet the Robinsons, it's one of the better Disney animated films from the 2000s.<br/><br/>Grade B"

Bolt, even though adorable, is the least funny one of the cast, probably because he's such a straight face hero. I won't rob him of his glory though, because we want him exactly like that, he's driving the whole film.

The funniest parts tend to be with the funniest character.Solid film for all and one of the best by Disney but still little below my all time favorite Toy Story!"

","I Actually saw this movie on Starz on demand In 2010. I loved it back then, and now have a strong interest in it. I then bought it and re- watched it. Here's my N and P. <br/><br/>Negatives: if you were a 9 year old kid watching this, and you didn't give two craps about what the adults are talking about, like, (agents, Television show making, etc.) then you would find the movie VERY boring. While he's funny, Rhino the hamster was a pointless character. <br/><br/>Positives: Amazing animation, Great voice actors, humor is good, the plot is very oringal, Very entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall, The movie is VERY good. But with few tweaks here and there. 9.0."

","It isn't often that Disney make a computer animated film without the help of Pixar, only example I can think of is Dinosaur, but there came this one with an intriguing sounding story. Basically Penny (Miley Cyrus) is the girl with her American White Shepherd dog Bolt (John Travolta), who has many superpowers to defeat all the villains of the city, only thing is, it's not real. Bolt has been raised in a television studio as the star of the show, and he has been made to believe everything he does on the show, powers, villains, etc, is real. So on one episode, a two parter, Penny appears to be kidnapped by the henchmen of Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell), and Bolt thinking this is reality makes his escape and accidentally winds up outside of Hollywood, to New York City. Looking for and trying to ""rescue"" Penny, he meets alley cat Mittens (Susie Essman), cats to him are the enemy, and she plays along with his delusion until he can work out the truth and find his owner. In their journey and a few adventures they also wind up meeting and being joined by Bolt enthusiast hamster in a ball Rhino (Mark Walton), who also believes everything he does is real, and Bolt thinks he is some kind of all-knowing creature. Meanwhile, Penny, who earlier was sad she couldn't spend a day with Bolt as a regular dog, is upset that her confused Bolt is missing, but the studio urges her to let go and find a lookalike to continue the show. So after a number of adventures, travelling to Las Vegas, and discovering regular dog activities, such as hunger and fetching sticks, Bolt does eventually work out that he is not a super powerful dog, after being saved by Rhino. Another adventure or two, and the three animal friends do reach the studio, but Bolt is saddened to see Penny getting close to a lookalike dog, not realising she is just acting, it is only when a fire breaks out and Mittens convinces him of the true feelings that he can go back for her. In the end, after rescuing her from the fire, Bolt and Penny finally reunite as a regular girl and her dog to have a regular fun life together, with Mittens and Rhino joining as well. Also starring James Lipton as The Director, Greg Germann as The Agent, Diedrich Bader as Veteran Cat, Nick Swardson as Blake and J.P. Manoux as Tom. It is good that the critics mention the connection of The Truman Show with this, is is pretty much the same concept, just with a superhero theme, Travolta makes a good voice for the canine hero, Cyrus, annoying as she can be in real life, does the female character voice quite well, Essman is quite good as the sarcastic cat, and Walton steals many moments as the hyper fan hamster. The animation is fantastic for the story, it is heartwarming and really quite funny in many moments, and most of the scenes of action are exciting, a really watchable action comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Animated Feature Film and Best Original Song for Miley Cyrus and Jeffrey Steele's ""I Thought I Lost You"". Very good!"
"leannetjuh","8","1","2","1 March 2011"," I was pleasantly surprised
","At first, I didn't feel like watching this movie. It seemed childish, a story about a superdog that gets lost from its owner. But after watching the trailer I came to see otherwise.<br/><br/>I loved it. Especially because of the sarcastic cat named Mittens. It gave the movie that extra touch to make it great. I was touched by Mittens past and how she wanted to take care of Bolt, and then got rejected. I didn't expect that sort of emotional depth in the movie, but there it was.<br/><br/>Bolt may appear like a kids movie about a silly dog, tricked into believing he has superpowers, but it's much more than that. The dramatic hamster Rhino and the sarcastic Mittens make the picture complete.<br/><br/>Their interaction is simply hilarious. And of course, the animation is flawless. The ending is as you'd expect, but I wouldn't want it any other way. Must-see for kids, and adults whom enjoy animated movies."

","What do you get when you take a directionally-confused company, give it to John Lasseter for the breath of life, go 3D and merge The Truman Show, The Incredibles and Dr. Doolittle into a nice package? You get Bolt, a surprisingly-entertaining movie that may have very well removed Disney Animation Studios from life-support and brought them back to centre stage.<br/><br/>John Travolta voices Bolt, a dog who acts as a superhero and constantly rescues his owner, Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus, go figure,) in an over-the-top action show that both makes fun of and puts to shame Michael Bay. The only problem? He thinks it's all real. So when Penny is ""kidnapped"" one day by the green-eyed man, Bolt-thinking she's in trouble-dashes out of his trailer and decides to search the country for her. Along the way, he meets up with a black cat named Mittens (Susie Essman,) whom he believes is in league with Penny's kidnapper, and an obsessed fan/hamster, named Rhino (Mark Walton,) in a comedy that teaches people about the dangers of blurring fiction with reality.<br/><br/>In terms of the movie itself, this is Disney at its finest: you have the comedic relief (i.e. Rhino,) the intricate subplots-Penny's relationship with Bolt, the corporate hold on both Penny and Bolt-the running gags-the pigeons standing next to billboards with his face on them and still not knowing who Bolt is, Bolt attempting to use his superpowers and failing-and the crisp-clear animation, which converts surprisingly well to 3D. Adding to the excellence of this movie is Lasseter's supervision, especially since you can't go wrong with a guy that made talking toys, talking insects and monsters in your closet work so well in practice. Despite Bolt not being up to par with the typical Pixar film, it's nice to know that the legend himself has added a few ""Pixaresque"" moments to an otherwise standard Disney venture.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very fun and enjoyable film. Despite the disappointment of this movie not being as funny as I would've liked it to have been, it certainly had enough humour that I found myself laughing in places I never thought I would've when I sat down to watch it. Additionally, the voice-acting was top notch (no surprise there,) and it's a relief to know that Miss Hannah Montana is actually in a role for a change that WON'T make you cringe in irritation. I also liked how well the movie transitioned from its ""action sequences"" to its real-life sequences, as it showed just how much care Disney put into making the audience truly believe that there was a show within a show. If that's not proof that animated movies can have just as much heart as live-action films, I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is a must-see for Disney fans, animation fans and just movie fans in general. Disney gets a lot of sh*t for making cheap and emotionally-draining movies these days, but Bolt has actually paved the way for a revival of Disney Animation Studios and shown that not all hope is lost, especially given the two movies that the studio released following this one. Bolt has action galore, suspense, humour and-most-importantly-heart. It's not the best thing to ever come from the company, but I'll be damned if it isn't the start of Disney's slow redemption.<br/><br/>Final Score: 8/10."

"neil-476","7","1","2","11 February 2009"," Good but not great
","This CGI animated movie from Disney/Pixar (under John Lasseter's aegis within the new arrangements, but not actually initiated by Pixar) illustrates how far CGI has come. Character design, backgrounds, and animation are all of a standard which would have been drooled over a few short years ago - now they are simply taken for granted.<br/><br/>The story concerns the efforts of Bolt (a dog who stars on TV as a superhero, and believes that his TV show is real) to travel across the USA in order to be reunited with Penny, his human. His companions are Mittens, a cat with a jaundiced attitude, and Rhino, a hamster (complete with transparent ball) who has had a great deal of exposure to TV.<br/><br/>The movie is good, though it should be noted that there may not be quite as much for adults as there often is in these movies.<br/><br/>Of more interest is the 3D. Technically, it is perfect - there is no ghosting across of right eye image to left eye or vice versa - each image is absolutely discretely delivered to its own eye. I'm pleased to report that the film is not filled with things being jabbed into the camera constantly - sure, it happens once or twice, but not enough to distract - instead, the 3D is for the most part simply quite natural. In fact, the thing which impressed me most was Rhino's globe - the distortion of the background through the plastic makes the globe the most believable thing in screen in the entire film.<br/><br/>And I suppose, in five years' time, we'll be taking the quality of the 3D for granted, too."
"RainDogJr","Null","1","2","22 January 2009"," Hollywood dog
","A Californian dog will learn to be like a normal dog in this film, a family Disney film that I saw with some familiars yesterday. I wasn't aware of the fact that Bolt is presented in 3-D then was a surprise to find that at my local cinema Bolt is been screened only in 3-D, certainly more expensive but Bolt absolutely worth the money. Passed like 2 or 3 years to see another movie in 3-D since the last time was when I saw the re-release of The Nightmare Before Christmas. Was curious the fact that yesterday I saw, for the very first time, the trailer of the up-coming Henry Selick movie Coraline but anyway, the name of the mentioned Californian dog is Bolt, nice white dog, Bolt is more specifically from Hollywood, he is the star of a TV show and not only his world is only the Hollywood studio but also he believes he has all the powers and enemies from the TV show. So Bolt is not really a dog actor, in the TV show his enemy is Dr. Calico who has two cats that does know they are part of a TV show so the basic stuff is funny, the two cats, one white and another black, have some fun. In the TV show the happy ending is always there, Bolt always saves the day, he always saves Penny and since Bolt really believes he has powers and stuff the filming goes always as planned. What happens when the ending is not happy? Bolt is worried, for him Penny is in real danger, he will be out of the studio, he will see the world. Is a great thing the character Rhino since with him now we have in Bolt a character that believes that he has all the powers and stuff of the character that he plays in the TV show and in Rhino a character that believes that the TV show is real. So Bolt will learn to be like a normal dog, certainly he never acted. The film has a message, is very entertaining, looks really nice, has those hilarious pigeons, I liked it, really liked it."
"boltygirl","10","1","2","21 January 2009"," best CGI movie i've ever seen...
","I really miss the classic 2D animated movies, but Bolt is without a doubt the best CGI movie I have ever seen. I did enjoy some other well done CGI movies like Finding Nemo, but none have ever really intrigued me as much as Bolt did.<br/><br/>When I first watched the trailer, I have to say I wasn't totally excited to see it. After hearing a lot of great things about it though, I decided I should give it a chance, and I am SOOOOO glad I did.<br/><br/>Being a teenager who doesn't find any interest in doing the typical things teenagers do, I am trying to be a kid for as long as I can and great animated movies like Bolt really help because it enabled me to feel the things I felt when I watched great movies like The Lion King. I laughed, I cried, and I wish more people would have seen this instead of Wall-E, which I did enjoy but I have no desire to see it again (I personally prefer the animated movies with talking animals because that would be a dream come true for me). There hasn't been many CGI movies with talking animals, which is probably why I still like to repeatedly watch the classics like Bambi, Lady and the Tramp, The Fox and the Hound, Oliver and Company, The Lion King, etc. I can watch Bolt over and over again, and never get tired of it. Bolt, Mittens, and Rhino are SO easy to love and are all awesome characters; every minute of this movie is pure entertainment. If more CGI films like Bolt come out in the future, I certainly won't hesitate to see them."
"himsa-1","8","1","2","15 January 2009"," A very good animated movie
","First of all I must admit that I don't like to watch animated movies. I saw this movie because my friend gave me the CD. I didn't watch the movie for about 4 days but after that I was getting bored and I had nothing to do at home so I decided to see the movie. When I saw the first 5 minutes of the movie I was amazed that an animated movie can be this exiting. Action sequence that came in first 5 minutes of the movie they were brilliant. But when the scene ended with the super bark of BOLT I felt O Yeah this is another animated film where super dog will save the master from the evil every time she is in danger. But it wasn't like another child film. Then story twisted and we realize that the dog thinks situation is real but it is not real and he is a part of action show where he was made to think that situation is real. This I must admit was unpredictable. Now situation changes and he realizes that he is not a super dog and than he goes through the situations and then it's a happy ending. I must admit that I had not expected this movie to be as good as it is. This movie is fun. Story was brilliant. (Thank god it was not a routine animated film about a super dog). The story had unpredicted twists and turns. It also had humor which was very light and something that was worth of laughing at. Especially the Rhino was fantastic with some of his punch lines. Pigeons were also great when they came on the screen. I also liked the character of Mittens; the cat. The cast of voices is very good featuring John Travolta as Bolt, Miley Cyrus as Penny, Susie Essman as Mittens and Mark Walton as Rhino. Animation was also good that you expect from Walt Disney pictures. This movie will won hearts of the children but adults will spend a really good time too. So overall this movie is pretty enjoyable and fun. Just watch this movie and you will be entertained for hour and a half. Now I will hope to see many more animated movies. Thanks BOLT My Rating  8/10"

","Bolt is a star. He's an actor playing a superhero dog in a series in which he and his owner, a little girl, go through several ordeals trying to save the world and themselves. The good thing is, he's doing a fine job and everyone likes the series. The bad thing is, he doesn't know he's an actor and actually believes he's a superhero. When an event is created that takes his co-star, who he believes to be his owner, away from him he thinks it to be a true crisis and goes to the rescue.<br/><br/>So far the story. Good enough, it's only a simple animation film after all. And like most of todays animations it leans a lot on the actions of several side characters and their interaction. I love the cat best, and the hamster plays a good part too. But all in all the combination just doesn't work out too well. It is too much of a standard story packed into too much of light headed animation. The animation is up to par with what can be expected today, nothing wrong there, but it doesn't really add to the story and that makes the ending result just too thin.<br/><br/>Added to that is the fact that this is a pure Disney film and that is seen in the way the story flows - all the elements of the classics are there and it has to be said that the day for the classics is done and should be changed into a new rhyme instead of repeating it over and over.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 super barks."
"jburtroald95","1","6","36","13 March 2009"," Absolute garbage from start to finish, with Susie Essman being the only saving grace.
","Disney is the one company most renowned for its universal animated classics, and all these years has only scarcely stepped outside that genre. Though undoubtedly that has been a wise move. It is there that they truly belong, and dozens of prestigious awards that they now have up their sleeve ought to prove it. What's more these achievements aren't just for critics and award judges to adore but audiences to yawn at, they're incredibly entertaining. Naturally they are all very simple, but also full of incredible characters, spectacular animation and beautiful storytelling. Though of course, this is all in the past. Bolt is a perfect specimen of what the company produces nowadays, quick one-dimensional flops whipped up carelessly and effortlessly that bore anyone under the age of eleven out of their brains. To create the story, screenplay writers Dan Fogelman and Chris Williams have taken ideas from 'Stardust' (2007,) 'Toy Story' (1995,) '101 Dalmatians 2: Patch's London Adventure' and who knows how many other films. The animation makes us question whether they put Lego people in front of the camera instead of using computers and the voice cast is half asleep. With the exception of Susie Essman, who is the only cast member that bothered to put some effort and energy into her performance. Though she mightn't have enough fame attached to her name to be mentioned up on the poster with John Travolta and Miley Cyrus, she put a certain realistic liveliness into her character that none of the others could be bothered to do - perhaps they could have, but thanks to their laziness we will never know. But as wonderful as she was, she also is  sadly  bound by the dull script and can never truly flourish.<br/><br/>The faulty failure opens with an action-packed chase scene styled like one from a sci-fi adventure television series to introduce canine superhero Bolt (Travolta) and his sidekick owner Penny (Cyrus:) the heroic duo in an epic battle against the sinister 'green-eyed man.' (If you try hard, you may just manage to enjoy this long, exhausting scene.) Then we hear a director yell ""cut!"" and see the sky, train, ground, and everything else assumed real being taken down to reveal that everything we just saw was  in the world of the film  part of a TV show. (Shame that the advertising gave that twist away.) Though there is markedly absolutely no difference between Penny and Bolt and the actors who play them (again in the world of the film,) apart from the fact that in the real world Bolt is just an ordinary dog. But while Penny is easily able to distinguish between the world of the show and the world of reality, poor delusional Bolt isn't. He believes that everything being performed on set is actually happening, including his powerful 'super-bark.' So after a scene is filmed that ends on a cliff-hanger in which Penny is kidnapped the poor clueless mutt escapes from the studio and embarks on a ridiculous search for his owner, manipulated by three imbecilic pigeons into dragging a terrified rebellious scruffy old stray cat (Essman) and picking up a demented hamster Bolt TV series fan (voiced by Mark Walton, who tries to be as distinguished as Essman but instead awfully overdoes it.) From there we have about half an hour of redeeming fun before a predictable and seemingly never-ending conclusion.<br/><br/>It is now finally clear that Disney has forever lost its touch and should immediately consult Pixar before they even begin to make another animated film from now on. Walt would never have allowed this disaster to occur, but he's long gone and so is his legacy. But hey, get used to it. This film isn't the first of its kind and it certainly won't be the last. So let us let go of the past and brace ourselves for a long and tiresome future."

Humour is subjective, obviously, but I still think it could have catered towards a larger scope because I know people that didn't even laugh once.<br/><br/>Bad:<br/><br/>1. So much of the story relied on pure luck and was just hard to believe. I'm fine with suspending my disbelief, but there are limits to what I'll let slip by.<br/><br/>2. I think that the comedy could have catered to a larger scope and, while I did laugh a few times, I didn't laugh audibly or as much as I hoped. I hate to compare movie but just look at Toy Story, The Iron Giant and Aladdin. Arguably three of the greatest animated movies ever made and in some cases just plain movie.

","I have been anticipating the release of Bolt for several months. I had an opportunity to see a screening of it and it exceeded all my expectations. Bolt is a wonderful movie with a good story and heart, something that Pixar has done well but Disney has struggled with. I believe the addition of John Lasseter to Disney Animation has made a significant impact on the quality and continuity of this film. Yes, it is CGI. You may ask, ""Why is Disney doing CGI when Pixar already does?"" All the studios are doing CGI right now. I have been very impressed with Pixar's CGI detail, however the detail in Bolt is even better. Creating a dog with fur that gets dirty, wet, wind-blown and looks real is very impressive (at least it is to me). In addition to better detail, the color and light of this film is so true to life, you'll think it's the real thing.<br/><br/>I laughed, cried, and was on the edge of my seat.

A dog is led to believe that the life he lives on his TV show is real, but once he escapes into the real world, he becomes like a fish out of water. He doesn't understand how the real world works, he doesn't know why he doesn't have his powers, and he is in desperate need to find his owner Penny. Along the way he teams up with an alley cat named Mittens, and a hampster Rhino who also happens to be Bolt's number one fan. Back at the studio, the producer is trying to find a replacement for Bolt, but Penny still believes he's alive and will make his way back.<br/><br/>It's trite, but it's fun.

He is absolutely hilarious. The pigeons in the city are also quite funny. John Travolta lends his voice to the main character (Bolt) and he does a nice job. I guess it was a good thing that I didn't even know it was him right away. The characters integrate into the plot nicely and the action is fast-paced without rushing anything.

","i just loved the interesting plot,and all the main characters in this flawless movie; Firstly, the attraction of having Travolta's voice for Bolt is a good reason, and just like Murphy as the donkey in Shrek is an endearing character, Travolta's voice for Bolt is equally fitting. Animation, editing,and the flow of events is superbly handled. Those three pigeons are unforgettable. what an observation of their body language ! The dialogs are full of wit and humor . How ever, like other animation movies, this one too, could have had some musical scores to it, and shouldn't have ended with just one last number. i have given eight on ten, as i feel that the humans in the movie were not given adequate attention. and were more like caricatures, except for Penny , the little girl of the show, and her parents, especially her father."

","The dog of a big television show thinks everything he is doing is real, until he escapes ""by accident"" and is shipped far away to New York. Now he must find his way back to the little girl he loves and protects all while thinking he still has these special powers.<br/><br/>The film's animation is nothing spectacular, but will please the little ones. The opening sequence is a scene from the television show, so it's packed with fast paced action and editing. Well done and interesting to see how the incorporated the dog into a superhero fighting everything from guys on motorcycles to helicopters.<br/><br/>The story itself is good enough to keep me interested and doesn't really get too stale. It goes through the required clichés of this type of flick, finding out he has no powers, feeling bad and upset, then realizing he still loves the girl and wants to get back to her, blah blah blah. It's all there, so don't expect anything really new in that department.<br/><br/>The voice acting is basic, specifically from the leads, Miley Cyrus and John Travolta. Is she in character? Or playing herself? The cat and the hamster steal the show in every scene they are in. Good chemistry between the three characters on their way back to Hollywood, which makes for some good laughs and more toys for the little ones to buy.<br/><br/>I can recommend the film because it is entertaining, feels like this years Kung Fu Panda, then again it feels like this years any animated film that isn't Pixar.

","Much like what 'Madagascar' did to penguins, so did 'Bolt' do to pigeons. I already knew I loved the pigeons from the previews, and they didn't disappoint. But unlike the 'Madagascar' penguins, the pigeons weren't the only highlight in 'Bolt.' They were just one of many wonderful things about this great movie (loved the Mittens' mobster scene.) Excellent action sequences (from minute one,) hilarious humor for both kids and adults, a touching story, stunning graphics (finally, a animated and accurate Las Vegas scene) and a die-hard hamster-fan named ""Rhino"" all make 'Bolt' one of the year's best films. Sure, it mirrors Buzz's 'Toy Story' subplot and Jim Carrey's 'Truman Show'  but thankfully they move past that fast. And when they do, when they have the cat, Mittens, teach naïve TV-action hero, Bolt, how to be a regular dog, the movie turns into a tender and hilarious story. In a year that produced some excellent efforts in animated cinema ('Wall-E,' 'Kung Fu Panda' and 'Horton Hears a Who') I'm actually shocked Disney furthered the efforts with a wonderful story so full of action, comedy and heart. The only drawback was the predictability for anyone that's seen this same kind of storyline before, and the over-the-top dangerous finale they put the little girl (Penny  Miley Cyrus) in. Actually, that last complaint actually disturbed me a bit. Yes, we needed Bolt to come back to ""save the day"" in a real and action packed way, but the irresponsibility the TV crew put her in, actually might be a little too much for (some of) the target audience this was meant to be seen. Other than that and as long as it's explained to little ones as fiction/pretend, it absolutely is a must see for adults and little ones."

","Bolt- The canine star Bolt (John Travolta) of a fictional sci-fi/action show that believes his powers are real embarks on a cross country trek to save his co-star human Penny (Miley Cyrus) from a threat he believes is just as real. Basically it's ""Underdog"" meets ""The Truman Show"", but there is nothing new under the sun, so no sense beating it up for that. I was expecting a snooze fest only palatable for small children, who will delight in this by the way. I was mistaken. Though the premise is shaky, with obvious plot holes as big as you like (Since when do Dogs act?), it's a sweet little movie, and the kids won't care. The humor is pretty broad but there's something for everyone.<br/><br/>John Travolta, an actor I haven't liked in quite some time, gives a genuinely cute performance as a young dog coming to grips with reality. Miley Cyrus also gives a decent performance. It's nice to hear Susie Essman (Here playing the cat Mittens) without the trademark F-bombs dropped in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". Who is absolutely wonderful, and I doubt I'm alone on this one, is the little couch potato hamster Rhino (Mark Walton, who has made his career with this). He's an obsessive fanboy of Bolt's TV show, and has such aplomb and over-enthusiasm that he steals every scene he's in, and probably the entire movie too. He's probably my favorite ""side character"" in years.<br/><br/>It's a nice film, with decent laughs and some fun action sequences. Once it sheds the convoluted TV show premise the film is allowed the breathe and have more fun. While it's hardly in the ranks of WALL-E, The Incredibles or Ratatouille, it's still a fun movie. B."

I soon became bored of the dull speech and could have written down what was going to happen, after watching a dozen other Disney films.<br/><br/>The only really well made part of the film was the animation itself, which, apart from a few continuity errors which you would've thought would've been noticed, was very good and pleasing to watch.<br/><br/>You probably won't enjoy watching Bolt, but I would recommend to any child under 10."

","Bolt does not have a Shakespearean plot or spectacular twists and turns: it's a simple and straightforward (read: predictable) story. However that doesn't mean the film is bad - quite the opposite! The animation is spectacular, the voices are great, and there are some hysterically funny moments (my favourites being the pigeons). I suppose Bolt was made to appeal to younger (and I mean very young) audiences, hence the complaints by grown-ups here. But you know what, every parent appreciates the fact that films are still being made that appeal to kids and keep them entertained! I took my 3-year-old son (who usually has a very short attention span) to see Bolt in the cinema, and he sat through the entire 90-ish minutes of it and enjoyed it tremendously. So, Bolt may not be Oscar-worthy material, but it fulfils its purpose, which is providing some good uncomplicated fun for the entire family -- and especially for the wee ones."

"diablogtr7","8","1","4","27 December 2008"," Great film that you will not regret seeing
","Disney did not disappoint with Bolt. The characters were very alive and they all had that Disney quality to them. When you first see Bolt as a puppy you just want to reach in to the screen and hug him. They achieved a very good balance between Bolt the dog and Bolt the character, and maintained that throughout.<br/><br/>This was a very action packed movie. In the span of 90 minutes there was more action than most 2 hour action movies. The first 20 minutes of the movie will be remembered by anyone who sees it for decades to come. And they had slower, quieter scenes mixed in there to give you a break every now and then. They timed it very well.<br/><br/>I don't like Miley Cyrus but she had such emotion in her voice. I could not believe the level of talent she brought to this movie. You felt the warmth in her heart when she cuddled with Bolt, and the sheer agony when she misses him. I will have to re-evaluate my opinion on Ms. Cyrus now.<br/><br/>The animation was just superb. In 3D, it was like you were in the movie, with Bolt, every single step of the way. It made for an incredible ride that was well worth the price of admission. Trust me, you will not regret going to see this movie in 3D. You felt like reaching out and patting Bolt's fur every time! The backdrops when they travel cross country are just jaw dropping. The entire movie is just richly detailed and breathtaking to see. If you are not a kid already, you will most certainly feel like one.<br/><br/>This movie had really great moments that have Disney written all over them. Especially the very emotional scene towards the end of the movie, when he studio is burning and Bolt stays with Penny. I nearly cried.<br/><br/>But there were drawbacks as well. One, the hamster guy was just annoying. As in Jack Black and Tom Green kind of annoying. They really really overdid how big of a fan he is of Bolt. Then there were the pigeons who kept running the same joke throughout the whole movie. I also felt like this could of been a bit funnier, but mostly it was just that the plot of the film was very very simple and linear and there were no twists or turns. It was a straight arrow.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this was a great film that I would go see again. Miley Cyrus's voice acting was just amazing, I really can't say enough about that (And I have very high standards when it comes to acting). Bolt is an action packed movie about self acceptance and friendship, and it is not to be missed!"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","5","24 November 2008"," Not exactly a shocker, ""Bolt"" is a great family film
","Things haven't exactly been great for Disney animation sans Pixar lately, so while it may be a surprise to you when I say that ""Bolt"" restores some faith to Disney's silver screen products, it shouldn't be a surprise that it was produced by John Lasseter, the man behind Pixar.<br/><br/>""Bolt"" is not just some bizarre plot concoction like ""Chicken Little"" or ""Meet the Robinsons"" were. It's an adventure, action and friendship story that works like any good Disney film used to: with heart-warming and lovable characters as well as some silly ones. It appeals to boys with the action, girls with animals and a female human protagonist, and of course enough jokes to keep adults entertained (although this is its weakest area.)<br/><br/>Bolt, voiced by John Travolta in sadly his best role in recent memory, is the star of an action TV show, but he's been groomed to believe the world of his show is reality. When producers demand more from the show, the plot has Penny, Disney teen sensation Miley Cyrus (a smart call on Disney's part), Bolt's co-star and owner, kidnapped. Only Bolt believes it's real and escapes into the real world to find her. To make things tough, Bolt gets shipped to New York, across the country. He befriends some critters of course, a cat and a hamster, while learning tough real world lessons on the way.<br/><br/>The concept alone is smart when you think about it. Smart at least in the bankable sense. Superhero action movie, combined with animals, combined with an adventure that seeks to reunite two separated friends. It's like rolling ""The Incredibles,"" ""Toy Story"" and ""Homeward Bound"" all together. Genius. The script is really quite genuine and touching, though not as humorous. It's much more geared for families and that's nice to see for once. No serious under-the-radar adult jokes. Perhaps the best line of the movie is one that directly references Pixar's ""Finding Nemo.""<br/><br/>Disney plays it safe with ""Bolt."" If Pixar does all the riskier, more unique films, perhaps Disney animation can get away with good old formula stuff. That's definitely okay, especially if they have as much heart as ""Bolt"" does."

","First I should say I get teary-eyed every time I watch ""Wall-E"" - so I know good animated movies. This movie is just not getting me very interested (watching it now and soon to turn it off). It was cute in the beginning as the dog's behaviors were really cute in mimicking an actual dog. Then, once the plot became clear and the dog's voice (which doesn't fit as others have stated) was revealed, the movie went down hill. I don't understand how people can say this is funny. It just goes to show that people really don't think and/or aren't honest and say things are good because they SHOULD be good (being a cartoon). It's almost like people force themselves to like things. It shouldn't be hard to like things - it should be natural. But this cartoon/movie just really isn't good. It has potential (or should I say had), but it just isn't (enough). I heard of this movie before, but now I see why it wasn't a blockbuster. I'd be surprised if it made $45 Million. I'll look that up now and then I'm done with ""Bolt"". 3 for animation but a plot that was doomed to failure as well as weak anthropomorphic screenplay. I just don't care about these characters...even as someone willing to make the imaginary stretch (as we do when we watch any movie - animation or otherwise)."

I was into dogs then, in the phase when I saw them as more than just big, dumb animals, and I saw an ad in a magazine for a film about a dog with superpowers... I saved up all my allowance, shoveled driveways, delivered groceries, and then I went to the movies to see Bolt...<br/><br/>MILEY CYRUS!? Ugh, two minutes into the film and already I thought it was cheesy and annoying. And that's no opinion from an adult reviewer, this was me when I was the target age! I wasn't the only one, when it reached the Hitler-like cat and his fat sidekick, both parents and their children were getting up to leave. I stuck around, thinking it might improve... not a bit! Miley Cyrus' (Penny's) obese mom is introduced, as is a fat hamster, a stray cat with a misshapen head and then this utterly stupid scene where Bolt makes a strange face with alien eyes in a trailer park came up. Towards the end I think I was ready to burn down the theater it was so bad! Not only was Miley Cyrus in it, but the soundtrack was unbelievably terrible, nearly every voice was nerve-wrecking and there was too much of that puppy-love crud that makes dogs out to be these intelligent creatures.<br/><br/>It might be an alright movie if you're two years old... but I'm sorry, I just didn't see the interest, and I feel worried for society seeing its current amazing reviews."

","Bolt, I honestly don't know what to say about this film because honestly I feel bad about saying this, I love Disney so much, but this movie didn't do anything for me. First off this was one of the strangest casts, I do like John Travolta, but I just couldn't see him as Bolt for some reason, his voice just threw me off completely. Miley Cyrus, this movie became more about her and I think they were just trying to attract her fans to this movie. The only thing that I really did enjoy from Bolt was the hamster, Rhino, he was just absolutely cute, he could have been annoying, but he's like the ultimate fan that loves you so much that it turns around and you like him right back. The animation, it was decent, 3-D is just becoming so huge this year I think. The story is just The Truman Show with a dog, it also kind of reminded me of Homeward Bound, so this is something we've seen before.<br/><br/>A super-dog named BOLT, whose days are filled with danger and intrigue-at least until the cameras stop rolling. When the star of a hit TV show is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood sound stage to New York City, he begins his biggest adventure yet-a cross-country journey through the real world to get back to his owner and co-star, Penny. Armed only with the delusions that all his amazing feats and powers are real, and the help of two unlikely traveling companions-a jaded, abandoned house cat named Mittens and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino -Bolt discovers he doesn't need superpowers to be a hero.<br/><br/>While I wasn't into this movie, I think it's a great family film, especially for the kids, it's a guaranteed fun time for them. The characters are cute, but it's Rhino and Mittens who steal the show. I don't know about you, but I think this movie had a little bit of a rip off from Animaniacs, those pigeons in the beginning reminded me too much of the Goodfeathers and Mittens reminded me a bit of Rita, if you've seen the show, you know what I'm talking about and will agree with me. Bolt is worth the look, but I'm not that impressed with it, watch it with the kids and for the fun 3-D stuff. The story is just a little unoriginal but the characters make it worth your while."

","Hats off to Disney for improving their CG that much in just three years. If you try looking at Chicken liitle which established Disney as capable of making CG-animated movies, you will know. Bolt is also waaay more likable than Chicken Little. <br/><br/>Now for the actual movie. Bolt (John Travolta) is a dog whose life is a reality show in which he is a super powered dog who goes on dangerous missions with a girl named Penny (Miley Cyrus). But it turns out that he really believes this and when he escapes from the studio he must deal with not having super powers and come to terms with reality. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty similar to The Truman Show, and since I know that movie, Bolt became rather predictable to me. It is cute seeing him interact with humans and hanging out with a feline he meets along the way home to the studio, but that was just not enough to make it a classic. <br/><br/>The voice actors did good jobs, that's for sure, and some action scenes are well made, but aside from that it's pretty average.

This doesn't go well; he ends up in a box and is shipped to New York. Once there he believes the Styrofoam in the box was the reason his 'powers' no longer work. He meets Mittens, an alley cat he believes is one of Calico's minions, and together they set off across America so that he can get back to Hollywood and save Penny. Along the way they meet Rhino the hamster, a fan of Bolt who believes Bolt is a real superhero. As the three continue their journey they encounter various obstacles before the exciting finale.<br/><br/>When I sat down to watch this I didn't know about the story; all I really knew was that it was a CGI animation from Disney that featured a dog. This meant as I watched the opening I thought Bolt really was going to be a super-dog. Some might have been disappointed when it emerged that it was just a show within the film but I thought that was rather fun and worked perfectly to set up the rest of the film where Bolt learns that he isn't quite as super as he thought. Once in New York the story is almost entirely about Bolt and his new companions Mittens and Rhino. These characters are a lot of fun; especially Mittens, I loved how she was introduced when we see her running a protection racket against the local pigeons. The story isn't exactly deep but it produces some really good set pieces and some emotional moments. There are some mildly scary parts but nothing that should upset children; the sense of danger doesn't go on to long. As one might expect from Disney the animation looks really good and the voice cast, most notably John Travolta, Miley Cyrus and Susie Essman as Bolt, Penny and Mittens, do a really fine job; combined they make really good characters. Overall this might not be Disney's must memorable CGI animations but it is a lot of fun and can be enjoyed by animation fans of almost any age."

","John Travolta plays a dog in this movie. Normally this movie would be nothing special, just a cute little kids film to show your children. But because the dog is voiced by John Travolta himself, that makes the film an absolute must watch for any breathing thing.He truly steals the show in this flick, as he does in every movie he's ever starred in. He enthralls the audience with yet another one of his Oscar worthy performances that movie-goers of future generations can look back at with the same amount of amazement as we do today. The very presence of John Travolta's voice is enough to watch this film at least twenty times a year."

","""The Truman Show"" meets ""Toy Story"", ""Bolt"" is a fun animated film about a dog who, believing himself to be a superhero, goes on a quest to rescue his owner from exploitative Hollywood pencil pushers. It's a fast paced, fun little flick, more entertaining than Pixar's ""Up"", but lacking the sense of adventure and wonder that made ""Toy Story"" so memorable.<br/><br/>This project was started by Disney, but then taken over by Pixar chiefs who reworked the story to better fit the ""Pixar Formula"", which is really just Campbell's ""Hero's Journey"" (some hero leaves his protective environment and discovers a bigger world outside his familiar surroundings) with a Pixar twist. That twist is, the hero chooses to return to the smaller world after learning some message of personal growth or societal revolution. Here the message template is ""Finding Nemo"", the dog learning that he can survive out there in the real world (ocean) and be a hero without having to rely on movie special effects (daddy). It's corny moralising, probably even damaging, but it affects audiences on a primal level all the same.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – More fun than ""Up"", though I can't see this holding up with repeated viewings."

","We got the opportunity to see this in a sneak preview in 3D and were very entertained. Great plot, great animation and the 3D was amazing. Sometimes felt like Bolt's head was towering over the audience. Good thing he didn't drool! All the characters were great. The pigeons were great comic relief. It's amazing the amount of detail the animators put in. Watching the way the pigeons moved their heads was entertaining in itself. Rhino and Mittens were also hilarious while having more depth as well. A lot of Rhino's great lines were in the preview but didn't exactly play out in the story the way they seemed like they were going to. Even with that, he was hilarious. Obviously the plot is predictable but it's a very fun story. We were laughing out loud throughout this movie.<br/><br/>Skip Bond and see Bolt."

","We are used to animated movies spreading kindness and happiness among the viewing audience, but Bolt is somehow different. The beginning of the movie is very surprising and the plot unwinds superbly till the end. I enjoyed it a lot, and admired the high quality of everything in it. One of the best scenes in the movie demonstrates the thorough thinking in this movie's preparation: a strong explosion blasts in front of us, and the camera suddenly moves some hundreds of yards away, and we see a Styrofoam glass knocked down very slowly by the blast. It was amazing. The Pixar company has done it again, with the small details that elevate the movie to it's high standards."

","Well, watched this movie recently at a sneak preview and didn't know anything about the movie. My first thought was ""Oh no, no another crappy animation film..."". 15 Minutes later I was really surprised how funny this ""crappy"" movie actually was, and many people around me laughed their guts out.<br/><br/>Well, it's got the same ""true friendship"" moments you might find in every movie of that kind. And also some of those over the top ""this could never happen by chance"" moments. But thanks to the great characters featured, especially Rhino the hamster and the reoccurring pigeons this movie stands out of all those other animation movies featuring some animals on a difficult task. And the ending isn't even that heart-warming as it used to be in that kind of movie. Afterall, great fun for either children or adults, as long as you make it through the first 15 minutes. <br/><br/>8/10 Stars."

","Bolt is a beginning of new 3D animation franchise by Walt Disney Pictures. And after watching this I must say I will be happy to see the next part as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Bolt is Hollywood's hottest television super dog with super power energy. Unknown by fake studio world one day he entered into real world in search of his partner Penny. He befriends with pigeons, black cat & Rhino- the hamster in a transparent ball to accomplish his mission. Infect, it's Rhino an admiring cute character who made Bolt the real super dog & made impossible possible for an ordinary dog & that's what message is. Rhino is full of fun to watch. It's indeed a nice addition in favorite animated characters. It's coolest animation visual treat with well done voice over from John Travolta & Miley Cyrus. Bolt has something for every audience & it absolutely deserved the praise. As per the one-liner for the film, I would like to go with Rhino who frequently uttered- ""Awesome"".<br/><br/>Recommended to all animation lovers.<br/><br/>Ratings-8/10"

I can say that without a shadow of a doubt, in my opinion, ""Bolt"" is Disney's best animated film since ""The Incredibles."" The plot was original, the characters were entertaining and funny (especially the hamster), the action scenes and the overall animation was phenomenal, and the movie was just a fun ride. I would recommend this film to people of all ages. It's one of those movies where parents can take their kid(s) to see and they'll both be entertained.

"southbase","7","0","3","7 January 2009"," Fine Family Film about Plucky Pooch
","New Disney animated film that reportedly went through some development problems early in its production finally appears as a kind of unofficial semi-sequel to 2004's THE INCREDIBLES (had that film also included a family superdog), about a young White German Shepherd named Bolt (John Travolta, strongly used during the first hour or so but whose voice largely disappears during the last 20-30 minutes), employed along with his young owner Penny (the ear-popping Miley Cyrus) in the production of outlandish adventures for an unnamed studios' output of media and theme park attractions. When awakened to his contradictory usages by several of the other animal actors at the studio, the little pup goes off on his own by unexpectedly getting shipped to the East Coast and forgotten by everyone except Penny and her mother. Joined by an amusingly smart-mouthed alleycat named Mittens (Susie Essman, whose voicework skillfully displays comic skepticism without becoming one-note or overly hostile) and an overfed TV addicted Ohio hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton), Bolt decides to make his way back home somehow and prove to Penny and the audience that his life matters to what they have asked of him. Slightly longer-than-normal film of its type at first uses the additional material with seemingly traditional cartoon-movie reinforcements like a song midpoint (albeit good) or the moral that money can only exist to ultimately feed business kingdoms and royalty so don't make it do anything else. But alongside these genre tropes directors Byron Howard and Chris Williams inject energizing and inventive elements, particularly through the dedicated verbal character interplay of Bolt and his bizarre animal contacts (including blankly-eyed head-bobbing pigeons and dialog-feeding actor felines), or their encounters with a wide range of human physical types who come off more realistically American proletarian lower-class lifelike than most animated features usually include. In fact much of the film's comedy, starting with Bolt's own unintended myopia during the first half, is so low-key in funnily suspenseful scene transitions and delayed verbal punch lines that the standard animated movie audience may be taken somewhat aback if expecting constantly bawdy SHREK-like pop-media satire or romantically-/matrimonially-angled narrative sideroads (the Disney cartoon epics of the 1990s and 2000s). Like its little hero BOLT instead constantly keeps its head low and quite honest and is all the fresher for it as the little trio charmingly continues through the American Mid- and South-west and Bolt himself steadily learning his own sadness & disappointment can be offset and made palatable as he learns the value of real friendship and a sensible life goal of his own might see him through. Another successful element is the remarkable range of moods and settings the animators create by juggling sunsets, twilights, and light intrusions in shadowy cramped spaces (much of Act II takes place after dark and I was marveling at how the directors and their visual crew were keeping very strong pace through the lower-key nighttime lighting and compositions with the storytelling; when the action literally explodes at an all-night Ohio animal shelter [!] the resulting screams and chaos come off much funnier like a group of real animals and people were all just woken up and startled into disastrous realizations at the same time right at 3am). It all grandly combines near the end when little Bolt returns to LA just as the mourning Penny is involved with the climactic staging of a dangerous epic fire stunt that suddenly goes awry, and joined by his new friends along with the overtaken firefighters descends into the maelstrom to rescue his beloved owner for real and prove to himself and his audience what he's really made of. Its story elements a little creaky, its voice & star-speeching maybe a little too cut off before the final minutes, BOLT does finally combine its' modest strengths together into a rousing ending in the finest Disney way that bodes well for its new Pixar management and the imaginations of children who will find a little canine hero that they can learn from."
"osbournebastard","7","0","6","5 December 2008"," Bolt, Buzz Lightyear rip-off?
","Although the cast of characters didn't seem to be too much of a challenge to create (like how many doggie-kitty movies can you count?)I find Bolt's profile and personality very similar to those of Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story series who also believed that he was a hero until Woody talks him out of it saying that ""he's just a toy"". Disney is still contributing to the cliché that ""dogs are dumb, cats are sinister, mischievous creatures and that the hamster is, well just a hamster."" The animation and production are superb but what the story lacks in huge amounts is innovation. Probably because they refuse to take risks anymore like they did in the past. Let's not forget what happened when they launched ""The Wild"" in 2006 shortly after ""Madagascar"" showed up and got obscured in the box office due to its similarities with both the cast of characters and structure. And now they seem like they're following a loop for success imitating other Pixar titles such as ""the Incredibles"" and ""Toy Story"". Hopefully kids will never notice that. But then again I wasn't one of those kids."
"GSmith9072","6","0","4","29 November 2008"," A fulfilling fun film
","Bolt is a fun easy to swallow romp with a soft accessible palate of caricature and lush picture-scape that easily pleases the eyes. It does not boggle the imagination nor is it an exercise in stylistic pacing, comedy, or characterization, but it's a welcome family film without pretension that offers a feel-good adventure that I certainly enjoyed. The film does have a surprising amount of human touch despite the formula and pre-packaged cute that I expected the film to use as its main source of energy. It follows yet another journey (typical of the 'cgi talking animal family film' genre) of a Buzz Light year-esquire white American Shepard with an altered perspective of reality, a notably emaciated cat, and a hamster that derives it's laughs from being a parody of the overzealous fan-boy that says ""Awesome!"" all the time (quite effectively, however). In the film Bolt is actually disturbingly exploited, as he is made to think he and his owner are in actual danger on a consistent basis. One wonder's how his supposed loving owner Penny would be able to take one day of that, but alas it isn't taken so seriously, as it's a premise needed for the film to exist. It was due to this however that I sympathized with his character, and the added lack of humanity came from the fact that Mittens, Bolt's accomplice for the journey, is a stray that once had a home. The emotion in this respect is treated rather typically but it strikes the right chords to teach a valuable lesson which is often absent in films featuring cute dogs and cats. The only main character un-abused by people is Rhino the hamster, who offers much of the comic relief between the confused Shepard and the captive struggling feline. The film is animated well, no shocker there for films from high-end companies like Disney, and the character movements, especially from the pigeons, keep up the spirit of animated zest. There are even some great action sequences; the fake scenes from the TV show (that are featured in the previews like they're the main film) are great as well as the more down to earth scenes. The conclusion's emotions are a tad forced, and a lot of other elements are predictable, but Bolt picks up enough steam and plays with it's situation enough to warrant it's place as a genuinely good animated film."
