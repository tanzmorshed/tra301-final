","Akira is great. I have been watching ot every years for 30 years or so and honestly it still holds up, One has to watch it more than once to get it. The ride is well worth it.
Scary part is the Hollywood remake machine has found it. I cannot wait for the toned down, dumbed down, gender switch, franchise standard one-liners and fat twerking tattooed American 'women' to make an Appearance. And I am an American!
Sigh!"

","Akira is fun, intriguing, violent and original. Beyond that this anime is famously the first, and a very early example, of an animation with completely matching and synchronous mouth movements for all the characters, which is an achievement for the fictitious and full-length feature.
They are remaking this in Hollywood. I have owned a DVD of Akira for two decades and watch it every year. I will not be attending the American 'Akira.'"
"jpt27","9","368","452","29 March 2005"," Landmark Japanese animation that opens boundaries and minds.
","'Akira' is an astonishingly influential film, easily as much so as cinema's touchstones Citizen Kane and Pulp Fiction. Its impact is made more difficult to judge, though, given that it was made more than sixteen years ago, and didn't make an initial impact outside of Japan. Oddly, this made its influence even more profound, benefiting from 'word of mouth' and the influx of cheap VHS at the end of the Eighties. It's also gained enough of a following to warrant being digitally remastered, at a cost of over US$1 million, as a 'Special Edition,' which I am basing these comments on.<br/><br/>Rather than suffering the humiliation of being advertised, Akira filtered, like a software virus, into the bedrooms of what would become Generation X. Hollywood began to sit up and pay attention after teens began abandoning the pap of the day like Last Action Hero, and started seeking out something different, dissident, and Akira finally had its audience. Japanese animation now has a firm presence in our media, and so many paths lead back to the cultural genesis of Akira. Finally, its role in the history of film was cemented with the release of last year's mega-hit, the Wachowski brothers' The Matrix. Without Akira, there is no Matrix, and with no Matrix, you have to wonder how very different Western cinema would be today.<br/><br/>So what is Akira? It's a Japanese animated film, an adaptation of 2,000 pages worth of graphic novel by Katsuhiro Otomo and set in the futuristic world of Neo-Tokyo. Rebuilt from the ashes of World War 3, it's a technological dream of neon, computers and soaring science, mated to the social nightmare of corrupt politicians, a rampant military and an oppressed working class. Add to this the rise of a powerful breed of psychics (or 'psionics') capable of various degrees of telepathy and telekinesis, and somehow linked to a top secret military project known as Akira, and Neo-Tokyo seems ready to explode. You can almost feel the heat, the sweat, and the grime, courtesy of the borderline-masochistic attention to detail in every frame of every scene of animation.<br/><br/>Akira is all about hyper-reality, which later became known as bullet time. Animation, and more importantly imagination, allows impossibly kinetic and 'free' camera movement. The style rams home every car crash, explosion and death defying stunt. It's not the easiest film to watch in one sitting, nor indeed, at all, but you'll come away knowing where the inspiration behind so many late Nineties blockbusters came from. More importantly, you'll appreciate how mediums come to influence other mediums, and barriers such as language and culture can be hurdled with ease.<br/><br/>It's not just an action-fest either. The main arc of the story is that of Tetsuo, who begins developing psychic powers but doesn't understand what is happening to him or the responsibilities that come with such godlike power. This opens the door to some genuinely moving scenes of film-making endeavour and artistic triumph, as Tetsuo wonders if he is losing his mind and eventually lashes out against anyone and everyone. The standout scene in the whole film, for me, should be mentioned about here. Whilst under observation in a hospital bed, Tetsuo hallucinates being attacked by childhood toys. Dreams and reality are folded into each other and so it remains for much of the rest of the film. Horizons peel away and reality itself seems to disintegrate, fragment after animated fragment, as Tetsuo battles his way to downtown Neo-Tokyo and prepares to face Akira, whatever that may mean.<br/><br/>The only other character developed to this level is his best friend Kaneda, who in a number of small, well-judged scenes, comes across as bright, breezy, confident and heroic, and on hand to reason with Tetsuo. No matter what point Tetsuo's powers escalate to, and no matter how much he is wanted by the police and the military, Kaneda just wants his old friend back, and it is this hope of redemption which gives the film its emotional backbone.<br/><br/>Other strengths include the intelligent use of sound. A minimum of scoring is used: mostly Japanese drums and percussion, and some voices during dramatic parts. More interesting is the use of silence, absolute flat silence, during key moments. It fits in very well with the themes of psychic/telepathic powers, and in a more general way, the vivid hyper-reality of the film's delivery. Put it this way - when you dream, you dream in a silence of implied words, and Akira knows this too.<br/><br/>I thought the dialogue was excellent too. The street kids have catchy and sardonic street lingo (""Tetsuo's our friend! If anyone's going to kill him, it should be us!"") The military are represented by a titanic general whose lines have gained a certain amount of hilarity during translation (""You hedonistic fools! Can't you see it is utterly pointless to fight each other!"") I found myself eagerly awaiting the next punchy exchange between players, which is something that Hollywood has been missing recently. In seven out of ten films I see, the dialogue is truly awful. How difficult can it be to get two people to talk naturally? <br/><br/>'Akira' is not for everyone. In the first twenty minutes we have strong language, an attempted rape and the kinetic carnage of a fight between rival biker gangs. Some will simply not tolerate this in an animated movie which is, despite all efforts, going to be viewed by younger children. Even if you can stomach the unsavoury content, you might be beaten by the sheer oddness of Japanese culture. (They certainly have an unhealthy obsession with seeing Tokyo laid to waste.) But if you can skip over these points and see the overall genius of Akira, you may just appreciate Akira's place on the pantheon of modern culture."

It takes a very open mind to enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, be careful with this movie; it's not for everyone.  Just ignore the hype on BOTH sides and judge for yourself.

"neoxman","10","190","291","11 September 2002"," A Masterpiece of Epic Proportion.
","Visually Astonishing, Dark and Original is what best describes Katshuiro Otomo's Masterpiece `AKIRA'. Now here is an animated film that is way ahead of his time, the film was released in 1988 even before Disney created computer FX's in their animated features. AKIRA is one of my favorite movies of all time it has beautiful visuals, great animation, an extraordinary story and a wicked soundtrack. I have read the entire AKIRA manga comics and yes it makes the movie that much easier to understand but with the new DVD edition which contains the correct dubbed version that allows the viewer to understand the film a little easier. I first saw AKIRA back in 1994 when I was 14 years old and ever since then I have collected great anime, at first I was confused but yet intrigued and consumed by the plot, I wanted to know what the story was about. Finally after 4 times viewing the film I understood the plot and the message Otomo wanted to deliver in this feature. The story is fascinating it takes place in the future in the city of NEO-TOKYO were citizens live in a constant chaos of an urban revolution, while the youth lives reckless on the dark streets gathering in bike gangs the government proceeds with the so called `akira project'; a mayor step in scientific discovery based on human energy.<br/><br/>AKIRA is a movie about betrayal, love, loyalty, anger, and fiction. For those who do not understand it is a movie about the universe and how us humans connect with it, we use about 11% of our brains but what if we were able to use 40% or even 100% of it, what then? And what if some of that percentage was damaged by hate, depression, or anger, this is the case of TETSUO who is the center character of this film. The possibilities are far from anything we can imagine, `AKIRA' provides a fictional possibility that self energy exists within all of us and that is just as delicate as it is powerful.<br/><br/>This is an epic proportion animated feature, the action sequences are creatively amazing, the plot is very intriguing, dark and character driven like no other film. It is one of a kind and even after 14 years we have yet to see anything like it whether is an animated or a feature film."
"toji","10","119","193","23 October 2001"," Trademark Manga for the Western culture
","Without a doubt the necessary injection of Manga culture Western audiences needed. Personal objections (or should I say appraisals) aside, Akira deconstructs the form of narrative and character development that we had all become accustomed to through Hollywood and produces a reasonably honest translation of Katsuhiro Otomo's Manga epic, with mass deletions of unnecessary characters and plot avenues. The story is complex enough to keep western audiences attention, yet simple enough to digest whilst taking in the wonderfull animation and excellent soundtrack (a collection of traditional Japanese instruments and modern day synthesised electronica that allow for elements of cinema to establish themselves for the audience) The conflict between the two main characters, Tetsuo and Kaneda is ultimately superceded by the films namesake, the mystery of the boy Akira, and as with very few films Hollywood produces it leaves it's more labour intensive thinking until the end. A delight to follow, with periods of intense action and thought provoking predictions of a neo society, one would like to think of the film as the pipe dream of one who predicted such tragic events as of September 11. Akira, whilst violent for the medium, is a lush metropolis of gang warfare, a psuedo examination into the possible, and a fantasy tale of elements long lost in modern cinema. A cool, entertaining piece littered with cult visions and awesome bikes."
"desh79","9","28","42","5 November 2005"," Ultraviolent fantasy or eloquent Humanistic statement? Probably both
","To many, this is the movie that started it all. But what's interesting about Akira is that, while it is largely credited with introducing anime to the West, it barely raised an eyelid on its initial release. Most Japanese critics' lists from 1988 barely gave Akira a mention, instead deciding to concentrate on films like Grave Of The Fireflies or My Neighbour Totoro, at least as far as animes were concerned. But while these are perhaps (and in my opinion definitely) superior in quality, their success in western countries was more slow-moving and therefore not as much of a shock to the system as Akira was.<br/><br/>When Akira was first screened in Europe and North America in the early 90s, most people had simply never seen anything like it. Distributors, unaware of the tradition of adult-orientated animation in Japan, didn't have a clue how to promote this feature (some billing it as a kids' movie), and equally audiences suffered from the same confusion (in some cases parents taking their children to a film which features scenes such as a person exploding before mutating into a garish cyberpunk mess of flesh and cables). This confusion resulted in Akira being something of an underground success, but it also ensured the movie cult status across western countries, though perhaps for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>Is Akira a hyperviolent, sadistic fantasy? Or an eloquent statement on modern civilisation run amok, with technology getting the better of its masters and planet Earth having its divine revenge on those who mutilated it? It's possibly both. Most aficionados of Japanese animation (and also some Japanese live action, witness films by Shinya Tsukamoto or Takashi Miike) are aware that stylised violence is nothing particularly new to the genre (for now wanting to avoid the age-old discussion of anime not being a genre in and of itself but rather a style of animation which incorporates several genres like horror, sci-fi, adventure, etc Â– and indeed, it would do great disservice to the artistic integrity of many anime artists to simply lump them into one category). However, another fairly consistent, and perhaps ironic, feature of these ""violent"" narratives is the humanistic message inherent within them, and that, as opposed to many Hollywood narratives which use violence in a Biblical way (ie. the Good guys are justified in using violence against the Bad guy), a narrative like Akira, which stems primarily from both a Buddhist- and Shinto background, avoids lazy good/bad categorisations and instead uses violence to make a clear point - That it does not lead anywhere but tragedy. While perhaps the gratuitously stylised nature of the violence ends up clouding this message, the sheer fact is that, unlike in many mainstream narratives, violence is not rewarded in films like Akira. In fact, in Akira it culminates in the end of the world. Some resolution.<br/><br/>As much as Akira has attracted attention for its violent content, so the convoluted narrative has caused accusations of it being confusing at best and incoherent at worst. While it's very likely that some of the Buddhist symbolism within the film (Tetsuo's final transformation into a new cosmos, as hinted at during the final credit sequence, being a case in point) will go over a few people's heads, the storyline itself is fairly simple: Tetsuo, a bullied and insecure individual, is subjected to a genetic experiment which unleashes a hidden power within him, and, in his anger, destroys the world which he feels rejected him. As well as being a somewhat abstract statement on disaffected youth (a rather appropriate topic, given that I'm writing this at the time of the Paris riots), I would regard Akira as a document of its time. Even though it's set in the future (but then any sci-fi is just an abstract futuristic representation of the time it was made in anyhow), Akira excellently sums up the blind and ravaging short-sighted materialism of our age. That aside, Tetsuo's mutation has been described by some as allegorically representing Japan's disproportionate wealth bubble of the 1980s, while Tetsuo himself is the product of a world driven by greed and avarice.<br/><br/>I have to admit that Akira left a huge impression on me when I initially saw it 10+ years ago. In fact, as with so many others, it probably helped to start my fondness of east Asian cinema. I wouldn't be surprised if, ten or twenty years from now, Akira is widely regarded as one of the most influential movies ever made (if it isn't seen as such already, witness the influence it had on Hollywood films like The Matrix), and that future generations will justifiably view it as an all-time classic."
"jimboduck","10","98","168","22 March 2005"," The One and only Anime classic -- 10 (classic)
","When I first grabbed the cover box for AKIRA off the shelves of my local video store, I had never heard the word ""manga,"" (Japanese comic book) nor ""anime"" (Japanimation) for that matter. Back then I would have given that movie a 9 (excellent), since it was like nothing I had ever seen before, was true graphic violence, but was still a bit too long and too hard to understand. Ten years later, having watched a slew of other anime productions, I would have given this movie an 8 (very good) from memory had I not seen it again yesterday. After seeing AKIRA for the first time in the original Japanese language, I have come to fully appreciate its cultural and artistic merit.<br/><br/>Ten years ago, I watched the English dubbed AKIRA and understood absolutely no Japanese. Ignorance of the language made for funny jokes with my brother (""Just as my bullet was reaching the red line! You think you're so tough"") but added nothing to the movie. Ten years later I understand both the language and the country, thanks in part to AKIRA, and I have finally realized that Katsuhiro Otomo had created a classic. While critics may know the director Kurosawa, it may take another 10 years for the name Otomo to make its way to the forefront of American cinematic consciousness.<br/><br/>From here on out, I have nothing but praise for this historical milestone. No other hand-drawn movie I have ever seen is done as meticulously. The pillar lined coliseum comes to mind. It's apparent on first viewing that an immense amount of effort was put into the hand-drawn animation. It seems as if every detail within the frame is in motion. This stands out in the ANIME industry, where so many directors don't bother with effort and instead choose to have a still frame frozen over five seconds. In my mind AKIRA's animation is peerless on an international scale.<br/><br/>Second, the Neo Tokyo depicted in AKIRA is definitely the one that should exist today. Nightlife is dark and violent. Fundamentalist Buddhist sects roam the streets chanting dogma and searching for answers. And most importantly, the medicated punk teenagers speak a crooked, thuggish Japanese slang that I haven't heard in any movie of recent memory. 1988 was Japan's heyday, what with the bubble economy and all, but since then the artistic vision of Otomo's AKIRA seems to have gotten stuck in an economic recession. I feel as if modern Tokyo and its Anime has diverged quite a bit from the Neo-Tokyo depicted in AKIRA.<br/><br/>My final comment is DO NOT rent the English dubbed version, as I did long ago. If by chance you've developed a familiarity with Japan's language and culture, AKIRA makes so much more sense, as it was animated for the Japanese language. The poor English dub job does nothing but distract BIG TIME. As Japan's economically exuberant and excessive 80's heyday fades further into the past, AKIRA will prove to be a relic of a cult imagination that may be fading as well. To watch it in English would be sacrilegious.<br/><br/>In homage to this classic, I've titled my homepage AKIRA-TETSUO, which is named after that demonic anger and guilt you feel when you fail -- the emotion that you can harness to wreak atomic havoc upon this green planet earth. No happy ending with this cataclysmic movie.<br/><br/>JY<br/><br/>Jimboduck-dot-com"

"Brade","10","43","73","25 January 1999"," An animated masterpiece, without the sing-alongs of Disney fare
","It amuses me that so many people are appalled by the ""graphic violence"" of this film when they are the ones who will turn around and glorify a movie like ""Silence of the Lambs"" simply because it is live-action.  Akira completely dispels the myth that animation must be replete with characters who are super-deformed and randomly break into song.  This is a true emotional experience the likes of which Hollywood could not duplicate even if it tried.<br/><br/>A gang of young motorcyclists get involved in a government plot involving the resurrection of ""Akira,"" a force which once laid waste to Tokyo.  Now, in the Neo-Tokyo of the future, the youngest and lowliest of the gang, Tetsuo, ends up harnessing this extremely destructive power and goes on a rampage of telepathic mayhem to earn the fear of those who once bullied him relentlessly.  Beneath the violence in this movie lies the very touching story of this young man and his reconciliation with Keneda, his best friend.<br/><br/>
One of the most moving scenes in the film is a flashback that shows the first meeting between the two when they were very young.  Though the other kids had bullied and harassed Tetsuo, Keneda was there to stick up for his now lifelong friend.  If those who watch Akira can discard their preconceived notions of what animation should be, they will find one of the most exciting, emotional, and rewarding films they will ever have the fortune of seeing.<br/><br/>As a special side note, I personally prefer the dubbed version, which is executed very well by a talented cast of voice actors. My favorite line in the movie belonged to the Colonel: ""They don't teach tact at the academy."" Though it was adapted from a huge body of manga work, Akira was executed perfectly, being directed by its original creator, Katsuhiro Otomo."
"Kore-O","8","46","79","22 December 2005"," Every Anime fan have to start from a certain place.
","I was probably around 8, when I first saw Akira. It was my step dad who asked me if I was interested in watching this Japanese cartoon. I expected something like, my favorite children movies like The Lion King or The Land before Time.<br/><br/>Akira however, was something else. At the time I was to young to understand English, since it was a second language for me. But I remember what kind of an affect it had on me. It was brutal, it was hard, it was edgy. The drums and Neo Tokyo lights flew through my little body as butter, as I witnessed death, gore and sadistic killings. Something my pure and innocent eyes had never seen before. And yet I was strangely excited. I was never tough as a kid. I was a afraid of the dark and often had nightmares about all kinds of things. But Akira, despite it's mature nature, just had me in awe. When I finally re-saw it many years later, when I was an old teenager, I was still in awe.<br/><br/>Akira is simply a wonderful and entertaining sci-fi movie. It was what introduced me to anime, and innovation in a hole new way. If you want to start watching anime or see, what all the fuss is about, then Akira is a good place to start. Even though it's over 17 years old today, it is still a fantastic and visually stunning animation. Even if you don't appreciate animation you owe it to yourself, to check it out. It has spectacular action, motorcycle-chase-sequences, mad scientists and tons of blood and shooting.<br/><br/>8/10"
"da-most-wanted","8","44","76","15 November 2006"," An anime that never ages
","I remember the first time i watched this when i was 14, back then it didn't mean much to me i just watched it because of the violence. Growing up i cant count the number of times i have watched it but it seems as though every time i watched it i uncovered something new in the plot. On to the review then; There are two different dubs for this film in English, the initial one i watched on VHS is much better then the one on DVD. The voices match the characters and bring across emotions very well in the VHS dub. In the DVD dub the voices seem alien to the characters personalities, this may be due to the fact that I'm used to seeing the film with the old dub.<br/><br/>The animation is very fluid, definitely a revolution in animation. The vast range of colours used really bring the metropolis alive. The start of the film where Kaneda and the crew are riding through the city you get to witness all sorts of sub-environments of the city, from tight alley ways where you can almost sense the deprivation to the bustling streets bright from the flashing neon lights.<br/><br/>The characters grow on you the further in to the film you get, at the beginning you can sense friction between Kaneda and Tetsuo, however as the film progresses you understand the past between these two characters and come to terms with their feelings. The colonel is also a very interesting character who seems to represent a beacon of hope constantly attempting to avoid the inevitable catastrophe headed for neo-tokyo.<br/><br/>The storyline revolves around two central characters, Tetsuo and Akira. It is heavily emphasised towards revealing what the next evolution of man is and whether or not the evolution would be in the best interest of man.<br/><br/>Closing comments, Akira is a must watch for any anime fan who appreciates a thought provoking storyline and dense characters.<br/><br/>Also watch; Ghost in the Shell, Ghost in the Shell:Innocence and Perfect Blue"

"WHCernan","5","35","66","24 April 2001"," Different, detailed; but a masterpiece? Not really.
","I've been a big fan of science fiction and fantasy in both literature and cinema for at least 25 years. I love the cutting edge, yet until the year 2000, I had never seen any anime. My anime-loving friends urged me to introduce myself to the genre with either ""Akira"" or ""Princess Mononoke"" or even ""My Friend Totoro"". Since my friends only had ""Akira"" on video, I chose that. I watched this in November 2000, so please forgive me for forgetting the character names.<br/><br/>Right away, my viewing frame of mind fell once the English soundtrack came squealing its way through my sound system. What is it about US distributors of Asian movies? Why do they think we want to hear grown women talking in baby imitations? I'd much rather read subtitles and hear the original soundtrack than these peevish, cartoony caricatures.<br/><br/>When my friends had hyped the incredibly detailed, fluid animation style that put American animation to shame, I looked forward to seeing it. In fact, every review here seems to glorify the skill and talent of the animators. Although the frames did contain a lot of detailed artistry and a large number of independently animated objects, the movement was jerky as all hell. It was very easy to see where the frames were linked. It was like playing an action game on a PC when it gets overloaded trying to keep up with the game. Disney may be pablum for the masses, but its theatrical releases certainly are a hundred times more smoothly animated than ""Akira"".<br/><br/>I had to put the ""viewing experience"" aside and concentrate on the plot, theme, and characters. I've done it enough times in the age of VHS rentals, so it was no problem here. I found that the character development for everyone except the protagonist was weak and shallow. I never could understand any motivation for the erratic behavior of the friend. Now, this is more like an American movie than some cutting-edge Asian import.<br/><br/>The plot.. well, very poorly explained, especially the last 20 minutes. I think I understood the ending of ""2001"" better the first time I saw it. I don't want to spoil anything, but there is no explanation for what happens at the end of this movie. Those of you who have seen it will understand... bigger and bigger and bigger... why? Just to be grotesque?<br/><br/>Finally, the theme made sense to me. Our world faces great danger from our misunderstanding of technology and humanity's preoccupation with it. We will be our own downfall if we are not careful. Good message, I get it.<br/><br/>So, overall, I gave it 4/10. I thought it was sloppy in direction and the story was utterly lacking in interest. Those of you here (and on the video jacket) who compared this film favorably with ""Blade Runner"" are, in my opinion, not paying very much attention to ""Blade Runner"". That is a hugely superior film to this.<br/><br/>Finally, as to ""My Friend Totoro"", I saw it too. It had the same problems with animation jerkiness as this does. Is ""Princess Mononoke"" going to let me down too? I'm going to watch the SUBTITLED version of that anime just to get away from those baby voices."

It is convoluted but that reveals itself overtime as a reason for its longevity. The animation is insanely good and the violence and force makes it exciting.
The American remake machine has ordered up a Hollywood version of Akira. Let me guess: it will be called Adam, have a Hollywood overweight starlet with neck tattoos and its premier will be covered by Entertainment Tonight (unannounced commercial). May I begin vomiting now?"

","For its time, Akira set new standards in animation. However, a movie is more than just visuals. In this respect, while ground-breaking on a technological level, Akira is a failure as a movie. It features unlikeable, boring, often-stereotypical characters with poor character designs. And the plot does little to make up for the lackluster characters. At best, it's a very rough synopsis of over twenty volumes of manga. At worst, it's an utter train wreck.<br/><br/>Rather than seeing Akira as a movie, viewers should consider it an animated ""omake"" to the manga. If you liked the manga, and always wanted to see certain scenes in action, then it's worth watching. In that respect, it's sort of like the movies your annoying uncle takes of his vacation. If he vacationed in Hell.<br/><br/>One notable thing about Akira is its exceptional soundtrack. Even if you never watch the movie, it's worth giving a listen."

","It is my opinion that Akira is no masterpiece for several reasons: <br/><br/>I can't find any likable characters in the movie. Kaneda and Tetsuo are members of a biker gang, and when I thought about it they're just sociopaths and aren't any better than their rival gangs. By the end none of the characters really develop or learn anything, and the ones that were killed off I assume is because they simply weren't useful anymore.<br/><br/>I find the movie visually unappealing and confusing. Most of the youthful characters were so plain and similar, they looked like they were made with a cookie cutter and I couldn't tell them apart. Kaneda and the female protagonist looked like they could have been siblings if not the same person. In contrast any character in their twenties or older was positively hideous for whatever reason. And you'll here this from every poor review: it is pointlessly gory and full of confusing grotesque creatures.<br/><br/>The plot is full of unanswered questions some of which include ""what's with the kids who look like old people?"" ""what's with the killer stuffed animals, and why are they bleeding milk?"" ""Where did Kaneda find a laser gun without anyone stopping him?"" And I felt cheated by the end when I spent the whole time thinking: ""Akira? who's Akira? When are we going to see Akira."" Only to find out Akira was dead the whole time... At this point in the movie I feel they ran out of ideas so they just filled it with grotesque nonsense and nothing was accomplished.<br/><br/>I give it a 2.5/10"

","2019. 31 years after being destroyed during World War 3, Tokyo (now 'Neo-Tokyo') has been rebuilt and is a thriving metropolis. Shotaro Kaneda is the leader of a biker gang. His friend Tetsuo is injured in an accident and taken to a top-secret government facility. He develops telekinetic powers but decides to use them for evil rather than good. He has the same powers as Akira, the force that destroyed Tokyo in 1988, and now it appears that history will repeat itself.<br/><br/>Regarded as some sort of animation-drama masterpiece but it is far from that. The animation is great but the remainder is average, at best. The plot has potential but becomes quite random quite quickly. Stuff happens that seems tangential to the story. Plus, there's several strands of plots going on at the same time, adding to the complexity but detracting from the focus of the story and the engagement level.<br/><br/>The random, rambling, plot becomes quite tedious past a point.<br/><br/>However, the plot is not the worst if it: character engagement is where the movie falls flat. There's really nobody to like or care about. Characters are one-dimensional and appear to be constructed to appeal to kids.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's mediocre."

","As most things that people try to ""remaster,"" the 2001 version that Poineer Animations put out just doesn't cut it. I've watched Akira on VHS about 4 times in my life with the original English dialogue. That original cast had great voices that supported the characters. Although the translation may not have been as accurate, the actors were portraying the characters appropriately with their voices. In the original cast, the tones of the voices and calculated pauses gave the scenes that sense of urgency and strange phenomena. This new version has lost its aura. The new English voice actors made the characters shallow and stereotypical. These new actors are lifeless. They just sound like Hollywood rejects reading lines, as opposed to acting. My mother could do a better job with line delivery. I used to say that Akira was the best example of dubbing of a foreign film. But no more. From now on, I'm only watching it in Japanese."
"sgt_pinback","2","44","98","7 December 2003"," Oh dear
","Before I start, let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing, which I gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some.  So, it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new DVD version would make a difference.  I have also not read the corresponding book; I'm only familiar with one other Japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context.<br/><br/>Potential minor spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>I usually like darkly tinged science fiction stories (the likes of Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I did not enjoy this movie at all.  While it started out mildly intriguing, it became tedious by the time it was only half-way finished.  There are all sorts of problems; let's start with what is probably the most severe: the dialogue.  The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences; if they aren't shouting each other's names for the n-th time, they are usually grunting monosyllables (""Kanedaaa!"", ""Tetsuoooo!"", ""Huh?"", ""Grrr"", etc.).  This leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and two-dimensional.  It doesn't help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals.<br/><br/>The grunting is augmented by some random pseudo-philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by Star Trek standards.  There is nothing deep and meaningful here - it all seems haphazard, thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock sci-fi ideas with no coherency whatsoever.<br/><br/>What little there is of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of escalating scenes of mayhem and destruction.  Not that there's anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction, of course; but in this case you'll find yourself asking ""what's the point of it all, and how long until it's over"". Character development in the last 30 minutes or so consists of little more than Tetsuo turning into Pizza the Hutt for no readily apparent reason.<br/><br/>The ending resembles the one in 2001 - a bizarre string of images that, far from resolving or explaining anything, leave the viewer feeling he's just been looking into a kaleidoscope for two hours.  I'm sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art; but to me it was just a lot of admittedly imaginative use of colour and shapes.  (Some of the music was also quite interesting).  Unfortunately it's all style and no substance.<br/><br/>Tired of Disney?  Want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with ""adult"" themes?  I'm sad to say you're more likely to find that sort of thing in ""South Park""."

","I really wanted to like this movie, I heard from everyone that it was an anime classic and I had seen screenshots that looked really cool. In the end I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie was hand drawn and it looked amazing no doubt about that, I could stare at still from this movie all day long, it's the other things that bothered me.<br/><br/>The story is a mess. I loved the first act, seeing this cyberpunk city was really cool, seeing the gangs and everything. After that the movie turned into a anime horror movie, which I don't feel fit the tone at all. The whole Akira thing was confusing as hell, they never explained it, everyone was asking the whole movie ""What is Akira?"" The third act dragged out so much, things that were happening didn't make sense at all. The end was just a mess with destruction everywhere, but no story to tell about it.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was also annoying. Some of the songs were cool, but they play them almost 7 or 8 times in the movie, which wears out the song and just makes it ambient noise.<br/><br/>This might be only the English dub, but the dubbing was horrible. The words were off the mouth movements and the voice actors were bad. In intense scenes the voice actors never gave an intense feel.<br/><br/>For a classic there were some big problems. The story could have been more direct and made more sense. In fact, they could have just made the movie about the city and the gangs fighting and that would have made it better. With the movie how it is, they could have cut it down to take out the dragging on of the end. Akira just ended up losing my interest near the end, making it not as interesting as I thought it would be."

I think the reason it is so highly acclaimed is that when it was released to the west, it was so fresh to viewers equating animation with Disney that it automatically became ""good.""  I think it gets 1.5 stars"
"vkn","1","39","91","10 April 2001"," So ugly it's impossible to like, no matter how hard one tries.
","I'm all for supposedly intelligent films and series, that contain hidden meanings you have to search for. And it's only on the Japanese market that one can find some good examples of these. I've greatly enjoyed pondering over Evangelion, Jin-Roh, and many others. So why can't I be bothered to do the same for Akira? Simple; Akira is just so... ugly.<br/><br/>The big mistake Akira makes is that, if a movie wants to make people think about it's ""hidden meaning"", for people to try hard to understand it's point, the film should at least offer something to draw the viewer in. Likeable characters, interesting concepts, or at least -something- just plain nice to look at. Some positive elements that can make one grow to like a movie.<br/><br/>Akira does none of this and is, from start to finish, deeply detestable. It may be just a matter of personal taste, but the character designs struck me as especially repulsive. The film is populated by doughy-faced goblins with bad dressing habits. Ugh. How can one possibly be interested by such a cast of characters who look like radiation-deformed Hiroshima toddlers, let alone remotely like them?<br/><br/>Even worse is the way the film hurls a constant slew of sickening and really needlessly gory images at the viewer's face. Sure, violent gore-fests can be fun in a mindless way if you like that sort of thing, but they seem badly out of place here. If it's supposed to be a deep and intelligent film, how come it feels as if you're watching something from Troma studios? These two sides of the film co-exist in a very uncomfortable way. As if Fellini was trying to direct Attack of the Brain-Eating Zombies. Bottom line; the exaggerated bloodlust of a random violent horror film doesn't go hand-in-hand with anything remotely refined.<br/><br/>Still, deep beneath all the tasteless violence there's the kernel of some kind of -point- to all this carnage. Trouble is, it's terribly patchy and impossible to make sense of. Every now and then, there's a small flash of lucidity and a few brittles of a deeper meaning are thrown around, but it seems so random and rushed that it ends up just adding to the confusion and the unpleasant overall feel of this film.<br/><br/>The overall impression one gets from watching Akira is about as pleasant as staring at a badly-treated, crusty fleshwound dripping with pus. And very few people will want to stare at something like -that- several times in order to be able to make sense out of it (all for a deeper meaning which doesn't even look all that interesting from what I can make out). Sorry, but no way am I going to willingly watch such a repulsive film again, I've been put off for good. Akira is not ""gritty"", ""haunting"", ""menacing"", or any other cool word the marketing bods might want to slap onto it, it's just ugly.<br/><br/>And for some reason, there are still people out there who claim that this is the be-all and end-all of the Japanese animation industry. Let's just be grateful that it's -not-. If every Japanese production was this dreadful, we'd have been denied the joys of the most graceful and aesthetic animation in the world. The way Manga video marketed Akira gave a bad, and lasting first impression of Japanese series in general to occidental audiences, which qualifies as a valid enough reason to hold a grudge against this movie in my view. You're better off watching Macross Plus, Honneamise, Gall Force, Jin-Roh, or even Saint Seiya instead of this sick and messy effort. Simply because those, and many other films are thought-provoking as well as plain enjoyable.<br/><br/>(fans of mindless and truly disgusting gore will love Akira, though)."
"ironhorse_iv","7","9","16","29 March 2016"," Akira explode with a lot of high energy action! The results from that, is some highly acclaimed praise! It's well-deserved. Still, it has some miss points
","While, this movie wasn't a success, when it first came out during its limited U.S theatrical release, this film has garnered a large following as a cult film since then. Akira led the way for the second wave of anime fandom outside of Japan and is a major influence on live-action films. Now, it's widely considered to be one of the best anime to come to the United States. In Japan, this movie is considered by many critics to be one of the greatest animated and science fiction movies of all time. I wouldn't go that far, into the praise, but I do love the way, Akira use imagery and themes regarding revolution, teenage delinquency, and political/religion incompetence, to show the deep clashes of cultures, between the new age beliefs and tradition values. It all build up to the inevitable destruction of the old and the rebirth of a new society. However, the film relies so heavily on symbolism, surrealism & absurdism, that it fails to connect with everybody. Some people might get lose, with some the film's many motifs, such as the image of a capsule that repeated throughout the story or the double helix shows up several times. Since, most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the original manga, the restructured plot of the movie differs considerably from the print version, toward the last half of the film. Without spoiling it, just note different characters dies and lives than the manga. So don't worry, if you get confused by the odd visuals, because I was also asking 'WTF', was I watching, even after reading the manga novels. Lot of the character development and back-story was left out from the novel. Even, the majority drug abuse concept of the manga seem, to non-existed, here. Instead, it focus on an evolution theory that doesn't really go anywhere. Then, there is the fact, that a lot of the flashbacks, they did use, were edited in the film in the wrong spots. It made the film, so much more baffled. It's doesn't help, that the science-fiction manga in which, it was based & named after, is indeed a long read, so not everything about their world, can be put in the 121 minutes, run-time of the film. No matter if you're a first time viewer or a fan, the film does get a bit messy at times. Directed by the same author, and artist from the manga version, Katsuhiro Otomo; the film depicts a dystopian version of Tokyo in the year 2019, call Neo-Tokyo with cyberpunk tones. It's here, where the odd plot comes into play, focusing on teenage biker Tetsuo Shima (Voiced by Nozomu Sasaki) and leader of his biker gang, Shotaro Kaneda (Voiced by Mitsuo Iwata) being expose to psychic powers from the government, that would wipe out, their world. What a lot of western viewers like myself, was surprised by, is the amount of violence and adult-driven themes. It was very rare to see that, in animation, at the time. The body horror in the night was and still is, visually haunting for me. This Japanese anime film contained some of the most kinetic sequences in animation history as well. All of the action scenes, were really made well. It gave the film, an epic scale of detail, movement, and fluidity. Akira has often been considered the greatest animated film of all time, with advanced technical features, such as highly-detailed scenes with textures, shadows, unusual colors, and seamless animation with over 160,000 animation cels. Computer-generated imagery was used in the film, primarily to animate the pattern indicator used by Doctor Onishi, but it was additionally used to plot the paths of falling objects, model parallax effects on backgrounds, and tweak lighting and lens flares. At its time, it was the most expensive film ever produced in Japan with $8 million. It's kinda cool that movie had the destruction of Tokyo occur on July 16th, 1988, the day that the movie had its Japanese theatrical debut, it was the same way; the manga told their story in 1982. The film has also been dubbed twice into English — once in 1988 by InterSound & later with Streamline Pictures and Geneon AKA Animaze via Pioneer in 2001, leading to a misconception that they produced it themselves. In my opinion, I like the Japanese version with the subtitles than the English version. There is just something, not right with the English dubbing. With the English editions, some of the original Japanese dialogue is lost or mistranslated. I also not a huge fan of the movie's soundtrack by Shoji Yamashiro (pseudonym of Tsutomu Ōhashi). Some of the music on there is very unlistenable. I can hardly stand the heavy breathing mixed with pounding of the drums. It hurts my ears, so much. Overall: While, a live-action film adaptation version might or might come, one day to renew fans, for the most part, this movie will be best known for its sharp animation. Still, the confusing plot and downer feel of the movie, doesn't make it, a great watch. It's still one of the most memorable anime of all time. However, I can't recommended everybody to see it. In the end, if you're a fan of anime, check it out. If not, there is better anime films to introduce you to that genre."

","This film is simply amazing! Takes place in the near future after the end of WWIII. It was supposed to be caused by a nuclear bombing on Tokyo. It was actually caused by a boy named Akira. His powers were woken suddenly and unexpectedly. The scientists, quick to take action, stepped in and abducted him. They pushed his mental powers to the limit and he lost control.Tokyo was destroyed in the resulting psionic explosion. Several years later another gifted child has escaped from the same institution and is involved in a motorcycle crash with a 16 year old kid name Tetsuo. When the military takes the kid away Tetsuo is taken with him. His childhood friend Kaneda watches as he is abducted. This leads to that and Kaneda is breaking into the facility where Tetsuo is being kept. Tetsuo wakes up in a hospital room and escapes the facility. He is constantly being contacted by Akira and goes to find him, leaving a trail of destruction in his wake. Tetsuo is lashing out at the world that oppressed him. Kaneda follows him trying to end the destruction and death. Tetsuo finds Akira... what's left of Akira and goes insane. Kaneda trys to kill him and Tetsuo loses control of his powers. Like the Akira incident a psionic explosion happens and the universe is reborn again. This is presented in stunningly detailed and extremely smooth cel animation. It remains a pinnacle achievement in animation technology. This is not for children. It is extremely violent and deranged. If you are not into anime you will be after watching this.

Well, I watched him collect all the books and above all, I heard a lot the rhythmic score in our parent's car! I remember to watch a few minutes years ago but it was senseless with Tetsuo calling ""Kaneda"", Kaneda calling ""Tetsuo"" and that was all.<br/><br/>One week ago, I started to read the comic and it was hard to put it down: Contrary to traditional comics, the text is minimal so the pace is really dynamic and matches the story: as it deals with devastations, technology and mysticism, it's really Japanese at heart. The characters (Kaneda, Kei, Tetsuo, Kaori, the kids, the Colonel) are well studied and all the emotions are rich: humor, romance, courage, madness, faith, friendship... Otomo is a stunning artist too and the numerous devastations of Tokyo are among the best pages of comic ever. If there is a big slump between volumes 17 and 27, the last volumes are visually fascinating! <br/><br/>Now, comes the movie: actually, it's 20 years old but it's not very outdated. At its release, it surely rocked the animation because there weren't a lot of productions like this. As for the adaptation, it's a good thing that Otomo was at the helm: The movie looks like the comic and vice versa. The story has been drastically cut for the screen but the core is still here(in fact, it's indeed the big slump mentioned that has been left). In addition, a lot of ideas have been rewritten so it's nearly like a special edition. <br/><br/>Finally, the comic is so explosive that this animation is nonetheless less powerful. In other words, if you like the movie, read the comic because it's a thousand more epic and read ""Domu"" as well (it's a good prequel!)."

There hasn't been a single time that i didn't get a new insight or vision from watching this movie. It is so complicated i had to watch it at least 3 times before i could be able to begin to understand what is going on in this movie! I recommend to watch the movie Japanese spoken (i always do!) with English subtitles, because the Japanese brings out more of the culture and i fear that any translation other then English will diminish the incredible detail of the dialogs.<br/><br/>I absolutely love the details everywhere: The junk laying around, the destroyed and decayed things that have not been repaired, the look in the eyes of people just walking about, the atmosphere of purposelessness and decay. Also admirable are the so very non-Hollywood little human things like for example: The annoying TV commercials, the dull hanging around of the gang being bored, and senseless chattering of a girl on the phone. Everything is just... real! Next to this, the quality of the animation is just overwhelming! You can see the dedication and hours and hours of work on every frame! No computer can make this kind of art...<br/><br/>This movie is not just another movie... It is a piece of animated art that for me has as much Art-value as the Mona Lisa. My deepest respect and admiration to the makers of it!"
"kaplara","5","7","14","28 November 2004"," Damn, and it started so well...
","A movie whose pace starts out well enough, but can't keep it going.<br/><br/>When this movie opened I was surprised, the visuals are quite advanced, and the portrayal of a rebuilt future society is excellent. The movie is quite good up until it goes from being a weird mystery (What exactly is happening to that kid?) to being a pseudo-DragonballZ philosophical mess. Basically the movie feels like it was written in 1 night and the writer couldn't figure out how to end it, so he just filled the last hour with random fighting, which you at least could forgive if it led to something, but it doesn't. Overall it's very disappointing, such a waste of what seemed at least to be a solid movie with a solid plot."
"Seraphion","5","5","9","5 February 2015"," A strong classic SciFi plot, but the technicalities don't really impress me
","The movie presents one of the classic plot line of Modern SciFi, the emergence and rise of a superhuman power. It also develops like all the rest of its sub genre, having the powers develop into something wild, uncontrollable by the wielder, and then wreak havoc on an epic scale. Looking at the release time frame, I think it's possible that this movie actually influences many of the sub genre movies. Thus the plot line may be considered one of the classics. But I really don't see wealth of enjoyment in looking at the technicalities. Despite the world setting is carefully built, it doesn't really seem to be explored so much in the movie. The movie's coloration choice of having few contrasting colors makes it boring if only the the story is not that strong. The emotions depicted are also quite hyperbolic as characters show disgruntled faces all too often. The vice acting is as usual the standard Japanese hyperbolic where characters shout overly at all things."
"Al_The_Strange","10","5","9","10 January 2015"," Akira Review
","As with anybody else exploring Japanese animation for the first time, Akira was one of the first titles that I ran across, for it represents one of the most popular, most innovative, and most explosive experiences committed to the medium. For at least one generation, the film served as a major gateway drug to the larger world of anime, with promises of pulpy and unbridled violence that normal American animation would never dare divulge in (and the cult of Akira thrived well on video tape bootlegs, before the advent of optical media). If you are looking for animation with such elements as killer biker gangs, military takeovers, out-of-control psychic warfare, and mass destruction galore, then there's no better place to start than with Akira.<br/><br/>The film begins and ends with a bang...literally. Set in the scuzzy streets of NeoTokyo, some 30 years after a cataclysmic explosion that heralded the coming of World War III, the film immediately kicks off with a thrilling biker gang chase. When one of the gang members is captured by the military and experimented on, unlocking latent psychic powers. all hell continues to break loose. Tetsuo's psychic rampage leaves nothing but awe in its wake, as he stops tanks shells and laser beams in the air, destroys entire city blocks, and sends vehicles careening out of control. It all builds up to a huge showdown in the stadium, where evolution suddenly goes into overdrive, and the fate of the world is suddenly at stake.<br/><br/>The film is fast and densely-packed with loads of well-staged action setpieces. Even when things aren't blowing up, the visuals are superbly-drawn, and often serve to express more to the story. However, even I'll admit that the experience hasn't always been that endearing. The film felt convoluted and stiff at first glance, but through repeat viewings (and after reading the original manga), I grew to connect much deeper to the story and characters.<br/><br/>When comparing the story to its source material, there is some missed potential; the Akira manga is a huge saga with numerous subplots and characters that would require more movies (or maybe an anime series) to fully cover. Katsuhiro Otomo, however, takes his own story and completely remixes it for the film, paring down the whole story and cutting out whole characters to make it all fit in a two-hour time frame. Even though the full story of Akira would be grand to see on the big screen, this film proves that less is more. The movie is entirely set in NeoTokyo, and it methodically reveals all the characters and ideas it needs to to make sense. I believe it actually handles all of this much better than the manga did, where characters seemed to bump into each other at random and then go on the run; in the movie, the characters receive a more pronounced introduction and are gradually tied into the various plots involving military coups, secret experiments, and all-out destruction. The film squeezes in as much characterization as it can; more screen time for everybody would be welcome, but there's just enough to them to make them easy to understand. The plot seems dense with all the different characters and concepts it has to juggle, but the film strings it all together aptly to make all the twists and themes feel natural. Themes of power - the best and worst of it - resonates throughout the entire picture.<br/><br/>Made with a larger-than-average budget, the film boasts spectacular animation quality. Every scene is laden with rich, highly-detailed, and brilliantly-colored artwork. Action moves very smoothly. Even character movements and lip flapping is very well-done (unlike other anime films, Akira is pre-scored, with dialogue recorded before the animation, allowing them to animate mouth movements to match the voices). A few computer effects are used in the film, and generally match up with the film well. Designs for all the settings, characters, costumes, vehicles, and things are really cool. Voice acting can be a hit or a miss, depending on what version you see. The Japanese dubbing is decent. There are two different American dubs available, and they're both cheesy and over-the-top in their own right. Writing is pretty well-balanced; exposition is used to condense some parts of the plot and make it more accessible to audiences, but it doesn't sacrifice much, and most lines are punchy and good. Sound design is pretty cool. The music score contains some of the weirdest music I've ever heard, but it's strangely fitting, and perhaps a little catchy.<br/><br/>Even though it seemed odd at first, I've grown to love Akira and its dystopian world of warring bikers and psychics. Its style and levels of superpowered action inspired more films and shows in the medium, and it would inspire me (and others like me) to explore more of the exciting world of anime. Even on its own merits, it has always been a thrilling, edgy, and inspiring experience unlike any other. If you're open to watching this type of animation, it's recommended watching at least once for mature audiences.<br/><br/>5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)"
"JeanLuc-2","10","5","9","26 August 1999"," One of the first and one of the best.
","I guess I should start off by saying that I'm a Japanimation fan ever since I was little. I always enjoyed watching robots fight it out on tv. Then of course I grew up, and became more and more interested in animations and I thought I should watch a full-length anime. I went down to the local video store and a little package in the corner of the shelf caught my eye. I picked up the video and was first introduced to the best anime of all times : ""AKIRA"".<br/><br/>I was absolutely enthralled when I first viewed AKIRA. Even though I felt that the story was complicated, it did nothing to effect my judgement of the film. In fact I liked the mysterious feeling the movie gave me the first time I looked at the futuristic Tokyo with all the skyscrapers,lights, and the incredible artwork it was presented in.<br/><br/>The character animation in this film is by far the best I've seen. The characters moved fluidly and realistically, showing off a wide range of emotions. The voices were equally well done, the speech actually matches the character's mouth movement. This can be seen by watching the subtitled version of the film, which I consider to be the better version.<br/><br/>One of the things that stands out in this movie is the detailed background. The futuristic Tokyo was brought to life in it's full glory. Complete with detailed texture on buildings, realistic lighting effects, and constant movement in the background make the film extremely atmospheric. Along with a powerful and unforgettable soundtrack. You'll be sucked into the animated world in no time.<br/><br/>The story like I said is very complicated, and will require multiple viewing to fully understand. Basically in a nutshell the film is about a secret army experiment on ESP that can render a test subject so powerful he/she can destroy with only their will. The main characters come from a motorcycle gang, the leader Kanada, and his friend Tetsuo. In one of the battles with a rival gang. Tetsuo was seriously injured and was taken to a military hospital, where he became a test subject for the army. He gained more and more power and finally escaped from the hospital. On the verge of insanity, Tetsuo swept through Tokyo with his supernatural abilities and it's up to Kanada and his rebel friend Kay, plus a trio of psionics to stop Tetsuo and prevent the destruction of the whole city, perhaps even the world.<br/><br/>If you want to fully appreciate AKIRA, i suggest you watch it at least 3 times so you can full piece together all the subplots.<br/><br/>I've said all I can about AKIRA. I can say no more if I do not wish to spoil the story for those of you who haven't seen it. All I can say is no matter if you are an Animation fan or not. Go rent AKIRA and enjoy it, you won't regret it. Because this is the best animation ever made and there'll never be one like it ever again."
"Amano","10","5","9","19 February 1999"," Confusing to the weak of mind. The best anime film ever.
","The first time I saw Akira was when I was young.  I remember thinking that the animation was superb but it was not until recently that I discovered it's true beauty.  The plot, whilst complicated, is a tremendous example of imagination and foresight.  The film draws you in and you really get a feeling of empathy for the characters.  I recommend this film whole-heartedly to anyone who wants more than stunning visuals and violence (Akira has a balance of both)."
"siblyn","2","13","31","25 April 2005"," Neverending annoyance
","It is an okay animation nothing close to the ghost in the shell class, in any category you can take. I was suggested that I would like this movie if I liked GITS. what happened? I was so enraged by that suggestion. So here I am warning GITS fans. If you like most animation movies, you might like this one too. If you even like the ones that are conceived with some adolescent's level ambiguous maturity without much character development you might like this movie too. Otherwise you should stay clear of this. I cant think of anything commendable about this movie. That makes me really wonder how the movie has been given such a good rating."
"kanada","10","8","17","23 March 1999"," Excellent film: One of the best ever made
","AKIRA is more than just a good film.  It is flat out great.  Its story is unequaled in the movie business and it is by far the best anime ever made, LODOSS being a close second.  But many people are turned off from AKIRA by reviews about its bloodbath and intense violence.  In fact, there is hardly ant blood in the movie.  A lot of people die, but much of it is not graphically shown.  Anyone 14 and above can, and should see this movie. It is appropriate, if the viewer is mature of mind, and delves into the realm of the human psyche vividly.  For anyone who loves real ""ART"", completely drawn except for one scene, and of a truly high caliber of films, then AKIRA is for you.  I have not seen the Subtitled version, but the dubbed one is extremely good and easy to follow the second time through.  LONG LIVE AKIRA!!!"
"GoldenEye","5","8","17","29 October 2001"," Overrated and nonsensical
","I don't care if I anger every so-called ""otaku"" out there that loves this movie, but I must say that Akira is certainly NOT the best anime out there. Akira does have its qualities, such as the intense motorcycle chases throughout the movie, and as with all anime, the superb attention to detail is not lacking a bit.       However, Akira suffers from a severely disjointed story. I know that almost all animes have plots that are confusing, but Akira tops almost all of them. I could understand the whole government testing idea, but the plot present at the last half of the movie about psychic powers and stuff lost me. The movie holds up very well until the testing begins, and the climax is disgustingly absurd. The writers offer little to no explanation of half the events in this movie, and I feel that this is what killed the film, along with the badly-drawn Dragonball Z-type characters. If you want to see good anime see anything by Hayao Miyazaki. 1-10  Overall--5.5 Direction--6 Story--2.5 Visuals--8.5"
"fjhuerta-2","4","9","20","23 September 2001"," Great visuals, bad plot (remember Battlefield Earth?)
","((Warning: MILD spoilers ahead))<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>* Very nice animation, although it sometimes seems choppy and other times it is as detailed as a Saturday morning cartoon. I wonder if there was more than one team working on this movie, since the animation quality is not consistent.<br/><br/>* Special effects. The streaking lights on the motorbikes are superb, and they compliment the action nicely.<br/><br/>* 5.1 / THX soundtrack. In DVD format, this movie has terrific sound and video quality.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>* Forget about understanding the plot if you never read the comic.<br/><br/>* Editing is terrible. Imagine a cartoon version of Battlefield Earth (minus the dorky angles, terrible acting, and blandness). It all adds up to a confusing mess of a movie.<br/><br/>* The pacing is bad. The first half of the movie goes by pretty quickly. The second half is boring and confusing.<br/><br/>The ugly:<br/><br/>* What's up with the scenes where a 15 year old has her clothes ripped off and she is clobbered viciously? Isn't this illegal? Bad taste... really bad taste.<br/><br/>* Vices galore. Drinking, drug abuse, and violence. I thought these were only Hollywood traits.<br/><br/>* The level of aggresivity in this movie is way high. Way too high. It makes Fight Club seem tame in comparison. We get the idea on the first motorcycle scene; so why emphasize it over and over again during the entire picture? Is this a trick to make us believe the movie is great, when in reality it is just violent?<br/><br/>The verdict: you might have to watch it once, since it is really interesting (much more than the overrated Ghost in the Shell), but it is ultimately confusing, a bit boring, and unfulfilling. It's one of those movies you come out with a feeling of emptiness you didn't have in the first place."
"binmaze","4","10","23","20 September 2002"," Way hyped.
","You can summarize story of Akira into this one line: ""There was an energy named Akira.""<br/><br/>SO WHAT?<br/><br/>The painting 'was' marvelous at that time. But for now, that is out-dated.<br/><br/>Boo. 7.6 rating score for this candy-looking movie with no meaning at all but just pretending being serious? It's no better than Final Fantasy Movie."
"ivans536","6","6","12","5 February 2019"," Overrated & Overlong
","Heard a lot about Akira prior to watching it, both about it's quality and cultural impact, and since usually I'm a mild fan of Japanese animation, I had very high expectations for this film.<br/><br/>I was let down.<br/><br/>Although the movie is very stylish and the story has promise at first, the movie is simply overlong and almost impossible to get through in one sitting. It has a lot of potential and has great word-of-mouth referances so it's surprising that even though it boasts a huge run time for an anime, the characterization is still paper thin, and by the end of the movie you are left thinking of what happened and more importantly, why."

","While trying to concentrate on watching the rest of this movie, I just couldn't keep up with it. There was too much action going on and like it made it hard for me to understand what was actually happening. Yeah I know its about a boy in a motorcycle gang who are trying to defeat a government who kidnapped their friend. However, I found that things all came at once.<br/><br/>I don't understand why Kanye West or anyone would call this a masterpiece because its so confusing and you have to keep up with it, otherwise you would be lost as me. I've watched better anime's then this I'm afraid........."
"danieljameslearmouth","9","6","12","27 November 2011"," A treasure from the archives of Japanese animation
","In 1988, Western audiences hadn't really acknowledged Japanese animation, despite the popularity of the Gundam franchise. Even so, that didn't stop the creation of one of the most acclaimed anime films to date - 'Akira'.<br/><br/>The film is set in 2020, 32 years after the detonation of a bomb which wiped Tokyo right off the map. A new city was built there to take its place, called Neo-Tokyo (much like Tokyo-3 for Evangelion). Society at that time is at its lowest, and Neo-Tokyo is a breeding ground for anarchy and destruction. Shotaro Kaneda (Johnny Yong Bosch) and Tetsuo Shima (Joshua Seth) are bikers in a gang, who fight a rival biker gang called the Clowns. One night, however, Tetsuo sees a child on a highway, but before he can slow down he runs into him...but the child survived, and vanished. Tetsuo is injured, and lifted to hospital. Or rather, a research centre. It is assumed that Tetsuo carries a power very similar to what Akira had at the time of Tokyo's destruction. Kaneda and a few others have made the assumption that Tetsuo, if left to live, would potentially end the world, and it is left to Kaneda to kill Tetsuo before he can destroy the world.<br/><br/>When this got an English dub some time in the late '80s, it was heavily frowned upon, and a second English dub was done in 2001, with the voice actors I mentioned a moment ago, as well as newer voice actors, like Michelle Ruff and Sandy Fox. This review is based around the later English dub.<br/><br/>The animation is pretty old, but a lot of it is still amazing to look at. It's one of the most complex anime to have been produced; it used more colours than conventional anime at the time, and used three to four times as many frames as a conventional anime as well. It must have been an absolute nightmare to get the cels to make it.<br/><br/>The voice acting in the newer English dub is improved greatly, in comparison to the first dub. While the film is still relatively better in Japanese, it's still much better than the original English dub from the '80s. And at least this dub has all the original scenes, as well as voice acting that fits most mouth movements, even though they all differ.<br/><br/>The characters aren't very highly developed, though we can assume they are mostly orphans, Kaneda and Tetsuo especially, as they are both taken into an orphanage. We do learn a bit about them, but if you want character development, read the 6-part manga; it's much more developed. You can't get a 6-part manga into a 2-hour film. Hell, the manga hadn't even ended at the time of the film's production.<br/><br/>The music was produced by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, a collective of workers by day, but spiritual Noh performers by night. The music is one of the best things about the film; it's enchanting, and fits many of the situations in the film. Even if you don't like traditional Japanese music, you can't really deny the music is beautiful.<br/><br/>This film has perhaps some of the most bizarre scenes in anime, where Tetsuo breaks free from hospital with his girlfriend Kaori (Michelle Ruff), and ride on Kaneda's powerbike. Needless to say, Kaneda chases them, and gets to the scene of an incident where Tetsuo is knocked down to the ground and Kaori too, with her top ripped open. Kaneda arrives and stopped the Clowns from burning his bike. Tetsuo proceeds to brutally beat up one of the Clowns, but Kaneda intervenes and stops him. Tetsuo begins to suffer from a chronic headache, and ends up with hallucinations, first of the ground crumbling before him, and the seconds his internal organs simply falling from his body. That particular scene was excluded from the original English dub, and that gave the movie a 12 rating as a result. It's incredibly creepy when all is considered, and fairly awkward for Tetsuo, because his guts didn't spontaneously collapse from his body at all.<br/><br/>While 'Ghost in the Shell' failed to popularise the anime genre to Western audiences, 'Akira' did introduce a lot of people to a lesser child-oriented form of animation, and with it came the path for other anime to be introduced to Western audiences; 'Perfect Blue', 'Evangelion' and even 'Ghost in the Shell'<br/><br/>I will say there are very few flaws in the film. However, the film is a little too complicated for some, considering its apocalyptic story. And while at times there is a little humour, it's a little too serious whilst trying to be funny, which is very much awkward.<br/><br/>Because of how much of a cult phenomenon it is, it gets 94%. It's one of the best classic anime to have been released, and still holds a lot of meaning to anyone around the world. Just...don't go crazy while watching it."
"undeaddt","8","4","7","20 March 2019"," The best hand-drawn thing I have seen in my life.
","This is by far the best hand-drawn animation I've seen in my entire life and it surpasses every single anime that is praised for the hand-drawn animation like Dragonball, Naruto and many other anime series. It has been made in 1988 and it is way ahead of it's time, Disney is just a copycat in my eyes from now on for me. The story is complicated and deep and altho I understood some of it, I know that if I watch it at least one more time everything will get clearer, especially the ending. An amazing piece of art that has a bigger meaning than many live action movies that are praised for the same reason."
"rjciez","4","4","7","19 May 2013"," Not my cup of tea, but the animation is great
","(Dubbed version). I was really interested in watching ""Akira"", since everybody still mentions it as a cornerstone of Japanese animation, 25 years after its release (1988).<br/><br/>You van definitely tell that the animation still looks pretty good, 25 years after. A lot of details in the backgrounds, and the way the main characters were draw. It is important to also mention, that the scenes of violence and topics covered (anarchy, experimentation in human subjects) were not common in animation by 1988 (at least in western animation, which is the one I am familiar with), which is probably also one of things that makes it a hallmark in animation.<br/><br/>However, after watching the movie, I was never too engaged with the plot. In my opinion, there were too many things going at the same time (the fight of Kei's revolutionary group, what was the whole point of the ester's, the concept of the internal energy in every human) that did not allow me to focus in any of them, so I felt the narrative and the story a bit chopped.<br/><br/>I know it might be because they tried to condensate a whole manga into a movie, but these should be 2 independent pieces of art, the movie should not rely on you reading the book to understand it, otherwise what is the point.<br/><br/>Overall, I was not fully satisfied by the movie, making it an experience that I did not hate neither enjoy. (I learned also that I am not the biggest fan of Cyberpunk, as Akira belongs to this SciFi genre) Score (5)"
"marshmellyjellybelly","6","4","7","28 August 2012"," Decent, okay; just highly overrated.
","After hearing many reviews on AKIRA being such a highly praised, groundbreaking anime film and cult classic among anime lovers, I decided to finally watch it to see what the hype was all about. Suffice to say, I was left pretty disappointed. I'll start with the mechanics of the film. I must say that the animation is very well done for the time the film was created. Of course, modern animation (whether two or three dimensional) is much more dynamic by today's standards, but context is everything. Visually, it was pretty impressive, especially the action scenes, and the detailings of the setting. It fully captures the essence of dark, grim, and futuristic, dystopian Tokyo on the verge of an apocalypse. So, on to what I didn't like about the film. I felt as if most of the characters very one-dimensional and dull, even the main characters Tetsuo and Kaneda. Tetsuo and Kaneda's relationship could've been a lot more developed, but they failed to do so. Immediately, we are thrust into a major plot point where Tetsuo gets injured. There was no time for the development of their relationship, which only could've taken a few scenes to animate. Instead, I felt as if there were a lot of unnecessary scenes with irrelevant dialogue throughout the film, dragging the film out longer than it should. Later on in the film, we find out that Tetsuo is struggling with his identity and role in his friendship with Kaneda. There is obviously a difference in status and lack of balance in power within their relationship. Again, these concepts are implied and underdeveloped. I felt that Kaneda's bike gang didn't have much development as well. Rather than a close-knit and loyal gang, it felt more like just an ordinary gang that was just ""there"" to fill in spots for characters. Also, the plot of the story was not difficult to catch on, but it took awhile to fully grasp the big picture, since the film is dragged out longer than it should. It got confusing at times and even convoluted, leaving the audience with many unanswered questions. Overall, AKIRA was not that bad. It was sort of decent, just highly overrated. I do understand why AKIRA may have been hailed as a ""classic,"" as the animation, plot line, and overall themes of the film were pretty original and groundbreaking material for anime during that time, as well as the fact that it was introduced to the Western audience when anime was not very common and popular. A lot of people may have nostalgic attachments to this film, but from a more unbiased point of view, I didn't think it was that great and there are a lot more anime films that are much better."
"jboothmillard","8","4","7","21 February 2011"," Akira
","I had heard about this from many sources, saying it was the greatest Japanese Anime film in the Manga category, it features alongside other Animes I have seen, such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it had to be worth it. Basically thirty one years ago an atom bomb exploded and vapourised Tokyo, leading to World War III, now in the future, 2019, the city has been rebuilt on the artificial Tokyo Bay, where terrorism and violence is gripping everyone. In amongst the this are The Capsules biker gang leader Shotaro Kaneda (Johnny Yong Bosch) and his friend Tetsuo Shima (Joshua Seth) who go against rival gang The Clowns. Near the end of a chase, Tetsuo ends up crashing his motorcycle, after almost hitting a child that will be mentioned later, and captured by armed soldiers, while Kaneda are the gang are taken for questioning. The Colonel - Col. Shikishima (Jamieson Price) and The Doctor - Doctor Onishi (Simon Prescott/Isaacson) of a secret government project discover Tetsuo has mental powers similar to the little boy who caused the explosion that destroyed the city, Akira, so naturally they decide to keep him in captivity and will kill him if his powers get out of control. But Tetsuo escapes the facility and meets up with girlfriend Kaori (Michelle Ruff), and after Kaneda joins them and stops an assault by The Clowns, Tetsuo experiences a painful headache. Taken away again by a government van, he goes to military hospital, where he is attempted to be killed by The Espers, Masaru (?), Takashi (Cody MacKenzie) and Kiyoko (Sandy Fox), of course with his power growing this only makes it worsen. After going on a rampage, Tetsuo stops off at a cryogenic storage facility below Neo-Tokyo's new Olympic Stadium, and that's how he finds out about Akira and the powers he had. Kaneda and Kei (Wendee Lee) meanwhile are determined to stop Tetsuo from becoming more powerful that he may lose his mind completely and destroy the city, Kaneda's right-hand Yamagata 'Yama' (Michael Lindsay) gets killed, and Kaneda is now out for revenge on Tetsuo. He meanwhile has returned to the Akira cryogenic chamber, where the Colonel is waiting to try and stop him, Kaneda soon arriving as well, but any attacks on Tetsuo fail, apart from removing his right arm. At the Stadium Tetsuo grows himself a new arm from non-organic components, like machinery, and Kaori arrives to see the power he now possesses, and that is when they go out of control and he starts growing. Continuing to grow into a large blob creature, and killing Kaori inside, the Colonel tries to make go back to the lab, but he just attacks, but Kaneda arrives, with the Espers protection, to stop him. In the end though, the explosion does happen, and all the Espers can do is teleport the Colonel and Kaneda to safety, with flashes of Tetsuo's memory showing, and they return to see most of the city destroyed in the glistening sunrise. Also starring Mike Reynolds/Ray Michaels as Mr. Nezu and Matthew 'Masamune' Mercer/Miller as Kaisuke 'Kai'. I have to say firstly, I had almost no idea what was going on throughout, the story was confusing and complicated, but I think this is one of the only times where I can forgive that, because it is so good. I recognised the most fantastic sequence, where Tetsuo becomes a mechanical blob monster, because it was spoofed in the ""Trapper Keeper"" episode of South Park, but there are so many great moments that will blow your mind. Director and creator of the comic strip Katsuhiro Ã”tomo went over budget creating many night sequences with fantastically vast looking cityscapes, with marvellous use of colours, great camera-work, wonderfully disturbing material and design ahead of its time, this is an amazing animated science-fiction action fantasy. It was number 16 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!"
"eightspeeder","10","4","7","3 July 2006"," a great, but loose, adaptation of great manga
","Katsuhiro Otomo wasn't even finished with his sprawling, 6-volume, 2,000 page epic Akira when he got together with a huge team of animators to make the film. The books were hugely ambitious, combining Buddhist-influenced ruminations on the evolution of intelligence (What if something like an amoeba were given the power of a human? What if a human were given power far beyond itself?) with a sci-fi/action plot taking place in a post- annihilation Tokyo, featuring everything from teenage motorcycle gangs, covert military psionics research, and something called ""Akira"". In the film, Akira is a perpetual mystery. Until fairly close to the end, we can only guess from the facial expressions of those in the know whenever the name is uttered. In the books, however, Akira appears by book 2 of 6 and features heavily in the rest of the story. This is the main difference between the books and the film: While the film builds to one massive climax, the books have several gigantic climaxes along the way and, therefore, quite a few more notable characters. Lady Miyako, for instance, is a huge character in the books, but only glimpsed twice in the film, and only from afar. Joker, the head of the rival Clowns biker gang, only features in the opening sequence of the film and has no lines, whereas in the books he remains important until the end as an actual character. Other such massive aspects of the books' plot, such as the Neo-Tokyo Empire and the covert American military operations to stop it, are completely left out of the film. But somehow, all this shedding of material that seems quite important in the books only distills Akira down to its essentials. It keeps the jaw-dropping action sequences and the philosophical weight while slimming down the narrative structure to something that feels like a much more natural fit for film. The core characters - Kaneda, Tetsuo, Kei - are still fleshed out extremely well. All in all, though the actual worlds of the books and the film are quite different, it would be impossible to say either world is better (though more hardcore fans will definitely pick the books since there is simply much more to sink your teeth into). So I recommend you watch this film, though not on an occasion where you just want something light and fluffy. It's dark, it's a bit gory, and most of all, it's extremely heavy. If you come away wanting more, then you should definitely check out the books."

","Not often does a movie come out that has both kick-ass action and storyline, but also a deep hidden meaning and some huge questions. 2001 must have been one of the first, even though it's ""coolness"" has faded over four decades. Since then, every now and then movie-makers has decided to coat existentialism with action-packed innovation. Matrix is one of the latest to mix the two in a good way.<br/><br/>Akira is another of those movies. The story starts out on a pretty basic level but quickly unfolds at a brisk rate which forces you as a viewer to keep your eyes peeled. This is made very easy in Akira by the amazing visuals, the fast and sometimes mysterious storyline and a kicking soundtrack.<br/><br/>Akira is raw and uncompromising, the action is over-the-top and spectacular, the setting(Neo-Tokyo) is fantastic, and the characters intriguing. At the end of the movie, we also get a good dose of theology/science ideas thrown at us for good measure. Combine all of these and you're in for quite a ride.<br/><br/>Akira was one of the movies that started the Manga phenomena outside Japan. It's not hard to see why. Even though I've seen very little Manga, the few movies I have seen has convinced me that the Japanese have a lethal advantage over Western animation. Nothing wrong with that either. The best outcome is, of course, that Hollywood smartens up and starts to come up with some cool ideas themselves. We'll just have to wait and see. Until that happens, there's still a ton of Japanese movies to see."

","I really don't have much affinity for anime. I love animated films, but, frankly, beyond Miyazaki, I'm not a fan of this distinctly eastern artform. Ninja Scroll and Ghost in the Shell mean nothing to me. Though a typical anime film in many ways, Akira seems different from all the rest. It's a fascinating film with wonderful animation, and it doesn't contain the softcore pornography that often passes for artistry in the anime world. <br/><br/>It's been several years since I last saw this film, so only moments remain. What I remember: the apocalyptic showdown and some demented teddy bear spewing milk while the eeriest music I've ever heard plays. First, lets take the apocalypse--I love apocalyptic works of art; Mad Max, the Watchmen, Threads, etc. all had a tremendous impact on me growing up. Perhaps because I grew during an era of nuclear proliferation, I have always been terrified of World War III. Watching the Russian tanks travel across the wasteland of Afghanistan remains with me to this day, as does the fear that accompanied those images. Akira, at its end, taps into those childhood fears and those experiences awaiting the end of the world as we know it. This is an incredibly personal reaction, I realize, but one that I probably share with a lot of people between the ages of 25 and 40. <br/><br/>And then there's the teddy bear. It's probably the single most disorienting and frightening scene in the history of animated film. While in a hospital room (and while probably drugged, I don't remember), one of the characters has visions of two stuffed animals grow to gigantic proportions. Milk starts pouring out of them (I think, maybe I'm imagining all of this) and this strange, frightening music plays. It's terrifying and brilliant. One should watch the film if only for those two scenes. <br/><br/>The story, as I remember it, is fun as well, involving secret government tests and such. It's got a whiff of conspiracy to it, and that tends to make things better. All in all, a great little movie. If you like cinema at all, see it, and, if you think you don't like anime, then watch this and be amazed that you can stomach the stuff."

And you will look back with sorrow at all the wasted AKIRA free years and think,""why did someone not tell me about this film"", this is the only Japanese animie film i have seen but it will not be the last AKIRA has opened my eyes to a different kind of film, a kind of film without actors that are in love with themselves and in which the word impossible is nonexistent i hope you will take my advise and go out and buy AKIRA right now...stop reading this and buy it!"

But I really do feel without a film like Akira, people like the Wachowski brothers, Quentin Tarantino and Doug Linam even wouldn't have half the creative juices flowing in their head from the explosion of vivid storytelling, fascinating narrative (even if it was in Japanese) and amazing detail.<br/><br/>This movie is ground breaking on so many levels its mind boggling, the story is a bit out their, but someone please tell me which Manga ain't, in fact you can't tell me Lord of the Rings or Star Wars aren't ""far out there"" stories either, at least Akira is set in Tokyo a real place ! With great characters you really feel immersed in the plot of the movie and Tetsuo's roller-coaster ride is portrayed beautifully. But this movie is all about Kaneda, what a guy, if a young teenager needs someone to idolise its this street punk, who has a chip on his shoulder throughout this movie and tries his best to keep his best friend Tetsuo from falling deeper into a black hole. Great storytelling Watch this movie at all costs and watch it WITH SUBTITLES otherwise you loose a lot of the essence of the movie the same way Crouching Tiger or house of flying daggers would be tarnished from a dubbing.......

"juubei-2","10","4","7","21 October 2005"," Life-changing.
","Like the introductory nuke that sets up the back story, Akira exploded upon the western hemisphere with the power of 10'000 pounds of pure TNT. Wasn't animation supposed to be cute? Wasn't there supposed to be song and dance routines, fluffy animal sidekicks and good old fashioned morals interspersed between moments of slapstick comedy and saucer-eyed shenanigans? Thankfully, in Japan they do things differently; in Japan, animation is cool.<br/><br/>Akira blew my mind when I saw it at the impressionable age of 15. I wasn't a complete noob, but still I had no idea what I was in for when I popped that crispy VHS tape into my noisy VCR. This movie had everything my teenage fantasies craved; ultra stylized and ultra violent sci-fi action more than a decade before the Matrix with production values that (now) nearly 20 years old still rock. There are scenes in this film drawn with more precision than a computer rendering, that look more alive because of that added human touch.<br/><br/>And there's a story to go with it. My animation instructor claimed Akira had nothing more than people yelling at each other in it (he was a little biased tho, having been influenced by only the western animation greats like ... well, none of their names come to mind because I was only influenced by Japanese ones! No wait, Tex Avery, got one! hah!...) Needless to say, I pity him and never did forgive him for his stupidity.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece, something that must be seen. The original Streamline dub is better than the new Panasonic one, even though it is probably less accurate it left more to the imagination. But don't let that or the steep asking price deter you from the new DVD. There's tons of special features, from the Akira production report (30 mins) to 100s of character designs and background paintings to frame through. And the digital mastering brings out the picture and color in a way that makes my VHS tape weep tears of joy.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, I can't give AKIRA a higher recommendation."

","I know I'm a little late with this review but after seeing this movie I've got to say something about Akira. Directer Katshiro Otoma has made quite the piece of work. Akira has the most original story and captivating characters ever seen in an animated film and perhaps a real film too. <br/><br/>Shotaro Kaneda ( Japanese voice by Mitsuo Iwata) is the leader of a Neo-Tokyo bike gang. Along his side as one of the other gang members is Tetsuo Shima (Japanese voice by Nozomu Sasaki). When a secret military experiment is thrown in the picture turning Tetsuo into a crazed psionic killing freak Kaneda and his gang must save Tetsuo and save Neo-Tokyo at the same time. <br/><br/>This movie goes beyond any other anime film ever. Even the widely known Princess Mononke. The movie is fast paced and the characters are well thought-out. Akira goes down as the greatest anime film of all time. 9/10."

","(****) Out of four stars<br/><br/>Akira is far underrated, and should be easily in the top 250 movies. The story is innovative, and draws you into the plot in a matter of minutes. The surreal and futuristic society portrayed, is one that few if any other movies can match. The music and cinematography intermix perfectly, as Kaneda and Tetsuo lead the cast in a whirlwind of explosions, mystery, and mesmerizing visuals.<br/><br/>The story opens with a cataclysmic explosion, that sets the pace for the rest of the movie, and then from there goes into a heart-racing bike chase, in which Kaneda's superiority over Tetsuo is established.<br/><br/>From here on out, words cannot describe the visual aspects of the film, and the plot line is unlike anything that you can read.

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>I have no doubt that the first time most westerners watch this they will feel confused afterwards. I'm pretty sure that the first time they see it they will think the animation was very good. Maybe some will know they have just seen something special. Akira is probably the most famous Japanese animated movie, manga or anime, and is surely the most influential. it may not be an exaggeration to say it is one of the most influential movies of any kind ever, as many films, animated and not, have taken elements directly from it.<br/><br/>I won't try to summarise the plot, i'm not sure if i can make it sound comprehensible, but it involves biker gangs, friendship, overpowering technology, and the apocalypse. The plot is confusing, especially for western audiences who had simply not experienced anything quite like this before, and the frantic pace and quick direction only make everything seem more chaotic (as if that wasn't the point to some degree), but the more you watch it, the more you will see this is not a flaw. The animation is some of the best ever seen, the picture it gives of Neo-Tokyo is stunning, and the last half hour is mind-blowing. Some parts are very touching too, as we watch Tesuo's struggle, and the multitude of themes are well worth thinking about when you can't sleep or are drunk, stoned, whatever.. 8 out of 10"

","This is the ""Watchmen"" of the Orient. An awesome masterpiece which has so much to say to young people. The struggle in 2019 in Neo-Tokyo by the orphaned teenagers is our struggle. We identify with Tetsuo and his horrifying decent from childhood into manhood and beyond. A marvelous superhero story and the human relations. Tetsuo´s girlfriend and ""best friend"" we know and understand these problems. Akira remains the elusive opponent of Tetsuo. But in reality the battle is not between Tetsuo and Akira but between Tetsuo, his friends and the leaders of Neo-Tokyo. I cannot emphasize how much I recommend this movie. It is the animated version of Kurosawa blending with the modern art of Tsukamoto´s ""Tetsuo"" which is definitely build on ""Akira"". I didn´t know that until I saw it today. I guess it has something to do with the Japanese concept of ""Manga"". Anyhow, don´t believe the ""low"" rating for Akira on IMDB. This is one of the most important films ever made. 10/10."

","Thank You Katsuhiro Otomo for opening my eyes to the wonderful world of Anime. Akira was the first anime I ever watched, though I was young at the time. The spectacular animation blew me away.<br/><br/>Akira is what I now call an Onion film. Not because it makes you cry but every time you watch it you understand more of the complex storyline and characters. Now to address the DVD problem Only in Australia do you get the original dubbed English dialogue which if you have watched Akira you know the classic lines. But in the US that DVD has more features. I was disappointed in the way the ""new americian"" dialogue over simplified the old dialogue. The mysterious and deep dialogue died. I shall give you an example. Here is a line that is not in the movie but demostrates how the new US dialogue is bad Old US dialogue dub ""Akira is a highly powerful entinty"" New US dialogue Dub ""Akira is a very powerful guy""<br/><br/>Now back to Akira"" The old US dialogue version"" , after the first viewing of the movie you understand a little bit of Akira then I advise you to watch it several times over a year or two and delve deeper into the story. But if you find it confusing then walk away and pick up the Manga graphic novel of Akira and it will explain all."
"THE_Tetsuo","10","4","7","22 September 2003"," One of the best films of all time
","This isn't just the best anime of all time.  I feel that it trancends its boundaries as an ""anime"" film and can rank amongst the all-time greats. What many don't understand in their haste to compare this to films like Princess Mononoke or Ghost in the Shell is that it came out about 12 and 7 years before those films, respectively.  Akira was so far ahead of its time, that it's actually aged very well.<br/><br/>The story, centering around two members of a biker gang, actually goes so far in depth about the nature of their friendship that you actually forget about the theme of ""man vs. nature"" in the story.  The SE DVD was done really well and it plays really well on a good home theatre system.<br/><br/>You can't possibly think of a film this layered as just another Japanese cartoon.  It set a high water mark for anime and along with films like Macross and Vampire Hunter D; was very instrumental in anime crossing the pacific to enjoy widespread popularity in the U.S.<br/><br/>The only complaint I could think of at the moment is that much of the plot was toned down from the even more adult themes of the comic book anime that this was based on.  Although many people think that the original dubbed voices were poorly done, I think that they gave the movie some extra character and charm."

The story, animation, everything is perfect.  The soundtrack is something else, absolutely the best I know and a piece of art in its own right -- the voices of the dolls Akira sees in his nightmare, for example, are pygmies, not children or a studio effect.  I bought the OST as a super expensive import CD for one of my girl friends, and the daft cow completely failed to appreciate it ... oh well, her loss.<br/><br/>This movie makes Disney look very, very old.

","""Akira"" is one of the most visually potent animated films of all time.  Set in a darkly futuristic version of modern-day Tokyo, this tale tells of several people trying to stop mentally unbalanced adolescent from turning the city into rubble by the use of enhanced mental abilities.  I have seen this movie twice and I still cannot believe how spooky and disturbing it is. The plot is hard enough to follow that it might require a second viewing. This is a movie to watch if you really to have some fun experiencing the anime genre.<br/><br/>The animation is exceptional considering it came out before the advent of computer-assisted animation.  Now, it looks even better since it is digitally remastered.  I believe this is the best animated work to have come out of the Land of the Rising Sun.  It is quiet possibly the most beautiful classically (aka sans computer assistance) animated film of all time even though it was probably one of the last ones to ever be made in the classic sense.  <br/><br/>Overall, Katsuhiro Otomo has created visual and even psychological potpourri that will leave an etch on the psyche of animation for all time despite the country of origin.  Animated films that were released after ""Akira"" and that have yet to be released have looked and will continue to look ""Akira"" for inspiration because of how groundbreaking it actually was.

A second factor that probably drew in even deeper, was the musical score.  It is definitely the best I've ever heard.  The violence here isn't really as graphic as some people have made it out to be.  Yes, people get shot, yes there are bodies exploding, yes when people get punched or hit by foreign objects, blood does flow, but all the blood and gore here is sustained.  I won't lie.

"Per_Klingberg","10","4","7","28 April 2003"," A blending mix of beauty, ultraviolence, action and intelligence
","First of all, let's state that 'Akira' definitely holds interest for cineasts in general, not only those with an interest in anime.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to say that I'm not as familiar with the original manga (=comic book) 'Akira' as I would like to be, but the graphic novels are kind of hard to get by where I live and expensive.<br/><br/>I do know however that the film translation of 'Akira' doesn't come close to match the rich intrigue presented in the manga, and that many characters have been given less importance and screening time, if any at all. Then again, not too surprising, considering the comic was running for over ten years.<br/><br/>The setting of the movie is in Neo-Tokyo, about 38 years after a mysterious and extremely lethal weapon wiped the whole original town out. That's when World War Three started: since then most of the town has been rebuilt, except for the heart of the city that to this day remains empty. Post-war Japan is far from a peaceful and stable place to be in, though. Both religious fanatics, awaiting the return of the great 'Akira', and discontent revolutionaries cause violent riots from time to time, which is violently struck down by the military. There is also a great deal of unrest in the government: corrupt politicians and an army, that will maintain order at any cost, fight about who's more fit to save Neo-Tokyo from itself.<br/><br/>*I wouldn't call this a spoiler really, rather an introduction to the plot - but I figured I'd give a warning first. You decide*<br/><br/>All this political nonsense doesn't get to social misfits and vigilant bikers Kaneda and Tetsuo though. They're just happy to hang around the local bar with bikerfriends...oh, and that occasional pill and bloody confrontation with other gangs of course.<br/><br/>All this changes though when their gang is racing around in the heart of old Tokyo, after a confrontation with nemesises 'The Clowns'. Tetsuo collides with an odd-looking boy, standing in the middle of the road. Though Tetsuo is seriously hurt, the boy not only remains without a scratch but disappears right in front of Kaneda's eyes. From this on, things just get shadier and shadier...the military is called in, and Tetsuo is taken away. Through his encounter with this mysterious boy it seems something has awakened in Tetsuo. Something extremely special - or something extremely dangerous. In his search for his lost friend, Kaneda gets in touch with enigmatic and attractive revolutionary Kei and soon finds him drawn into something way beyond his understanding. Politicians, revolutionaries, scientists and army alike seems to have their mind bent on something mysterious called 'Akira'. But exactly what is it, and why are they so anxious to get to it?<br/><br/>*End of possible spoiler*<br/><br/>'Akira' is usually described mostly as a violent movie, not giving much thought for plot or moral. Don't let them fool you: though it cannot be denied that it contains a fair amount of violent action - and at some points - gore, this is a movie with an extremely rich plot and complex intrigues. It constantly keeps you on the edge, even after a couple of viewings, and I always find new dimensions to it. Also, Katsuhiro Ötomo's truly creates something unique and stunningly beautiful with his portrait of a Tokyo close to the brink of ruin. And then there's the music...or the ending...to put it short, never before has the apocalypse been so beautiful.<br/><br/>10/10"
"bosochima","4","7","15","17 March 2002"," Less Than What I Expected
","I am not familiar with anime, or Japanimation, or manga, or any other sort of Asian animation style. I watched Akira because of its reputation as one of the best films of its genre. Evaluating Akira as a film, however, as opposed to a cultural phenomenon, I thought it was disappointing. The animation style is very detailed and glossy, although in 2002 (with films such as Shrek, Toy Story, Final Fantasy, and Waking Life in circulation) the visuals in Akira are nothing special - they even seem somewhat dated. What really bothered me about the film was the lack of interesting characters, uneven pacing, and an alternately boring and incoherent plot. What could have been an interesting story about human evolution and government conspiracies gets stuck in a teenage biker gang soap opera before falling off the metaphysical deep end in the last twenty minutes. This might make sense to people who are familiar with anime styles and stories (I think that Akira was a book before it became a film), but speaking as someone who is not versed in that folklore I was left scratching my head in confusion and not enjoying this cinematic experience. I give the film 4/10."

","This was the game changer? Really? Wow. I can't believe that a movie with such poor writing is considered one of the all-time greats, the anime that brought the medium to The West. Its 2 hours long, but its worse than Genocyber in terms of character development and explanation. I felt helpless as the plot unfolded, each point more out-of-damn-nowhere than the last. Things only happen because Akira wants them to. Who cares about logic? <br/><br/>As if there's a reward for interpreting the cryptic writing. These characters are awful. Most of the cast has no personality beyond their role: ""biker"", ""colonel"", ""scientist"", or ""politician"". The two lone exceptions are Tetsuo and Kaneda. Tetsuo apparently has a huge inferiority complex that makes him homicidal immediately after getting his powers. We barely see him struggle, but we hear him b!?$% about it throughout. Kaneda is just a dumbass. Rude, violent, and annoying, without any backstory. Instead of creating a strong relationship between these two, all we get is bike chase scenes and yelling the other's name.<br/><br/>The saddest part is, honestly, the animation is among the best out there. The level of detail on such a grandiose city is astounding. The animation is smooth, and it overall conveys the dark tone. The weird moans and yells of the soundtrack also strangely work out. Too bad its wasted! <br/><br/>This is one of the worst written films I've seen. Akira cares far more about fast bikes and bloody deaths than character development. Not one character resonated with me, and the ass-pull ending was emotional anti-matter. I hate this movie."

Even if you have a really good story, the animation seems so rudimentary. Are we to praise this film for its story and ignore its lackluster animation? Apparently so. Either that, or most people really like the animation. I just do not see it.<br/><br/>But everyone has their tastes.

","The hype built around ""Akira"" is there for a reason; see this animated film for yourself and get ready to have your mind blown. It's 2019, post World War 3 Tokyo, now Neo-Tokyo. Shotaro Kaneda (voiced by Mitsuo Iwata) is the leader of the Capsules Biker gang. While out fighting their rivals, Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima (voiced by Nozomu Sasaki) nearly crashes into a small, odd-looking child. Tetsuo is injured and taken away by government agents, who discover that his brain patterns are very unusual. Colonel Shikishima (voiced by Taro Ishida) orders experimenting to begin on the boy, who begins to develop similar powers to Akira a mysterious boy with mental powers so powerful they were nearly god-like. The plot follows Kaneda, who allies himself with anti-government forces in the hopes of rescuing his friend and Tetsuo, whose growing abilities begin tearing at his sanity.<br/><br/>This film looks amazing. The post-war setting of 2019 Neo Tokyo makes for some truly incredible sights. This is one of those movies where any number of still could serve as backgrounds for your desktop because every little element is lush and detailed. Every frame was painstakingly hand-drawn and painted and you can tell everyone involved consistently delivered their best work. Every frame is beautiful and exciting to see. Populating this world is a story that fleshes out Neo-Tokyo and makes it seem very much alive. While we mostly follow Kaneda and Tetsuo, we also see glimpses of the rest of the population. We find out that there is political unrest between the youth of Japan and the corrupt government, that there is a religious cult following the mysterious Akira, that the youth who are disenchanted with rules and politics roam the streets, fighting each other and joining gangs. You get a glimpse at a world that's very interesting; just enough to get you worried when the climax of the film threatens it all.<br/><br/>If you're a big fan of animation and you want to break the stereotype that every animated film is for kids, this would be an excellent choice to show to the uninitiated. If you're not a fan of animation and you want to jump into the format, this is a great spot to go; no silly sequences where a character screams, but only his mouth moves or backgrounds are replaced with streaming lines here. There are some shocking moments of violence and some frightening sequences (mostly Tetsuo's hallucinations as he develops psychic powers) that are the stuff of nightmares. The story is complex, but not difficult to follow (kind of a must for a film that is subtitled and moves quickly) and the characters are well developed, with some nice subtle moments to them. It's all set to a fantastic score that's memorable and haunting, cleverly using vocals (but not necessarily words) and to me, what sounded like an extensive selection of wooden xylophones to generate a primal, haunting melody that hinted at the action that was incoming.<br/><br/>It all wraps itself up into an unforgettable climax and the film is filled with iconic moments that once you see, you will recognize in countless other films and stories. The film nevertheless stays fresh and stimulating throughout despite inspiring countless other filmmakers. I'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who I wouldn't recommend ""Akira"" to and if you can see it on the big screen, it's an engulfing experience you won't easily forget. Even you, that guy that doesn't really think of himself or herself as a person that likes animation, you have got to see this film. I can't believe it took me this long to finally get around to watching it. It actually makes me angry that someone didn't introduce it to me earlier!

Kaneda is more pure hearted – he IS indeed the leader, he had the same troubled childhood, but he always chose to fight, to excel in whatever he does – fighting schoolmates, kicking rival motor gang leaders in the teeth, picking up dangerous chicks, or fighting monsters to save the world. He is just always ahead of his mates, his friends, his rivals. He of that sort of people who is always surviving to be better than the others. Not because he is actually something more than them, but because he decided that fear is not the answer to all the troubles which the dark world around him presents to him. Something which Tetsuo cannot understand. And that's why Akira has to take Tetsuo to another place, where there are no rules, there is no life yet, and the little prick can create whole new galaxies, full of darkness and light, primal worlds where he is not being defined and defied – possibilities which doesn't come with limitations. This is why Kaneda is suited better for this dystopian world – he can channel his rage and angst into excelling as a motorcycle rider, fighter and survivor.<br/><br/>In our own modern world we strive to be better, but most of us are forced to compromise and suffer because of feeling fear and losing confidence and and resilience. It's essential to provoke every single day that same spark which we feel when watching Kaneda ride his bike. But most of the times we can't do that – every morning is a new opportunity to believe in the possibility of fulfilling our dreams. And right after that the day shows us that we simply cannot achieve everything as we want it. And then comes the fear. And the laziness which causes loss after loss. Because we simply cannot maintain that same level of excitement and energy which we had at one moment.<br/><br/>This is why we need remember that we are just a glimpse in history, a blink of an eye in the life of a galaxy – and we cannot live with fear and compromise all the time. It is important to overcome most of the problems so that we can succeed in being whatever we want to be and become. Just to live how we want to live it and not regret it. That's how the colonel and Kaneda live. And that's why they survive after all the destruction. Maybe the human DNA is indeed changing and at one time we might be able to achieve whatever we want without the need to devise this internal energy somehow.<br/><br/>Let's just enjoy the ride as we want it, and don't have any remorse about being good or bad."

","While the animation of Akira is impressive at the time of its release and no doubt still exceptional by todays standards the overall feel of the film was just disappointing. Was I expecting too much? I get the underlying story of humanity's capabilities of corruption and the emotional downfall of the oppressed human mind. But the dialogue and character development just wasn't there, it was just two hours of exceptional animation(9/10) coupled with a very tedious and incoherent storyline with way too many characters and no development(2/10) - (overall 5.5/10). Having only watched the remastered version I just can't put myself through another two hours of someone justifying why the original may be better. While not a strict fan of anime I watched this expecting what other's comments have said 'this will turn you onto anime.' Well I was already a bit part anime fan thanks to Ghost in the Shell(10/10) which was both very intriguing and had good story building dialogue, but this just left me feeling nothing at all by the end."

","Wow. What can I say? Well, nothing to justify the absolute mind-bending Anime that I thankfully picked up on DVD. Akira tells us the story of Neo-Tokyo in utter turmoil, just after a massive war, in which the cause is unknown for a lot of the movie. Motorbike gangs rule the road, but when Tetsuo is taken away by the government after a collision with a mysterious boy, all hell breaks loose as he is put under scientific experiments.<br/><br/>The animation is fantastic, impossible to tell that it was made nearly 20 years ago. It has probably the most stunning landscapes and detail that I have ever seen in an animation, bar none. The story is complex and thought provoking, not short of hidden messages and subtle references to the holocaust. It paces along nicely and never fails to keep a viewer tense and interested. It's moving, mind--blowing, intense action-fantasy that won't fail to keep you entertained."

","Akira is the greatest Anime film of all time, perhaps even one of the greatest Science Fiction titles. I haven't been the biggest Anime fan over the years, but this movie completely blew me away.<br/><br/>Akira takes place in 2019 in a post WWIII Tokyo (Now Neo Tokyo), which was destroyed by a Nuclear Weapon in 1988 (the beginning of WWIII). A Tokyo plagued with government corruption, drugs, biker gangs, poverty, and civil unrest, where every day could be your last.<br/><br/>Akira starts off looking like some kind of mad max Japanime rip off, but what unfolds goes beyond imagination. The Capsules are a gang in Neo Tokyo, who are at war with a rival bike gang.(The Clowns) One night on a high speed chase on the highway, young aspiring gang member Tetsuo Shima, collides with a strange looking young boy in an explosion, and is thrown off his bike. The army then lands and takes Tetsuo, and the mysterious child, arresting Kaneda (the capsules leader), and his members. Tetsuo is taken to a secret military facility and hooked up to all sorts of machines, and put through tests, as they figure out his collision with their project, (the child who he collided with) gave him ultimate psychic abilities, that lied dormant in his mind for many years. His power is to strong to be controlled by anyone, as they conduct the same brain modifications on Tetsuo, as they did on their first project, the project from 1988 that went awry with catastrophic consequences, the project known as Akira...<br/><br/>The scientists keep Tetsuo on drugs, to hinder the releasing of the power, to experiment on him until they can perfect the ultimate power, but after attaining a serious injury at the test lab, (fighting with a giant monster teddy bear and bunny rabbit?) the power is released at an astounding rate to heal the injury quickly, and the drugs are partially made useless as he blasts his rooms door open, viciously murders 2 soldiers with a scientist, and sets out on a path of destruction to find the only one with a greater power then him, Akira.<br/><br/>Fueled by envy and hatred, Tetsuo takes out his rage on a society that has done him wrong, as he makes his way to the abandoned Olympic stadium in the ruins of Old Tokyo, destroying everything in his path. Tetsuo has no idea what will happen to him if the drugs used to hinder his power wear off, and becomes drunk with power, driven insane by the brain augmentations, drugs and his own mind, troubled by a terrible childhood, where he was always in the shadows of others, and seemingly had no one in the world who loved him, Tetsuos only goal is to awaken the Akira project, sealed under the Olympic Stadium for many years, and destroy it, to take over the world.<br/><br/>But as the drugs wear off, Tetsuo sees the error of his ways, as he can no longer control the power himself, and when Akira is released, Tetsuo is taken out of Neo Tokyo, to another dimension/universe, to have the only peace he can ever know, and sucked into this black hole with him is the city of Neo Tokyo, whose founders played god with humans, and suffered the most dire consequences imaginable for it..."

","I understand how some people feel: that this film has absolutely (or very very little) to do with the original books, or that there is no discernible plot. And I would agree. As a movie, AKIRA is very shallow. However, you have to understand what this movie has done to Anime. It was the movie that brought the anime craze to the United States. Also, just watch the movie from an art perspective. Just as a cartoon, this film blows all conventional anime standards out of the water. No current film has ever come close to what AKIRA did for anime, and I doubt any other traditionally made (cel) movie ever will. My thanks and congratulations to Katsuhiro Otomo's team.<br/><br/>Kaneda's character in the film is much shallower as the one described in the manga. His real motivation is only mentioned once in the movies, when he says ""Tetsuo is our friend, if anyone's going to kill him, it should be us."" In the books, Kaneda's transformation from mere bike gang leader to head of an entire resistance is a slow one, and you can see his skill growing. He is motivated by sheer revenge in the beginning, revenge for Yamagata. Towards the end though, you can begin to see that his interest in the Akira Project itself is present. Unfortunately, the actual Project is not made perfectly clear in the movie version. A terrible shame, as it provides some interesting aspects of the behind-the-scenes of the story.<br/><br/>*more to be updated in time*"

I am an older man and must have an aversion to heroes who are uneducated slacker bike gangers that the new generation doesn't. If I can't identify with the hero the movie is a bust with me. The story is supposed to start 31 years after WW III, in a city called Neo-Tokyo. The city is in a decline and its easy to see why with the police unable to stop biker gangs, and the high schools not teaching the students.

","I remember seeing this film when I was around oh, 8 or 9 years old, in full knowing of the adult content (I mean, the most violent animation I had seen previos was probably ""Footrot Flats""). I didnt sit all the way through it (its a hell of a lot of story to consume) but the action in the first half entranced me like no other ""Cartoon"" had before ie I couldnt believe they allowed breasts and shot dogs in cartoons.<br/><br/>I have since bought it myself, and it still, from start to finish entraps the imagination in its beautifully stunning animation, set pieces and unbelievable action. I would say the last half hour is the greatest action sequence ever portrayed on film, whether animated or not, and is enveloped in animation I believe far surpass' that of even Ghost In The Shell (which is saying a lot) especially considering its entirely hand drawn, which I appreciate greatly in animation.<br/><br/>The storyline while being convoluted and incredibly hard to follow the first few times, and could alienate some viewers through its intricacies, opens up after several viewing and provides a great backdrop to the entire experience.<br/><br/>I will admit one thing though. I have yet to see the subtitled version, and while sure to be superior to the dubbed, its not entirely necessary IMO. The American dubbing, while ruining a lot of the context (as anime dubbing does) its probably one of the best efforts I have heard. The characters voices really grow on you, and are all individual sounding with a lot of character differentiation.<br/><br/>Overall it sits on my personal top ten, and provides a depth rarely seen in film, let alone animation.<br/><br/>10/10."

","Akira(1988)<br/><br/>Review: I remember when about 15 years ago when my brother rented this movie and was excited about it. I never heard of it, but had an open mind. Here's my take:<br/><br/>Akira is possibly the most overrated anime ever. I do not understand the love. It's been hailed as a classic. Tell me why you loved this. Is it because of the convoluted story? Is it because of the lifeless and dull characters? Is it because it is really long? Is it because of it's many scenes of unnecessary violence?<br/><br/>Seriously, I do not get it. The characters were dull, the story is contrived and confusing and the violence is far to much and some of it is towards the kids. It gets rather hard to watch. I found no joy in this. This movie overstayed it's welcome. It's just too damn long.<br/><br/>However, I must give credit where credit is due. The animation is really good here. For 1988, it's mighty cool.<br/><br/>There are many Anime that are great like Vampire Hunter D:Bloodlust, Princess Mononoke, and the Cyber City Oedo miniseries. Akira just does not satisfy at all. It's a boring and unpleasant experience.<br/><br/>And to finish my story, halfway though Akira, my brother who was excited fell asleep and I was really drowsy. True story.<br/><br/>The Last Word: I hated this movie. Through the test of time, Akira will remain the most overrated piece of Anime garbage. Good visuals do not make a good movie."
"xfactor-78139","3","6","13","29 April 2018"," Meh...
","It's not for me. I can see why this appeals to so many people, the animation is fantastic for an older film, but it doesn't appeal much to me. It's depressing and too dark, and the biggest gripe I had was the blink-and-you-miss it appearance of the title character. Sure they yammer about Akira the whole movie but you barely see him at all. If you're going to name the entire movie after a character, why make it one that only appears for what amounts to the last four minutes of the movie? In my opinion he may as well not have even been in the movie. While in the same vein, how about how Tetsuo's powers appear? So let me get this straight, he almost runs over a gargoyle-like psychic with a motorcycle, who blows up said motorcycle the moment before he gets hit to escape unscathed while leaving Tetsuo half dead in the road, and somewhere in the intermediary between those two events he gets powers. SOMEHOW. So in this universe the easiest way to get psychic powers is to lurk around government facilities and commit vehicular manslaughter?<br/><br/>I didn't like the characters much either. They were street thugs, I get it, but think about it. If they weren't jerks, Tetsuo wouldn't have been out wrecking stuff with the rest of the gang, and therefore wouldn't have almost killed the gargoyle, and no one would have died. Literally the only reason that anything happens is that Tetsuo and his friends are violent destructive heathens! Upon reflection I don't really find anything likeable in any of the main characters aside from the psychics. They were just fine in my opinion, although the voice actors were a little flat in my opinion.<br/><br/>That's not to say that it's a bad movie. Far from it, it is exceptionally well made. It does its job of being a dark, gritty anime, with no detail spared. The characters react as expected, given their characters, and they do feel believable. But the bleak downward spiral ending in Tokyo turning into a crater is just to dark for me to find any appeal in.. I honestly do see why people love this film, but I personally find it hard to find any appeal in."

This will blow you away and I'm not lying, watch and be amazed. I mean sure there's a lot of graphic content (that Mutation scene still freaks me out), so this is primarily aimed at an older audience.

"Horst_In_Translation","4","3","5","22 October 2019"," Didn't do too much for me, but mostly from a subjective perspective
","The award-winning ""Akira"" is a Japanese animated movie from 1988, so this one had its 30th anniversary last year, and it was written and directed by Katsuhiro Ôtomo, who was in his early 30s at that point and it is probably still his most known career effort as of today, even if he has also worked on other fairly well-known films. The cast list I cannot say anything about really, probably only the biggest anime/Japanese movie fans will be familiar with the names and that is alright. Good voice actors are never as famous as good ""live action actors"", but that does not mean in any way they are worse. The ones here did an okay job overall for this film that runs for slightly over 2 hours. As for the western world, there are animated movies that are only for kids and animated movies that are for grown-ups as well as kids, but virtually no animated movies only for adults. This is definitely different when it comes to Japan. For this country, there is a full sub-genre of films that are animated and not suitable for children, not because of sexual contents most of the time, but because of the violence. This is one of them. As for sexual content, we only have female breasts exposed on one occasion, but tons of bloodshed and violence really. This was one of the problems I had with this movie, indirectly I would say, because the film is incredibly tense and not in a good way. People say (wrongfully) that it is not good if nothing happens in a movie, but the exact opposite we got here is nothing to be desired either because there is no moment to take a breath for the audience really and I personally do not like it. Also it does not feel too realistic if always something happens, something crucial, that is, apparently. And this is the case here.<br/><br/>Anyway, one of the more interesting things to me here was that while the film was made in the 80s, there are references to the future, what the futuristic Tokyo will look like and funnily they picked the year 2019 exactly to depict it. Okay, it's not on a Space Odyssey oder Dark Angel level, but still kinda funny, even if obviously they are exaggerating so much here that it is hard to believe this is what they thought the year 2019 would look like. I think we can be glad that it is not like this in reality and also that there was no World War III as mentioned early in this film. Okay what else did I like about the movie. The animation is okay. It is not entirely to my liking, but there are moments I enjoy and I can see why some really adore it. It's obviously not Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli in terms of looks and approach, but it succeeds to deliver in other departments, more through style than cuteness. I liked the sets and depiction of the broken city honestly more than the people's looks. Especially those with changed skin color I found a bit strange, but I guess it was also partially to emphasize their powers and how different they are to ""normal"" humans. Another thing I found really cool was the red motorbike and also the red uniform one character was wearing. Still what was up with the stickers? Advertizing? Anyway, I don't care too much, it still looked swell.<br/><br/>Now for the negative and there is a lot more for sure than positive, at least for me. But like I said in the title of my review, a lot of it is subjective. I must say I really struggled with the characters and their introduction especially. Early on, it felt like a mess to me with how many were included really and how each and every one got a scene or two and then some were never seen again. Also in terms of editing, the film is so so fast that there is never really a camera shot and angle that lasts for more than a few seconds. Of course, this fits in well with the speed attached to this film in general in terms of motorbikes and superpowers and fighting because some of the characters are super fast, but still, this is certainly not my preferred approach. At the end, it was a bit improved as there was finally better focus on the characters and not too many of them anymore. Still, there were characters like the officer who did not have really enough elaboration before that to make the impact they were supposed to make and also where is he gone eventually? Like vanished completely and not in the creature I think. Also I thought it was a weird decision by the two (or maybe even all three) tiny powerful characters to just jump in there to save the young man. And boom he is saved in the end, but nobody else is. Why would they trade their lives for him? Sure he fought hard and gave it his all, but he is not a deity or something and the quote ""at least we can save the young man this way"" was not enough for me.<br/><br/>I think many people who rated this film so highly that it is still (barely) in the imdb top250 forgot about some of the mediocrities earlier on and the rather weak first 75 minutes and did so because the ending is really spectacular and admittedly what the test subject turns into at the end (or almost the end) looks pretty memorable, also pretty disgusting, but how we hear he cannot control his body anymore also shows that, while he probably is the main antagonist, he is also some sort of victim. And it was a bold decision to let the girl die that he sucked in. And other characters. But to me, it hardly made an emotional impact. Same for the moment when the good main character (of course) survives and his friends welcome him and are really happy he is still there. I also did not like the little light and ""piece of energy"" he eventually turns into and it was too much of an easy way out. Maybe the feel-good easy way out and kinda interesting, but did it make sense that he turns into something so tiny after we hear he bascially created a new universe before that? They did it better with Scarlett Johansson's transformation into pure energy not too long ago I guess. But let's not drift too far away from this one here. I give it a thumbs-down overall and was a little bit (but not too much) surprised when people clapped the moment the closing credits rolled in. Then again, with the type of people in the audience, I was not too surprised. But even if I did not like the movie as much, I still thought it was a better watch on the big screen (where I got the chance to see it) than on a small laptop screen or so. But it is definitely nowhere near my top250, probably not even in my top250 from 1988, let alone from the 80s. I don't recommend checking it out. If you still want, it probably helps if ""Dragon Ball"" is more your thing than Pokemon in terms of ideas and stories. Oh and finally, also a few words on the title, again negative ones sadly: It is short and catchy yes and from that perspective probably helped the film to garner more attention, but Akira never felt like a defining concept or character to me compared to some others that would have been a better choice to name the film after. In an accurate scenario, it would be that Akira is significant enough to say: ""Yes, this is the character that they should have picked for the title."" However, the way it is here, is the other way around. Naming the film after Akira gives a pretty forgettable character some additional significance. That would be all."

I'm not an anime fan, or even a fan of animated movies in general, though there are a handful that I've liked well enough. With this film, I'm left entirely in limbo. When something like this occurs, I'll check out the FAQ page for the movie here on IMDb and try to gain some understanding, along with a handful of the more accomplished reviews for the picture. It didn't surprise me that to get a better grip on the story, one would be well advised to read the two thousand plus manga treatment of Akira by the writer, and this film's director, Katsuhiro Ôtomo. I can guarantee that's not going to happen, so what I'm left with as regards the film is a lukewarm acceptance that it's been a very influential work in the genre, while leaving me entirely unimpressed. All I got out of it was an endless series of violence, destruction, explosions and fighting, and though I followed the characters of Kaneda and Tetsuo well enough, there wasn't the least bit of story line that had an appeal for this viewer. Nor were the characters even likeable to any degree, so that was another check in the minus column. So rather than bashing the film, I'll just consider my viewing another in a long list of movies I've watched to get a broader perspective of what's out there and know that I'm not missing anything. All films can't appeal to everyone."
"brchthethird","8","3","5","28 February 2015"," Stunning visuals and a cool story make for quite a unique experience
","Anime has never been something I felt drawn to, yet there are many titles to which aficionados of the genre/style will always point you and which have achieved a sort of name recognition among those who wouldn't necessarily consider themselves fans. AKIRA is one of those films, and it happens to be the first anime film I've ever seen. The setting is 2019 in Neo-Tokyo, so named because of an apocalyptic event which took place 31 years earlier. The rebuilt city isn't too different from what you might find in a post-apocalyptic/dystopian sci-fi story. What stood out most to me, and the most recognizable elements of this type of story, was the portrayal of a fascist police state where government and those in authority abuse their power and the citizens fight against them. Not only do they show this violence, but there is also a lot of graffiti which provides subtext and context to the overall situation. Some of it went over my head because it's probably specific to Japanese society when this film (and the source graphic novel) were made, but the broad strokes of oppressive regimes, the military-industrial complex and populist uprisings should resonate with most viewers. All of this, and I haven't even gotten to what makes this story unique. At the center of this story is a biker gang, and one of the members, Tetsuo, is captured by a secret military group that studies people with psychic abilities. There is also another group of people who prophecy about the return of some mystical Akira, who will either bring balance or destruction. To be honest, I don't completely understand all of the plot intricacies, but most of the time I was being blown away by the stunning hand-drawn animation. I've never completely warmed up to computer animation, but animated films such as this one have an artistry to them that is second to none (when done right). One minor complaint I have is that the English dub (and I don't really like dubs) was a bit iffy in places. What I mean by that is some of the voice acting was a bit over-the-top. Still, it wasn't too distracting like it might be in a live-action film. My other minor complaint has to do with the length of the film. The third act was perhaps a little bit too protracted and it messed with the overall pacing. Still, I ended up liking this film a lot and look forward to delving into more anime in the future."

This coming from a artist perspective its nothing short of awesome in what they did in 1988.

","I must admit I have not seen a great deal of Anime but having seen this I am keen to see more. The version I saw was dubbed into English, which made it a little easier to concentrate on the visuals which were quite stunning. The plot I found to be very inventive and quite enthralling, if a little complicated. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.<br/><br/>After World War III, Tokyo is destroyed. It is re-built and re-named Neo-Tokyo. Parts of the old city still exist but are not inhabited. A biker gang lead by Shôtarô Kaneda, known as Kaneda for short, travels the streets, picking fights with rival gangs and generally doing what kids do. There are riots in the streets and anti-government protesters have broken into a secret facility and kidnapped a small boy. This boy has special powers and is separated from his kidnapper before he is involved in an accident with one of the bikers, Tetsuo Shima. The government people holding the boy come to pick him up and also take Tetsuo with them. His accident has released a power within him, one that he will struggle to control in the future. He becomes aware of another who had similar powers, Akira, and he makes it his mission to locate Akira. Many will try to stop him, including the boy and his two companions and Kaneda. Will they be able to stop Tetsuo from releasing Akira and possibly bringing about another catastrophe on Tokyo? Well, you probably guessed I'm not going to tell you here, those Spoiler Police are tough.<br/><br/>As I've already said, the animation is first rate, I assume that there was very little, if any, work done on a computer, given when it was made, which makes it even more remarkable. I did find it a little too long and a little too drawn out towards the end, but it didn't detract too much from, what is, a very fine piece of work.<br/><br/>The thing that struck me was, as with the majority of Anime I've seen, all the action takes place from the point of view of the young people. Personally, and probably because I'm older, I would prefer to see a more balanced point of view. It's only a slight niggle, I know, but maybe something the filmmakers might like to consider. Over all though, a rather excellent piece of work! Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 8.6/10"
"quiropiuscochannel","9","4","8","8 November 2010"," Till This day stills being an amazing piece of animation. Simply amazing.
","I have always thought about Akira as one turning point in the history of anime and general animation as well. It was one of the very first animated movies to show gruesome acts of violence, people getting killed, and blood and gore all over the place. Of course, this is not the first time an animated movie directed to a mature audience was made. In fact, for me the first movie of this kind was Heavy Metal from 1981. I admit Heavy Metal is awesome but the movie wasn't that popular, and became more of a cult movie rather that something that completely redefined the genre. For me Akira was not only the movie that completely redefined the genre of mature animated films, but also was the movie that showed everyone that anime, and ""cartoons"" were not longer exclusive of the kids culture. When It came out, Akira made look animation for the first time as something cool. It was no longer something for a small group of followers of anime, but opened the genre and animation to a much more bigger audience, including the Media. I cannot think of any other animated film that made such a drastic revolution such as Akira. The movie is amazing not only for the mature themes, but also the story and the animation itself are the show stealers. The animation was fabulous, extremely detailed and extremely accurate into showing a ""Cyberpunk"" world. The city of Neo Tokyo stills being one of the most amazing things ever made in animation, and the action scenes were also pretty good. The Blood and Gore effects were also fabulous. Katsuhiro Otomo created a master piece of animation which will last forever as a classic and a total revolution in the history of anime and animation in general."
"sunsetshoegazer","10","4","8","26 February 2010"," The animation isn't the only amazing thing... Spoilers throughout
","AKIRA is, despite its fanfare and acclaim as the ""big anime"", still highly underrated. It's a gem, and a movie that slowly drags you in. Beyond the jaw-dropping animation, bloody violence and nightmarish ending (famous enough to be parodied in an episode of South Park (Trapper Keeper), and cartoons such as The Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory and Invader Zim), it is a movie that is deeply human, and greatly philosophical. This is a character movie, a film about people, as dystopian fiction has classically emphasised the destruction of humanity and relationships as one of its major themes. In the same few minutes that we hear fantastical theories of human evolution and see a portrayal of a world devastated by nuclear war, we also see the disenfranchised youth of Neo-Tokyo and the friendships that arise in such unsettling times. Interestingly, two of the biggest criticisms of AKIRA conflict: one is that the plot is incomprehensible and too heavy, and the other is that the plot is a poorly made backdrop for explosions and other eye candy, and while the film is stunning to just look at, there's a lot, lot more going on.<br/><br/>When we examine great works of fiction that deal with fascist societies, authoritarianism and social decay, we will find that the vast majority of these works contain a considerable deal of violence. This is not a coincidence; look at Winston Smith's visit to Room 101 and Offred's viewing of the men hanged for being homosexuals and women killed for being independent in the modern classic Handmaid's Tale. These elements are commonplace in literature and live-action, but the level of brutality in AKIRA, the way the cops treat civilians, the Cronenberg finale, is virtually unheard of in first-rate animation. The disgusting form Tetsuo takes at the end of the movie sees him as a giant, mutant baby: and isn't this symbolic of what Tetsuo was trying to run away from? He wanted to be independent and an adult and all powerful, and ends up becoming infantile, all-consuming and a burden.<br/><br/>The characters in the film are somewhat condensed compared to the manga (which is even better, and even bigger) but are still believable and very human - the ultimately caring Kaneda who is outwardly overconfident, outgoing and sometimes cruel, the angst-ridden, lonely Tetsuo with the inferiority complex, the brave, self-righteous and yet naive nature of Kei, the wise, idealistic, loving personality of Kiyoko. These are rich characters. In fact, one of the major subplots surrounds the Colonel's authoritarian and pro-active personality clashing with the government authorities, and how he gets increasingly infuriated with what he sees as the 'dreaming' and foolishness of the scientists he engages with. It's hard to see this as short of depth. <br/><br/>Of course, much has already been said about the groundbreaking animation. This film has around 160,000 unique stills, and much of the movie takes place at night, which is traditionally something animators avoid because of the colour demands. It was also one of the first Japanese animations to pre-record voices before beginning the animation process, which, while already common in the US at the time of production, was new in Japan. The end result is absolutely vivid, dark, and sometimes terrifying, but always wonderful. The iconic opening bike chase is referenced in Kanye West's 'Stronger' video, as well as the scenes where Tetsuo is undergoing military experimentation. Also adding to the great atmosphere is the haunting soundtrack composed by Shoji Yamashiro and performed by Geinoh Yamashirogumi.<br/><br/>The powerful chants in 'Tetsuo' have recently been sampled in acclaimed musician Panda Bear's 'Comfy In Nautica'. <br/><br/>This movie is complicated and bursting with themes, but I cannot stress enough that it is a movie that needs repeat viewings. It has a lot to say, and it is admittedly very difficult to understand in the first watch. People talk about themes of human nature often, but then complain about violence in films such as AKIRA and other controversial pieces of art. While some films masquerade under the pretence of making statements but are exploitative and ultimately trash, AKIRA is a phenomenal exploration of humanity and the downfall of civilisation. <br/><br/>The number of different conclusions and interpretations of this film, from an analogy about the war crimes in WWII Japan, to the enormous troubles of youth, to even a critique of modern consumerism and capitalism itself (!) show how thought-provoking this film is.<br/><br/>To end what was never meant to be so long: An epic masterpiece, and one of my all-time favourite films. <br/><br/>10/10"

","The hand drawn animation in this movie is quite possibly the best example of animation in any film ever. The story isn't as strong as it is in the manga due to a lot of the story being cut out to make the film 2 hours but it is still a fine film."
"tedg","Null","9","24","31 May 2000"," Hard Edges
","This is an interesting film. The story is sophomoric and the characters are, well, cartoons. But the cinematic world is interesting. The creator was clearly brimming with ideas, and these are obviously from his print efforts.<br/><br/>This was done using print techniques. meaning that the animation is drawn and page-sequenced rather than using what are now common computerized techniques. So this may be the best of the films that are 'hard-edged.'<br/><br/>The art itself is all cartoon, meaning each object and person has sharp outlines. This is hardly unique, even with modern (but cheap) animation. But at least here, you have some clever shading and use of complementary colors. Few colors are used throughout. Shadows and blends are also ""hard"" of course.<br/><br/>More interesting is the hardness elsewhere. Because this is cell art, there is no motion blurring. Its lack is jarring once you've gotten used to films which use it, so because of its age, this film has already achieved a curious antique effect of hard motion. Obviously, the animator was aware of this, because he uses extreme discontinuities between shots. The result isn't just simple choppiness, as others have noted, but a continuation of the punkish style of hard edges, as well as an evocation of comic panels.<br/><br/>Stupid story, but curiously stylish, dated animation."

","Akira isn't only my favorite anime; it's my favorite animated film and one of my favorite films, period. Katsuhiro Otomo has crafted an animated sci-fi actioner for adults that's good, a rarity since most ""adult"" animation fails by relying on dopey sex jokes and idiotic plot rather than a good story with likable characters. Otomo's film weaves together themes of friendship, honor, betrayal, the deadly consequences of playing God, gang war, espionage, corruption, and the abuse of power while maintaining a brisk pace throughout its running time. Throw it all in a blender and it's one of the greatest animated films of all time.<br/><br/>On July 16, 1988, Tokyo was obliterated in a massive explosion, setting off World War III. In 2019, Tokyo has been rebuilt as Neo-Tokyo, a megalopolis crawling with malignant crime and governed by corrupt politicians where 16-year-old Shotaro Kaneda (Cam Clarke in the 1988 Streamline dub, Johnny Yong Bosch in the 2001 Pioneer dub, Mitsuo Iwata in Japanese) is the tough, cocky, skirt-chasing, and bullheaded leader of the Capsules, a biker gang that's currently at war with the Clowns, a band of savage rapists. Kaneda's gang consists of his friends, 15-year-old Tetsuo Shima (Jan Rabson, Joshua Seth, Nozomu Sasaki) who's like a brother to him, 15-year-old Kai (Bob Bergen, Anthony Pulcini, Takeshi Kusao), and 16-year-old Yama (Tony Pope, Michael Lindsay, Masaaki Okura) and a few others. During a brawl with the Clowns, students are protesting and an odd-looking boy named Takashi (Barbara Goodson, Cody Mackenzie, Tatsuhiko Nakamura) with psychic powers has been abducted. After Tetsuo takes down a Clown, his bike explodes upon nearly ramming Takashi. The boys arrive to find a battered Tetsuo. The army, led by Colonel Shikishima (Pope, Jamieson Price, Taro Ishida), arrives on the scene and takes both Tetsuo and Takashi away, while the boys are arrested. At the police station, Kaneda gets 17-year-old resistance member Kei (Lara Cody, Wendee Lee, Mami Koyama) released with them, having taken an interest in her. Dr. Onishi (Lewis Arquette, Simon Prescott, Mizuho Suzuki) conducts experiments on Tetsuo, prompting his escape. After Tetsuo steals Kaneda's bike to run away with his girlfriend Kaori (Goodson, Michelle Ruff, Yuriko Fuchizaki) and both are attacked by the Clowns, Tetsuo beats a Clown to a pulp before he is again taken by the army to the facility that also holds Kiyoko (Melora Harte, Sandy Fox, Fukue Ito who is credited as Sachie Ito), Takashi, and Masaru (Bergen, Mackenzie, Kazuhiro Kamifuji who is credited as Kazuhiro Kando). When Kaneda tries to find out what happened to Tetsuo, he and Kei soon find that Tetsuo, now gifted with telekinesis, is being consumed by psychosis, and after he murders one of their friends, an enraged Kaneda resolves to stop him.<br/><br/>As you can guess from the summary, there's a lot going on in Akira. Even with Otomo having removed much of what was in his then-incomplete manga, there's still enough to warrant its 124-minute length. We see Kaneda worry about Tetsuo as a true friend does, Tetsuo lose his grip on sanity and become someone else, and Colonel Shikishima struggle against politicians who only cares about money. We see the dangers of playing God as Tetsuo wreaks havoc on Neo-Tokyo and even earlier when Colonel Shikishima says that maybe they should leave that power alone. We also get glimpses at honor when Kaneda tries to curb Tetsuo from killing a Clown he's already beaten severely and with Colonel Shikishima's musings on a soldier's duty. On top of that, Otomo throws in religious fanaticism as people blindly follow Tetsuo, thinking he's ""Akira."" There's more where that came from and the stakes keep rising to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Due to Otomo and Izo Hashimoto's excellent writing capabilities, the film isn't overstuffed and nothing feels out of place.<br/><br/>The animation is stunning. All 327 colors are jaw-dropping; watch out for those reds. Each background has immense detail; the streets of Neo-Tokyo are gritty and grimy, buildings vary from excellent condition to run-down and deteriorated, we see walls and even a door with English profanity painted on them, and the sewers are as filthy as a real one while the interiors of the hospital are exceptionally clean in contrast to the clutter and graffiti of the school the boys attend. Each character looks like a real person, with the array of facial expressions that entails while clothing looks like what real people wear. The gore is also very realistic. Anyone without an iron stomach will want to steer clear of Akira. Organs fall out, half a face is shot off, and limbs are removed, which is not to mention the mutation scene. With that said, the gore serves the story rather than the reverse. The attention to detail goes even further to the few animals depicted in the film; the attack dogs near the beginning and even the dog that's seen in a commercial on a TV in the background look like real dogs and the rats in the sewer look like real rats. Put it all together and it's a depiction of 2019 that looks a lot like the real thing. The way Otomo keeps everything moving only helps. Otomo's decision to record the dialogue first and animate every nuance of the actor's mouth is where he pulls out all the stops, since this wasn't done in Japan at the time, making it even more impressive that the dubs sync with the animation as well as they do.<br/><br/>Whichever version one prefers, though this fan is partial to the Streamline dub, performances excel across the board. Clarke, Yong Bosch, and Iwata are uniformly excellent as Kaneda, the tough, cocky and womanizing biker who cares about his friends and won't let anyone mess with them. He's a lot like I was at that age. While some have argued against both Clarke and Yong Bosch in favor of the other as sounding too old, I don't think that's the case with either; when I was 16, I didn't sound far removed from Clarke's take. Another argument some have made against Clarke is that he speaks in monotone, but nothing could be further from the truth; his tone changes with the situations he finds himself in. The same can be said of Rabson, Seth, and Sasaki as Tetsuo, though Seth lags just a little behind. With that said, this can be partly attributed to the Pioneer dub script, though it is grating that Seth often mispronounces Kaneda's name as ""Kah-nee-duh"" rather than ""Kuh-nay-duh"" or ""Kah-nay-duh."" Take the scene where Tetsuo advances on the soldiers in the government hospital and Seth says, ""It's no use hiding anymore,"" while neither Rabson nor Sasaki says, ""anymore."" It's not that big a deal, but it takes away from his menace some. With that said, all three portray him as an abused kid who loses his sanity and despite being the villain, you feel bad for him. Or at least I do since I see a lot of my mentally ill little sister there. Cody, Lee, and Koyama are first-class across the board as Kei, portraying her as tough but sensitive, well in line with how Otomo conceived her. The same can be said of Pope, Price, and Ishida as Colonel Shikishima, playing up his no-nonsense manner and sense of a soldier's duty. Bergen, Pulcini, and Kusao are superb as Kai, one of the film's most likable characters. So are Pope, Lindsay, and Okura as Yama, the most confrontational Capsule, and the same also be said for all the rest. That said, you can't go wrong with any of them.<br/><br/>Music is a crucial part of any film. Akira is no exception and the Geinoh Yamashirogumi are up to the challenge, using drums, chants, guitars, gamelan percussion, and even a church organ to form Akira's musical score. Kaneda is the most recognizable, having been used in just about every trailer. It's easy to see why; it's an exhilarating track and it's hard not to feel pumped once you've heard it. The same can be said of Battle Against the Clowns, Tetsuo, and Exodus from the Underground Fortress. The score mostly remains the same, with the only radically different version being the Japanese hypersonic track that Geinoh Yamashirogumi founder Shoji Yamashiro mixed in 2008 for the film's Blu-ray release. In this version, which Yamashiro mastered at 192 kHz, music has been moved around, some pieces are shortened, some are replaced with alternate versions, and the piece used during the flashback to Kaneda and Tetsuo's first meeting has been replaced with an organ, and not necessarily for the better; if you want my honest opinion, the flashback is more powerful with the original music sampled from Requiem. That said, the entire score is incredible and I've listened to it countless times. In addition, Otomo squeezes in Tokyo Shoeshine Boy by Teruko Akatsuki during the scene where the groupies walk off from Kaneda, Kai, and Yama. Mix in a jaw-dropping sound design and it's a film firing on all cylinders.<br/><br/>Akira is a fun and exciting film, one I could watch over and over again. Wanting to see it at age 11, it knocked my socks off when I finally saw it at 18. At 30 years old, it continues to stand the test of time. It's a timeless film, just as relevant today in 2019, if not more so than when it first dropped on Japan in 1988 and the United States in 1989. Akira was one of the first anime to arrive to the western world uncut; without it, we may not have Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and many more without a single frame removed. Akira is the best animated film made for adults and one of the best films of the 1980s, anime or otherwise. Its characters are well-drawn and feel real, it deftly handles global issues still at work, its frenzied action scenes continue to thrill and it's vastly quotable. Its imagery will remain burned within your psyche and its musical score will ring inside your eardrums long after the credits roll. If you love sci-fi and can brave the violence, you should see Akira at least once. Who knows? Maybe you'll like it and want to come back to it repeatedly. Very highly recommended."

","The first thing you should think about before watching the movie Akira is that it is an anime. But it's not any anime like Pokemon or Yu-gi-oh, Akira is not meant for to be watched by 6 year old children. The story line is a bit confusing and very deep. If you don't like to be puzzled and confused in a movie, Akira is not for you. On the other hand if you enjoy movies that make you think, Akira is pretty good. There is plenty of good action and almost never a dull moment. The characters especially Tetsuo and Kaneda seem believable. It's not like some anime movies where you don't feel any empathy towards the characters. This movie is also a bit graphic which is why it should be watched by a mature audience, so if you are a bit queasy when it comes to blood, don't watch this video. Also the music in Akira is pretty good (in my opinion at least). In the end you'll either hate this movie or love it."

Akira was one of the first adult animated films to ever breakthrough into the west. Akira helped to popularize anime in America and in that sense, it still continues to influence us to this day. At the time, when Akira was made, Japanese anime films were cheap and often would settle for bad production in return for more profits. Akira was a revolution in this sense. Every penny was spent to craft what is possibly the most beautiful animated film of all time. Akira was one of the first animated films to animate characters around the voice dialogue and incorporate 3D CGI into its animation. It also was not afraid to have tons of dialogue and extremely bloody scenes. The results are stunning to say the least. But why has Akira remained so popular through the years?"

It looks at the past and future and looks at the effects of the nuclear devastation of Hiroshima. Many Science Fiction themes are presented and in a great way even though some of it feels very condensed due to the story being adapted from a Manga series (Japanese comicbook).<br/><br/>This is what I love about Akira, it's just a true testament to visual storytelling and the creating of a fully developed world with interesting and developed characters that seemingly have basic personalities.

Akira broke from this trend with detailed scenes, lip-synched dialogue - a first for an anime production - and super-fluid motion as realized in the film's more than 160,000 animation cels.

An encounter with a powerful child leaves one of a gang, Tetsuo, injured and captured by the army.  They find his mind has powers that can be developed  however the lessons of the mysterious Akira are still fresh in their minds and the army know they must control his development.  Meanwhile Tetsuo's friend, Kaneda, fights corrupt politicians, a powerful military and the power of the opened human brain to get his friend back.<br/><br/>When I went to see this film at a big cinema chain that I won't name, it had been over 10 years since I'd last seen the movie and could remember very little of it.  The screening was cancelled because the emergency lights couldn't be shut off (d'oh) but we were all offered free tickets for later. Coming back to it I hoped it would be worth the bother and, on the whole, it was.  This type of film is usually all visual flair and some messed up plot about demons etc.  Akira is almost that but rises about the average by being cleverer than that and by being one of the first of it's type.<br/><br/>The animation is excellent  breathtaking cityscapes and futuristic effects. The violence is graphic but is nothing compared to modern Japanese standards.  It doesn't take away from the film and it all looks great.  The use of sound (or rather silence) is also effective with powerful silences at key moments really adding to the film.<br/><br/>The plot goes a bit nuts at times and ends up with the body horror of many films of the genre.  However at it's core it is looking at the idea of humans using their full brain power and possible next steps for evolution. That doesn't mean it doesn't drag at all and several bits do go on too long  the ending in particular never seems to reach a closing point!  I felt it could easily have taken 20 minutes less and still done the same job.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with the version I saw was the hammy American voice work.  It really made it feel clichéd.  However overall the film looks good and has some great action.  It may not be a classic film and the genre is a bit of an acquired taste but this is a solid film that (partly due to it's age) transcends many of the clichés the genre later acquired."

Now, his friends, a group of psychics, and the Neo-Tokyo military attempt to stop him before its too late.<br/><br/>Akira's art style is unlike anything of the genre, its colors and design is something you would see in a fever dream. The direction is excellent and the world is perfectly created to make a unique and amazing universe that quite obviously inspired many future films. The story is very complicated, the beginning goes by very fast, but it doesn't take away from the film, in fact, it demands a second viewing from you the moment ends. US companies spent over 1 million dollars to restore the visuals as well as adding an entire new soundtrack/sound FX, which was definitely worth every penny, as the film is spectacular to the senses.<br/><br/>Over all, its a superb film that requires multiple viewings. Highly recommended."

","I really wanted to see this movie a long time ago, now I'm happy I didn't do so earlier! now I tell you why. By the look of it's cover and seeing a couple of trailers you may say it's all about motorcycle gangbangers of Tokyo or something... well, partly, It's true. but what I really didn't know was the mind-blowing real script of this anime about life, existence and the very beginning of creation of everything, which is the part that will take you away. The moment that the Akira was risen in attempt to overcome the great power of Tetsou and defeat him, It was literally demonstrating of the ""Big Bang"" to the viewer itself. and even that mad scientist mentioned that for those to place no doubt it was a recreating of something meaningful and theoretical. Now that's why I'm glad I didn't watch it earlier years ago, cause I'm afraid I wouldn't comprehend the whole movie (not that I did already!). You come with a low expectations and go with a handful of meaning and questions at the end of the movie. It's like Spanish Inquisition and you didn't expect that! so just enjoy it."
"bfwam","9","3","6","24 November 2016"," Akira; Not to be missed
","If you are a fan of animation, not seeing Akira is equivalent to not seeing a Pixar film or a Miyazaki film. Obviously Pixar and Miyazaki films are much more family friendly than Akira is. I would not recommend showing this to a younger audience at all, but I will argue that Akira is on the same technical level. The animation is truly groundbreaking, using cell animation to it's advantages rather than allowing it to hinder the incredible amount of detail put into this film. Any fan of animated works will no doubt be delighted to see the incredibly stylized steam-punk Tokyo lit up by neon lights. I don't want to get too much into the story, mainly because of how easy it is to spoil this movie, but I will say that the screenplay works to play on how we tell stories, and how we write/view protagonists."
"joshuafagan-64214","9","3","6","3 April 2016"," A Landmark Masterpiece
","As the credits rolled after two hours of sci-fi action, philosophy, and metaphysics, I just sat and stared at my screen. I didn't know what to think of this movie. I still don't. But it is one of the most starkly original and creative films out there, and it is certainly one of the most influential. Many Americans were first introduced to anime via this film and its graphic, dystopian, confusing spectacle. Watching this movie, it is clear how many things it has influenced, things that are probably a lot more well-known to a modern audience than it. Although I do doubt if many Americans understood it. It's a hard movie to really understand if you're an American. It's probably a hard movie to understand even if you're not.<br/><br/>In fact, to some degree, it is the sort of movie that is not supposed to be understood. It is meant to be experienced, and experience it I did. I'm not even sure if I enjoyed it or not, but I do know I'm in awe of it.<br/><br/>The animation is spectacular, particularly for its time. It doesn't look basic or simple or old-fashioned. It looks smooth, fresh, dynamic, beautiful, and above all, evocative. Not even Tarantino can make a mess of blood and guts looks so artistic, and Neo Tokyo is a completely believable futuristic city. It's hard to make a dystopian landscape that is equal parts terrifying and beautiful, but they managed to pull it off with aplomb.<br/><br/>If I had to describe this movie in terms of other movies, I'd say it's a combination of Brazil, Contact, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Blade Runner. But even that doesn't really cover it. This film is Japanese, through and through, both in the obvious ways, and in the less obvious, more cultural ways. If you have a fair understanding of Japanese culture and/or have just watched a lot of anime, you should be fine. If not, you might get lost pretty quickly.<br/><br/>Speaking of anime, the second half of this movie is absolutely anime-tastic. It's as anime as anything I've seen. I've never been a personal fan of anime tropes, but they are done really well here, and they make a sort of sense, not a particularly logical sense, but a thematic, philosophical sense.<br/><br/>The story is interesting. It's too long and complicated to describe here, so suffice it to say it revolves around two boys, Shōtarō Kaneda and Tetsuo Shima, and a girl, named Kei. I wish the story had gone more into the three of them as people, but what we get is all right, if a bit generic. The story itself... if you love anime, you'll love it; if you don't, you might not. It certainly gets more abstract and dramatic and less based in reality as it goes on. The disconnect between the first and second halves is one of my biggest problems with the movie, but it doesn't ruin it or anything.<br/><br/>Check out this movie. It is a building block of so many genres and the animation medium in general. Maybe you'll end up as speechless as I was. But hopefully, you'll be as blown away as I was too."

","28 years after its release in 1988 & My First encounter with Akira.An awesome post-apocalypse (sort of) movie set in 2019 & Neo-Tokyo after 3rd World War.(Only introduction I'll give about the plot so as to not degenerate into spoilers).I'm a huge fan of Anime & This movie is a prime example of almost prophetic futuristic vision in sci-fi& how awesome it looks in animation.Often better than real-life props,plastic sets or fallible expressions of human actors.It has everything,intriguing story,suspense,visuals,sights & its a pioneer in many movies which spun-off its characters & modified it to their stories,novels,movies & characters.I could actually see&remember so many of them.I've seen stunning animated movies set in similar circumstances out of Japan which remain my all time favorites like ""Ghost In The Shell"" & ""Animatrix"" but all of them owe some of the origin to this movie.So do 'The Matrix', ""Minority Report"" & at least 4 or 5 more that I can name that draw parallels at least.This is probably the most realistic scenario one can expect after a few decades of War & details are just exquisite.Definitely joins a collection of memorable ones I've seen.It's intense &music score is one that I especially loved.Considering how Lo-fi it does seem at first glance after digital revolution in animation in 90s & '00s,it's just jaw-dropping in how well it was shot.This is me raving Highly recommended."
"Victreebong","9","3","6","16 November 2014"," The undisputed definitive title.
","Akira is a film that will live long after it's initial hype and praise. Akira is a shoe-in for the Criterion Collection, if it's not already being considered. Lauded as the anime to start all of the current anime's success, Akira holds firm onto it's iconic violence, cyber punk and dystopian elements to this day. An anime that is as advanced as it was the day it was released, that's something to be heralded.<br/><br/>The facets of the film that make it timeless are the same key points that are emulated by other titles. The psionics, kids who are psychic, clairvoyant and not allowed to age into adults, are copy pasted into everything to Pokémon. These entities are not only important in Akira's plot, but are also exemplary exposition units for unraveling the plot behind what's happening in the film. But they're more than just exposition, they are the reason why the protagonist and antagonist are dueling it out to begin with. The psychic archetype owes everything to these guys, and little kid espers as we know them wouldn't exist the way they do now if it weren't for Otomo's vision of how they would act and appear.<br/><br/>The protoganist, Kaneda, and his tongue in cheek adopted little brother, Tetsuo represent two sides of the same coin in Akira. The two are compliments to everything a young man has to contend with. Tetsuo's seriousness is mirrored by Kaneda's boyish humor. Where Kaneda has a girl that's crazy about him and he's ""devoted to"", Tetsuo acts the fool to impress whatever's in front of him. Where Kaneda can effortlessly impress, Tetsuo struggles to impress with limitless effort, even as the film goes into it's third act. Their relationship is Goku/Vigeta, Asuka/Rei, Cloud/Zack and any other anime dual hero archetype you've ever witnessed.<br/><br/>The cyberpunk genre owes its entire earnings to Akira. Where Otomo may have looked at previous futuristic robot mangas like Astroboy for inspiration, Akira sets the stage for cyber meets biological in a whole new fashion. For example, at one point a character must fuse their limb with discarded rubble, creating a synthetic metal arm to use as a prosthetic. Not only does biological meet metal, soul enters the equation at one point. Is Akira a mecha suit anime, no. Does it dabble in futuristic Tokyo cyber principles via vehicle, lasers, big gun and robot appendages, like no other.<br/><br/>Where Akira really shines however, is in it's underlying metaphors of control of innocence, totalitarianism, religion and big government. Everybody is under someone else's thumb in this film. Government is facing riots for fascism and corruption, the army is being thrown a coup via political muscle flexing, gangs are being chased and persecuted, the residents of Neo Tokyo 3 can't move without riot police involvement or being sanctioned by barricades, even the Psionics are told they cannot leave quarantine. The entire subplot of Kaneda telling Tetsuo what to do, and Tetsuo's revolt are all key to this same principle that the only one who's truly free in the film Akira is, well, Akira! If you're feeling personally exploited, watch Akira. You'll suddenly feel better about your own 1st world problems.<br/><br/>Akira stands the test of time visually, metaphorically, literally, and of course audibly. The film is just as detail driven from every angle as it was when it came out in 1988. If there's ever an anime to connect correlations to every existing anime genre, it's Akira. You'd be plain ignorant to think otherwise."
"TheFilmGuy1","9","3","6","14 November 2014"," Visually Breathtaking and Extremely Enjoyable
","Akira is the kind of anime film that even people who don't really like anime can watch and enjoy. It's visually breathtaking and has a very creative and interesting story that will keep you engaged. <br/><br/>There's a lot of different elements involved in this story. A futuristic Tokyo, biker gangs, secret military operations, kids with powers, and even some blood and guts. It's certainly a story that you haven't seen before. I found myself quite engaged in the story and constantly was wondering what exactly was happening. Not to spoil anything, but even in the end there are some elements that are left for you to interpret yourself. But it will certainly satisfy you once things come to a close.<br/><br/>Visually, this movie is a feast for the eyes. I watched it on Bluray, and it's gorgeous. The colors pop, and everything looks great. I haven't seen many other animated films like this on bluray, but i'm sure this is one of the best looking ones. <br/><br/>Another element of this film that I really have to commend is the audio. I watched it with the remastered Japanese audio on the bluray, and it sound phenomenal. It blows away the English dubs that are also on the disc. Every little sound is audible, and it all comes together to be a perfect audio experience. I also LOVE the soundtrack. It totally fits the mood of the film and is great to listen to. I usually don't notice audio in a film as a whole, but you can't help but notice it here. It's perfect.<br/><br/>Akira is quite an experience. Its highly original and should certainly be watched. I would recommend buying the Bluray from Funimation, because it looks and sounds absolutely top notch. You won't be disappointed."
"TheBlueHairedLawyer","10","3","6","30 July 2014"," Holy cow, this was fantastic!
","People are voting Disney's Frozen (2013) as the best animated film of all time... how dare they? Akira is the most amazing animated film I've ever seen. The animation, all incredibly detailed and hand-drawn in manga style, it beats any Disney animation. Neo-Tokyo is a colossal super-city ruled by a corrupt government. Something happened in the past involving a strange entity called Akira that left the city in ruins. The Capsules, a teenage biker gang, most of them orphans and drop-outs, decide to fight a rival gang, the Clowns. While doing so the youngest of the group, Tetsuo, narrowly misses running over a strange child with a shriveled-looking face... suddenly an invisible force makes his bike crash. The leader, Kaneda, comes to Tetsuo's rescue but he and his gang are quickly arrested by the army. Tetsuo is taken away along with the bizarre child; the child is telekinetic and has recently caused a mess in the city when his guardian was shot to death and he screamed, unleashing his powers in front of everyone. Tetsuo becomes a test subject for the army's scientific division; he is operated on and vivisected and suddenly has hallucinations, beginning to become telepathic. He escapes and meets up with his girlfriend Kiori, telling her about his horrific experience. Meanwhile all the members of the Capsules avoid being arrested narrowly, and Kaneda starts perusing Kei, a teenage agent and spy. She disappears from him suddenly; she is looking for her best friend, Ryu. Tetsuo finds his gang after Kiori is savagely raped by the Clowns, but he suddenly has disturbing hallucinations: one of himself falling through the concrete into the earth, another of his internal organs falling from his body. He hears the voice of Akira calling him before the army comes to retrieve him. While locked up, he meets Kyoko, Takashi and Masaru, three adults, middle-aged, who were the original subjects of the scientific department back when Akira was alive. They are kept as children by taking various drugs but still have the appearance of both a child and an old person. The trio try to use their telekinesis to play with Tetsuo, but he gets scared and attacks them. Soon he escapes again, discovering he too has telekinetic talents, and this time he has no intention of going back to the army to be their lab rat. Akira was filmed in 1988 and in considered the most detailed animation in history. It has been dubbed from Japanese into other languages but to be honest the Japanese version is the best; if you can't speak Japanese, like me, read the subtitles, they're very accurate to the film. The soundtrack was spectacular; my favorite soundtrack was the song 'Doll's Polyphony', which played during one of Tetsuo's bizarre hallucinations. It had elements of Stephen King's Carrie: Tetsuo has had a hard life, abandoned at a school by his parents who never came back for him, made fun of by other children, and as a teenager being treated like a loser tag-along by the gang. Finally he can't take it anymore and unleashes his powers on all who bullied him in the past. And who hasn't ever dreamed of doing the same type of thing, having those powers, at least once? Akira is a thrill-ride from beginning to end. They didn't need to rely on CGI or lousy singing to make a fantastic and awesome adventure, unlike Frozen (2013) and Rio 2 (2014). There is a book series as well, which the film was based on. I can guarantee you'll love Akira, it's got unlimited imagination and leaves you with millions of thoughts and questions... sometimes a movie comes along that can make you dream, make you think beyond your limits. Akira is that kind of film."
"maxwell-pietsch","9","3","6","24 June 2014"," weird in a thoughtful way
","This film is weird in a way that makes you think and is interesting. It creates a new world with new rules and it's exciting to see how that world is going to develop and to uncover it's past. It is one of those films that was enjoyable to watch, with the regular action and all that, but also great to remember because it was so novel. There's a moral but it's done in an artistic rather than preachy way and so the moral remains open to interpretation.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked about this movie was that the main character is a kid from an alternative school. Actually both the protagonist and antagonist are from alternative schools. It made me think, ""lots of people are just regular, like these kids from alternative school,"" and it was cool to see a regular person, exceptional in some ways as we all are, be a hero.<br/><br/>There was also the military guy and the scientist, they were less regular (not in a bad way). I liked how the military guy said he was more concerned with action than with knowing, while the scientist made mistakes because he was so concerned with knowledge above practicalities. That was cool."
"Doc_Roliday","10","3","6","23 June 2014"," An otherworldly experience that frightened me for life
","I still remember how was the first time I got to see the movie: saw how cool Kaneda looked on the VHS cover in a film rental store and asked for my aunt to rent it. Little did I know I would get scarred for life at 8 years old, and would have nightmares with the movie the same night as I watched it. I have to thank this moment, as it scarred me it also fascinated me, since nothing after that touched me so deep in an unconscious level, and that made me watch the movie a thousand times during my life.<br/><br/>The movie is unanimously regarded as an orgasmic visual and aural experience, and I agree with it. But it's also questioned a lot by it's confusing story and unexplained ending. What I have to say is that the film is a tragic story about how power, when wasted and misused, means nothing, and how qualities like friendship and loyalty, as forgotten as they may be inside the human spirit, will survive after all the hate, anger and madness have done it's job.<br/><br/>It's the soundtrack the true highlight of the movie - the tribal, powerful drums and dreamlike bells, all make it sound like there's something out of the physical realm orchestrating the inevitable fate of the characters. After so many years and so many times watching the movie I realized it was the soundtrack that traumatized me, as the genius combination of it with some of the imagery can give a profound impact even on an adult viewer... On a poor innocent 8 years old who only expected an action cartoon where the red jacket hero with the big laser gun would save the city, it's an impact he'd never forget. <br/><br/>10/10"
"TheTrueAnimeFan","10","3","6","23 January 2014"," What anime is supposed to be.
","In a time where anime has degenerated into the same generic structure of dumb plots, dumb characters, sexual exploitation and overall no creativity, this film is a breath of fresh air. This film should be an example for all anime of today, a story that gets the viewer interested, along with mind blowing visuals. I highly recommend seeing this film, whether or not you are an anime fan. Akira is incredibly violent and full of inappropriate content, so this is definitely not for kids. I do recommend that if one is squeamish, do not watch if unprepared for extreme amounts of blood and guts. I must say now that from beginning to end this film kept me engrossed and wanting to know more about the struggles of the characters. The English dubbing, in my opinion, is quite good and does not detract from the experience at all. I had been growing tired of anime, no longer seeing any anime of the caliber of Cowboy Bebop, Wolf's Rain or Ghost in the Shell. This film brought back my interest full force, returning me to the wonder I felt when watching the wonders anime had brought me in the past."
"notoriousgrk","9","3","6","15 December 2013"," Tetsuooooooo! A classic anime!
","Firstly, Akira was originally a comic book series in Japan aka a manga. To finalise the texted series the makers decided to convey this by animating it.<br/><br/>The story's setting is in the year 2019. Its post world war 3 & a year before the Olympics in Tokyo, which interestingly Tokyo was actually granted to host the 2020 Olympics just recently. Kaneda and Tetsuo, who have befriended each other since school make part of a motorbike gang during their high school years. After riding one night, Tetsuo notices a mystifying child and shortly after the government hospitalises Tetsuo. This intrigues Kaneda, and he searches for his friend while acquainting Kei who is grouped with others in investigating the government. The plot tends to thicken, and the themes multiply once Tetsuo is found.<br/><br/>The makers animated this with such detailing it can remind one of Disney. From the multiple framing that makes it flow to the colouring that enlivens the scenes, it makes for viewing that amazes. This was done in a time before computerised imaging thus it was drawn and coloured by hands.<br/><br/>The Japanese styled music was pronounced in the film. This appears to have been done to articulate that the traditional Japanese culture thrives in the maker's futuristic setting. It also tends to contrast two time periods and balances the urban environment with country music.<br/><br/>Parts of the story seem to be open for one to speculate, consider and discover. As moments of the story tend to bewilder and encourage partaking and interpreting in the story. Segments of the timing of the story are mixed so it tends to move in ways that vary and asks for the viewers to join it. Thus different parts of the story's timing become revealed as it proceeds.<br/><br/>Akira looks to be a fantastic journey of imagination, anticipation, thrills and wonder. Its very likely that this animated film exemplifies for making riveting animated films and even came to inspire other films of its type to surface. On DVD (definitely) or Blu Ray (maybe) the making of the movie can be found hence uncovering of its detailing, planning and recording which can interest and savour viewers. A film of 1988 and thus a hidden wonder to be discovered and to ask what other wonders are about from here.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"GeorgeRoots","9","3","6","16 November 2013"," Tetsuo's Gotta Die... Like Right NOW!!!
","Now granted that when I was a kid, I enjoyed ""Pokémon"" and ""Dragonball Z"" immensely. Growing up I've became more aware of anime's many genres and sadly the majority I found were nothing but goofy, repetitive drawing styles & unprovocative story lines. Now I come across ""Akira"", A manga that apparently matured a way of storytelling the same way Alan Moore did with American comics in the 1980's. Suddenly after a little research shows that ""Kill Bill"" (2003), was influenced by the manga ""Lady Snowblood"". ""The Matrix"" (1999) was pretty much ""Ghost in the Shell"" with a fresh coat of paint, and practically anything from Studio Ghibli shows that Anime can be as provocative as anything Disney has to offer.<br/><br/>Tokyo is in the year 2019. Teenage Gang Leader Shotaro Kaneda, pretty much spends his time harassing other gangs in extremely high speed chases. Eventually teenage biker Tetsuo Shima is caught in an accident leading to his abduction. What follows is the gang trying to find their lost friend, and the consequences of what Tetsuo could soon be capable of.<br/><br/>Many who can sit through this two hour adaptation of a 1000 page Manga can luckily look forward to being treated like adults, as well as a VERY detailed animated feature consisting of more than 160,000 cells of animation! Featuring a neon lit Tokyo as stunning as the look of ""Blade Runner"" (1982), this film is literally eye candy. Every explosion looks detailed, every street corner has immense depth and overall every crowded place just looks consistent. The story I won't spoil for you, but it features everything you could want to revolve around a Cyber-punk futuristic city. Crazy vehicles, militarised areas and psychic powers from the most bastard kid ever drawn, all in all you have something that you can be proud to call ""Influential"".<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It's not for everyone and believe me when I say that, but for those who can sit through it all may be pleasantly surprised and optimistic in checking out similar works. 9/10."

","If you're like me and not certain about anime, and your only reference is Dragonball Z, be prepared to be dazzled and amazed. In the first ten minutes, this movie hits you with a plethora of intense futuristic imagery. Unlike with live action sci-fi films, the anime experience is only limited by the director's imagination. Anime is also treated more seriously as a medium in Japan than it is here in the states.<br/><br/>I don't want to ruin it too much, but if you are not familiar with anime and are looking for something that will transport you to another place, Akira is the place to go. Good luck finding a copy to rent; I had to buy mine, but it was highly recommended. I'm glad I did."

","It is indeed the greatest animated film of all time. The film broke many boundaries in animation, such as the storytelling, the action scenes and the content. I love how it doesn't try to be a kids movie, and that the film is mature, dark, and even sometimes dramatic. Most animated films in the 80s were mostly intended for children (i.e. Disney, Don Bluth) But what about the content of the movie? Well lets see. We got great characters, a great storyline, and great visual storytelling. I also love the soundtrack to the film. The soundtrack is mostly made up with Japanese Taiko drumming, and at times traditional Japanese music. It's a pretty unique soundtrack for an animated film. Akira has been praised by film critic Roger Ebert, giving the film thumbs up, and ever since Akira has been released in 1988, the film has developed a cult following, getting fans worldwide. This movie is very violent and graphic, so if you can handle the violence, you can handle the movie. <br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANIMATION FANS."

I've never been crazy for Japanese animation, but I have dedicated myself to have an open mind. When I heard my friend had it I decided to see it for free rather than waste my own money on it.  And, oh boy, that was the smartest decision I've ever made, EVER.<br/><br/>I hated this movie, with a passion.  I don't think the word hated actually portrays my passion for this movie.  I want to be as professional about this review as possible to convince you people this is garbage, not classic.<br/><br/>First off, let it be said I don't care about dubbing.  I can stand dubbing.

Then you say, ""I've been watching this for two hours, but I see no end in sight, the ending to this must be great!""  Then you have an epiphany. ""THIS IS THE DAMN ENDING!"".  And before you know it, the movie is over. Finally you say, ""I just wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life.

Run, run and don't turn back.  I don't really care if you people say this is a classic, they said Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was a classic, so why don't you go and see what I thought of that.<br/><br/>I apologize for some of the language, but I needed to say it to fully express my anger for this horrible waist of perfectly good film.  I hope they didn't kill more than one tree to draw this.  I firmly believe he people who made this ""film"" should be taken out of the gene pool immediately.<br/><br/>1 of 10.

","Before reading this review, understand that I am over 40 and am not an avid anime fan. I have watched MANY anime movies (my daughter is NUTS about anime) but my primary interest is in Japanese movies (such as those by Akira Kurasawa---a DIFFERENT ""Akira"" from the one in this movie). So, look at my review in this light.<br/><br/>Artistically, this movie is brilliant. When I was a kid, Japanese animation meant crap such as KIMBA or SPEED RACER--very choppy style animation and in their American form ONLY for the kids! Calling that old stuff AND this movie ""anime"" seems like a disservice because of this. Instead of poor backgrounds and extremely low frame-rates that made the shows look more like slide shows than cartoons, Akira abounds with high quality animation, backgrounds, intense sounds and action! This is certainly NOT ""your father's anime"".<br/><br/>So why only a score of 7? Well, the story is incredibly confusing---even for anime. I felt like I needed a script so I could logically follow along or that MAYBE the translation into English subtitles was flawed (I've seen this ruin several movies before).<br/><br/>In addition to being totally confusing, the main characters are unlikable street thugs. It's hard to get into a movie when you just don't like ANYONE (well, maybe I liked the one freaky kid who had neat mental powers).<br/><br/>But, for lovers of anime and anyone who wants to see an incredibly intense and high quality Japanese animation movie, this will definitely be a must-see. HOWEVER, I STRONGLY WARN PARENTS TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT TO LET THEIR KIDS SEE THIS. The movie, is at times, intense and gory AND features one attempted rape that gets pretty graphic! If you aren't sure if your kids are ready, they probably aren't!"
"rstarzecmoviecritic","6","3","7","16 July 2019"," Ambitious, but Too Much Packed into One Movie
","TOP RATED MOVIE IMDB<br/><br/>Akira, like other famous anime films, can prove to be quite bizarre at times. Trying to explain the premise of the movie is challenging since the story takes a while to focus on a main plot rather than three or four different subplots.<br/><br/>The movie starts with what appears to be a bombing of Tokyo in 1988, then quickly jumps to the year 2019 (hey that's this year!) and the city of ""Neo Tokyo."" A bike gang with key members Kaneda and Tetsuo becomes the focus of the film as we simultaneously see a civil war happening in the city due to lousy tax reforms which upset the citizens. On top of all that, there exist three children with psychic abilities who are being monitored and cared for by a group of military members and scientists who are concerned that a mysterious being Akira will be unleashed in the near future. The last important thing to note is that Tetsuo gains psychic abilities after interacting with one of these psychic children at the beginning of the movie. It only gets stranger after all of that.<br/><br/>As can be seen from the last paragraph, Akira is a movie that could be helped if it did not pack so much into one story. The plot is so convoluted that it is honestly difficult at times to tell who the true protagonist of the movie is. From the cover art on the box of the blu-ray disc as well as the first fifteen minutes of Akira, the protagonist seems to be Kaneda, and one would think the movie would primarily about him as a leader of a bike gang, but as noted above, the focus of this movie is all over the place.<br/><br/>The writer/director's choice to set this story in the middle of a civil war is interesting yet strange to dissect. As we get further into the story, we are led to believe that the explosion or bombing at the beginning of the story might have been a result of the titular mysterious being, Akira. Once Tetsuo receives his new abilities, the group of military and scientists begin to talk about Akira as a sort of common enemy that will unleash hell on Neo Tokyo due to catastrophic events in the past. This notion is reminiscent of people in power uniting against a common enemy in the graphic novel Watchmen, and the visuals surrounding the common enemy are strikingly similar as well. With all this in mind, this part of the story is almost to no avail since the common people in this movie are always seen fighting with the government. This common enemy never seems to fully unite them, but rather causes a ceasefire between the two parties.<br/><br/>That last thing to discuss about this film is its rating of R. It receives that rating due to graphic violence and brief nudity, both of which do appear in the film, but this film can easily be catered towards younger audiences if the nudity was dropped from the film. In the scene that involves nudity, it is heavily implied that members of a rival bike gang are going to attempt to rape a woman, but they only undo her top in the scene before they are stopped. If they are stopped even earlier than this, then this film could probably receive a PG-13 rating since the violence in the film is more cartoonish than disturbing.<br/><br/>Akira is definitely not a film for everyone. Ultimately it tries to pack too much into its 2-hour runtime but it is ambitious in nature, so it at least deserves some respect.<br/><br/>6/10"
"blazesnakes9","10","3","7","8 December 2013"," 1988: A Year of Anime
","The year 1988 will go down in film history as three major animation films from Japan were released and all three were critically acclaimed. One of those critically acclaimed films is Akira, which is probably one of the best films of 1988. The movie tells the story that is set in the year 2019, where Tokyo is built into a different kind of city called Neo-Tokyo. 31 years ago, an mysterious blast devastated Tokyo and now, the city is now being replaced by cutting-edge technology and warring political backgrounds. The characters in this movie are very interesting mainly because all of them, except for one, are teenagers. The teenagers are part of a biker gang and they roam the streets of Neo-Tokyo, looking for trouble. In the opening scene of Akira, we see them fighting with another biker gang called The Clowns. When one of the members of the biker gang is injured, he is sent to a hospital, where an government team is conducting an experiment on the injured boy. While the boy is being treated for his injury, the team gets a hold of a telekinesis power that is being put into the injured boy. But, there's more to that. That special power that the boy possess was the cause for the mysterious blast that occur in Tokyo 31 years ago. Even more specific, a young boy who was present in 1988 had that special power to ultimately destroy everything in sight, including the city. The young punk soon knows that he has the power to destroy anything that he sees and can only do it in his mind. He even uses it against the army that occupies the city by blowing up tanks and destroying an entire bridge. But, there's only one problem. If he overuses that power that has caused the blast in 1988, he will not have the ability to control it. That advice keeps popping up by the young kid who started the blast in 1988. Instead, the power will overcomes and destroy mankind as we know it. The punk doesn't realizes that because he thinks that having this special gift is fun. The real truth is that his ability to damage certain buildings and people can destroy his friends as well. While the boy uses the special power, an very aggressive Colonel gets involved with the young boy and he is also affected by this mysterious force. He also want to catch this kid before he even hurt or endanger the lives of others. Along the way, an government scientist teams up with the Colonel to find out the meaning behind this powerful, yet mysterious force. Akira has a lot of energy going for it. To me, the movie is a cross between Disney and the 1982 science-fiction thriller, Blade Runner, (it's ironic that both this movie and Blade Runner are set in the year 2019). The animation is very crisp and very colorful to look at. I also love the idea of having hell-raising teenagers as the protagonists, especially the young punk, who gets a hold of the supernatural power. The story of Akira is very well-told as we see this very imaginative metropolis crumbled as two-warring political parties and members clash against each other to win their independence and their freedom to express each other's thoughts and ideas. The story is also adapted from the manga of the same name. Add that and also the kid and you have a great anime movie. One of the things Akira does that other movies don't do is cast teenagers as the main characters. So many science-fiction films and anime involves adults and also older people. This movie doesn't fall into that category. I think that making teenagers interesting characters makes the movie work because as we see Neo-Tokyo develop, the entire population is swarming with warring political parties, government officials who are operating under direct orders from the military to keep everything in check and also the rebellious teenagers themselves. The main characters are almost like the kind of teenagers that bring out a lot of appeal to the audience. The action sequences is this movie are very gut-wrenching. We see in the beginning of the movie of the biker gang terrorizing the streets of Neo-Tokyo by assaulting each other while driving their motorcycles through the busy streets and highways, not even caring who gets in their way. The finale takes place in the Olympic Stadium, where the punk can't control much of what was given to him and he starts to develop into a giant moving mass, almost like a mutation of some sort. Even though he can't control the power, he doesn't even regret anything that he did wrong. We, as the audience feel his pain throughout the movie because this possession and obsession of using his power hurts him outside and inside. It even hurts and affect the people around him. The movie also tells us about how runaway technology affects everyday life like these kids that live in Neo-Tokyo. Akira is visually-stunning, packed with high-octane action throughout, and it is very violent. This movie is not recommended to younger audiences. All in all, Akira is one of the best films of 1988. It's style and action culminates itself into a anime classic. It's ground-breaking for its time and will not disappointed fans who love the genre. ★★★★ 4 stars."
"zetes","10","3","7","16 March 2000"," This film should be taken more seriously
","Too often, Akira is thought of as the typical anime. It's thought to be action, gore, and nudity packed. I think far too few viewers see the enormous amount of detail the writers put into their characters. These characters are very well developed. I think the conflict between Tetsuo and Kaneda is a very compelling one. How many of us can sympathize with Tetsuo? I'm sure nearly all of us can. He lives his life as a cronie, a short and insubstantial punk whose friends treat him like a joke. Then he gets these super powers, and like so many, he lets his power control him.<br/><br/>
Kaneda begins the film as just a punk, but as the film progresses, he realizes that only he has the power to help. He thinks, and I can see him think in the film. It's all very well done.<br/><br/>I also love the three children with super powers (I don't recall their names). Their situation, along with Akira's, is very tragic and quite affecting. The most impressive scene in the film, where these three accost Tetsuo as giant toys, is among the best scenes in film.<br/><br/>
The only problem with this film is that it can be overly complicated at times. It took two viewings to understand Tetsuo's past (and I'm still not entirely sure that I got everything). anyhow, 9/10, a near masterpiece. Much better than the derivative American film The Matrix, of which Akira was a precursor (and the filmmakers have admitted to having seen and loved it)."
"zetes","10","3","7","21 September 2001"," Upon the fourth viewing
","I have already written a review for this film, written after the second time I saw it (actually, a long time after my second viewing); I suggested a different way of looking at it, an approach more directed at the human aspects of this film (explored even further later in this review), and handed it a 9/10. It's greatest flaw, I stated, was that its story was far too complicated and difficult for its own good. Although by the second time I had understood it a lot more than the first time, many parts were still undecipherable. On my third viewing, on the new Pioneer Special Edition DVD (VERY highly suggested; you can't get the edition with the collector's tin anymore, but a plastic, and actually a better box is still available), I finally got to see it in widescreen and finally in Japanese. The Japanese (or the subtitles rather, since I don't speak the language) reveals more of the political level of the story. On my fourth viewing, the first one when I watched it entirely alone, I connected the story a little better, but many questions were still unanswered. But now my attitude is this: who cares?<br/><br/>Few doubt its visual mastery; only Princess Mononoke is comparable in the level of detail. I would say that Akira is still, even compared to Mononoke, on a level all its own. It's something that most people tend to look over when they're examining animation, but the techniques of the direction are actually highly developed. The techniques of direction in animation are still far behind those of live action film because the medium is not taken seriously. The Japanese are solving this problem, but Akira is still its peak.<br/><br/>I have previously talked about its more human side, trying to shut those up who accuse it of being nothing but spectacle. Here, too, comparing it with Mononoke, which stands as the most universally liked anime film in America (despite what Disney thinks; btw, if you think I'm ragging on Mononoke Hime, I do love it. Check out my user comment on it, although I don't quite like it as much as I did upon my first viewing), I think the emotional and human values of Akira are greater. There has been a constant fuss about the ambiguity of Mononoke's characters. ""There're no good guys or bad guys,"" is a popular phrase that I think even I used to describe the characters in the film. If there are no purely good guys, then what is Ashitaka, for instance? Akira's characters are actually much more ambiguous. I bizarrely chose to compare Ashitaka with Travis Bickle, the crazy taxi driver from, well, Taxi Driver in describing how complex I felt his character was. I'm embarrassed that I said such a silly thing; not that Ashitaka, despite his good- guy ethics, isn't a complex character; it's just that comparing him with Travis Bickle implies something that it oughtn't to. Now Tetsuo can be fairly compared with Travis Bickle. As Roger Ebert once said about Bickle, Taxi Driver is a great film because we can all identify with Bickle, even if we would never go as far as he did.<br/><br/>Tetsuo is the same way: there is an enormous amount of pathos in that character. Caneda is just as well developed. To see just how well written this script is, follow Caneda's developement throughout the film. He is not the same person at the end. Kaori, Yamagata, Kai, the Colonel, Masaru, Kiyoko, and Takashi have quite a bit of depth, too. Perhaps the only characters who come off a little thin are Kei and Ryu; this is because of the difficulties the screenwriters had in developing that particular aspect of the film, the revolution. I'm not sure, for instance, why they were smuggling Takashi away at the film's beginning. Maybe a fifth viewing will reveal more of those aspects. Of course, the politics are only supposed to be working as the background to the struggle between Tetsuo and Kaneda.<br/><br/>On this fourth viewing, Akira reveals itself to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made, one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen, maybe the best (and I have seen a lot), and easily the best animated film I've ever seen. It also stands now, in my opinion, as one of the greatest masterpieces in cinema.<br/><br/>
PS: No, actually, I'm not a fanboy. Check out my other reviews to get a clearer picture of who I am."
"thedarkb","4","2","4","6 December 2019"," All style with little substance.
","The film's artwork may be incredible, but Akira is held back by a weak plot in which I could find very little meaning. Tetsuo, portrayed as a kind of tragic character, never really has an arc until the final few minutes where he acknowledges Kaneda's efforts to protect him. He begins the story as someone angry at other's attempts to protect him, and, for the bulk at the film; remains essentially the same character, only with newfound power.<br/><br/>The science-fiction/fantasy elements of the plot seem desperate to be perceived as profound in some fashion and just come across as forced as a result."
"juliankennedy23","8","2","4","15 September 2019"," Sunk Cost Fallacy
","Akira: (1988) 8 out of 10: Watching Akira in 2019 is a bit of a trip it turns out. For one thing, the film made 31 years ago (That can't be right... checks math... cries...) takes place in the far future of well...2019. In addition, they cleaned up the film something fierce for modern audiences (Not one of those Ghost in the Shell 2.0 fiascos either. They didn't CGI up the animation or anything like that. they just made the picture much better with colors that pop.) While I watched it this go around with the Japanese voices and subtitles I did take the new dubbed version for a spin as well and the new dubbing is a godsend. No more horrible squeaky voices nonsense of the original dub (Though I do miss the Colonel Shikishima's constant Grrrrs from the old dub. Damn you nostalgia.)<br/><br/>As for the story? Well, this last time I made it all the way to the giant baby monster at the Olympic stadium... I am so proud of my brain. It usually nopes out around giant teddy bear filled with cream (I think that was cream. I hope that was cream).<br/><br/>Akira is difficult to follow on only one (or four) viewings. I have always found it a particular challenge. Each viewing brings new enlightenment (This viewing I found out the explosion at the beginning of the film was an initial singularity as opposed to a nuclear explosion I had always assumed.) But once we hit the Mass Effect 2 boss battle giant baby laser show I (or at least my brain) once again noped out. I couldn't tell you what happened or what philosophy was going on in those last ten minutes or so. I guess we can call the plot ninety-five percent downloaded before an error this time.<br/><br/>So what did Akira get right about 2019? Almost nothing thank goodness. As bad as it can seem out there we are in better shape than the constant violence and decay of cyberpunk Neo-Tokyo. There is a combination of very old technologies (payphones, jukeboxes, taxis) and the new (laser rifles, a really cool flying landspeeder type thing). One thing Akira absolute nails for 2019 is the major plot point of Neo-Tokyo preparing to host the 2020 Olympics. The giant mutant baby fight even takes place at the construction site for the Olympic Stadium.<br/><br/>The Good: There is so much that Akira does right let us give a quick list. The soundtrack is both excellent and memorable. The animation is jaw-droppingly beautiful. It is a fully realized world with many background characters and actions that add to the enjoyment.<br/><br/>The other thing Akira nails is the action scenes. Now the action scenes with the motorcycle are what gets the headlines. I mean who wouldn't want to slide/stop like Kaneda on that red monster. (They remade the bike in real life and it looks very cool. It is also very heavy and unwieldy. The difference between an animator and a motorcycle engineer I guess.) For my money, though the best action scene is the flying bike/landspeeder thing with the Gatling gun attached to the front. When they take that thing onto a freight elevator it ends up being one of the most beautifully drawn (and funniest) action scenes I have seen in a while.<br/><br/>The Bad: This is a dark film. Our protagonist Kaneda (who when other's call to him sounds like they are saying Canada over and over again at least on the Japanese soundtrack) is a violent gang leader of a motorcycle club, not terribly perceptive, and while he does have a young Captain Kirk quality in many stories he would be our untragic bad guy.<br/><br/>His ""love interest"" Kei is a terrorist who is unwittingly working for a corrupt government official to sow the seeds of discord to create instability and profit. (I put love interest in air quotes since she is older than Kaneda, clearly more interested in her terrorist cell leader than in Kaneda and only seems to end up with Kaneda due to the fact that everyone else is dead.)<br/><br/>Our main antagonist is Tetsuo who gets Akira powers from an aged child? (Okay I know I said my brain didn't nope out till the just after the giant baby fight but I have actually no idea how exactly Akira powers work, if there is such a thing an Akira power, and how Tetsuo was ""chosen"" to get such powers.) If Kei is like an older sister to Kaneda then Tetsuo is the runt younger brother. When he gets his powers he reacts with all the delicacy one would expect from a bullied boy with weak/short man syndrome. (It is certainly a more realistic view of how some adolescents would handle getting unlimited power overnight than say X-men has where they volunteer for boarding school rather than burn down peoples houses and kill their perceived enemies. )<br/><br/>The Neo-Tokyo government is corrupt, involved in terrorism and blames all there problems on the last administration's ill-fated tax cuts (Okay that might a bit like our 2019). Within the government, we have Colonel Shikishima (whom I actually have a soft spot for). He institutes a military coup, runs the Akira project and, I can't emphasize this enough, clearly has no conception of the sunk cost fallacy.<br/><br/>The only good person in the entire universe is Tetsuo's fifteen-year-old girlfriend Kaori. She seems to genuinely care about Tetsuo. She is of course beaten up, sexually assaulted and crushed to death unceremoniously.<br/><br/>The Ugly: I have no idea what is going on in the last ten minutes of this movie. It is pretty, the music is incredible, and it is as incomprehensible as they come.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: Akira is the reason we have anime in the west today. While getting a lukewarm reception upon release in Japan it took off on home video in North America and Europe and, along with Ninja Scroll, Ghost in the Shell, and Urotsukidoji helped break animation out of the Animation Age Ghetto (at least for Generation X).<br/><br/>Akira's influence is everywhere. The SOL satellite weapon is basically borrowed wholesale for Gears of War's Hammer of Dawn. Five Nights at Freddy's main antagonists look very familiar to the dream bear and bunny in Tetsuo's hospital room. Heck, I wouldn't doubt Kaneda's bike helped popularize Japanese style motorcycles among a generation or two.<br/><br/>Though Akira is a dark film with somewhat unlikeable characters it is also can be a funny film. It does mix in a lot of humorous asides and character rounding moments. It really is a strength of the film. I recommend Akira for the animation, the music, the realization of cyberpunk Tokyo and some of the characters. I still think the story is a completely incomprehensible mess, however."

","Japan. The near future. Tetsuo, a young street urchin, begins to develop psychic powers. Local authorities believe him to be the successor to Akira, a dangerous psychic responsible for a nuclear explosion which decimated Tokyo 31 years ago. Akira is currently in cryo-freeze, cocooned in a heavily guarded bunker several miles below the earth's surface. The Japanese military want Tetsuo securely locked away with him. Attempting to rescue Tetsuo is Shotaro, the leader of a rowdy biker gang.<br/><br/>Directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, ""Akira's"" one of the more influential Japanese science fiction animes of the 1980s. The film featured a larger budget, more animation cells and more fluid motions than was commonplace in Japanese animation at the time, and would go on to influence a number of directors, amongst them James Cameron and the Wachowski ""brothers"". And as is typical of sci-fi anime, our cast are a bunch of loudmouth kids who can't stop yelling, and the film spends most of its time salivating over machinery, vehicles, computer screens, urban landscapes, urban alienation and apocalyptic imagery.<br/><br/>Japanese animated films tend to be preoccupied with adolescent metamorphosis. Japanese culture is itself plagued with a specific form of infantalism. They've dubbed this phenomenon ""hikikomori"", which refers to a large, growing subset of the Japanese population who essentially refuse to ""grow up"", take on responsibilities or enter the workforce. In most cases this rejection of adulthood is due to a perceived, socially exacted trauma. To millions of Japanese men and women, the adult world has been discredited, is traumatic, offers little, and is already a nightmarish, pseudo-robotic, cyberpunk nightmare which offers nothing but anxieties and phony social expectations, interactions and demands. They ditch it all. Caught between the cosy, stable traditions of Old Japan and the schizoid dystopia of New, the hikikomori choose to remain protectively cocooned and stuck in limbo. Mamoru Oshii's anime, ""The Sky Crawlers"", deals indirectly with this arrested development.<br/><br/>""Akira"" is, in a way, also about extended adolescence and the anxieties of growing up. The film's biker gangs are populated by naughty kids, led by Shotaro, their own daddy of a leader. Shotaro constantly admonishes his boys for trying to ""grow up"" and ""be big like him"", but he's no more childish than the other figureheads in the film (some of whom are literal babies). Tetsuo, meanwhile, wants to break free, his adolescent metamorphosis mapping a passage from puberty and impotency to power and authority (he literally gets bigger and bigger, increasingly large and powerful). Everyone else wants Tetsuo infantalized and frozen, like little Akira, cryogenically frozen as a child and presumed nonthreatening, but Tetsuo won't have this. He fights them off, conquers his uncertainties and confusions, but goes positively nuts whilst doing so. From this point onwards, anxieties very specific to Japanese culture pop up: the fear of too much power in the wrong hands, of nuclear annihilation, of urban sprawl, of technology's smothering of tradition, the threat of overreacting leaders etc. Indeed, it was around the mid 1980s that Japan began to gain technological prominence and redefine itself. In many ways, ""Akira"" is tapping into a zeitgeist that was perhaps weary of its growing technological power and influence. And so Tetsuo paradoxically resists his metamorphosis whilst also revelling in power, an internal power struggle which eventually becomes too much for him to bear. From this point onwards the heroes of Japanese anime would get increasingly impotent, self-reflexive and stuck in existential ruts, until you reach the self-loathing heroes of ""Evangelion"" and ""Sky Crawlers"", social outcasts in giant robots who can't even muster the will to fight.<br/><br/>""Akira"" was based on a 2182-page manga by Otomo himself. The film sports a number of atmospheric passages, but its attempts at depth, nuance and scope also clash awkwardly with the demands of a teenage audience. Aesthetically, French comic-book artist Jean Giraud is a massive influence, as he was upon ""Blade Runner"" (to which ""Akira"" is oft compared) and Hayao Miyazaki (who adored him). Fans of ""Akira"" hate its English dub. Oshoro's next feature, ""Steamboy"", traded ""Akira's"" cyberpunk for steam-punk.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Worth two viewings."
"Quinoa1984","10","2","4","24 December 2005"," As inspired and bizarre an anime sci-fi film you're likely to see, not perfect, but still a post-apocalyptic wonder
","Science fiction films, even when they might be a incoherent in spots (and maybe the story and action in Akira is not completely incoherent but as an American some of the Japanese styling is, well, f***ed up), are supposed to raise questions about human behavior and thought, and be intelligent enough to let the audience try to fill in the blanks instead of force-feeding the answers. The film Akira by Katsuhiro Otomo (from the comic by him) does just that, and at the same time is a visual extravaganza. It has been quite a number of months, truth be told, since I've seen the film, but many of the images, particularly the more grotesque ones but also the ""simpler"" ones, have stuck with me for so long. It's a post-apocalyptic take on manipulation of a person to serve what could be considered the ""greater good"", but in the end, what does it feed but more destruction? <br/><br/>That there are some interesting action and character elements in the story helps, and after an explanation of what happened to the natural world (by way of a large, atomic-like explosion), we're introduced to a group of bikers. One of them is Kaneda and the other is Tetsuo. Tetsuo, while on the run from some other bikers, gets caught up in a Government program that is all too elusive for his own good. After some crazy scenes involving his body changing around, it's clear that things have gone awry, on both his end and the government's. So it's up to Kaneda, with a little help from some friends to stop the forces that be from causing destruction. It is through the various confrontations that happen with Kaneda and the 'powers that be', and Tetsuo's reactions, that make up Otomo's outrageous, seemingly unlimited visual prowess.<br/><br/>Aside from a climax that might feel a little 'long', however hypnotic, and how gruesome some of those transformations and the violence can get, it actually isn't necessarily as disturbing an animated film like the masterpiece Fist of the North Star or Ninja Scroll. It could even serve, as strange and 'heavy' the film gets, as a good starting point for those interested in watching anime and have never been much exposed before. Some sequences, to be sure, are not for the squeamish. But there is also a certain innocence that goes along with the story as well, with the theme of experimentation on small children. When coming from a Manga comic book, it's also fascinating to see how the film also works as a kind of transition into what anime would completely blossom into in the 1990's (for better or worse). And that the plot, once understood up to a point, is 'gotten' it becomes very worthwhile, because it deals with questions that are always abound in science-fiction stories, and told with an energy not captured in American films."

Tetsuo develops telekinetic powers himself and escapes from the lab...<br/><br/>In one way, I owe a lot of respect to ""Akira"". Thanks to the talented director Katsuhiro Otomo ( ""Steamboy"" ) this film became the first worldwide influential anime, and without it the road for future anime projects may have never been started. In other words, without ""Akira"" they may have never been ""Inuyasha"", ""Shin Seiki Evangelion"", ""Sailor Moon"", ""Hellsing""...All in all, it's a good sci-fi film, but not for everyone's taste. Namely, while on one hand the dark tone and imaginative scenes seem impressive, on the other the story looks confusing and the characters pale.<br/><br/>------------- <br/><br/>Some of the scenes look great even today. Like when Kei is walking on ( polluted ) water. Or when Tetsuo is using his telekinetic powers to bend laser beams shot towards him. Or when a whole building sinks in smoke. And it may just be that the finale where Tetsuo transforms into a giant organic monster even inspired ""Princess Mononoke's"" sequence with the white pig cowered with red leaches. The dark poetry is powerful, but it cannot hide the obvious flaws, like the stiff and cold composition of the plot. In the end, some part even look like disgusting trash. That's why the dark, but beautiful animes like ""Shin Seiki Evangelion"" still hold on better after frequent viewings.<br/><br/>Grade: 6/10"

","I feel that ""Akira"" is one of the best films ever made.  If it were a live action film, it would be without a doubt regarded as such.  But ""Akira"" is a film that alienates some of its viewers with the very complexity that secures its greatness. Next time you watch Akira, try this; A) Forget it's an animated feature, look at the screen and imagine the same shots are live action, it's not hard to do and you'll suddenly see visuals that would have made ""Titanic"" look like a Kevin Costner postcard epic.  B) Forget the sub-plots!  The sub-plots in Akira are intricate and elaborate, but they are there to enhance subsequent viewings of the movie and provide the background to a masterpiece that upon each viewing you discover something new about the world you thought you knew so well... C) Focus on one thing, the red bike.  I was with a group of my friends, and we had just finished viewing Akira and began talking about it.  One friend was explaining how the movie was about Bhuddaism, another was explaining how the movie was a microscopic perspective of a macropolitical situation, others had similar interpretations... a couple people mentioned it was about the relationship between the alpha male and the omega male.  From different perspectives, they were all right about what ""Akira""'s about. Then I explained that at it's core, the movie is about the Bike, Kaneda's bike.  The bike symbolizes everthing going on about the film, and how all the events are on a parallel course, oddly enough, with the physical condition of that bike. I could go on and on relating everything in the movie back to Kaneda's bike, but I digress.  Just, next time, before you sit down to watch Akira, say to yourself; ""It's all about the bike."""

For that reason it holds a special place in my library that may not be appreciated by all.  Still, it's corny, violent, artsy Anime at its best with a wonderful soundtrack by Geinoh Yamashirogumi! The original Japanese version is okay too, especially if you understand Japanese and can read the English subtitles together for a great laugh. I don't like the new, re-edited, re-dubbed ""American release"" at all. They re-cut the movie slightly, rewrote the English dialogue and re-dubbed it with more ""normal"" American voices to, ostensibly, better explain the movie. It's like taking a beautiful, esoteric, impressionistic painting of a cityscape and turning it into a color glossy photograph of New York City with circles and arrows on the back explaining each scene.

'Akira' was one of the first international anime hits and did much to establish the genre outside Japan. The story is complex and somewhat fanciful, and the aesthetic, characters, and 'acting' are fairly typical but the imagery is outstanding.

While GHOST IN THE SHELL ponders what could be, Katsuhiro Otomo's movie reflects on the past - especially japanese history - and toys with elements of surrealism to bridge the gap between between the sociological and philosophical layers of the movie."

","If you are an otaku, the first thing you will notice that the film does not adopt the regular style of drawing, the faces and figures are roundish instead of sharp manga-style drawing. Which will make you less reluctant to avoid watching it, even if you have the habit of skipping a movie by watching its dull beginning. The problem of juxtaposing the post-apocalyptic the low-life and high-tech in the making of a regular cyberpunk movie has overcome by its thick representation. But it has missed the little details of life, like those little-animated details of how nature works in the Ghibli films.<br/><br/>The ending disarrayed my interest, I did not understand the ending, the creation of the singularity and several realities and being existed in one of them, seems like too much complexity has been put in a very little amount of time. I prefer either startling and action-packed endings or happy endings rather than an obscure one.<br/><br/>The movie is free of romance, but promising affections have been shown in several scenes, In the scene, when Tetsuo escaped from JSDF by using his psychokinetic powers and returned to Kaori, to whom he surrendered his egomaniacal appearance, later devouring her unknowingly with the psychic power of uncontrollable dual identity. Also in the scene of Kei describing the mystery of life to Kaneda with the help of esper Kiyoko.<br/><br/>Maybe overrated but the improvision of the futuristic dystopian tech world with a thick storyline and layers of topics which inspired a lot of masterpieces this movie is worth-watching."

","The story is set 30 years later in Japan at the time it was made, it shows a possible future what could happen this year. The film was made in 1989 but the setting is in 2019.<br/><br/>Kanada and his gang of bikers get involved in stopping biker gangs which leads to their friend Tetsuo to be in a creepy hospital like area where they treat him and he has these illusions because of these three kids who also operated by the same people they look like senior/mid aged people but they are actually kids.<br/><br/>This is good way to get introduced to the mature side of anime, as it has a lot of gore, mild nudity and lots of strong language. With of course mature themes, I normally don't like anime which has too much gore, horror or nudity but this was actually really good.<br/><br/>There are two dubs to the movie, the pioneer and the streamline dub. If you want to watch the dub I would I highly recommend the pioneer dub as with the streamline dub there was a lot of mistranslation, miscasts and of course dialogue changes . If you see any weeb reviews claiming the dub is bad please do me a favour and pay no attention to them because people like them just love to ruin anime for others and just think they are better then everyone else because they think their annoying japanese voices are so perfect. These people are the main reasons why I always stick to dubs.<br/><br/>We have a perfect cast from the Pioneer dub with Johnny Yong Bosch as Kanada and Joshua Seth as Tetsuo they both fit their roles perfectly and we also have voice actors like Michelle Ruff, Michael Lindsey, Jamieson Price, Sandy Fox and former child voice actor Cody Mckenzie my only complaint was that they should have had another child voice actor to do one of the boys who were still kids at the time like Aaron Dismuke or Max Mittelman Borby wasn't bad or anything but they to create chemistry they should have had each of the kids with different voice actors with the exact gender. But Corby was a lot better then both Barbra Goodson and Bob Began as both kids since they were both adults trying to sound like younger boys but failed.<br/><br/>As for the streamline I could only get through 45 minutes of it and other then Cam Clarke as Kanada I don't think anyone had a clue on how to voice their characters or were even given the right direction. Luckly, Barbara Goodson and Steve Kramer made up for it when they did additional voices for the pioneer dub.<br/><br/>Overall if you want to get exposed to the mature side of anime I would high recomand this movie. It is big coincidence that this movie took place in 2019 and I am writing this review on the first day of 2019. Have a good year everyone.<br/><br/>As for you BatmanFunReviews I thought you were a cool guy but I guess I was wrong.<br/><br/>""I'm no fan of anime type of movies"" then question then why do you even watch or reviews them.

"elicopperman","9","0","0","28 October 2018"," The Film that Kicked Western Audience's Butts
","In 1988, a very unique animated action sci-fi feature came out known as Akira, based on the manga series of the same name by Katsuhiro Otomo (who also made the movie). What made it so unique is how it revolutionized western audience's perception of Japanese anime. While anime had been seen before in America, a film of this magnitude had never been shown directly before, and you can bet it left one hell of an impact. Any fan of anime nowadays pretty much owes their debt to this feature. As for what I think, lets just say it happens to be a favorite of mine.<br/><br/>Set in the dystopian year of 2019 in Neo-Tokyo, Kaneda and his biker gang lose their friend Tetsuo to the government to be tested. While that happens, Tetsuo develops mutant powers and causes chaos throughout the city, soon to become the next ""Akira"". From that premise alone, there is a clear social commentary on how our leaders abuse technology and power, which can lead to murderous rampaging monsters. The mythos behind what led to the original Akira is very intriguing, and the film does not shy away from going into detail about how such horrific events could have even happened, or what they even do to those in the long run.<br/><br/>In addition, the characters really make the film worthwhile, as all the events cause huge problems for each of them. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo is that of pure friends and you can really feel Kaneda's desperation in wanting to save his best friend whilst unfortunately having to hunt him down. With Tetsuo, his powers end up having conflicting results on him, whether it'd be making him stronger or making him diabolically insane. The others mainly consist of special investigators, corrupt politicians and the biker gang themselves. While their subplots can be a bit sporadic, they still tie in together with the overall narrative, whether it'd be trying to stop Tetsuo or getting axed by him.<br/><br/>But of course, there's no excuse in not talking about the animation of the film, which is gorgeously crafted. The world of Neo-Tokyo provides a heavy usage of vibrant lighting and futuristic special effects, yet it still has its own identity by showing the contrasting depiction of gritty urban slums. The more stakes and action that occur in the film, the more grand the visuals become, and even at their most grotesque, the amount of effort, detail and artistry put into them is enough to marvel at. Also, given that this was the first Japanese animated film to have the voice-acting done before the animation, it makes the lip synching, expressions and character acting much more accurate than most Japanese animated films before its time.<br/><br/>I think we can all agree that Akira is an animated feature with a kick, and what a kick it is. With striking visuals, creative storytelling and a cast of rough albeit sympathetic characters comes a film that became one of the staples for intellectual dystopian science fiction features of the 1990s and onward. If you're a fan of anime, science-fiction, action, dystopian films or all of the above, then this is a mandatory watch. Even if it might confuse you at first due to how complicated it is by concept alone, you might not get as big of an experience like it anywhere else. As it's the animated film that changed everything, maybe it'll change you too."

","There are few pieces of media that have had the seismic effect that Akira had on it's 1988 release. Based on the manga of the same name and directed by the same author, the science fiction film changed the face of Japanese cinema and, indeed, the face of Japanese fiction in general.<br/><br/>It's not hard to see why. Katsuhiro's world is dense and alive in such a captivating way; beyond the biker gangs of our main characters Tetsuo and Kaneda we have doomsday cults, government conspiracies, insurgent terrorists, mysterious physic powers... Audiences back then and even now are pulled into the world, invited to explore every nook and cranny, making it instantly watchable and perfect for repeat viewings.<br/><br/>Such a shame then, that this is exactly what drags the movie down, particularly in the second act. Cramming the plot full of so many subplots gives rise to many false climaxes and resolutions, leaving the pacing choppy at best. Particularly evident is the resolution of the titular Akira plotline, which seems like it should be the resolution of the movie, but upon looking at the remaining time, you'll be shocked to discover that almost half an hour still remains. Cutting a lot of these superfluous subplots would help the pacing greatly, but then again that's exactly what made the film so engaging in the first place, providing a serious conundrum.<br/><br/>Even more confusing is that, because of the inclusion of so many subplots, it seems that the characterisation and character development of our main characters - Tetsuo and Kaneda - suffers as a result. Tetsuo turns too quickly from disgruntled childhood friend to telekinesis-wielding antagonist, but at least this isn't as bad as Kaneda's treatment, who remains the same one-note, shouty delinquent virtually the entire way through the film. Why the filmmakers chose to focus on these smaller threads instead of the main thread of the movie escapes me, but at least another key area of focus for the film - production - paid off in spades.<br/><br/>The bubble economy of the 1980s made Japan a lot of money, and it's no surprise that a lot of this money was channeled into entertainment - namely, the burgeoning anime industry. With a budget of around $10 million, this is still the most expensive anime film of all time, and it shows. Everything on screen is animated, even the backgrounds in panning shots, making for one of the best looking pieces of animated film out there. Just watching the film for this level of quality rarely seen in anime films anymore is worth it, and there's no way you'll pick up on every detail with just one watch. <br/><br/>So perhaps this is why, despite choppy writing, the film still stands the test of time today, and can still be enjoyed with our modern eyes. Akira still remains one of my favourite films of all time - perhaps because of the impression it left on me at a young age - even though it can't exactly be called the 'best.'"

","This is an engaging story which is echoed by more recent productions, like ""The Matrix"", ""Minority Report"", ""Metropolis"".  I don't think it's themes were that original though it was original in its success in the West.  It is certainly stylish and still holds its own effectively among more recent animations and deserves praise for depth of story and attention to detail. It is essentially an action/adventure story which is neither shallow nor pretentious.  Forget the hype and watch it as such, and you will appreciate it as good entertainment, albeit unsuitable for younger children.<br/><br/>If you take it in it's temporal context as a pioneering Japanese anime export, it is excellent.  To compare it to the latest computer aided animations and more evolved plots is probably unfair but it is a tribute that it still remains largely comparable.  If you grew up with anime like I did, I would say there is nothing mysterious about the story, although it is certainly not spoon-fed to its audience.  Even the much-maligned ""giant monster scene"" is a simple, logical, dramatic tool, to metaphorically express a power which has overcome not just its possessor's ability to control it; but is beyond the very understanding of mankind.<br/><br/>7/10"

Viewing Akira in this light, I would say that Akira is above average for anime, but not as revolutionary as some have suggested.

Even this had been more clearly fleshed out, his behavior in the last hour or two would have made it more interesting.<br/><br/>Like I said, the opening was terrific, with the awesome opening action.

"hatsunemiku-27340","8","2","5","11 September 2017"," Anime for Adults
","Akira. Every anime fan worth their salt knows the name, many have seen it, and some understand the legacy it has. Akira came out in 1988 to critical acclaim and may be considered one of the first truly mainstream anime successes. Its success was enough to open the gates to the golden age of cyberpunk anime, paving the way for Ghost in the Shell and a slew of mostly forgettable 90's OVA's. With the majority of anime of the period being cast aside or forgotten, especially by casual anime fans and mainstream audiences, Akira has had a stranglehold on pop culture for years. But nearly thirty years after its release does Akira hold up? The year is 2019, thirty years after a giant explosion wrecked Tokyo during the Third World War. Neo-Tokyo is now home to motorcycle gangs, such as the one led by the teenaged Kaneda. During a battle between his gang and an opposing group of clowns (seriously), Kaneda's friend/rival Tetsuo gets into a crash caused by contact with an escaped psychic child. Tetsuo is taken in by the government where it is discovered that he has powerful psychic abilities. From there, Tetsuo and Kaneda wind up meeting for a violent and disturbing fever dream of a confrontation.<br/><br/>The plot is very reminiscent of Philip K. Dick and the idea of using psychic children is interesting. The problem with the plot is that despite the iconic biker gangs and general scenario, the actual story we follow is not exceptional. The mean rival becoming super powerful and facing off against his former teammate has been done before and done a million times after. The story that we follow is bare-bones.<br/><br/>And the same can be said of the characters. Tetsuo and Kaneda have taken on a life of their own because of how iconic this film is but I can't help but feel they are pretty underwhelming as a pair. Neither gets a lot of development, something that makes the final scene less emotionally impactful than I thought it should be. There aren't any extraneous character moments to show the camaraderie between the two. Instead, we're tossed right into the story and denied any real depth.<br/><br/>The same can be said about the relationship between Kaneda and Kei. The implication is that they are in love or have some sort of romantic bonds growing, but the majority of their time together is in the heat of action. I understand that compressing a large manga into a two hour movie requires cutting away the fat and the director would rather have a comprehensive story than well-defined characters. That's fine. And truthfully, the lack of real character depth in no way detracts from this film since the story is interesting and the world and design are fantastic.<br/><br/>The art of Akira is what is, for me, the most memorable part of the movie. Painstakingly hand-drawn with multiple layers for even the most mundane of shots, Akira is gorgeous from start to finish. The city is dour but feels lived in and the movement is ridiculously smooth. The color scheme reminded me very much of The Watchmen. It wasn't very anime-y in palette. In fact, given the fact Watchmen and Akira share some themes and have a very similar ending, I wouldn't be surprised if that graphic novel influenced some of the design choices for the Akira film.<br/><br/>Adding to the ambiance is an absolutely stellar soundtrack that doesn't feel like background noise but integral to the entire design. The use of music and the sound effects on top of the cinematography and direction shows that the production team busted their asses to make as good looking and technical a product as humanly possible.<br/><br/>Akira has aged well. It's prettier than most of its contemporaries and the plot, characters, and especially the world are still engaging. Pulling out from the nonstop praise and love it receives and looking critically, you can see Akira's armor is fairly hollow. But that armor is way too beautiful to be left to rot and belongs in a display case and revered if not for its substance for its craftsmanship. Akira is a movie well worth your time and should be a must-watch for all anime fans. Even if you're not into it, you should still be able to appreciate what it brought to the table and how it evolved the medium, showing that anime wasn't just for kids and teens, but for adults as well."
"rolfesam","10","2","5","7 December 2016"," The Silence Between the Screams
","Akira is a violent movie, nearly to a fault. While violence has existed in film nearly since its very inception it really isn't used to this extreme except in the case where a film relies on it for a central elemant of the plot or enjoyment of the film (such as in horror or war films). But Akira isn't into about those things, despite the elements of both genres that it wears throughout its 2 hour run-time. The violence and gore in Akira is simply meant to convey the feeling of basic feeling of pain and the crushing feeling of anxiety that the story's characters suffer through. <br/><br/>But there are moments between the gore and blood where there is just beautiful silence or near silence that come out of nowhere and just leave you with scenes told entirely through animation and expression rather than from exposition or any dialogue. these moments are some of my favorite in the entire movie with two scenes in particular that are sticking in my mind. I won't spoil the one that comes towards the end but during the first act of the story one of the two main characters Tetsuo begins to see terrifying visions and insinuation that show some really scary stuff in dead silence. It's almost suffocating to watch this scene without sound and it adds considerably to the panic of the scene. <br/><br/>Animation wise this may be one of the greatest hand drawn animated movies of all time. the skill and detail in each frame of this film is staggering even 20+ years later. Honestly there is only so many ways that I could describe the visuals with words other than beautiful or impressive. <br/><br/>The film is also a pinnacle in the cyber-punk genre of film, standing tall among other important films like Ghost in the Shell and Blade Runner as some of the finest examples of this sub-genre in film form as the buildings and neon of the city are as imposing as a wall in a small room, almost making being outside as claustrophobic as being indoors. <br/><br/>I'd recommend this movie if you were 16 or older and had a stomach for disturbing imagery, otherwise I don't know if you'd get the fullest out of this movie as you would otherwise."
"SpoilerAlertReviews","10","2","5","25 September 2016"," One of the most recognised, respected and revered pieces of animation in movie history
","This is something too epic to not see, Katsuhiro Ôtomo's masterpiece that paved the global way for Anime and Manga, gaining international attention and still remaining to be one of the highest grossing films of '88. <br/><br/>But for those not familiar with Akira or it's legacy, Ôtomo-san's post-apocalyptic sci-fi started back in 1982 as a series of manga and continued on till 1990 until and was eventually released into six massive volumes that wouldn't look dissimilar to a collection of encyclopaedias. The art- work is incredible and set a standard for Manga and then doing the same for Anime when evolving into the feature length animation. <br/><br/>The full story of Akira, is the modern Iliad and Tolkien of Japanese pop culture, an incredible work of science fiction on such a scale it's truly epic by definition and only fans of the original Manga series might be disappointed with the film adaptation as the movie is considerable shorter. Whilst keeping the core of the story true to the Manga, the viewers are missing, what I would estimate another 75% of the original plot. Yes! That much. <br/><br/>The story is set in Neo-Tokyo, around 2019 in the wake of an apparent nuclear disaster that decimated the city the year previous. The new city, though rapidly rebuilding is buried in politics, controversy, terrorism and an amphetamine-fuelled, cyberpunk culture that's rules the streets. Introducing Kaneda, the alpha-teen gangbanger who leads a biker gang of fellow juvenile delinquents and during a night clash with one of their oppositions, his friend Tetsuo has a near fatal accident when crossing the path of an escapee child, a government subject with interesting powers. <br/><br/>Tetsuo's recovery does not go well, basically being captured and monitored by the military, under the watchful eye of the colonel who is desperately trying to prevent a repeat incident that previously destroyed the city the year before. There's conspirators and treason within the government who know the truth about what happened and though it's not entirely clear the intentions of any of the parties, it boils down to harnessing or controlling the power Tetsuo has somehow contracted from his accidental meeting, leading to political intrigue, casting the government into turmoil and eventually a coup d'état with a rising spiritual revolution, riots and acts of terrorism. <br/><br/>Tetsuo starts to realise his powers and unfortunately takes a turn for the worse for mankind as his demonic rage obliterates anyone and anything that stands in his way of seeking out the absolute power, the child Akira. One way to describe him during the transition is being like Jack Torrance from The Shining, only with literally mind-blowing powers of Neo from The Matrix. The escape from the facility is bloody brutal. <br/><br/>The animation is still some of the best work I have ever seen, the violence portrayed is incredibly visceral with impressive action sequences that give the film a grand sense of scale and was innovative with out-of-focus perspectives. The opening bike chase in particular, with rear light trails, the velocity and detail gave the animation a a level of realism not otherwise seen in animated movies. It's very surreal, but so elegantly done and borderline horrific with grotesque images but balanced with vibrant, illuminating scenes of technology, architecture and science. I know this was a challenging film to animate due to being loaded with gorgeous night scenes, the cityscapes and lighting effects, demanding so much more from the animators, but the final spectacle makes it all so worth it. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is marvellous with a complete mixture of modern electric guitar entwined with Balinese Tantric chanting, taiko drums and other traditional Japanese percussions. Composed by Yamashiro Shoji and performed by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, it fits the film so perfectly well with Kaneda's theme song being high-powered and full of attitude and then the ambient 'Winds over Neo-Tokyo' being very soothing and dreamy. The mixture of tech-noir and tradition is conveyed across amazingly well too, with tracks like 'Mutation' and 'Exodus from The Underground Fortress' but Requiem is my personal favourite track because it captures the essence of the entire soundtrack together, giving a reprised merger of the key themes. I'm actually listening to it now while I write this. <br/><br/>This film was the ground-breaker, getting the rest of the world outside of Japan to notice and paved the way for international anime recognition. It was the main anime to reach wider audiences and was normally the gateway to other anime greats like Fist of North Star, Ninja Scroll and the more controversial Chôjin densetsu Urotsukidôji, better known as The Legend of The Overfiend that followed. Not forgetting to mention Ghost In The Shell. The films multiple posters are all iconic and instantly recognisable with Kaneda walking up to his bike being my personal favourite. <br/><br/>Admittedly, I watched the film first before reading the comics, which, incidentally had not finish running until two years after the film's release. It was this pinnacle film that got me hooked on manga and anime so I started collecting the manga and continued reading Akira as Ôtomo-san original envisioned it. Some, like myself, could be disappointed with the much-butchered story of the film but it's Ôtomo-san creation of both anime and manga, so he had complete creative control and who's to argue? <br/><br/>It's a masterpiece, an extraordinary testament to animation that perfectly bonds music, story, action and animation so gloriously well. It's the iconic film that placed anime where it is internationally today. Akira, the legendary anime that became the one of the most recognised, respected and revered pieces of animation in movie history.<br/><br/>Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 10 Direction: 10 Story: 9 (not 10 only because of the comic story) Script: 9 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 10 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being the ground-breaking, iconic masterpiece with some of greatest achievements in animation.  96% 10/10"
"Bryan_Roderick","10","2","5","20 May 2016"," All time best Anime Film.
","Akira<br/><br/>This anime film came out the day before my 1st birthday, yet I consider it one that I grew up with. Between this and Dragon Ball Z, there are few others that define my childhood exposure to anime. <br/><br/>Back when cartoons were slowly becoming more adult. I had forgotten how ultra-violent the movie was until I watched it recently. The animation still holds up today despite being from the 80s.<br/><br/>The music in by far one of the most memorable aspects of the film. I could listen to the soundtrack for hours on end. The blend of choral work and percussion is timeless and never dull. Not only that but the thunderous drums intensify scenes that were already amazing.<br/><br/>Before cyberpunk was even a big fad, Akira helped spawn and influence other films like the Matrix. Seeing this now, I can easily see their take from this. The blend of bleak future with heroes that do unrealistic and sometimes horrifying actions progresses as the film reaches it's second act.<br/><br/>The film had an underlining stereotype that Japanese people are fascinated by Caucasians, considering a few of the antagonists are typical Americans, large white, mustache sporting stern types, and the like.<br/><br/>I really enjoy that the main characters feel real. Kaneda is the cocky ""older brother"" figure who treats Tetsuo a bit harsh if only to toughen him up. Where was Tetsuo doesn't really get that kind of relationship and even through friendship he still resents Kaneda for how he treats him. It's super relate-able and wonderfully written.<br/><br/>Verdict: One of the best anime films of all time. There are some weird elements, and ultra-violent, but really should should look past that to the bigger picture, like a Tarantino film."
"jackstarr777","10","2","5","14 February 2012"," One of the only films to be thrilling, shocking, chilling, heartbreaking and hauntingly beautiful all at once... almost perfect
","It's such a huge surprise that Katsuhiro Otomo managed to pack so much wonder, beauty and pure cinematic perfection into only two hours of film. Of course, with the equally extravagant source material, I would expect the adaptation to be horrifically cut and toned down, washing away all the excitement of the manga, and though a lot has changed, Otomo has certainly done very, very well.<br/><br/>The music is beyond brilliant; it gets you heart racing when it wants, it frightens you to death in the nightmare scenes, and it breaks your heart in the sad scenes. Throughout the film, I couldn't stand up, do anything else, or press the pause button. In fact, I stayed sat down, watching the end credit sequence. I was so impressed by its beauty, that I got that glorious feeling of crying, as you so do after such a brilliant film.<br/><br/>There are a few very mild criticisms though, as the film is not without very minor flaws. The more recent English dub by Pioneer Sound is certainly more impressive than the previous Streamline sound version, but the best way to watch it is definitely in the original Japanese with subtitles on. Even if you're one of those people who hates having subtitles on, no matter what, it's much better the way it was originally written. The American voices often sound very silly and they draw away from the wonder of the story. And also, they cut out some parts from the actual film, and edited the music (no creepy organs, or 80's style action riffs!) due to some reasons I've yet to understand.<br/><br/>Another small criticism I'd like to give is the story. Given the 2,000 A4-size page material that Otomo originally wrote and had to adapt into a 2 hour motion picture, he did a very, very good job at getting all of the most suited bits and making the necessary changes. But, if you're a casual film-goer, you may miss the points and end up lost. As for clever people, they will spot everything and realise all of the points, and the clever but complex story will affect them as it did with myself. The first time I saw it, I loved the spectacle but barely understood it, but the second time (after I'd read the books) I fell in love with the story too.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what else to say... great story, great plot, great characters and voice performance (in the Japanese version at least), and the animation is remarkable, even for today! At 26 frames-per-second and all of the complex action, it's certainly a wonder how they achieved nearly everything with hand-drawn, hand-painted cells. It's at the level that we can only achieve with CGI today... and this is only a few artists on paper in a studio, with few computers involved.<br/><br/>If you love anime, you HAVE to watch this film at some point. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody who won't pay attention to it, but any film- goers who love a great story along with superb spectacle, this film is totally worth it.<br/><br/>Overall: 10.0/10"
"phoenixwolf20002000","10","2","5","20 January 2007"," The Grandmasterpiece of All Modernist Anime
","This is the film that started it all in terms of innovation and layered, modernist animation.<br/><br/>It defies pretty much all classical mainstream western animation stereotypes, which simply makes it all the more appealing to youth culture the world over.<br/><br/>Upon the first few glances of Akira, one might easily wonder where the animation staff behind it got their ideas for the film, which came primarily from Blade Runner. As has been well documented, Akira was created through a painstaking process that took creator/manga auteur Otomo Katsuhiro roughly ten years to complete in terms of the manga. All the hard work over in Tokyo paid off, because Akira, in terms of vision and story, is a flawless, well-executed anime film in every sense of the word. It is one of the most complex and well documented anime of all time.<br/><br/>Akira's story revolves around a secret government organization in Neo-Tokyo that is conducting mysterious experiments on certain members of a Neo-Tokyo biker gang and young children. The narrative kicks off with an extreme wide shot of a nuclear explosion which demolishes contemporary Tokyo, thus plunging the world into World War III.<br/><br/>Unlike many other, less ambitious anime titles, Akira is indeed fully animated, with vibrant flashy backdrop lights included in a Blade Runner-esquire metropolitan manner. The use of color in this film is nearly hypnotic in its radiance, making for much eye candy on many levels. The dubbed sound editing is eloquently executed as well, with a brilliant voice-over performance accomplished by then-obscure Johnny Yong Bosch, who plays Kaneda, a member of the Neo-Tokyo biker gang. There are many other notable VO performances in this film; however, Bosch delivers one of the most memorable.<br/><br/>Akira is a mature film in every sense of the word. It's smart, beautiful, and intense, with partial nudity and a bit of disturbing imagery here and there. Quite simply, Akira is one of the all time anime classics, and a great title to start off with if you don't normally watch anime. It managed to set the bar quite high for the entire ocean of post-Akira manga and anime that followed. It's the kind of film that The Matrix WISHES it could be. Akira is worthy of the highest rating possible.<br/><br/>As for the package itself, the casing is beautifully done, with many behind-the-scenes features that will easily use up a lot of your time if you watch them. Even without the ""making-of"" features, the film itself stands alone as a Wonder of The World among high brow cinema."

And I was dying to see this motion picture, and I got my chance to watch it last night.I could not believe my eyes when I watched Akira. The graphics were incredible and, that was not all, the entire movie was hand drawn. It sounded too crazy to be true, but it was!So realistic and very precise! And I did not believe it had a 1988 film release. AMAZING!! And the music was so wicked, it suited the movie for sure. Those thud sounds created a still and unknown atmosphere of the future Tokyo alright.<br/><br/>If any of you out there are wanting to see it, you'd better. And you will be astonished, astounded and amazed."

After second time, I gave it another. And another. Now I've seen it about 15 times, I can tell: it worths the trouble. Especially after I could see it in a movie theater (THANK YOU ODEON!!), I was simply blown away by it. At the end even closing my mouth felt difficult. Sot this movie is itself an experience, and no animated feature could compete against it.<br/><br/>The story takes place 30 years after World War III, when Tokyo is finally rebuilt as Neo-Tokyo. Motor gangs rule the streets, fighting each other, until one night one of them, Tetsuo runs into a strange kid, who looks like an old man. After this, he gets supernatural power, and destroys half of the city. His best friend, Kaneda tries to stop him, but they even have to deal with the army and politicians with different interests.<br/><br/>If you want to know, more watch the movie, because it is simply awesome!"

"JTurner82","10","2","5","18 July 2005"," Controversial Japanese Anime classic
","This ambitious, multi-million dollar animated adaptation of Katsuhiro Otomo's best-selling graphic novel series is spectacular, both on a technical and visceral level. A lot of effort was obviously put into making the animation as fluid and lively as possible, with stunning results that rivals Disney's finest. Most Japanese animated films tend to have a somewhat stilted frame rate (for economical reasons), but one look at AKIRA and you would definitely think otherwise.<br/><br/>It is important to note, however, that this is NOT a Disney/family-friendly kind of film. Neither is it for the squeamish of viewers (or the shallowest of minds, for that matter). This is a gritty, futuristic, post-apocalyptic tale involving juvenile delinquents, corrupt government politicians, and a cautionary message about the misuse of supernatural powers. Trying to describe the plot line may be a bit of a challenge, because at times it comes across as convoluted and difficult to follow. (This can mainly be attributed to the fact that Otomo was trying to compress his 2,000+ page graphic novel into one two-hour film.) It will take more than one viewing to make any sense out of this labyrinthine story, yet there are cautionary messages that one can ultimately take away from the experience.<br/><br/>AKIRA is obviously not targeted at young children, but at a more mature audience. Good thing, too, because the film contains an extreme amount of intense violence (and very graphic at that) as well as one brief but very disturbing scene where a female character is almost raped. The really gruesome stuff occurs in the last thirty minutes in which a young teenager (who happens to be the angst-ridden anti-hero of the story) has his arm amputated by a space satellite (with bloody results), gets a metallic replacement, and transforms into a gross, indistinguishable mass of flesh and gore. The latter sequence is one of the multiple ""bizarre"" set pieces present in the movie (others which include a nightmare in which cuddly, innocent-looking toys grow to enormous size and threaten a medical patient). The obviously frightening aspects of such moments will obviously alienate family-friendly audiences, yet at the same time explode with imaginative, grotesque visuals rarely matched in other films (unless you count Hayao Miyazaki's works).<br/><br/>Also worthy of mention is the background music by the Genioh Yamashiro Gumi, an eccentric concoction of percussion, electronics, chimes, and chanting. Like the movie, it thunders through the speakers with an aggressive, fast-forward pace and bizarre, surreal tones, ranging from energetic to mellow. It sounds like an unconventional accompaniment to such a movie, but it works.<br/><br/>The film is considered the pinnacle of Japanese animation, yet, as with many of the greatest films of our time, it has had its share of detractors. In particular, it took me more than one viewing to finally accept AKIRA. I first saw the movie when I was thirteen, totally unprepared for such a violent, confusing yet beautiful animated movie. To be honest, I disliked it. When I saw the movie again five years later, it wasn't the bloodletting or the plot that offended me, but the dubbing (not produced, but released by Streamline Pictures), which grated on my ears and ranks as the worst English Anime dub I ever heard. (To those of you who are fans of that dub who may be reading this, I'm sorry, but I absolutely can't stand listening to it again.) But after obtaining this more polished, professional sounding version by Geneon/Pioneer (more on that later), I at last came to accept AKIRA as a remarkable achievement in animation with strong, universal messages resonating within its turbulent, gory nature and multi-layered storyline. Even so, I wouldn't recommend this movie for the casual fan, but for animation buffs and as an exercise in artistry, action, and morality for adults, few films match AKIRA as a worthy contender in that category.<br/><br/>For the record, I have to tip my hat off to Geneon/Pioneer for putting a lot into remastering this controversial classic, and providing an all-new English re-dub. Produced by the folks responsible for top-quality productions for shows such as COWBOY BEBOP and OUTLAW STAR (AniMaze, inc.), this new version is superior to the original in every way. The new English cast (which includes stalwart Anime voiceovers such as Johnny Yong Bosch, Joshua Seth, and Wendee Lee) is talented and give it their all, and their efforts are amply supported by a script which is not only more coherent but faithful in spirit and meaning to the subtitles. (Using a direct literal translation in a dub can sometimes result disastrously, but this happens to be an exception.) The only weakness is that the spoken lines do not always mesh with the moving mouth since AKIRA's original Japanese dialogue was, unlike most Anime, recorded BEFORE animation began (hence why the animation is obviously synched more to the Japanese language track). While this new version may not be perfect, it certainly comes close, and everyone involved obviously cared about this legendary film to do it justice.<br/><br/>I understand that some folks have problems accepting this new version (given that they've grown up with the original), but all I can say about this is, if you don't like it, then don't watch it. It's that simple."
"preppy-3","8","2","5","24 May 2002"," Violent, adult and fascinating
","Extremely bloody and violent animated film about neo-Tokyo 30 years or so after World War III. The story is way too complicated to get into--suffice to say it starts quickly and never lets up. Actually, that's a big problem.<br/><br/>It does move quickly and is hard to follow (at times), and there barely a let-up. At two hours + that tends to wear you down. Also the English-dubbed language is very funny--all comic book clichés coming fast and furious. Still this is one of the best animes.<br/><br/>The animation is mostly superb. Some of the characters moved rather awkwardly and they all look the same (a real problem with Japanese anime). Still all the other animation is just great. There are some stunning motorcycle ride/chases/fights and the views of neo-Tokyo ""moving"" while the motorcycles are roaring really astounded me! Better than anything Disney ever did!<br/><br/>I do have problems with this movie though. As I said, it's too convoluted, and the women are shown pretty badly. There are only two female characters--one is a victim (who, for no real reason at all, is almost raped) and the other is the love interest who will do anything for her man. Sheesh! <br/><br/>Still, this is a truly fascinating film. If you have a strong stomach (the violence is VERY explicit) and can follow a plot going full-speed constantly, you'll like this.

","The most influential of all things anime, Akira no doubt played a key role in the popularity surge of Japanese animation & is considered a landmark achievement of its genre(s) that didn't just shape up most of the art in the anime world but influenced a few live-action films as well. However, purely from the storytelling perspective, it didn't do much for me.<br/><br/>Set in the underbelly of post-apocalyptic Tokyo, Akira tells the story of a teenage biker who inadvertently gets involved in a government secret program & ends up with psychic powers that are beyond his control. The only people capable of stopping him are the leader of the biker gang he used to be a part of & a bunch of psionics who know what his power can unleash.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, Akira is based on his manga of the same name & he has transformed it on the film canvas in a truly astonishing manner, setting up whole new standards in the process. The futuristic world it puts on the screen is highly fascinating to look at plus the cyberpunk tone present in its dystopian society provides the right feel to it as well.<br/><br/>The screenplay is finely adapted & while its execution makes sure that meticulous attention is provided to smallest of details, the narrative unfortunately isn't captivating enough & even the characters are quite uninteresting. The animation was a groundbreaking feat of its time, the camera-work is brimming with surplus energy, the use of sound is expertly carried out but its score is a disappointment.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Akira is a technical marvel that rarely lets its viewers breathe for it runs at breakneck speed from start to finish & packs in more action n violence than anticipated but considering its legacy, I expected much more from it. And although I won't be a part of its ever expanding fanbase for now, I do get what the fuss is all about. Definitely worth a shot, Akira is a must for anime & sci-fi aficionados."
"eddie_baggins","6","2","6","8 April 2014"," A visual masterpiece
","Akira is a film with a mighty reputation, an anime movie that has transcended it's genres typically more niche fan base and found itself as not only an important part of pop culture but a movie that in its own right is a peak example of the anime industry and a in many circles a respected Sci-Fi classic. Having to admit straight of the bat my complete lack of knowledge when it comes to the Japanese Anime/Manga world Akira is my first taste of films like this and perhaps one of the only ones I will ever partake in.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly a stunning looking film (which is a fantastic feat considering it was hand drawn 26 years ago) Akira is a film filled with more interesting imagery and ideas than a film that melds all of them together into a cohesive or overly satisfying whole. Director Ohtomo's vision for the 2019 city of Tokyo is a fine work of art, a world brimming with neon advertisements, biker gangs, rundown city landscapes and bright clothes. It's a world that is eerily familiar to us in this modern age and could be compared to an animated Blade Runner in its visual aesthetic and it's no wonder that names such as James Cameron dream of one day turning this film into a live action blockbuster. This world which feels so alive is the reason that Akira became such an iconic piece of entertainment for its story leaves a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>Watching Akira today the story feels overly familiar with it basically falling down to what people do when they receive great powers, they either do good or they do bad. The arc of the story can be seen now days in anything from Spider-Man through to Chronicle. Whilst this power play scenario centres the film, seemingly brushed aside arcs such as biker gangs, political unrest in a post-World War 3 world, disaffected youth and various other elements go by quickly and without much comment and one feels the film would of benefited from more of this and less creepy stuffed toys and wrinkly looking man children, but then again that is perhaps a key element to the films bonkers charms.<br/><br/>Akira is clearly a film that more often than not people relate to and respect and thanks to its bucket load of ideas is never dull. Whilst I didn't personally connect to the film in any type of meaningful way Akira is a beautifully animated film and a film that still acts as a unique entry into the Anime cannon and if you're like me and have not delved into the world a decent entry point to all its strange glories.<br/><br/>3 not so innocent teddy bears out of 5<br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

This is that big of a mind-bender.<br/><br/>There's substance to the claims that the plot can be a bit opaque, and I think there was too much of the epic manga crammed into this (the political subtext and metaphysics are only given a passing glance). But with regard to animation, there's simply no rivaling this. Look at the rippling destruction of a citywide energy blast or the blood spray of a human body as gunfire cuts it to ribbons; the sheer effort and attention to detail that went into this are staggering. The line work is articulate and the color is just stunning. This is a post- apocalypse and it's still a visual feast.

"The-Sarkologist","9","2","6","18 September 2011"," Considered to be the original manga movie
","The problem with this movie is that the creator attempted to squeeze a huge comic series into a two and a half hour movie, and unfortunately is leaves people a bit confused. The second time I watched it, I was able to understand it a little better and was able to follow the plot reasonably well. Basically the movie opens with a huge explosion in Tokyo which starts World War III. Thirty years later, in NeoTokyo, a motor cycle gang, during a rumble, stumble across a very secretive military operation. They are all arrested and let go, except their friend Tetsumo, who was wounded in during the operation, and is taken away. At first they think his is taken to hospital, but then he turns up later brandishing some rather nasty powers. Basically this movie is about the dangers of advancing faster than we can naturally evolve. It rests upon the belief that we as a species exist purely to evolve into the highest form possible, and that is a state of pure energy. This seems to be a Hindu philosophy, where we are constantly reincarnated until a time when we achieve Nirvana. I could argue that this is fantasy land, but in fact it is. Still there is no evidence to disprove evolution nor is their enough evidence to support. It all comes down to faith, even moreso if we believe that we will evolve into energy beings. What is happening in the movie is that the military are using experiments to hasten humanity's evolution. Though in three cases it began to succeed, in the case of Tetsumo, it has gone horribly wrong. One could argue though that they reason Tetsumo became so aggressive is because he had been trodden on all of his life, and his greatest desire was to be able to strike out. Yet he has a purpose that he does not understand himself. He is not a chaotic fiend destroying everything around him, but rather somebody possessed. This is seen when he screams, ""so that is what has been beating around in my head all this time!"" The question then is ""who is Akira?"" Akira is not the guy on the cover holding the laser and leaning against a bike. I cannot remember who he is, and he is a major character, but he is not Akira. Akira is actually the cause of the explosion in Tokyo thirty years earlier. Back then the scientists had succeeded in transferring humanity into the form of pure energy, and thus first person was Akira. Unfortunately he could not control what he had become, and this resulted in the destruction of Tokyo and the beginning of WWIII. We see this in Tetsumo as well for his begins to grow out of control, and nobody is able to look after him. In fact the three children must sacrifice themselves to rescue the Colonel and Tetsumo's friend. There is no real victory in this movie, only a Pyrric one. Most of the characters are dead and NeoTokyo has been once again destroyed, and the only way to save Tetsumo was to let him go."

","We've had many great anime films like ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Ghost in the Shell"". But there was one anime film that formed a legacy.<br/><br/>The anime film is, ""Akira"".<br/><br/>The film is also based on the manga by the same name. The film has some great animation and a nice story. The character's are also interesting. Who knew three kids with mental powers and having 60 year old skin would be interesting. The voice acting was good. Mostly because Johnny Yong Bosh and Joshua Seth did good job's as Kaneda and Tetsuo.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Akira"", is a great anime film that is definitely worth watching.

It's a true storm of pictures that will not only entertain you, but also forces you think. It's true art. <br/><br/>Drawings are beautiful and on a very high level for 1988. It might actually be the best that was created to that date. The music is interesting, and great the most of the time. Sometimes though, it didn't seem to fit perfectly. Characters are very interesting, especially Tetsuo impressed me.<br/><br/>I can't think of any flaw, but that the story sometimes seems a bit chaotic. This isn't so bad though, because it totally fits to the craziness of the movie."

","Saw this on sci-fi channel so I have no idea how much was cut out.  What I saw though was pretty cool.  It is a bit slow at first, but once a dream sequence starts up it gets moving pretty fast.  The story is about a group of bikers, one of them takes a spill thanks to a mysterious boy in the middle of the road and the army takes the dude who had the spill and does experiments on him.  These experiments end up giving him telekinetic powers...powers that were apparently given to another named Akira.  Well the guy ends up going berserk and using his powers to destroy the city, looking for the one called Akira.  Meanwhile his old friend joins some rebel group in the hopes of finding his friend.  The rebel group opposes the Akira experiments.  After awhile the two friends have a cool duel.  Parts are hard to follow, but all in all it is a cool movie and trust me nothing I wrote will spoil it for you.  This is a very brief summary of the plot."

It is inevitable not to compare the situation with the destruction, the fights, the violence, the sence of fury and nonconformity with the government seen in Neo-Tokyo. A city and a country has been carrying up the anger a very long time... It was time to let the anger out. Now the streets are full of dust, rocks, broken glass, tear gas is still in the air, blood. The whole country is in a state of anger.<br/><br/>What you see in Neo-Tokyo is the picture of our days. Unfortunately we don't have the same buildings and holograms as in Akira. It doesn't matter on which side you are, you can see it is moving, and is making noise. A mass of people in the streets.<br/><br/>One day, a cinema near the center of major protests and riots had a special screening... Akira. A movie which i've never seen at a big screen and a sorround sound.<br/><br/>The movie starts. The whole room knows what is about to begin. Japanese voices of caracteristic tones and sounds covers the cinema. Kaneda's Theme is playing. The neon colors break through the viewer's eyes. A masterpiece of Katsuhiro Otomo.<br/><br/>It was like seeing our streets, the people, the cops, the violence. Just hearing the Kaneda's Theme almost made me tear up. Not because i felt sorrow on how similar it was to the country, but how amazing and incredible sounded along with the visuals and colors.

Just when we got out, we see the movie again... Akira is here, Neo-Tokyo is here.

"BottleGourdPlant","Null","1","2","1 August 2009"," AKIRA and the Hibakusha
","Otomo Katsuhiro's AKIRA (1988) is an animated confrontation with various postwar anxieties that have remained repressed and forgotten in the midst of contemporary Japan. On a surface level it might be difficult to detect such anxieties in AKIRA; however, whence juxtaposed with a clearer understanding of ""what happened"" in the years following 1945, Katsuhiro's masterpiece can be realized as a vivid rendition of submerged history. AKIRA gives viewers insights into these postwar anxieties with a covert emphasis on the plight of the Hibakusha.<br/><br/>AKIRA opens with the destruction of Tokyo. A flashing white semicircle engulfs the city, an occurrence connected to World War Three. From the beginning of the film, war is placed at the forefront in remembrance of Hiroshima and Nagasaki preventing viewers from overlooking the destructive memory of the Atom Bomb. This powerful, lasting, and retrospective image introduces the viewer to the world of AKIRA.<br/><br/>The mutant children of AKIRA can be looked at in light of the fated Hibakusha (Hibakusha = ""Atomic Bomb Victim""). The Hibakusha were grossly disfigured by the atomic blast and those not directly affected fell ill to latent radiation poisoning. Due to fears of infection, the Japanese masses rejected the Hibakusha as lepers, aberrations that should have died. It is interesting, though, in such a postwar environment, Japan took up the faÃ§ade of The Victim of WWII, replacing the aggressive political overtone that previously dominated the country's attitude towards war due largely in part to the incredible nature of Hiroshima/Nagasaki. As The Victim, one might think Japan would have embraced the Hibakusha since the Hibakusha were the direct victims of the bomb; but no -- the Hibakusha were sloughed aside as nothing more then monstrous ciphers.<br/><br/>The understanding of the Hibakusha helps the viewer wholly understand the mutant children of AKIRA. The children are grotesque in appearance with white hair and purplish-gray wrinkled skin that looks as if it is dripping, resembling the keloid scars that plagued many Hibakusha. The children wield special powers and have special insights into the entity known as Akira, similar to the ""special knowledge"" of the Hibakusha given their experience of first-handedly witnessing the atomic blast, an experience the bulk of humanity can never entirely comprehend. What is more, the mutant children have an ambiguous social position -- on one hand they are embraced by the government, exploited for their powers, and on the other, feared and treated as Other. In like manner, although the Hibakusha were recognized as the true Japanese victims, living representatives of war-product, they were rejected, hated.<br/><br/>Near the end of AKIRA, the protagonist, Tetsuo, comes across the remnants of the entity Akira in a secluded spherical laboratory beneath the Olympic Stadium finding nothing more than dissected organs kept in jars -- no body, just parts. This image of the dissected Akira reflects the fate of the Hibakusha after they died as scientists dissected their bodies to better understand the effects of radiation poisoning. Although the affiliation with the mutant children as Hibakusha might not be readily apparent, the image of the dissected Akira as Hibakusha cannot be avoided. Katsuhiro draws from historic reality in constructing these images and does not allow the viewer to overlook a realization of the Hibakusha as the shameful treatment in which postwar Japan received the Hibakusha is confronted despite a collective social desire to forget and submerge such a treatment.<br/><br/>Animation imbues Katsuhiro with a forum that allows him to depict a fantastical reality with impossible individuals. His statements regarding WWII and the Hibakusha would not have been as pointed if depicted absent of animation. By using the unreality of animation to translate history, Katsuhiro successfully comments on the massive human error of 1945 and the years that followed.<br/><br/>***The history included in this analysis, alongside the specific insight regarding the mutant children, is taken from Professor Aaron Kerner's lecture on AKIRA which took place on 4/8/8 in CINE 401 (National Cinema Japan) at San Francisco State University."
"JSlack","Null","1","2","5 February 1999"," Takes two watchings to understand, but is worth it.
","There seem to be two main sides to this argument. One side argues that this is the greatest Anime ever, on the basis of it's outstanding visuals and intricate storyline. The other side says it's a load of things unpleasant, and usually emphasise less the violence (of which there is plenty, no one disputes that.) and more the lack of a storyline.<br/><br/>First, let me dispel that myth. There is an intricate, deep and powerful storyline here. It touches on the nature of religion (in much the same way as Monty Pythons 'Life of Brian' did, funnily enough) whilst also ruminating on the worth of a science that cannot hold back. It has characters who are genuinely deep, (especially the Colonel.) something which most people neglect to mention. One of it's main arguments is that all debts, good and bad, will eventually be repaid.<br/><br/>But lets also face it. It's confusing. The first time it's watched, nothing makes any sense, the government cover-up plot is too confusing for words and the cult is an absolute mystery. Akira (the character) is lost within the utter chop and slice manner of the movie. There are simply too many scenes to keep a track of.<br/><br/>But watch it a second time, and it will all make sense. You to work out all the pieces, make the puzzle fit together. And you discover a film that is far deeper than most films out there. For an example, watch ""Deep Impact"", another apolyptic style film, and see which makes the more profound statements. On a first viewing, Deep Impact is more accessible. But on the second, Akira unlocks it's hidden secrets. Akira is all about that second viewing.<br/><br/>And now to dismiss another myth. Akira is not the greatest Anime ever and never has been. Golgo 13: The Professional, held then and still holds now the honor of greatest Anime."

So when I was 10 I saw this movie as a reward for doing homework and I was not disappointed. Akira wins on almost every level. Adult oriented Japanese animation at it's finest.<br/><br/>STORY
The story of Akira is about 5 rebelious teenage boys who are good motorcyclists. They bike in a gang together in a post apocalyptic dystopian Neo Tokyo. But it turns out one of them boys are actually a lab expirment that is hellbent on having the power of a God. Tetsuo gets stolen back by the goverment for more tests and the boys have to get him back. Luckily Tetsuo escapes. You have to see it. It's a trip. If you are smart you will get the subtle touches in the atmosphere. Although the manga was better and complete you will still enjoy this masterpeice of teenage angst and rebellion. Riots break out in the streets. Goverment corruption is about
CHARACTERS
Tetsuo- Our little expirement always put as the beta male but comes more powerful. He has psychic powers.
Keneda- the caring friend of Tetsuo yet rebelious and always smarting off to his elders.
Kaori- The side chick of Keneda. She's always frightened by everything she sees but quite intelligent.
Kei- The rebellious girl who helps lead a movement
Clowns- These are the most ferocious dudes.
Colinel Shikishima- Wants to take back project AKIRA Tetsuo and do expirements with the Doctor.
Espers- weird elderly children that have the power of AKIRA harnessed.<br/><br/>There many unfleshed out characters but you'll see them but forget.<br/><br/>ANIMATION
By far the best animation ever in a animated movie. Akira is basically Manga in full motion. On a tech and art wise. It's better than almost any Disney movie in existence. The art style is semi-realistic. The technology is detailed and the animation is as smooth as can be. Akira may not always be perfect but it does everything perfectly. The characters are well animated. They gestate and move their lips. It's not like how in most anime even OVA where the character's are standing still flapping their lips.<br/><br/>Amazing lighting effects.<br/><br/>Pipes flail about and swing. Lots of complex designs<br/><br/>You will see beautiful bouncy futurist bikes with light trailers. Beautiful explosions. 3D perspective no CGI.<br/><br/>There is tons of blood and gore and violence.<br/><br/>The backdrops painstakingly detailed and realistic with neon cities, fancy buildings and squalid corridors. There is no cheese to be found. No dumb lights. No stupid unnecessary pans. Everything is smooth concise and consistent. AKIRA has aged well entirely.<br/><br/>SOUND
The Sound of Akira is Jaw dropping. Especially in the latest dubs and releases. But don't waste you time watching that. Watch the sub at 3 am you dank hipster you. There are amazing songs with Japanese traditional drums. Timeless sounding.
You will constantly hear spouts of TETSUO! and KENADA!<br/><br/>OVERALL<br/><br/>Akira is basically a once in a lifetime anime film right next to other Katsuhiro Otomo's. . You watch this and you're a big boy now."

","""Akira"" is the best SF anime since 1988 and it will remain like that forever.
I'm not really a huge fan of anime films/series but ""Akira"" is my favorite anime ever and even though I've seen some other SF movies/animations like Ghost in The Shell(both the anime and the movie),Blade Runner(both of the movies),Inception,Edge of Tomorrow,Looper,etc none of these movies delivered what Katsuhiro Otoma did with his anime film Akira.
It may be just my opinion but I think that the 2nd best SF movie/animated film is Ready Player One because just like ""Akira"",Spielberg's movie has:an amazing and beautiful story,characters who are well created,astonishing visual effects and great directors who are 100 percent dedicated to thier movies.
Even though Otoma's anime ending is just the half of his manga book that has the same name as the film,""Akira"" still has one of the best endings in the history of animated films and I really hope that Otoma will reconsider making the 2nd part of the movie."

"wemme","7","1","3","2 June 2016"," You have to see it, even though you might not like it
","From start to finish, Akira was an extremely heavy and intense movie, in every imaginable way. The fast pace, the cynical story set in a cynical universe, and all the brutal violence makes Akira a very difficult film to sit through. What keeps the viewer mesmerized however, is the extraordinary animation. Every shot is breathtaking and in all the gore and cynicism, it's absolutely beautiful. Akira is a work of art and a stunning masterpiece that needs to be acknowledged and remembered (believe me, it's hard to forget the experience), but I cannot really say I liked the film, at least I didn't enjoy it, as much as I appreciated it. <br/><br/>Even though the universe that the movie takes place in is very complex and a lot of the movie experience is trying to understand it, the underlying plot is rather simple; ultimate power is unfortunately given to someone who can't handle it and wreaks havoc. But what really stands out about Akira and makes it very likable, is that it takes so many chances, it shies away from nothing and just when you think the story can't become any more insane, it manages to surprise you again and again. <br/><br/>The 7/10 rating is a personal compromise; Akira is absolutely amazing, but it left me feeling hollow and heavy. It's an experience no avid film-lover should miss, but I don't have the stomach to give it a higher rating. I personally find the story very lacking, but much of the imagery is incredible and will stay with me for a very long time."
"reviewsreviewswastaken","7","1","3","3 August 2015"," A Well-Thought Out Beautiful World
","I'll start off by saying that the concept behind Akira is extremely interesting and I will be sure to check out the Manga to find out more about the film and it's background. In addition to this it is animated beautifully. What the film lacks is consistency in it's execution, which I should say won't bother most people, in fact I think this film is pretty entertaining but I don't review based on entertainment I review based on execution. <br/><br/>The thing about this film that irritated me the most was the inconsistency of sound mixing, particularly footsteps. The way footsteps are integrated into the environment is a little absurd, I have never heard footsteps as well-defined as the ones in Akira, and as well as this the surfaces on which footsteps can be heard is incredibly inconsistent. It's a pretty minor thing but if you notice it it's really annoying. I have to say the score is pretty great, it's intense and well-used. There are places where the integration of the score into the environment is a little awkward but forgivable. A big problem with sounds mixing was the use of silence. This is mainly due to the fact that once the silence is brought on it doesn't stay. Rather than remaining in silence the film moves in and out of silence without changing location, which could be believable if someone was causing this to happen, but the change in volume was too abrupt and awkward. <br/><br/>While the film is animated beautifully the use of depth of field in like 10 shots out of 5000 or so, is really distracting. When the rest of the movie is animated as if everything is in focus and then there is one out of place shot, where someone or something is out of focus is really odd and like I said distracting. As well as this the editing is really weird in some spots. Example, a character is being swallowed up and the film slowly fades to black as character gets swallowed, cuts to the events outside, and then cuts back inside where the environment is no longer black like before but as bright as the outside, and then fades halfway to black before cutting back outside. It's not something most people notice but for me it was a really odd thing to watch.<br/><br/>I have to give props to the writers for being incredibly intelligent in their adaptation from manga to anime. There are quite a few things that aren't fully explained within the film, but the world that exists withing the movie isn't able to explain those things to you and so I personally felt satisfied with not fully understanding all aspects of the plot, because even the characters sometimes don't understand what has happened. I saw the movie with a friend who has read the manga and told me most of the things I didn't fully understand were explained in the manga, so the move to adapt the world presented in the film as slightly different to the manga was very intelligent. <br/><br/>Overall intelligent, well-thought out, beautifully animated and entertaining, check it out, especially if you've never seen any anime before, this film is a great bridge into that kind of thing."
"MattBirk","8","1","3","27 July 2015"," Not only a great Anime, but a fantastic Sci-Fi Film as well
","Based on reputation alone, I expected quite a bit from Akira, and I have to say it mostly lived up to its reputation. I say mostly because I was led to believe this movie had battles similar to Dragonball Z (superpowered characters facing off against one another), but that certainly is not the case here. I guess I was expecting a bit more 1v1 battles between espers (those with psychic abilities), but instead, the movie had a deeper story to tell. Akira is a brash and dark film that takes place in a dystopian future where the government is struggling to keep secret the evolution of mankind. The concept alone was enough to hook me in and using animation was the perfect medium for this type of story to fully flourish.<br/><br/>Everything in the movie was unique to say the least, from an animation standpoint to its bizarre conclusion. If you go into this movie thinking it will be nothing more than action or your typical 'strange' anime, you will be quite surprised at how much detail goes into the story itself. There are a ton of ideas floating around (albeit a bit too many to fully understand most of the time) but the important ones are developed quite nicely. But those larger ideas that they choose to focus on really do thrive thanks to the animation, which as I said, know no bounds except the imagination of its creator. The only downside seemed to be most of what occurs in the first half of the movie seems a tad irrelevant in the end. It was as if the creators were trying to throw in too many ideas from the manga into the movie and it became a bit convoluted. But that is where the whole idea of rewatching the movie comes into play, Akira makes a bit more sense having seen where the story goes in the end. That way, as the movie progresses you can follow what exactly characters mean when talking about past events that occurred which we are given very little detail about.<br/><br/>But the main driving force behind Akira (for me) had to be the idea of unleashing the supremely powerful Akira. Knowing that he was powerful enough to release the energy equivalent of a hydrogen bomb was enough to suck me in for the entire runtime. It was this idea that made the movie interesting if not nerve-wracking because we don't exactly know what kind of a person Akira is, is he good or bad? Will he save the world or choose to destroy? It was this type of trepidation building throughout the entire movie which lead to the final climax of the film that worked for the most part. I have to admit, I wasn't expecting the type of ending the movie had, at first I was disappointed with how everything ended up, but as time went by, I kept thinking more and more about the ending. And eventually came to the conclusion that the ending was justified. It not only leaves the viewer in awe but more importantly, it leaves a very strong lasting impression.<br/><br/>Looking back on the film, the actual storyline of the movie is a bit more interesting to me than what was put on film (possibly meaning the manga would be something I should look into). While I didn't necessarily love the movie like I thought I would, mostly because it seemed to have pacing issues (at least the first hour of the film), the story itself was right up my alley. That being said, I would gladly watch the second half of the movie because that's where the action picks up, the telekinesis starts to appear, the characters start coming together, and the movie dives deep into hardcore science-fiction. Assuming you have no problem with anime and can buy into the idea of telekinesis, Akira is something everyone should see based on the impact it had within the film industry."

","First off, Akira was one of the best anime films of it's time. The story, characters, and animation itself are amazing! Anyone who truly appreciates Japanese culture and art MUST experience this film.<br/><br/>Here's my problem: The new English cast. Just awful. In the original, the voices and acting actually MATCHED the characters. The new cast was supposedly an attempt to produce a mre ""accurate"" English dub, but the film lost so much with the new dub.<br/><br/>This is NOT pining away for the ""old school"" version and being all nostalgic. I think anyone who experienced the originial would agree. Good thing I still got an original copy. On friggin' VHS."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","10 August 2014"," Brutal violence, deep ideas, masterful animation
","Akira is a giant in its field. Based on a highly popular manga series and directed by said manga's original writer Katsuhiro Ohtomo, it's a film that helped popularize anime culture in the West. It was nothing like we had seen before, being aimed solely at the adults, containing graphic sexual references, disturbing and gory images, heavy themes and more violence than any two Hollywood action blockbusters put together. It's also a thoughtful story and analogy about a young man forced to grow up too quickly and being confronted with strange phenomena, feelings and powers he's not yet mature enough to understand, let alone control.<br/><br/>So what's the story? Kaneda is young hooligan belonging to a motorcycle gang. They're enjoying their freedom and mischief, until one day his friend and fellow gang member Tetsuo happens upon a small child, who's much more than he seems. Tetsuo gets injured and happens to absorb some of the child's power. From there the eponymous Akira seizes control and lures Tetsuo into trying to free him. And from there it's a nonstop battle for the survival of Neo-Tokyo, Tetsuo's soul and everyone's lives. All told through phenomenal voice acting, alluring twists, great plot points and animation so vivid, gorgeous, detailed and vibrant that people have made completely valid arguments for this being the crowning achievement of animation.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the score is very good. It's not what you would expect from a movie such as this, being more groovy and ethnic than the normal pop and electric tunes, but it fits. You're always a bit surprised by it, but after a few moments you'll start digging it.<br/><br/>Akira is a masterpiece. If you can, do read the manga series beforehand, because it's well worth it and offers a deeper understanding of the material. But, if you can't, this movie will still win you over with its brazen style, high impact concepts, beauty and sheer energy."

Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo runs into Takashi who escaped from a secret government laboratory. There is a dissident anti-government organization. Meanwhile military scientists is experimenting on supernatural powers.<br/><br/>While the style is ground breaking, I would have wanted a clearer story with a more prominent main character. The movie should really follow Tetsuo and let him discover the secrets for us. Instead we keep switching to the bad guys who tells us everything. It's a pretty good story with an impressive imaginative style."

","The supreme level of animation and imagination seen in the movie makes you question the fact that it was made in 1988; the hand-drawn cityscapes and bike chases leave you in awe.The themes, the characters and the circumstances are universally relateable. The concept and climax of the movie maybe a little confusing to many viewers, but once you get a hold of it, it's quite fascinating.<br/><br/>Katsuhiro Otomo adapts his well-acclaimed manga (graphic novel), 'Akira', for the screen. The movie seems a little longer than necessary, and a bit dragging towards the second half, but I guess it was unavoidable due to its 6-volume 2200-page original story. The characters are likable and interesting, especially that of Kaneda. The background score and effects are strong and exhilarating, and go well with the story.<br/><br/>The story starts with a great premise and a lot of promise, but towards the end (after the revelation of all its scientific principles) it just seems a bit underwhelming; not a great (or epic) ending I expected it to have. Still, it's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and can be relished for its spectacular animation, intriguing plot, shady and interesting characters, and delightful humour.<br/><br/>One thing everyone has to accept, when 'Akira' released in 1988, it paved a completely new level animation or science-fiction could achieve in storytelling as well as graphics."
"SkullyD","Null","1","3","6 April 2007"," One of the greatest films ever.
","Akira, is not only a great example of what good Anime can be, but is also a great film. I would stack it against live action sci-fi epics like Star Wars and Blade Runner. While I personally think Ghost in the Shell was better animated, Akira's fury and brutality make it a film which you cannot simply watch on a superficial level. I read a review which said Akira was ""ugly.' Yeah, it is ugly. It's meant to be ugly. The beauty of the animation is how gritty it is. How it takes the Utopian vision of the future depicted by numerous bad sci-fi movies and sprays graffiti on it's pristine walls. The essence of Akira is the ugly side of teen culture and supposedly ""enlightned"" social philosophy.<br/><br/>Akira is not the first or last film to make us squirm for a reason. A Clockwork Orange used violent and sexually charged images to show the possible future of suburban youth. Schindler's List made us cringe at the graphic depictions of Auschwitz, so that we would remember what happened there.<br/><br/>Akira's plot centers around young Tetsuo, a street punk who plays second banana to his bike gang's leader, childhood friend Kaneda. Tetsuo is subjected to military experiments which unleash his dormant psionic abilities, and also cause him to grow increasingly paranoid and angry. Tetsuo becomes determined to discover who ""Akira"" is and why some of the other test subjects seem to believe Tetsuo is Akira reincarnated. As Tetsuo's power grows he becomes increasingly powerful, leading him to a violent confrontation with both Kaneda and the military.<br/><br/>In the end, the message of Akira is that humankind must be aware of the dark side of progress. The power of Akira is within everyone but is dangerous when misused. Much like the atom bomb, which the film makes reference to, this power can destroy cities and end millions of lives if it ends up in the wrong hands. Considering what our nuclear weapons did to Japan in the 1940's, and considering Japan's commitment to not manufacture weapons of war, the anti-nuke statement of the film is apparent and is one which it begs us not to ignore."

","Excellent movie. This movie has influenced a lot of other anime makers, I can be quite sure.<br/><br/>The movie starts of with a chopper chase action scene, which is greatly animated, after that the movie relies more in story telling than on action itself. So this might not be the best movie for the typical Dragonball Z fan, who only wants action in anime (i like DBZ though, don't get me wrong. But you get my point)<br/><br/>As I said before, this movie relies a lot on storyline, building up to an absolute climax at the end. And this is what makes this movie so great. Some of the scenes throughout the movie, some people might find boring, but you forget all about it at the end. It just all comes together.<br/><br/>Music, animation, storyline. Everything comes together so perfectly in this movie. You really need to see this if you are into Anime.<br/><br/>9/10"

","And I mean it. Over 2/3 of this movie is infested with blood, guns, and torture. It is obviously meant to emphasize chaos, but still, ugh! Even so, it works through it. ""Akira"" is probably one of the most mind-provoking films I've ever watched. No matter how profane, shocking, or disastrous the society of the setting is, the ending is godly and relieving, one of the best endings ever.<br/><br/>It being a manga film, a type that I normally don't like, I expected an awful plot, stupid language, and bad quality. However, when I heard how great everybody kept saying it was, I decided to give it a try, and man, was I unprepared, for the violence and awe both. It left me with wide eyes, literally, and that's rare for me.<br/><br/>For you manga-lovers out there, I don't even have to tell you this, but the graphics and animation are great! The features of each characters look so real and expressive, and instead of having the characters' jaws move only up and down like most manga, the characters actually talk! Their lips move like they're talking, not clapping together like when you eat with your mouth open. Now, that's very typical for modern animation, but honestly, I was still impressed.<br/><br/>The themes and symbols of morals were very well-represented and unique, something hard to accomplish for even live-action films. The ending is probably the best. A little child's last words of wisdom stay with you even after the end as they foreshadow the outcome of the city of Neo-Tokyo. After almost 2 hours of horror and profanity, there's finally a moment of beautiful silence and peace as the only 4 surviving characters walk through the ruins.<br/><br/>Overall, it's just such a great film and it keeps you awake throughout the whole thing. So, if you're the action fan, just sit and enjoy this movie and remember one thing: don't let the kids in."

","Excellent entertainment. It has it's small flaws, but it also has a lot of big strenghts.<br/><br/>The animation is so beautiful it's breathtaking. Watching what looks like a million pieces of glass fall to earth in slow motion in one scene is a visual feast in its own right. Attention to detail has always been the forte of anime - and here it is taken to a new level. The color scheme sets it apart from most other animated movies, and the combination of ultra-high tech look with traditional Japanese music works astonishingly well.<br/><br/>The story - well I am in two minds about that. Certainly it is original, and it moves along smoothly. The story is also not too far dumbed down for the lowest common denominator, and we even get to be treated to some political and socio-critical comments. <br/><br/>The characters seem human. They gain a little depth and the violence they dish out isn't just there to make you go ""Wow"". They don't just kill and walk on. The heroine even has nearly a hysterical fit after she kills. This helps no end to identify with the human side of the protagonists.<br/><br/>However, the point I dread in most anime movies is the long ""I'll explain the meaning of life, the universe and everything""-speech which seems to be a must in these type of films. Unfortunately at this point most writers make complete fools of themselves and 'Akira' is no exception here. When watching it once you can just get over it and move on. But if you watch it many times, like I have, this scene will get on your nerves. This somehow devalues what would have otherwise been the best anime movie of its time (and it is this part which elevates 'Ghost in the Shell' to the number one spot in my personal hit list of anime)<br/><br/>The ending is OK, although I think the animation guys totally flipped their lids in the 'mutation scene', but it's fun to watch nevertheless.<br/><br/>If you have never seen anime before this will change your view of what animated movies can do. <br/><br/>9/10"

Due to the fact that I am white through and through, most people in the area where I USED to inhabit thought me strange to like Starblazers! or old episodes of Astro Boy and the Kimba The White Lion over the usual Warner Bros. or Saturday morning variety of cartoons. Anyway, moving on. I saw Akira at a friend's house. This particular friend of mine is originally from Tokyo. He is,as expected,quite a fan of that style of animation. To say the least, I was blown away by Akira the first time I saw it. Let's first start with the ""Gore Factor"". This movie is definitely not the for those who are squeamish when it comes to animated gore and extreme violence. :\ I am not one of those people. So, let me say that,""Yes"" I did like the fact that it was violent. Sometimes,I prefer to satisfy my primal urges rather than be civilized. Don't take me up in the wrong way when I say that,though. Besides the violence,the story was quite nice. I found it to be entertaining, and I was kept glued to my chair whilst I watched. I loved the characters, the concepts and what have you. As for animation, I prefer the later years of Japanese animation. The settings and what have you were done with a perfectionist's detail,yet the ACTUAL animation of the characters matches that of some Disney film (Not much to say,but hey..I liked it nonetheless)<br/><br/>So, overall..what does the Scribbly Scribe give ""Akira"": 9 out of 10.

"quin1974","9","1","3","6 March 2001"," Compelling, One of Otomo's best stories
","Note: when I write this I am already an avid fan for several years of Otomo's work. I just didn't get around to write a review on Akira.<br/><br/>In the past 13 years I have watched Akira numerous times, and I still think this is one of the best Animes out there. But, all these times I have watched it one the small screen, VCR was the only way to see this. Until last night. I was able to see this masterpiece on the big screen at one of my local arthouses, it was a one-time screening, so the theater was packed with fans. Great atmosphere. This movie blew me away as if I had never seen it before. The sheer power of the imagery and the sound effects and the music coming at you through the screen and the speakers was tremendous.<br/><br/>Although, regrettably, the print was the dubbed version, making it a little easier to follow, I still prefer the original subtitled version. Thankfully I have this one on tape. Enough ranting about the screening, on to the movie.<br/><br/>Still incredible. I am also an avid fan of Ghost In The Shell (by Shirow, the other great Japanese artist) and I thought Ghost had surpassed Akira in brilliance. I have to take that back, there are on the same level entirely. Both of them are very, very cool. Akira displays a deep understanding of the human psyche and the balance that we all have to achieve to keep ourselves in line. Tetsuo is not able to do this, he has been bullied all his life and being orphaned at an early age this was not easy on him. He always saw Kaneda as his big brother and looked up to him and worshiped him in a way because Kaneda was able to contain his inner balance. When through some strange encounter with an experiment gone wrong, Tetsuo isn't able to contain his powers anymore and loses himself in the labyrinth of his brain. He gets visions of someone called Akira and has to find this Akira to restore his own self.<br/><br/>This all seems very complex, and it is. This is just the tip of the iceberg that is Akira. There are numerous subplots and motives and themes as only Otomo can write them. Otomo has displayed this before in the terribly complex story Domu and Mother Sarah (great comic stuff, find and read it). The complexity of the story is often what puts people off at the end of this movie. They seem to like the animation, the motorcycle scenes in particular, but the story seems to elude them at the very end. To these people I would like to say: go see it again, and again, and again. Or even better, go see if you can get your hands on the comic book.<br/><br/>As you can see I am not very fond of saying something bad about Akira and Otomo, but still there are some things that bothered me when I viewed this on the big screen. It had never really occurred to me how awful this movie is sometimes cut together. At times the scene you are watching is just picking up the pace and then it is cut off to dissolve to another scene. This was something that could have gotten a little more attention from Otomo. This is all probably because he had to make sacrifices toward the length of the movie and just didn't seem to get the movie right without the remaining cut pieces. Or at least, that is what I hope is the reason.<br/><br/>Well, this is enough from me at this time. I am certainly looking forward to a theatrical re-release of this with a completely enhanced soundtrack and visual quality (please Katsuhiro, make it happen), and the same goes for Ghost, of course.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>PS. my review of Ghost In The Shell is also somewhere here on IMDb."

","First of all, this movie is purely science-fiction. However, one of the tenets of science-fiction is to create devices or elements which could not otherwise exist in reality, and those devices enable the story to show and reveal certain aspects humanity that deserve introspection but aren't easily as accessible under the non-science fiction genre. In fact, this whole movie speaks in metaphors. We see people getting riddled with bullets, getting torn to shreds by this or that, yet later we get a sense that even the police/army have no idea why they are doing what they are doing, and thus lies in the greater tragedy; Everyone in this film has no direction, everyone is living on this neurotic fringe surrounded by the bleak trappings of modern industrial life, and ultimately we see that everyone in this film essentially has no balance, no inner light that guides them, and I think the film wants to explore the journey that one could take to find that balance, that inner light. <br/><br/>This movie has directional problems. The incredible action that surrounds the movie completley destroys our notion that this movie is trying to deal with something profound, something philosophical, something that you sit down with a friend over a cup of coffee for a few hours about. The juxtaposition of intense action to intense personal drama is really not a good idea, sort of like riding a rollercoaster than trying to discuss the nature of love immediately after stumbling off.<br/><br/>The things which make this movie well worth seeing are<br/><br/> + the ""literalization"" of Tetsuo's lack of balance / lack of control of his internal energy (remember, this movie is speaking in metaphors, when things go boom, take some of it with a grain of salt)<br/><br/>+ the friendship between Kaneda and Tetsuo, Kaneda's genuine concern and care about helping Tetsuo regain his balance<br/><br/>+ the incredible animation.<br/><br/>

","I'm really getting sick of this film being tossed off by critics as ""visually impressive, but too confusing"". Or by people who haven't seen referring to it as ""that gory anime sci-fi movie"".  Nobody regards it as what it is: a modern masterpiece.<br/><br/>The first time I saw it, I had never seen anime before. This was a new experience and I loved it. It was dubbed, and it was edited for television, yet I was still awestruck by the entire film. I watched it 2 or 3 more times in this incarnation, but I couldn't understand a thing that went on, and forgot about it. About a year later I saw it subbed, and it was like a whole new movie: there was much more emotional depth, and the translation was better so I immediately understood the whole movie! I can't believe how badly the dubbed version butchers the experience...not as bad as what we did to ""Nausicaa"", but pretty close. In the dubbed version Kaneda sounds like a robot,  and the Colonel is permanently growling. In the subbed version the Colonel emerges as probably my favorite character in the movie: the only voice of reason in a city run by corrupt politicians. The scene in which he is ordered to relinquish command, but instead orders his men to kill the messenger because ""we're all going to die soon anyway"" is very moving. I've now seen the film countless times in its subbed incarnation, and every time I am swept up in it, almost hynotized by the beautiful images before me.<br/><br/>My one and only complaint is the beginning, with the gang war: it's just too...generic. I've lent the film to friends who didn't watch past the first part, because they thought it was too much like ""typical"" anime, and I had to force them to watch the rest (of course they loved it). It just doesn't even hint at the beauty and epic sweep of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The film is also remarkable from a filmmaking perpective, and I don't just mean the animation. The use of dissolves followed by quick cuts are very inventive and effective, as are the various perfect transitions. And best of all the music adds to the film on many different levels. Image and sound play off each other to the point where I couldn't imagine the film without it. The flashback scenes all have an extremely washed-out color palette, where everything is brighter, perfectly evoking a more innocent time. And the film is packed with indelible images. My personal favorite is in the aftermath of Tetsuo's first major attack, when it's at dusk and pieces of the SOL are raining down on earth, Tetsuo's body sihouetted against the sky.<br/><br/>I will love this film forever, and though some people say it's a Blade Runner rip-off, I say Akira is better than Blade Runner in every way possible. Katushiro Otomo is one of the best and most innovative directors in the world, let alone animation directors. And he's not a one-movie fluke either...watch a fansub of Memories and be prepared to be wowed all over again. It may take a while, but one of these days people will wake up to Otomo's genious."

John Williams (of the ""Star Wars"" sound-tracks and ""Saving Private Ryan""), mostly bores, but this composer, I can't come up with his name right now, really kicks ass and adds the best to this movie.

","Although I went through a short faze of watching a lot of anime movies in my early teens, very few of them actually have had a lasting effect on me, with the exception of Akira.  Akira is a twisted cyber-punk thriller that in terms of visuals defies belief, but in plot defies proper explanation.  It's the kind of film in which everyone has a different opinion about the story and of the relationship between Tetsuo and Kanneda and the role that the government play in Tetsuo's downfall.  Most people are put off by animation, believing it will either be all out Disney sentimentality, of sex and gore packed Manga, people refuse to understand that animation can be used to tell stories for an adult sensibility.  Akira has so much story and so many sub-plots all clambering for attention that multiple viewing are required, and it's definitely worth it just to get the most out of the rich characters and consideration to detail that the animators put into every frame.   <br/><br/>
There is a strong emotional pull to the characters in this film, a much deeper side to them, deeper than you would find in traditional live action films, in which the characters not only demonstrate the language and fashion of the world they live in, but also help transmit much needed information as part of exposition within dialog.  It's important to look carefully at what the characters say, and to make a mental note of it, as it all comes back at the end of the film.  The focus of the film, as I pointed out above, id the friendship between Tetsuo and Kanneda, both are the complete opposite side of a connected personality that come into direct conflict at the climax of the film, and each one has qualities that the audience can identify with. For example, Tetsuo being the doormat to Kanneda's fearless leader, knowing that he will never escape from his shadow.  We also have the three mysterious children who try to point Tetsuo in the right direction, their faces withered and old.  These are characters whose function is clear, but whose past I still don't fully understand.    <br/><br/>In the final act the film kicks into another gear, bringing into play ideas of morality and loyalty, and the more political aspects of dehumanisation and military control.  It also depicts the kind of body-horror mutation that would make David Cronenberg proud, as Tetsuo's body begins to mutate into something more resembling his state of mind.  Again throughout the story we are gripped and the way in which the animation is used, I just can praise highly enough.  Ultimately the film says more than we can answer, leaving the audience (well me anyway) scratching our collective heads.  But that's not really a problem, and it wasn't the last time I've been left cold by a film I enjoyed.  Don't be put off by the fact that this is anime, the deep story and characters make Akira a rewarding experience, and a definite landmark in science fiction cinema.  10/10"

But don't let that keep you away from the film as it stands, in my humble opinion, as one of the greatest achievements of filmmaking in history. With an awesome cyberpunk/mutant-filled Neo-Tokyo backdrop. At the center are the inherent social problems and barriers that exist within people and government. This is timeless.<br/><br/>There's a certain obvious truth, which lies in the film. It is the simple fact that we, as human beings, are simply not prepared. This applies to any and every aspect of our lives. The characters in the film are certainly not prepared for the things that happen to them. And this fact shows. Unlike many North American sci-fi flicks, there are no simple answers for AKIRA. It's depressing and at the same time refreshing to have an understanding that we are limited creatures. It's a harsh reality and a simple answer. For Tetsuo, the changes that he goes through tear his very mind, and humanity, apart and it's not just him.<br/><br/>If given the unfortunate chance of suffering his same ""collision"" with destiny it would have the same effect on anyone. And no matter how much we say we would be unaffected it's all just a lie to ourselves. To Tetsuo. When Tetsuo's hallucinations begin the result is only catharsis, and rightfully so. No one would ask to be put into his situation and as the viewer we must watch the madness unfold.<br/><br/>Don't let the fact that it's anime steer you away from this compelling, and albeit twisted tale. The detail put into the imagery and story in the film adds to the unique and realistic feel, which AKIRA possesses. And there certainly wasn't any slacking in the story of the film as we are given an often thorough explanation of the events of the past, which have affected the Neo-Tokyo. Indeed, by the end of the film I felt like I had lived in Japan of the future, that's how drawn in I was. And still am. Whenever I am given the opportunity to watch AKIRA I must put off whatever I am planning to make room for this monster of a film.<br/><br/>If you get a hold of this flick, and it's dubbed, make sure it's the old dub with the truly gravy melodramatic voice acting by the main characters. The new version has some crummy, by comparison, dubbing that is nothing short of inferior to the original.<br/><br/>""TETSSSUUUUOOOOOOOO!!!""<br/><br/>""KANEDAAAAAAA!!!""<br/><br/>What more do you need from a film, people????"
"Keith-35","9","1","3","11 December 2001"," You really need to see the DVD.
","I've seen Akira on TV and video in the UK.  Having seen the (US) DVD it's clear that many clips were removed from the versions I saw.  The DVD version's story is much clearer with these ""missing"" clips and retranslation.<br/><br/>The DVD does omit some scenes that appear on the (UK) VHS version, but I only noticed one missing one.<br/><br/>Akira tells the story of quantitative western science's mishandling of something metaphysical and the disastrous consequences.  The story is set in the future.<br/><br/>The moral? We don't learn from our mistakes.<br/><br/>I believe this was the first movie marketed by Manga in the UK.  An excellent introduction to Anime."
"SlimeyPete","Null","1","3","19 November 2001"," Great animation and not as confusing as many say
","The most striking thing about Akira is the superb animation, which is full of detail and is surprisingly smooth considering that this is an Anime. The sound is also very impressive, being extremely powerful and emotive at times. <br/><br/>I can't understand why people find this film so confusing (WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!). <br/><br/>It's simple: There's this supernatural force called Akira (named after the boy who first possessed it), and it's been discovered by the japanese government. They are running secret tests on individuals to see if they can create a kind of human superweapon. Tetsuo, who is already pretty annoyed at the world, is tested on but the test is too successful, resulting in an extremely bitter young man with the power to destroy whole bridges with his mind. Then he slowly self-destructs until the finale, where his power overtakes him and he goes into oblivion(?). Sure it's fairly complex but it ain't THAT bad!<br/><br/>So, overall, I give Akira 9/10"
"Motoko","Null","1","3","18 January 1999"," Mind blowing
","If Uncle Walt could stop bouncing little children on his knee and refrain from telling them stories about handsome Princes rescuing beautiful Princesses from the clutches of evil fiends he could go out and take in a John Woo, Brian DePalma or Sam Peckinpah film. If he did, he could go out and make one of these. A gloriously stylish, plot-riddled, and spiritual (albeit violent) film.<br/><br/>Yes, I said 'film.' This is not a cartoon and never will be. The term 'animation' could be used but that barely does it true justice. Akira is one of the most marvellously cinematic experiences ever made. Easily the best all-round example Anime ever. And there have been some damn good ones. But because of its animated nature this, and many other great 'films' will never be truly taken seriously. Which is a shame for any fan of cinema.<br/><br/>There has been much criticism levelled at Akira and it is easy to see why. The film attempts to squeeze into two small hours over 20 issues of a full size Japanese comic. The fact that the comic series was never finished when Akira went into production means that it also has a slight incomplete feel to it. Many are easily confused as to what it all means. I have to admit that I'm one of them. But repeated viewings with a firm grasp of where the film is heading helps and the fact remains that it is truly compulsive viewing.<br/><br/>The best way to approach this is to treat it like any other film. The characters may be paint and pen but you still care more about them than the humans in a lot of expensive, flimsy blockbusters (makers of a film involving a certain big, green lizard take note.) There are sub-plots and histories which all give the people some kind of personality. Kutsuhiro, the director, achieves his masterpiece using the same methods as any other director. Pacy editing makes for some disturbing dream sequences. Zooms, pans and slo-mos turn in some dazzling action scenes and the animation is as impressive as any expensive CGI. The one true criticism I lay at it is its graphic scenes of violence. There's more blood and shredded corpses in this film than Verhoeven could get away with. This is not a film for under-fifteens and its brutal nature will shock anybody expecting a Japanese Mickey Mouse.<br/><br/>That apart the result is a marvelous trip into the surreal that screams out to be made into a 'real' film. If a studio did decide to take the plunge then the end result would be a thing of incredible beauty. But its unlikely to happen. CGI will never be good enough to pull off the nightmares and the cost to make this would make Titanic's budget look like chump change. Add to that the incredible cult fan base this film has, and the fact that a live-action version is sure to be booed by most of them, and it would be a brave company that would try to adapt it. And bravery isn't something the Hollywood system is known for is it."
"kameleontti","7","1","3","31 August 2001"," Good movie, bad ending
","In a way I liked this, but I was shocked at the end: It's different than in the comic version and my opinion is they ruined it. (Hard to tell you what I'm thinking without turning this into a spoiler.) Too much playing with violence, it's entertaining for a while but not when it hides the plot (if there is one underneath... - OK, there is!). The first half is wonderful and the way the music is used, rules. But due to ending I only rate this 7/10. If only they had used the ending from the comics, I would have given this 9, but what are you going to do about it?"
"mezzb","Null","1","3","21 August 2001"," Should have been tightened up at the end
","A great film that could have been among the best films ever made, Akira is hampered by it's drawn-out conclusion.  Both beautiful to look at and listen to (referring to the new sound dub on the Pioneer DVD), Akira also engages the mind and emotions.  Then its climax goes on for about 17 minutes, boring and confusing the audience.  For an hour and a half, I was spellbound, but the draggy climax turned me off.  And the very very end is one big ""HUH??!!"".  But maybe I'm just too stupid to get it.<br/><br/>Some points: The Pioneer DVD doesn't appear to be a new cut.  The American voice actors on the new dub are good but not great.  The sound however is phenomenal. And music is far better than the usual edgy-cartoon-heavy-metal associated with the genre.  Also someone commented that you need to watch the subtitled version in order to see the movie as the makers intended. Hogwash I say!  The makers of the film intended for you to watch the film, not read it.  The Japanese version is dubbed too ya know (since cartoons can't talk yet).  I have no problem watching cartoons dubbed.  And this is a strong dub.  I flipped to the Japanese soundtrack and subtitles and found myself reading the confusing dialogue and missing out on the spectacle. it's a matter of preference.  Some folks are purists I suppose.<br/><br/>Last point, the book is always better than the movie, except for ""Jaws"".  It goes without saying that a book/manga can go into more plot detail and character development than a 2 hour film.  That said, I found lots of places they should have actually reduced the plot of the 2000 page manga even further, to be more appropriate to a 2 hour film.  Such as: ""TIGHTEN UP THE ENDING!""<br/><br/>I'm done - thanks (8/10 - the first 3/4 is that incredible)"
"Angry_Arguer","Null","2","11","4 October 2003"," Animation Manipulation
","Akira wants to be smart, but, in truth, you'll find more detail and sophistication just by watching the first season to Transformers than here.<br/><br/>The animation isn't that good...now I've said it, here comes the lynch mob. Most of it has dated with obvious clunky movements compared to The Rescuers Down Under (arguably the best traditionally animated film of the 90s) or even Bambi.  Come to think of it, anime is only a collaboration between Disney levels of detail with stories ranging from Heavy Metal to Ralph Bakshi in inspiration.  Of course, the goal of animation is to present the impossible by creating a universe in the mind of the artist and translating that on celluloid.<br/><br/>For that matter, Akira is very stagnant in the visual department.  Animation has an edge in that it can explore absolutely unknown territory, but few films have actually done that.  None of Walt Disney's original work did much searching as they were focused solely on fixed artistry and construction. Only recently have animators started going around the environment to see what their world looks like.  Heavy Metal marginally did this, but I'd say Roger Rabbit helped push that idea forward.<br/><br/>As an action movie, Akira pales next to The Killer and Die Hard because those two are a dominant benchmark for the genre.  Adrenaline requires good heroes, menacing yet credible villains and technological comprehension of some kind.  In Akira it is about faceless nobodys with toys that resemble beefed-up props from Terminator.<br/><br/>As science fiction, Blade Runner and 2001 are more sophisticated and fluid. The dialog here, both subtitled and dubbed, is totally cornball and separated from the actual plot.  Instead of advancing the story, it divides and often contradicts our focus.  Not only is the heavy-handed message lost in the violence, but it becomes an enormous hypocrisy.  If films like this were more concerned about telling a story than blowing stuff up (or just blew stuff up and didn't try to make us think with cheap tricks) then they wouldn't be as shallow in subtexts.  Others like that include Face/Off and The Rock.<br/><br/>Overall, if this is the best anime has to offer--doesn't look like that now with Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke getting more and more acclaim--then I'm not impressed.  Foreign film's many different tones and methods aren't too dissimilar from their American counterparts because an equal percentage of them just don't work.  2.5 out of 5 stars."

"MaximumMadness","9","1","4","19 November 2017"," ""Akira""- Oft-considered a masterpiece of animation and storytelling, Katsuhiro Otomo's sci-fi classic continues to thrill and enthrall thirty years later.
","Not only a definitive cult hit, but also one of the earliest films to bring mainstream popularity to Japanese anime in Western markets, writer/director Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Akira"" is a classic by any stretch of the imagination. Quickly approaching the thirtieth anniversary of its original release while still maintaining a strong degree of freshness and a unique flair, the film has aged remarkably well and manages to hit home with the same great gusto it did all those years ago. ""Akira"" is a film I've almost been afraid to discuss, with it's influence and following still felt in the world of entertainment. But upon revisiting it once again just recently after having actively decided to take a break from it for several years... I'm just shocked by much in continues to surprise and captivate.<br/><br/>The film is set in a alternative history, in which Japan was nearly destroyed following a third World War. In the future of 2019, the streets are filled with protests and violence as gangs and corrupt cops rule the night, while corporate and government big-wigs run the world from their skyscrapers during the day. The film follows a group of hoodlum gang-members, including Kaneda and Tetsuo- childhood best friends whom are always at odds despite their past together. When an accident appears to awaken latent psychic abilities within Tetsuo, a web of treachery and deceit begins to unfold, forcing Kaneda to team-up with a group of anti-government activists to try and save him... Little does he know, however, that it might be too late... as Tetsuo is overcome by his newfound powers and decides to strike back at the world he feels has betrayed him. All the while, Tetsuo begins a search for a mysterious figure known as ""Akira"", whom he is haunted by recurring visions of...<br/><br/>The really fascinating thing about ""Akira"" is how it manages to tell a rather heady and multi-layered story in a fairly accessible way- by wrapping it all up in a classic, almost borderline cliché, action- thriller based around warring street gangs. While my first few viewings of the film as a young teen did leave many questions unanswered, revisiting the film as a mature adult... it's actually all there, and the information is quite cleverly doled out. The film deals with some really complex ideas and touches on some fascinating themes including existentialism and religious fanaticism, but it's always in a subtle and artful way that doesn't spoon-feed the audience nor withhold too much. It's a smart film that in turn allows the audience to feel smart by giving them the pieces, and allowing them to put it all together on their own- something many mainstream sci-fi stories in recent memory struggle with.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is a powerhouse. Stunning in detail and fluid in motion... it's awe-inspiring to behold, and remains one of the most aesthetically compelling hand-drawn works in recent memory. ""Akira"" is filled to burst with minute details that flesh-out the story and build-up the world while also having a vast and staggering scope like few others of its time. Character design is also keen and concise, with each member of the cast being given a simplistic look that tells you exactly what you need to know before they even speak a word of dialog. Otomo's works have always been spellbinding in terms of look- just check out the incredible ""Steamboy"" for further examples. But ""Akira"" might just be his finest in terms of direction and design.<br/><br/>Within the situational writing and structure, however, is where the film's few flaws begin to gradually emerge. Now don't get me wrong- the plot of the film is quite fascinating and the characters are enjoyable and entertaining. And on the whole, yes, the film is very well put-together. I think the fundamental issue is that a lot of the subtext, a lot of the story, and indeed a lot of the character development had to be lost for the sake of run-time. It feels like a shortened digest of a much grander tale. Which is basically exactly what ""Akira"" is. My most recent viewing of the film did leave me feeling a bit of a tonal whiplash from scene to scene, as the movie rockets past pivotal plot-points and set-pieces with an urgent rush that can sometimes feel haphazard. But even then, what's there is keenly thought out and well assembled. It just could have used a bit more time to play out.<br/><br/>""Akira"" is an outstanding film. There's no doubt about that. And just as it has captivated audiences for near three decades now, it will continue to do so for years to come. While it might not quite be a perfect film due to some minor issues with the pace and structure, the phenomenal art, good use of subtle storytelling and enjoyable cast of characters make it a journey well worth taking and worth revisiting again and again. And so, I give ""Akira"" a near-flawless 9 out of 10. It's a classic... just not a ""perfect"" classic."
"nacho_serenade","9","1","4","17 December 2016"," How to Akira a story
","How could we describe some of our biggest fears? Certainly, there are many troubles in society that make us think twice before saying that we live in a beautiful world. Well, to those who still have some doubts, Akira is a film that you should watch. <br/><br/>And I don't exaggerate when I say that this film is marvelous. As many others have done before and after, this film shows animation in its best context and does not try to be gentle with us. <br/><br/>Akira talks about a lot of things at the same time. Many movies who try to tell a story this way usually fall and aren't able to be a good cinematographic product. It is not the case with this movie in particular. <br/><br/>We have a lot of troubles in society who are perfectly and harshly, even viciously. shown in this movie. The way we learn this story is quite striking, and the visual and direct metaphors that are used are meant clearly to shock the spectator. We have a lot of blood, a lot of people dying, and we don't think at any point that it is ""gross"" and that there isn't a good reason for it to be. <br/><br/>The espers are probably one of the strongest points in this movie. They are these kids with scary and disturbing faces who seem to hide some kind of power that is being exploited by the army and scientists. From talking about poverty, and the worst side of society, the movie moves to a point much more symbolical and strong not only because of its impeccable visualization, but also because of how, I repeat the word, ""striking"" are the characters. <br/><br/>The feeling of losing some of this new comrades that the film introduces us is present at any point in the film. We clearly see a development about Kaneda or Tetsuo, two of our main characters, and how the things that they are seeing and facing change them, specially Tetsuo. <br/><br/>By using shocking methods, the films tells its story and divides himself in three acts: we have the introduction and the idea of what will happen, we have the progress and then we have the final act, which concludes in not only an epic way, but also dramatic and certainly unexpected. <br/><br/>I can perfectly state that this film is as good as many made by Studio Ghibli. The strong message behind it, and its way to tell us what he wants to tell us by simply being natural (as sadistic, as graphic and as fluent as it wants to be) and sincere, is probably what is most important in ""Akira"". <br/><br/>How many times have you seen a story talking about gangs and the creation of the universe, or the Big Bang Theory, at the same time? Well, my dear friends, Akira does it. And what an ending, please!"

","This is the best Anime film ever made. Period. Full stop. End note.<br/><br/>This movie is not a computer generated animation film. Each frame is lovely hand drawn by pure animation genius. There is something inexplicably beautiful about that compared to the computer generated animation work we see now which is too clean, perfect and lacks the charm of human subjectivity. We must never forget that objectivity leaches subjectivity of its beauty. If you have never seen this, you literally cannot call yourself a fan of anime.<br/><br/>This movie largely follows the adventures of a small band of bikers who stumble upon a government conspiracy to control children that possess enormously powerful psychic ability. These children are know as the Psychic Children or as The Espers. The location of the movie is a hyper real advanced Tokyo, in the aftermath of a huge explosion of psi-kenetic energy that destroyed the original Tokyo. The government program was terminated for 31 years and the Espers present were kept in isolation to keep any information from being leaked. They wield a variety of psychic powers that are weak compared to those of Akira and Tetsuo, but are still strong enough to overcome a normal human being when combined. Although the Espers are children, their bodies take on a wizened appearance; the reason is because of years of being experimented on and taking special drugs designed to inhibit their psychic and thus physical growth. I'm going to stop right here. I'm depriving you of the wonderful story that is Akira. Watch it now!"

Also, this is a well-paced story with a solid conclusion. The biggest strength of this movie is that the characters are discovering things just as the audience is. Therefore, there is a much greater investment in how things will end up for them.

"Priest6","10","1","4","2 September 2016"," A Love Letter to Meticulous Art and Cyber-Dystopia
","Akira, an animated film from 1988 directed by Katsuhiro Otomo and written by Otomo and Izo Hashimoto. The film is based on Otomo's manga, focusing on the first half of the story with the latter pruned due to time constraints. <br/><br/>As it stands, Akira is the only movie I've seen, animated or otherwise, that I have confidently rated a perfect 10/10. The reason becomes clear upon viewing this film, so if you haven't do so yet I strongly urge you to do so. Three specific areas contributed to this rating. Story, Sound Design, Acting/Animation. A quick look on what the movie is about please look above. I'd love to write an essay on this movie, but 1000 words is my limit so I will try to fit everything in that constraint. This is less of a review, and more of a love letter.<br/><br/>Story and Structure<br/><br/>Akira focuses on a branching story line with it's major protagonists/antagonists being teenage biker Tetsuo Shima, the leader of his biker gang Shotaro Kaneda, and the multiple characters they meet throughout the movie. There are three major arcs that occur in this film. The exposition arc, which introduces us to Tetsuo and Kaneda as well as their brother-like relation ship. Tetsuo is the smallest of the gang, often looked down upon by the rest. Kaneda, as the leader holds much more bravado to the point where he seems almost unstoppable.<br/><br/>The second arc starts around the time Tetsuo encounters the psychic child and is promptly taken away be the secretive group that fosters the child and his two psychic counter-parts. It is at this time we start hearing about Akira, through visions and heavily clouded conversations. The transition between the first and second arc is just about seamless. No jarring transition or cuts, it is hinted by a change in atmosphere and a period of calm from the previous chaos and violence that the film gave us in the beginning. Through the duration of this arc we begin to see how the mysterious psychic prowess begins to manifest within Tetsuo, while we also follow Kaneda while he searches high and low through Neo-Tokyo for his beloved friend.<br/><br/>The final arc starts around the time Tetsuo makes his stand in the baby room, begins the realize the extent of his awakened psychic powers and begins his search for the fabled Akira. In this scene we are shown the tension that exists between Tetsuo and Kaneda ten-fold. Both characters had gone through their proverbial and sometimes literal hell to get to this point, the emotion in the scenery jars the viewer to accentuate this point. This is the beginning of the end.<br/><br/>I applaud Akira for it's well thought-out story line. There isn't a single wasted moment to be found in even the smallest of frames. Every second is used to it's full extent to give us background on characters, setting, time-period, and the struggles existent in the film. By the end of the film, all questions that needed answering were answered, those that needn't an answer were left ambiguous, but we were left with proper material to formulate our own. From what I've searched, there is no background lore to the Akira world, what we see is what get and we are forced to build the world as we along, which makes the discovery of new elements all the more rewarding. 9/10<br/><br/>Sound<br/><br/>Intense, foreboding, hopeful, but ultimately anguishing. The OST for this film is a movie in itself, a cinema of sound that adds five layers of depth to the animation it accompanied. Composed by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, the soundtrack is comprised of 10 tracks, some played multiple times throughout the film, in scenes where it mattered. A simple google search of ""Akira Soundtrack"" will locate the entire OST for you to listen and enjoy.<br/><br/>Let's go further beyond the music, to the actual sound design of the film. Both effects and voice acting were superb. I watched the sub version, as it should be viewed, and the voice actors did an amazing job bringing their animated characters to life. By the end of the film I connected with Tetsuo especially when he realized his error and begged for Kaneda to save him. I almost cried out in pain as Tetsuo became overran by a power he was not prepared to control.<br/><br/>The sounds of Neo-Tokyo took the movie over the top. From the soothing hum of engines and speed-bikes, to the hectic gunfire and manic shouts of revolution, whenever there was no dialogue, the movie was far from empty. If there were a version of Akira with no dialogue, only sound, I would gladly watch it. 10/10<br/><br/>Animation<br/><br/>Akira is a product of its time, there's no denying that. Though the great thing about art is the aspect of timelessness. The animation of Akira not only outdid itself in 1988 but it outdoes itself in 2016. Vibrancy, color, depth, and crisp animation in bounds. Huge hand-drawn scenery with detail included in even the darkest corners of the alleyways of Neo-Tokyo. If i had to sum the artwork provided in Akira in a single word it would be, Genius. More or less the movie is a direct animation from the Manga, so I've heard. I've never read the Manga, but obviously Katsuhiro Otomo is as much of an artist as Van Gogh.<br/><br/>The scenes of violence in resistance ridden Neo-Tokyo were so vivid and in your face, animated perfectly to give a visceral scene. And it all happens so fast it can at times get tiring, but still the movie demands your attention, and you have no choice but to comply. 9/10<br/><br/>Akira is a tragic love story. A story about the pursuit of power and the anguish that comes with it. A story about being lost, and the hope of being found once more."
"bscrivener-50810","10","1","4","21 May 2016"," Mind-blowing, jaw-dropping, adrenaline-pumping and powerful- A landmark film in animation
","Considered a landmark in Japanese animation and seen as the film that launched anime in the US and later worldwide. Akira is without a doubt one of the greatest animation films ever made. Known for it's extreme, brutal violence and intense action, Akira is set in the aftermath of World War III in which a psychic explosion destroys Tokyo, (All shown in a brief, but memorable opening scene). Years later, Neo-Tokyo, a dystopian metropolis gripped by terrorism and gang violence rises from the ruins of old Japan, among these ruins lies the buried secret of Akira, a mysterious and unimaginable power. We are then introduced to the characters of Kaneda and Tetsuo, who while fighting a rival gang get caught up in a military experiment. Due to it's release in 1988, the animation was produced using the older, darker and grittier style of Japanese anime which works well for the tone and atmosphere of Neo-Tokyo. The soundtrack also fits the mood perfectly with a mix of ancient and contemporary music, also notably at times very sombre and depressing, again working well with it's visuals. However, what makes Akira stand out the most is its complex story-telling, mind- blowing imagery and artistically created and iconic blend of cel and computer animation. The only single minuscule flaw with Akira is that watching from a 2016 point-of-view where animation has evolved massively since '88, the film can look slightly dated. However, this did not in the slightest deter me from this masterpiece of a film and with a highly emotional and powerful final act, Akira ranks as one of my favourite movies ever. Mind-blowing, jaw-dropping, and features some of the most adrenaline-pumping scenes in history. Every scene feels relevant, interesting and keeps driving the plot, the characters are well-developed, relatable, hence as an audience we connect well with them, their motivations and their actions, therefore Akira rightfully earns it's place in film history as one of Japan's animation masterpieces and 100% fully deserves a 10/10."
"Angels_Review","8","1","4","15 May 2016"," A rather interesting anime movie classic
","So I finally got a chance to sit down and watch it, namely the English dub. What do I think about it? It was pretty good for an anime that came out in the 1980's and it holds up pretty well to this day. I was very surprised that the show was actually directed by the writer of Akira as well. Not many people can write a manga and get to direct it as well when it comes to movie. This means that the show would have come out how he wanted to and not changed around as it went from hand to hand. Just how close is this to the manga? Well as of now, I have not read the manga so I can't answer that. <br/><br/>Some things do bother me with the story and mostly with the characters though it is more based on my preference of character then anything else. I just think that the biker gangs felt a bit forced. I never been in one, never even been near a gang like that before so I can't say for sure but I think they wouldn't be so open with what they were doing for so long without already being caught by the cops. I may just be analyzing it a bit too much but it just got on my nerves. That also goes for Kaneda always trying to get into Kei's pants.<br/><br/>The main story had a very deep underlining meaning both in psychology and in humanity itself. It's hard not to spoil anything about this when most of it happens at the end but I do have to talk about this. There is a back and forth aspect that seems to happen of what science could learn but at what price. It's there when they mess with Tetsuo's brain and the results that happen after. Let me tell you, the results were not pretty. We are always striving for learning more about ourselves and to push ourselves to the max but at what price do we pay for such an idea? Are we even willing to push us to a point that we ourselves are not considered human anymore? And what would happen if such a power was placed in the hands of someone who didn't fully understand how to use it? Something that Kiyoko says in the show rings pretty true no matter what you're talking about. I went something like 'when you are given this much power, you must chose how you use it.' Sort of similar to Spiderman's Uncle telling him 'with great power comes great responsibility' but the idea is still the same. <br/><br/>The animation was rather gory and bloody for the most part with a lot of dark depressing textures. The place they lived really did look like a back ally pig sty but I believe that was what they were going for. For the time this came out, the artwork is rather good and I was surprised by just how much detail they put into the background as well as some of the movements. They even placed the streaks from the tail lights of the bikes in. I don't think I have seen that much detail put into a show that was hand drawn except for Studio Ghibi's movies. While the design of the characters were pretty realistic as far as anime can go without not looking like anime, they were still rather simple and it is understandable when people have to draw them time and time again. Once in a while, the lighting and shading didn't work all that well and I don't remember much shading on the 'children' except for the wrinkles. <br/><br/>The voice acting was surprisingly well done for the time it was dubbed. I can understand why this movie was what got anime going in America because the voice acting was what I would of imagined the characters to sound like. Because of the somewhat realistic artwork and the constant yelling that characters did, the lip sink suffered slightly. I can only say slightly because what they did do; they did a damn good job in doing it. One person who stood out really well was Kiyoko's voice actor (The female little child) Melora Harte. For those of you wondering, I did watch the 1988 release of the dubbing and not the new 2001 version; at least I believe it to be. <br/><br/>I can truly understand why this is called a cult classic, being as a symbol of 'greatness' in the anime world. As the years have not been all that kind to it, it may not hold that title for animation and voice acting but its story is still something that should be kept in the minds of those who watch it. If you haven't watched it, you are missing out even if you don't like this stuff."
"Stylo123","10","1","4","17 March 2016"," Akira is an awesome, great, brilliant masterpiece in science fiction, anime, manga, animated films, the 1980s and movies in general.
","I love Akira. Love it, love it, love it. Plus, I'm not really an anime person. Sure, I appreciate it and enjoy a good few of them. But no Dragonballs or Pokemons for me please, thank you very much. That said, I love Akira as a film, not an anime and it is a damn good film.<br/><br/>The plot is extremely engaging, taking many unexpected twists and turns. Teenagers, generally, are massive douchebags. I should know, I'm one of them. However, douchebaggery takes a new name in that of Tetsuo, who is a huge dingus. He doesn't really like Kaneda, who might be a sex offender but let's just roll with it, but Kaneda sure likes him, or tolerates him, anyway. There are awesome futuristic motorbikes, telekinesis dudes, bombs, meaty things and cooooool leather jackets. However, the story does progress a bit too fast, and would benefit from maybe a bit more character development and perhaps 20 more minutes, just to cover some of the events that were missed in the manga.<br/><br/>Tetsuo is masterfully designed as an unlikable a-hole who no-one likes, except for Kaneda. He's whiny and angsty and ""my parents just don't understand""-y, I'm glad he crashes his motorbike, it wasn't as cool as Kaneda's anyway. Kaneda, who somehow puts up with him, is also a bit of an a-hole, but in a lovable Rocket Raccoon way, he has an awesome motorbike (have I established how awesome the motorbikes are in this film? No? Good, I can say it more times) and legendary, if not questionable, fashion choices. However, it ain't just spiky hair and sticking' it to the man, there are also shady government telepaths and 'orrible army dudes, a plot Kaneda is dragged into by constantly harassing Kei, a rebel if I ever saw one, who looks eerily like she could be his older sister. Kaneda, buddy, something you wanna talk about?<br/><br/>Minus the sexual harassment undertones, this is a stunning film. The animation is so beautiful and seamless, merging hand-drawn animation with slight but noticeable computer effects. Despite the Neo-Tokyo setting, the animation feels very rustic yet extremely smooth. The colour palette is bold and striking, with the bombastic reds and flashing greens and blues near the finale. Overall, it looks very nice.<br/><br/>Sound-wise, this film is odd. Odd but good. Yes, during the awesome motorbike chasey scenes (with very awesome motorbikes, might I add), the sound is explosive and ear-destroying, and it isn't lacking in the """"Hey!-Look!-Some-eardrums!-Let's- punch-them-right-in-their-eardrum-faces!"""" department and I love it, what can I say? However, there are some periods of complete silence, silence in places where my eardrums should be getting punched. I'm talking about silence during explosions and screaming and that sort. Usually, this would be a clunky terrible thing to do for such an explosive film, yet it works. It really works. When watching this film recently with my ""what points can I chop up and throw into a slapdash 800 word review"" filter on, I came up with two outstanding points: the surreal imagery (which I won't mention, oh wait.) and the lack of sound. During my viewing, I was conflicted upon whether or not this was a good or bad thing. Upon reflection, it is a pretty good thing, it disorientates the viewer, adding to the tension of whatever silent moment is happening.<br/><br/>Overall, Akira is an awesome, great, brilliant masterpiece in science fiction, anime, manga, animated films, the 1980s and movies in general. It is definitely in my top 20 films of all time. That may seem like a stretch but I love a lot of films so that is one hell of a statement."

","Hadn't watched Akira for years and years. Managed to catch a ""clean"" version - very well restored, hi def and all the works and honestly it hasn't aged at all. On the contrary, with the exception of one scene where a girl talks a public phone, the whole thing has aged gracefully and is still as relevant as it was in the late 1980's: the animation is flawless, the designs as cool and modern as ever and the action flat out awesome. The story is still what one could have qualms about - the debate is the same as 25 years ago. It does have slow & confusing moments but overall it's well worth a watch. Now I'll go ahead and reread everything! Katsushiro Otomo : I wish you were doing more!"
"Tweekums","9","1","4","9 September 2015"," An anime classic
","In the year 1988 the city of Tokyo was destroyed in the Third World War; now, thirty one years later the city of Neo-Tokyo has been built. Here a gang of teenage bikers led by Kaneda cause mayhem fighting with other such gangs. One day as they are fighting a rival gang Kaneda's friend Tetsuo runs into a strange child and is taken into military custody. He soon starts having strange nightmares then develops telekinetic powers. Meanwhile Kaneda is arrested but soon freed from custody along with Kei, a girl who had been involved in an anti-government protest. Kaneda is determined to help his friend but as Tetsuo's powers increase he doesn't want help and becomes drawn to somebody called Akira who apparently has powers that are even greater than his.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that all anime fans should watch at least once; away from the works of Studio Ghibli this is probably the classic anime movie it is also probably one of the main reasons some people think of anime as 'weird Japanese cartoons' it starts normally enough for a post-apocalyptic story as we are introduced to Kaneda and his gang and see them fighting their rivals but once Tetsuo starts to be affected by his encounter with strange child things get weird fast; he has nightmares featuring giant, creepy stuffed animal toys and gets more and more bizarre as things progress. That doesn't mean it is too hard to follow though. As well as the aforementioned weirdness there are plenty of great action scenes as the rival gangs fight and as Kaneda and Kei attempt to enter the facility where Tetsuo is located. The animation and background designs look great as do the designs of the various futuristic machines. Overall this is a must see for anime fans which I suspect will be improved by repeat viewings.<br/><br/>These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles."
"hudsonmichelle","8","1","4","7 August 2015"," kind of movie you need to watch several times.
","This is kind of movie you need to watch several times. It's a good movie but it's really confusing, the direction in this movie was my biggest gripe but I could don't really understand the end. However, the animation is excellent and strong. It is Japanese animated work (It's the first anime to get 5 stars in North America) and good enough to give a good mark. The story is a highly stereotypical anime but it has got some decent artwork and an underdeveloped plot line. The ending is Okay, tho I think the animation guys totally flipped their lids but it's fun to watch anyway. This film most definitely is not for everyone. highly recommended."
"cinemamaster","10","1","4","5 August 2015"," One of the best animated movies ever!
","Calling Akira a great movie would be and understatement. It is a technical marvel that still holds up even after nearly 30 years of a half baked medium. Animation has gone downhill in some aspects. Gone are the techniques of traditional animation, now replaced by cheap and unimpressive flash animation. Kids shows are now a pointless mush mash of random dance parties, butt shaking and gross out humor (Nickelodeon in a nutshell). It's all backwash and pig vomit...and kids are eating it up...for the most part. You see, kids aren't that stupid as we initially thought. Their comes a time in their age where they realize that animation before the New Millennium was actually pretty amazing. I myself came to that age and stumbled across Akira. Brief synopsis: Akira follows two members of a biker gang: Tetsuo and Kaneda. Both have distinctive personalities. Kaneda is the cocky and enthusiastic gang leader, while Tetsuo is a bit of an underdog that is trying to prove his worth to his fellow bikers. When Tetsuo is caught in a serious accident, he is sent to a government hospital without his friends knowledge. Without spoiling much lets just say that Tetsuo gains immense psychic power and wreaks havoc on Neo Tokyo. Please be sure to watch this marvel of a movie. I give it a perfect score."
"boekoeboe","8","1","4","16 October 2014"," A godsend from 80s!
","For a long time it was just mesmerized by 'real' films, last week i saw the animation movie Akira and I am blown away. This film was made in 1988, the year I was born! The first computers existed just a couple of years, there were no cell phones, and there was not even the Internet.<br/><br/>Still, the team behind Akira succeeded to put down one hell of a movie. The cinematography, the colors, the technique and the depth of the images is really well done. It's always interesting how a director has suggested the future. Akira takes place in Neo Tokyo 2019. Katsuhiro Ôtomo has chosen to combine his image of the future with his current time. This delivered an incredibly nice tension between the technical inventions that you come across in the film.<br/><br/>Akira is a godsend from 80s. Enjoy!"
"paulsrobinson","9","1","4","21 May 2013"," the quintessential anime
","From what i understand Akira is the Citizen Kane of Anime films. influencing Anime since it was made even now, and also influencing live action cinema for example the Matrix trilogy and Chronicle. The film lives up to this reputation, and continues to influence now 25 years on.<br/><br/>The complicated for some story concerns a futuristic Tokyo biker gang whose lives are impacted on after an accidental collision with a child who is a part of a secret government run project dealing with telekinetic powers in children. Exploring ideas about mans need for power, rebelliousness of youth, and friendship. It does at times make it difficult for these to fully emerge with the frenetic pace of the movie. But the animation and visuals are dazzling and amazing which have aged really well, resulting in a vivid, dark, and very compelling view of a Future Tokyo.<br/><br/>In the end anyone that has any sort of interest in Anime, Sci-fi or to be honest film in general. Needs to see this movie as it deserves to be named in same breath as other influential films such as Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, 2001, et al."
"osakar","10","1","4","28 June 2012"," Astounding and complete.
","I recently watched Akira again, unsure if it would hold up after so many viewings. It did.<br/><br/>The animation and music is fantastic. Tetsuo's ""nightmare scene"" in his cell is a masterpiece on its own. The way it builds its music from tiny noises to a full-blown surrealistic symphony couldn't have been better.<br/><br/>Akira successfully realizes more than an adventure, more than a story, more than just a movie - a vision. The world it creates is fleshed out and complex. Still, with all the politics going on in Neo-Tokyo, the film never loses focus from the heart of it all - the friendship between Kaneda and Tetsuo. The side characters are all memorable to some degree - the Colonel is one of my favourite characters of any movie. However, characters and character development is not the main focus of the film, the story is what's important. And it's a great story.<br/><br/>I have to mention the animation again because it is just incredible. If not as flawless and glossy as that in modern anime, the style of the city and the characters still make it the downright coolest animation I've seen. The film is, if nothing else, a visual (and aural) masterpiece. On top of this, it's just so damn entertaining. Well worth seeing several times, which isn't something you can say about any movie.<br/><br/>I love the iconic imagery, the well-needed humour provided by Kaneda's likable biker gang, and most of all, the gloriously apocalyptic conclusion. Akira is an essential film, one of a kind, and the very idea of a remake is laughable. A must-see."
"hammy012","9","1","4","2 June 2012"," A pure mindf**k from start to finish
","My uncle, who studied in Japan during the 1980s, introduced me to this film two years ago, when I was 13. Initially, I was reluctant to watch it due to the poster... what, a capsule? I stereotypically thought of it as just another bizarre 1980s cyberpunk film with giant robots and Matrix styled sh*t... all that my uncle was interested in... given that I had a shallow understanding of what the culture was all about.<br/><br/>How wrong I was.<br/><br/>The opening was the most epic of any film I've seen so far (besides Oldboy and City of God). It set the mood for the entire film perfectly. I was in awe... growing up alongside Disney animated movies, what other ""cartoon"" opens with a gigantic nuclear explosion? It was utterly brilliant from that point on - a hypnotic trip through the underbelly of a society on the verge of collapsing. Being politically conscious and having lived through observing numerous cases of widespread corruption and oppression in my country, as well as being a bullied, angry teen with discipline issues. I immediately resonated with what Otomo was trying to express. The animation was unlike anything I've ever seen... the music was great and unique... and you get my point.<br/><br/>However, what startled me the most was the movie's message. Being 13 when I watched it, it wasn't really clear to me... the first few minutes were instances of mindless action and rioting... it was crazy and to a point, near extremist to me. Yet, the film never loses its way of providing unpredictable surprises, especially during the end. The film left me speechless, shocked and awed by the sheer brutality of it.<br/><br/>What was the film trying to tell? Beyond the madness, I thought that maybe humans could never be given the power of God... see what Tetsuo became during the end... he was overwhelmed... I'd leave that disturbing scene to your imagination as not to spoil it for you people. I could see parts of me here and there in Tetsuo... and I thought maybe that was what I would do if I was given powers like these. This film is, according to me, both a haunting criticism of human nature, and a beautifully animated masterpiece; a milestone in animation.<br/><br/>Watch it - just be prepared for what it'll throw at you."

Granted, with the dubbing there was a lot that did not make sense ( to the point where seeing the sub was a different movie ) but this lacks nothing. The characters are developed ( not as much as the Manga by far but this can be forgiven ) and you can really come to understand just how confused the characters are given the circumstances.<br/><br/>The two main characters end up facing each other even though they were inseperatable friends but it makes sense. While some things are just beyond understanding without the manga you can really feel that there is something epic going on.<br/><br/>With the 15 of 10 score and great English and Japanese performances, this is a MUST see for any anime fan, modern or old.

","This movie is just great, it shows all the horror of corruption after such a terrifying event. With its combination of visual effects and great storytelling, the movie seems to make more sense as an animation. (I'm not looking forward to a live-action remake)There's one thing in this movie that makes it just perfect, it's the music you constantly hear in it. The scene where you see Kaneda and his gang ready to fight the clowns, the music you hear just gets me into the mood, that there will be some action about to happen. The scene were Tesuo is in the hospital and is attacked by the 3 other psychic children just makes it sound so creepy, perfect for the situation. The movie fits all the things to make the perfect movie, but the only default is the mouthing, I know it never matches the mouth with the words in the first place, but it was still odd with the dubbing. All in all, I love this movie!"

I am a huge fan of Anime but always thought Akira was too mainstream for me and i wouldn't like it. Well i was wrong big style! This movie is masterclass, much more greater than any Anime i have ever seen before. For a film made in 1988 it still outshines some of todays drawings. Such amazing colour, texture, characters and imagination for something made that long ago.

","Yes, my name is Akira. Yes I am Japanese (American). With that out of the way, I have to confess my allegiance to this movie. The world is strange, post apocalyptic in that Japanese style which was embedded into our communal psyche after being A-Bombed.<br/><br/>If you are just getting into anime, this is the starting point. The animation itself might seem dated to a newbie, but given the context it must be regarded as one of the most influential animes of all time, skyrocketing the anima scene into the mainstream.<br/><br/>I will spare you the details of plot. The plot however isn't the standard Western follow a character's development to the end. It morphs, it changes, whom we follow changes, and gets far out and completely psychedelic towards the end. This could be viewed as a negative of course, since cramming all the six volumes of the original manga into a two hour movie leaves lots of room for disconnect. And in fact, if I were to give an honest criticism, I find that the movie remains a bit detached because of this approach.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I would be a fool to not recommend Akira, especially to a person inclined towards the East for getting a dose of entertainment."
"daryl42-1","9","1","4","13 May 2010"," Akira is a very beautiful flower, despite the thorny stem.
","9.4<br/><br/>Why do we like films? Why do we like moving pictures? Is it just a form of storytelling? It surely is. In fact, it's a very good form of storytelling. But is there more to film? Are more traditional forms of art, such as drawings, paintings and sculptures storytelling? Is music more than storytelling? What about books?<br/><br/>I believe that there is more to film than storytelling. Saying that film is about storytelling is like saying that music is about the lyrics. There is a lot of fine music out there that has poor, or even no lyrics. In fact, one might argue that opera is more than storytelling. That doesn't sound far-fetched, right? The question is, does film relate to books more than it does to music and paintings?<br/><br/>It may be difficult to make a film without a story. It would probably end up being described as, ""abstract"". This might be because it is hard for the audience to find rapport with the film. I find it limiting to the art of film for people to see storytelling as a crutch, or necessary foundation. However, it is easy to see that storytelling is commonly seen that way in film. Whereas music is divided into genres of tone and style, film is divided into genres of content and narrative. There is an aspect to film that is what makes it the medium, platform or canvas for artistic expression that it is. It is on this ground that I personally try plant my expectations and critiques when I watch a film. Anything else is complimentary.<br/><br/>Akira is a 1988, animated adult film. I say adult because in the West, animation is usually associated with children. Akira is definitely not for children. The story is based on a 2,182 page manga. It is a science-fiction, heavy story. Turning this into a 2 hour film should have been difficult. What is left feels like a very compressed script. There is little room for the audience to develop a relationship with the characters. I have seen this film about 4 times. The first time I saw it, I was intrigued at the plot at first, but lost interest about halfway through, and had no idea what was going on by the end of it. The fourth time I saw the film (on Blu-Ray), I payed lots of attention, and I still found it to be obscure and compressed. This makes the film drag during certain scenes. I usually don't experience this ""drag"" emotion that people talk about when discussing movies, but I can definitely testify that Akira, if any film I've ever seen, drags. This is ultimately what separates those who fell in love Akira and those who absolutely hated it.<br/><br/>But like I said earlier, I believe that storytelling in film is just a stem for what ultimately leads to a flower. (And if you think that a story can be so good that it doesn't matter if the flower is ugly, you should have written a book.) Akira is a very beautiful (in a gritty sense) flower. The animation is very impressive for its time. I don't like to compare works of art, but in 1988, Disney released Oliver & Company and in 1989, The Little Mermaid. These two films, while not mediocre in terms of animation, pale in comparison to what is found in Akira. <br/><br/>The depiction of dynamic lighting and shadows looks very natural in Akira, and it is almost a blessing to see animators paying much attention to these things. There is a scene where you can see the trails of light that a motorcycle leaves behind, mimicking the effect that is seen when using actual film. What else is impressive is the extensive use of smoke. There are a lot of explosions in Akira, and every explosion either has a large explosion or little pockets of smoke that animate very realistically. If you don't believe me, go and compare the other works of animation that came out at the time. While this may sound like it is a purely technical aspect, its result for me when watching the film was that it elevated the animation to an almost transparent level, where it was no longer a cartoon and now a near real event. The backgrounds of Neo-Tokyo are also very nicely depicted, and drawn. Another aspect of Akira that greatly exceeded my expectations was the music. The original soundtrack uses sounds that I'm not too familiar with, call it maybe a cultural difference. Still, I would have never imagined the music to have sounded the way it did. The use of percussion and... well... screaming paints a image of Neo-Tokyo that is rivaled by the work done in Blade Runner. (Which Akira is heavily influenced by.)<br/><br/>Akira is ultimately a very clear definition of a love/hate piece. The compressed, obscure plot and unfamiliarity with the sounds and sights, especially it's depiction of postmodern industrial Japan, may confuse, literally, audiences. Or, you may be drawn in by the animation, enchanted by the music, intrigued by the science fiction plot early on, and come out of it satisfied. Overall, whichever side of the theater you are in, it is definitely a must-see for animation buffs, and a recommendation for film lovers. Simply put, some people might not be able to hear the music (figuratively speaking) in Akira, and only hear the lyrics, which appears to be incoherent. To answer the question posed earlier, film does not relate to books, paintings and music. Although they are derived by human hands, the aesthetics that belong to them are unique. Akira is a very beautiful flower, despite the thorny stem."

","I expected to enjoy this, but I didn't expect quite the profound experience this movie was. Pretty much the best in post-apocalyptic, science fiction, animated entertainment, with hints of cyberpunk and strong attention to detail in both the script and drawing, Akira is pretty much penultimate anime. All of the characters are very realistic, the storyline is gripping, the voice acting (both Japanese and English versions, amazingly) is great, and the action is spectacular. For a full two hours, you get immersed in a very fleshed out world (no pun behind ""immersed"" and ""fleshed out"" intended...) and experience the transcendental energies of the Universe.<br/><br/>One night a biker gang chasing another gang called the Clowns through the streets runs into (literally) a strange aged-looking little boy, right as public demonstrations on the street and military activity converge in Neo-Tokyo, the rebuilt metropolis of the area destroyed in 1988. Despite these disparate events, all of the elements of that fateful meeting come together as Tetsuo, the sidekick of bike-gang leader Kaneda, starts developing strange powers, attracting attention of the self-same military elements, a rogue subversive group, and of course Kaneda himself, who simply wants to figure out what happened to his friend (and also is just a little attracted to Kay, one of the subversives). It all has to do with something called Akira, which resides underneath a stadium being built and organized for the Olympics 30. Also, in the process of each character attempting to discover what's going on, corporate plots will be unraveled, governmental coups will be performed, and the landscape of Neo-Tokyo will change for a second time.<br/><br/>Within the animated elements as well there are gorgeous metropolitan landscapes, surreal hallucinatory effects, dazzling environments, and magical realism. I've heard that there are talks going around to make this movie into a live-action, but though CGI effects have developed enough to pull off any of the separate visual effects featured in this movie, their synthesis could never be quite as great as the way this movie looks and moves, especially since live-action bodies wouldn't really belong to the landscape that this movie creates. As a completely idiosyncratic, fully developed piece of art, Akira is really inimitable.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","Akira is a great film, beautifully animated, complexly plotted and aimed for adults. This was the film that gave that put Japanese Animation on a global stage, and Japan does produce some of the best animation and some of the best films generally. The basic plot of the film is that it is set 30-years after World War 3 and the film starts in 1988 and you see Tokyo getting nuked. In Neo-Tokyo, built on the ruins of old Tokyo, Japan is suffering an economic crisis and the city is infested with teenage gangs, similar to A Clockwork Orange. During a gang battle one gang member clashes his bike into a strange, green skinned child. He is captured and studied by the government and he starts to develop psychic powers.<br/><br/>Akira is complex and has made plot strains going on at the same time and I don't want to ruin it for you. It is great if you love sci-fi, animation, anime/manga or just all things Japanese. The animation is also very good from a technical level and all the little details are just great. This is a film aimed for teens and adult, not one for children, but this is just an example that animation is not just for children. Akria is worth watching, and watch it in Japanese with subtitles."

","I read the comic book series a handful of years ago... I had read some other Manga prior to that, but this was the first that *really* grabbed me, and I made sure I read every single one of the chapters. I found out about this not terribly long after, and was excited to find out about both if Ôtomo was as skillful a director as a graphic novelist, and how the heck he was going to make a two-hour film out of 20 100-something(please feel free to correct me if my memory is off on this) page intense Animé releases. He did a darn good job. Some story elements are altered, and others, as well as characters, entirely eliminated, but without doing so, this would have been considerably longer. The fast pace is retained, and as far as I can tell, the meat of the source material comes through. The plot is engaging and well-told. The score is... interesting. The acting is great, with a few exceptions. I watched this with English voices, I don't know about the Japanese ones. The animation is a visual extravaganza(in the nicest possible meaning), breathtaking, the lighting, the effects, all of it. The artists have an awful lot to be proud of here. The action is awesome, and the designs incredible. A solid chunk of what was really, really cool in the original work is here, and it is *astounding*. There are some rather bizarre, as well as many quite disturbing and grotesque sights and sounds in this, and those unsettled by such should almost definitely steer clear. There isn't a lot of language, but it tends to be strong. There is graphic violence and gore throughout the entire feature. There is a little nudity. It's all written out in the Parents Guide for those who want specifics. I recommend this to fans of Katsuhiro and the novel of the same title, as well as the overall style(which this has in spades). 8/10"

","Rated R for graphic violence and brief nudity.<br/><br/>I usually enjoy anime films so I was interested in seeing Akira when it played on teletoon Friday night.It was a fairly long movie(clocked in at 2hrs 45min with commercials).It was a pretty interesting movie, anime buffs should like it but I thought it was a bit overrated. There is quite a bit of action, it has a good story and some good humor but the film is fairly weird and the dubbing isn't all that great(I hear its a new dub).Its about this motorcycle gang in which one of the members get picked up by some FBI agents and gets some sort of new power.He now becomes evil with power and its up to his friends to stop him.If you enjoy anime films then watch Akira, you might like it but I thought it was sort of overrated."
"dvc5159","9","1","4","12 October 2007"," A surreal future out of control.
","Anime is an underrated genre in the world of cinema. Unlike the American animators who either take cover for princesses/talking animals, and whose major attempt at branching out to an older audience include (pre)teen action adventures or cartoon adaptations of comic books (perhaps the sole exception to these rules is Ralph Bakshi), Japanese animation has the potential to leap to adult, mature-minded audiences, exploring fantasies and futures that, no matter how many times Hollywood tries, they simply can not replicate. However, Japanese animation was fairly overlooked and undervalued for a very long time in North America.<br/><br/>In 1988, Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Akira"" was released to instant classic status in Japan and still managed to find a small following in the Western world. However, its popularity was so infectious, that its appeal spread throughout the Western world and created a new generation, and legion, of anime fans. They soon wanted more, and the rest was history. It was a global cultural landmark. But I digress.<br/><br/>Many others have said it before, and I'll say it again - ""Akira"" ranks amongst the greatest animated films. Amazing that a story about an out of control psychic can be transformed with such Gothic and macabre detail, yet visually it is still utterly mesmerizing; how everything falls into place, how it looks, how it sounds, how it feels. It has been said that Otomo animated the voice actors' lips and synchronized it by hand onto the characters. The film also reportedly used over 160,000 animation cells. When put together it forms a gripping effect, we see the characters are hand-drawn, yet the super-fluid motion and good voice acting says otherwise. Groundbreaking stuff. The US$ 10 million (yes it was that expensive) budget had been put to supremely excellent use. tell the creators put a lot of effort and determination to give the public what they want.<br/><br/>In the year 2019, youth culture, delinquency, social unrest and future uncertainty are abundant. The city of Neo-Tokyo is weighed against the historical spectre of nuclear destruction and Japan's post-war economic revival. Otomo and his animators realizes this scenario with some jaw dropping sights, the encompassing metropolis of Neo-Tokyo fills up the screen, the streets filled with neon lights, chaos by oppressed citizens, and a shroud of gloom and despair throughout. You can tell that the look and feel of Neo-Tokyo has been inspired by, perhaps even modeled after many film noirs or neo-noirs more than science fiction. ""Blade Runner"" is probably the biggest influence on the film's look (the year 2019 should be the biggest clue).<br/><br/>Despite the futuristic elements, the city surprisingly shows a lack of technological progress as oppressed citizens take to the streets to overthrow the corrupt government. Amongst all this, the main story involves teenage delinquents, which looks like a cross between Hells' Angels and the delinquents in ""The Warriors"". One of them, Tetsuo, begins to harness supernatural powers after a freak accident, and he begins to lash out at anyone who opposes him - all while his best friend Kaneda tries to stop him/save him. Kaneda is the typical male anime hero, cocky, hilariously arrogant/ignorant at times, but desperately determined. Tetsuo, the villain, slowly descends into insanity and we watch as his design also changes along with his character. It's a solid tale of good and bad, the future, abusing power, friendship, and surprisingly, the introspective near the end of the movie, which is enough to make Kubrick proud.<br/><br/>I love how the film is put together and arranged at the right moments. Crisp editing makes the fluid animation smoothly glide by. Otomo's masterful direction of not only the heavy material and spectacular visuals accompanies the slick, ambitious and thrilling action sequences, more than complementing the visual world that he has created. The violence in said action sequences are shockingly graphic, but not overly grotesque like many other animes before it - it's just the right amount. This is not a movie for young children to watch, unless you feel they are mature enough to handle graphic violence and some introspective scenes. Rounding up everything to come into fruition is the atypical anime, or film, music score. Composed by Shoji Yamashiro and performed by his musical troupe the Geinoh Yamashirogumi, haunting visuals of the city and the graphic action are accompanied by surreal sounds of traditional Japanese chimes, chants and drums, giving it a wholly cultural feel to the film and seemingly making it exist in a truly different world than the one we know.<br/><br/>This film is excellent, simply excellent. An event of gargantuan proportions. Run out, buy this, see this yesterday, and preserve it for generations to come. Some films can be forgotten - this film will stay with you. It's a shame Otomo's next directorial feature was to become the disappointment that is ""Steamboy"". He should have another go for ambition."

","Akira stands out as a moving and also frightening experience involving corruption and incredible power. The movie is quite simply amazing, and for being twenty years old it does not show its age. Akira stands out as a movie ahead of its time. Despite being made in 1987, all anime fans can and will enjoy the sometimes violent Akira today in 2007. It is advised that one watch the movie through completely once then go back and watch it completely through a second time. The second time through you will know all the major players in the game and more of what exactly is going on. The movie is exciting, thought-provoking, and ultimately terrifying, but all-in-all the greatest anime experience. It is most definitely worth renting or even better buying."
"maxyg18","10","1","4","17 April 2007"," This was made in 1988?
","AKIRA is set in Neo-Tokyo, post World War III, about a biker gang leader named Kaneda, whose friend Tetsuo is kidnapped by an organisation ran by the government to be experimented on in a secret project also ran by the government. But luckily, Kaneda and his buddies journey through Neo-Tokyo to save Tetsuo. Meanwhile, all goes wrong when Tetsuo discovers that he's got the telekinetic powers of Akira after being experimented on and goes on a violent rampage with his powers causing chaos in Neo-Tokyo. Can Kaneda and his buddies stop Tetsuo or will Neo-Tokyo or even the world be destroyed?<br/><br/>In my opinion, AKIRA is the best of all ultra-violent anime; the action scenes are filled with blood, explosions, lasers, bullets, motorcycle gangs and even more, the animation is superb, all hand-drawn and no CGI. The scenery is very BLADE RUNNER-like and can even make you feel like your in the film itself (even though it's a cartoon). And how can I not forget the music? Instead of using synthesisers and other electronic items to give you the futuristic feel, it uses authentic tribal music and it works perfectly (it also uses the organ near the end which also fits perfectly).<br/><br/>However, it is important that if you're going to watch AKIRA, watch the 'Special Edition' version, which contains the newer and better English dubbing, rather than the original English dub because the original English dub hasn't got as-good voice-acting and the dialogue isn't good. Or you can watch AKIRA with subtitles in it's original audio language, which is in Japanese.<br/><br/>And like they say, no AKIRA equals no MATRIX."

","Although 12 years old now, and looking a little dated (CEL being replaced by the rather more sterile & lifeless CGI), Akira is the grand-daddy of all Japanese Anime films.<br/><br/>I only saw it by accident on TV about four years ago. Flicking idly through the channels one night until I saw what looked liked a rather detailed ""cartoon"" strip, which later turned out to be the full majesty of Akira.<br/><br/>However, I'd missed about 30 minutes of the film and by the end I was no more the wiser as to what had happened and what it all meant. But in spite of my confusion & ignorance I was simply in awe at the beautiful CEL rendering of a post-war Neo Tokyo.<br/><br/>I had to join a Manga organization to find out where to buy this movie, and when I did I couldn't get home quick enough. Fortunately this was the subtitled version (I have yet to see the dubbed version and in a way I'm glad because usually dubbed films often ruin the whole ""feel"" of the film)<br/><br/>It is, however, hard work to follow. The story is very detailed and moderately convoluted, not helped by having to read the subtitles while still keeping an eye on what's going on above. It took me at least 4 or 5 repeat viewings to finally get comfortable with the involved storyline but its well worth it in the end, although the last 20 or so minutes does go marginally anal with itself, and just pulls the film down from being a true classic.<br/><br/>It should be  remembered that this film is only part of a long-going story of Akira comics, so it's not surprising that our western eyes are a little confused with some of the sub plots & subtle Japanese spiritual & cultural meanings within the film that are never fully explained away.<br/><br/>Many have compared it to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, not so much with regards the story of course but on the grand visualization of some neo city of the future with its technology & artificial human society.<br/><br/>But IMHO, Akira supercedes even BR not only visually but also at a sub conscious level. Blade Runner lacks any real human attachment or emotional drive, whilst Akira makes you feel part of the crowd looking on at the goings on of a bunch of motor bike riding kids causing mayhem in the streets of Tokyo, but in fact could be any city you wish really.<br/><br/>Personally I prefer Ghost In the Shell, Cyber City & PATLABOR 2, closely followed by Akira, in that order of preference. But Akira is perhaps the most intelligent of these and all the other anime/manga films out there.<br/><br/>Don't confuse this kind of ""cartoon"" with the likes of Pokemon, there is simply a world...no, a galaxy of difference between the two genres. Akira is a tough, brutal, violent & grim film that will leave you both perplexed & confused by the end. But even if you don't want to be too involved with the story line its worth seeing simply for the majesty of the animation alone.<br/><br/>

","Akira was my intro to the world of anime back in'89. I can't explain it, but the moment I saw the flickering sign outside of the bar, I was grabbed. It's an incredible piece of art, but I've only seen the dubbed version and it's a little difficult to comprehend just what in the hell is going on, even after multiple viewings. This movie is similar to David Lynch's Lost Highway, where just when you think you have a valid explanation of the film, you pull your hair out when you realize that you've left out one detail that brings the structure of your overall grasp of it crashing down. That's why I'm not even trying to explain the film. I've seen it God knows how many times and I still can't grasp it completely. Akira has just been announced for DVD, so I'll hopefully be able to watch it in the Japanese language with English subtitles and explain it afterward, since this tends to be the most accurate way to watch these movies. It definitely oozes style and the animation does surpass anything that Disney's put out (except Tarzan, which is incredible in it's own right) and yes, the music is amazing. It drags a little in places but not to the point where it's excruciating to watch. This movie is a triumph of anime and it's my strong belief that it comes in second only to Ninja Scroll, my all-time favorite. AKIRA Rating: ****1/2 out of *****."

"friedem0n2004","7","1","5","31 March 2007"," A New Look at an Old World
","First off let me say that I haven't watched Anime for over two to three years after probably Gundam. I used to watch Robotech(Macross), Gundam, etc... This is my first anime that I have seen in quite some time. I have aged significantly too, which means that I understand some of the conflicts that are brought up in some of the shows better than when I was younger. Recently Akira was brought to my attention as being the one of the best pieces of Japanese anime's ever produced if not the best. I was interested to see how well this would hold up to my film knowledge and criticism. To tell the truth, this would make a great live action flick if it could be done WELL. And I stress well, because there is also great potential to make this a piece of crap too. First off I found the artwork or animation to be quite refreshing. I haven't a good cartoon so wonderfully drawn in many years. I'm more used to crude animation like the old days. I only wish I could have seen this in theaters back in 89' or so. Sadly I wasn't born yet so therefore couldn't have possibly seen it. But I have the next best thing, a new clean DVD transfer that was done pretty well. The dub in English was pretty well done but I wish I could have had both the original dub and the new English one as well. I haven't listened to the Japanese language track because I never used to when I was younger. But hopefully now I have matured to the point where I will listen to it. The characters in the film feel and look very lifelike to me. Akria seems to borrow a lot from American films and throw them into a Japanses anime, which is very intriguing. I found out that the voices were recorded first before the animation, therefore; the lips would match the dialog perfectly. This is something that Disney has been practicing forever but that this was the first time it was used on a Japanese anime. Quite cool. Akira's story again is like a great director from the 20th century has created it. It has an essence that pull the audience into the world of Neo Tokyo 2019. A little Blade Runner, a little Children of Men and so on. The only nudge I have against the movie is not giving more insight to what Akira is. But I guess thats the great adventure to the film. That you really don't have a clue as to what Akira is, or who he is. I kept thinking that Akira would pop up somewhere and kill Tetsuo, and control Neo Tokyo once and for all. But this never happened and I'm glad it didn't. Just see the movie. I won't give anything away, but just to say that the end is a bit of a downer. Although, what great movie isn't. The film is immerse as it sucks the audience into a world that is dark and mysterious. It makes the viewer question his or her own life and choices we make in it. Although, I might only recommend this film for Sci-Fi, action people. Don't be put off by the fact that its anime. I was for a while but soon changed opinions and hopped on the Akira bandwagon."
"howard.schumann","9","1","6","17 December 2007"," A masterpiece of technical animation
","As we approach 2012, the year designated by the Mayans in their calendar as the end of our present age, more and more people are beginning to come to an awareness of our multidimensional reality. Just recently an article in New Scientist magazine reported that an essentially empty area of our universe has been discovered nearly a billion light years across, implying the presence of a second universe beyond our own. Coming just a few weeks after other scientists drew the conclusion that parallel universes, which exist in the same area as our own but in overlapping space, may be real. This new discovery amounts to a shift in our understanding of reality.<br/><br/>I was thinking about this while watching Akira, the breakthrough Japanese anime doomsday fantasy by Katsuhiro Otomo from 1988 in which the old order has broken down and strange and powerful forces are working to propel the planet into a new universe. A masterpiece of technical animation, Akira is also a complex and challenging work of art that baffled Western audiences when it first appeared in 1990 but who appreciated its exciting animated style. At that time, animation was considered in the same vein as a children's cartoon, without artistic or intellectual substance but Akira changed that perception to the degree that anime in the 90s became one of Japan's chief cultural exports.<br/><br/>The film opens in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo in 2019, 31 years after World War III. Adapted from Katsuhiro Otomo's long running manga comic book (originally published in a teen magazine), Akira complements its non-stop action and explosive violence with recognizable human beings who can express complex emotions. While the film also contains a political thread in which young people rebel against authority and seek freedom from oppression, the plot is not as significant as the magnificent colors and the quality of the animation.<br/><br/>The main character is Tetsuo, a member of a teenage biker gang (bosozoku) led by his friend Kaneda Shotaro. The film revolves around Tetsuo's relationship with Kaneda. Growing up together, Kaneda has always comes to his aid, but the situation has fostered both Tetsuo's dependence and resentment. During a motorcycle ride, Tetsuo encounters a strange psychic child whom he later learns has been frozen into an unnatural aged childhood as a result of group experiments with telekinesis. Tetsuo's encounter with the child unleashes his own telekinetic energies and the story becomes one of his growing powers developing against a background of civil riots, terrorism, and government crackdowns.<br/><br/>Taken captive by government scientists who experiment on him, Tetsuo is transformed into an unrecognizable creature that can unleash super powers, capable of doing considerable harm to himself and others. Escaping across the city in search of ""Akira"", the entity rumored to be the most powerful of the group of child mutants, Tetsuo becomes a lonely outcast cut off from his friends, then disappears. As the screen is filled with silence, a radiant white dot comes down from the sky and we hear in voice-over the words ""It's begun"". What has ended and what has begun may not be fully understood until five years from now."

When Tokyo was wiped out by an enormous nuclear explosion. 31 years later in an alternate 2019, Neo-Tokyo stood where Old-Tokyo once stood from the nuclear blast.<br/><br/>Neo-Tokyo is large, vast, and very high tech compared to the Tokyo we knew well. Over the past couple of decades, the city is over run by gangs and the newer generation. Inlcuding an unbalanced uproar of violence, drugs, crime, and sex. Shotaro Kaneda, leader of his own bike gang is someone to look up to when it comes to fighting off bullies and helping out someone in need. Including his friend Tetsuo, who was never a good fighter and was pushed around a lot as a kid. When in doubt, Shotaro will always be there to stand up for him. Shotaro, Tetsuo their pals were taking care of things perfectly in their neighborhood.<br/><br/>Right until they encounter a mysterious decayed kid who's on the run. This kid has mysterious kinetic powers and is being tracked down by the military. When Tetsuo encounters the kid, he immediately inherits some strange illness which makes him a victim for the military to take and examine. Shotaro tries to get his friend back, but failed. Multiple experiments were performed on Tetsuo as he is now similar to the decayed kid he encountered earlier. The power he has is believed to be similar to Akira's power. And Akira is known for being the most powerful human being with Psychological powers.<br/><br/>Shotaro, some of his friends and a group of protesters seek to help Tetsuo from the clutches of the military. What has become of Tetsuo? Who was that Decade kid? And who is Akira? This movie proves that Otomo was brilliant in the art of animation from the very beginning of his career. This movie broke the limits of an average anime film. And has all the right ingredients for an enjoyable movie. Including Excitement, violence, character development, girls, guns, choppers, technology, explosions, humor, and interesting script.<br/><br/>It's an 80s anime with an 80s looks to it. But the animation is just brilliant for only being 2-D. The characters designs are cool. The locations are very visual. And the plot is well thought up.<br/><br/>I didn't see this movie until after I was familiar with Otomo's other works. In my book, his skills in anime are worthy. And I can see why this movie was so well received during it's original and American release. It's definitely a cult-classic to watch time after time.<br/><br/>Due to it being R rated. It has a lot of violence, including lots of blood, profanity, brief nudity, a few disturbing scenes, and suggestive themes. so viewer digression is advised when watching this movie.<br/><br/>I recommend it to average anime fans, experts, newbies, as well as those who seen Otomo's other works."

The action and fight scenes also depict why this film has become so popular.<br/><br/>What to me let the film down was the overall storyline as it seemed to be too complex.

The movie was vastly different from the original manga, and even though it had a completely different story, it was still great. I enjoyed both the movies plot, and it's stunning visual effects: it actually had 50 colors created specifically for it, and that is an amazing feat. I even enjoyed that the movie went into Tetsuo's mind and showed his hallucinations. The super powers shown by the psychics is great as well, as they are strong, but not so over the top that they couldn't be duplicated.<br/><br/>I want to see Akira made into a Live Action Movie that is based on the manga.

","Every frame seems to be made to mesmerize the viewer, the climax being a coup of the blending of technology and flesh, reminiscence and destruction, and at the end (in a way), hope through the destruction of the city and rebirth of the new universe (essentially, ""destruction is creation"").<br/><br/>There is no ""invisible threshold"" of the destruction Tetsuo permeates from his embroiled surroundings; the environment and his overall character - which is shrouded with delinquency and much that of the entirety of the cast; indicating (and directly referencing) how bad Neo-Toyko is, trapped and isolated from nothing else.<br/><br/>Although it is refreshing and on-edge to have said ""invisible threshold"" of destruction- it can be overdone at times and exhausting - which might be the point altogether. You can always destroy more and more, yet at the end there is always creation through said destruction (""Destruction is Creation"", once again).<br/><br/>The detail in the scenes of the destruction and gore, translates as an amalgamation of chaos - entrapping the viewer, as said before, much like the characters in synchronicity of the world around them, Neo-Tokyo.<br/><br/>Although appreciation of this film is obviously apparent, I wouldn't say everyone would have the same experience (especially with the highly regarded cult-prowess it has), as it's power-dynamics between Tetsuo and Kaneda seem floaty - Tetsuo ""always being saved"" just seemed like a one-off, overriding problem within another. Which I guess you could adhere to their surroundings, and no support in their lives, but from my personal viewing it didn't seem as strongly attached, more so an overarching feeling shared with all of the characters, it's just more situated within their relationship.<br/><br/>The character intentions of the three other children were hard to understand at times, like why they were using their powers in his hospital room (trying to scare him - but for what? Competition? Trying to see what he could do?).
Also the children (Kiyoko, Specifically) using Kei to appear in person just seemed weird. They sacrifice themselves for a ""boy who isn't involved"" (Kaneda), but don't show in person to stop the Tetsuo they agitated through their powers in the first place? I guess ""thEY'Re chIldrEn"", and didn't want to scare him off but he quickly realized it was them. Eh.
I'm most possibly missing out on a lot of source material, regarding that it also just felt like the ""Akira"" explanation was jammed in there, trying to make sense of it all near the third act.
Although some slight, probably micro-criticisms here and there, ""Akira"" was and i s highly influential, and generally introduced the popularization of Anime to the Western world. It deals with aggression, destruction, and rebirth through the dysfunction and delinquency of the characters, the chaos of Neo-Tokyo as a whole and the much needed betrayal of civilization (the shared notion of something better)."

After Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo is captured by the government, Kaneda attempts to rescue him...but after Tetsuo starts displaying strange powers, things take a decidedly strange turn. This is probably the most violent animated film I've ever seen, a mans guts spill out all over the street, a mans arm gets cut off, a man gets shot to shreds, and a guy gets his jaw shot off, it's insane. The movie starts off pretty normal, but things get really weird at the end. Its a movie that requires more than one viewing. Top notch animation,with over-the-top gore blend to create one of the most iconic animes of all-time."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Akira"" (1988) is a surprise to me seeing it for a first time in 2019, 31 years after its release. I did not expect for this movie to be such a deep and effective. Animation itself was simply amazing - terrific attention to smallest details. Story itself was epic, deep, dark and brilliant. The storytelling was superb - this movie did not dragged for a second (well, maybe a bit by the end). The world itself was amazing and dark.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Akira"" is an amazing movie. I'm not anime fan, haven't seen many of them, but this movie i simply loved and admired - every frame of it. Its not perfect, but its great."

","Even if you only have a passing interest in animation this is a classic you ought to watch. Now if you're really into animation and even more so anime, you ABSOLUTELY have to watch this phenomenon that pretty much introduced Japanese animation to the world. I am a huge fan of the original manga, and of course the movie had to be an extremely simplified version but I think they managed to do a amazing job to maintain as much of the story as they could. 30 years later it is still as good as when it came out."

","Probably the most iconic animated movie ever. I dont particular like animated movies but this just is impossible to skip, the lightning, the setting, the hybrid story of the manga AKIRA is just super well done. The music is just out of this world, it represents the felling that you would experience if you were on the movie. 
 Classic is just the word that comes to my mind, is a movie that should be passed from generations to generationsa.
 The songs just get stuck in yout mind. And if i ever get stuck on an apocalipse i will listen to the soundtrack(and some john murphy songs in 28 days later and and sunshine that are on my top ever movies)and enjoy every second of existence. This soundtrack is incredible."

","A great story and fantastic style of animation that still holds up today barring a few clunks, the film Akira is unique a great story that's fantastical yet also grounded completely worth status of classic. Grim, gritty and political one of the most important films in history"
"Raven-1969","9","0","1","4 July 2018"," When Power Goes to the Head
","In an off-limits area of new Tokyo and the aftermath of World War III, a secret government project known as Akira is unraveling and a freakish stage of evolution is occurring. Rival motorcycle gangs, military special forces units, scientists, rebels and odd kids with supernatural powers, are among the groups clashing. Orders are to kill what cannot be controlled, yet few are in control of themselves. Into the void steps motorcycle gang leader Kaneda, a noble outlaw in the tradition of Mad Max, Motoko Kusanagi and Han Solo, to attempt to tie up loose ends.
 
This timeless, complex and thrilling animation masterpiece is as action packed as it is food for the brain. It is a typical Japanese dish; the artistry, attention to detail and manner in which it is prepared and served are as important as the taste. No corners are cut. To look away, even for a moment, means missing an essential part of the multi-faceted story. Akira is delicious for eyes, ears, brain and heart alike. After 30 years it aged well.
 
Akira revolves around questions of balance; those who absorb power without thought or principle, and those too cowardly to act. Decisions are made for those who do not make them on their own. The only foolish questions are those that are unasked.<br/><br/>For a deeper experience, listen to the film in Japanese."
"TheMovieDiorama","9","0","2","18 May 2018"," Akira is arguably the most influential anime classic of all time.
","Garnering a title such as that automatically inserts high expectations upon everyone. Well, from what I just witnessed, it pretty much floored me. Two school drop outs, Kaneda and Tetsuo, discover that the government are creating weaponised telekinetic humans where the latter becomes experimented on himself. It soon comes into motion that they've unleashed a power of cataclysmic proportions that cannot be stopped. Thirty years since its release, three decades since it took the world by storm and popularised anime in western culture. It is, without a doubt, an incredibly entertaining cyberpunk showstopper. For director Otomo to perfectly balance the political agendas of anarchy, capitalism and revolutions with existential themes of religion and creationism, is pure genius. To blend these ancient and modern ideologies and amalgamate them to populate a futuristic dystopian environment, again, is pure genius. Not only does he stop there. Intricately adding exhilarating action sequences bolstered by characters teeming with excitable personalities to create what I can simply describe as anime's greatest blockbuster. Wow. It hasn't aged at all. The animation is gorgeous, Neo-Tokyo looked awe-inspiring and the inventive imagery was stunning. Tetsuo's nightmarish fantasies surprisingly stunned me, the ominous images of giant toys have mentally scarred me. The visceral violence, the excessive use of gore and the usage of profanity enhances the overall edginess. Way ahead of its time, that's for sure. Yet beneath the visual splendour lies a melancholic story of a friendship being tarnished by corruption. You feel for both Tetsuo and Kaneda, two central characters that are exquisitely developed. The third act involving Akira did escalate to absurd levels of craziness, which detracted from the realism of the story. Also some of the scene transitions were abruptly cut. However, very small nitpicks. Akira may not be the best anime feature film I've seen, but it certainly has justified its status as the most influential."

","AKIRA is an anime which is based on the 1982 manga by the same name it's written by katushiro otomo who also directed the anime the problem is that AKIRA doesn't cover all of the original comic which is kind of disappointing <br/><br/>but the movie is still really good and highly recommend for those who never been into anime 
 
the art style is the best thing you'll see in the movie neo tokyo never looked so 
epic in 1988 for a movie since my neighbor totoro (never seen that movie yet or even spirted away and princess mononoke)<br/><br/>the eng dub sucks tbh just watch it in japanese dub which i would highly recommend before watching it
(i also have kaneda's jacket might put it up for display in my room)
bike chase scenes have alot of mad max themes to it which is why i love this movie wish i could buy a bike that's like what shotaro kaneda rides <br/><br/>
that's much of the review i may edit it sometime"
"eagandersongil","8","0","2","4 November 2017"," The definition of POP and quality
","It is impossible not to notice right away how ""Akira"" influenced and used influences, it is impossible to say if the manga inspired the art direction of the first ""Blade Runner"" or if ""Blade Runner"" inspired the art direction of ""Akira"" , but it is livable that a baby from the source of the other, this is just an example, since innumerable other animes and films bring elements of ""akira"" such as ""Elfen Lied"" or so many others, ""Akira"" is politics, violence, vulgarity, music, action, photography, ""Akira"" is synonymous with the word POP, and one of the framers of Cyber ​​Punk culture in the East and West. ""Akira"" in two hours has a very unpleasant mission, he has to build a whole universe and still tell a story full of symbolism and subjectivity without letting the viewer get distracted, obviously he uses a lot of graphics to accomplish this task. but first of all, the basis of everything, is the script, that script is the only thing in the movie that is not perfect, she got confused, hangs, gives back, abuses ex-machine, but even so, he is extremely daring, innovative, philosophical and grandiose, perhaps even too much, contemplate the histories of Kaneda (Mitsuo Iwata) and Tetsuo (Nozomu Sasaki), two friends who are forced to face each other after being brought in by metahuman power, intrigues, youth, war and society are treated in the length of Katsuhiro Otomo, from this degeneration of youth, in the best style ""Mechanical Orange"" to the end of the world. is really a screenplay that covers a lot, although you get lost a little on this long road, he knows how to develop the characters partially, incredible as it may seem, is missing some flash backs, and you have problems defining a protagonist, or even even the real function of some character, as this is not told to the viewer, just shown, it is up to whoever is watching connect the dots, and please né, the screenplay of ""Akira"" is not a head bug, the luggage that we have today, many things are easy to interpret even if the story in some points leave many ends tips open, and the end, leave the viewer completely confused, of course, unless you have read the manga, there will be a wonderful experience, but we have to give a discount, it is difficult to adapt more than 2000 thousand pages of manga in two hours of film, several characters are left out or are poorly exploited. The first thing that jumps in the eye in ""Akira"" is the beauty of the animation that is something completely timeless, recorded at I20 frames per second, something extremely advanced for the 80's, and all handmade, details, windows, shadows, the beauty of this animation is something vicarious and addictive, it is impossible not to be in love with the movements, colors, angles, details, graphics, it is really a perfect animation, that even after more than 25 years stays above the level, conquering generations, just like her soundtrack, full of voices and synthesizers she is tribal, mechanical, scary and house completely with the film always leaving the viewer glazed on the scene and sharing the emotions shown on screen. Finally, ""Akira"" is a symbol of a movement, it may seem that many things are missing in its entanglement- At least in anime- it compensates with a timeless look and is a spectacular and unique film."
"DHWaldron","9","0","4","14 August 2017"," Down-right SPECTACULAR!
","""Akira"" is set after a bomb strikes Tokyo, sending it into a post-apocalyptic state, where psychics exist and teenage bikies flood the streets. After a violent and graphic opening sequence, one of Kaneda's (the protagonist of the film) friends are kidnapped. Throughout the film, we witness the development of the antagonist, Kaneda's friend, Tetsuo. Tetsuo develops psychic powers for an unknown reason, he soon becomes obsessed with the power, which cloud reason and judgement. All through the film we witness a complicated and unique plot-line and character developments which are interesting and not-your-usual-style. For example, Kaneda, the protagonist, does have qualities which frustrate and repel the viewer, but his heroic and redeeming qualities make him a stand-out character. The underlying and complicated plot add to the reasons of why this film is a must-watch.<br/><br/>The only disappointing aspect was the (sometimes) extreme and unnecessary level of violence. But, the overall plot, character development and spectacular animation (even for the current day) prove this film to be an unmissable classic."

","Parents need to know that Akira is a landmark of anime, a super production in Japan, and a cult classic in the United States; it introduced many Americans to the genre. It's available in an English- dubbed version as well as a Japanese version with English subtitles; this review references the English version. The violence is quite incredible, with numerous battles, fights, and shootouts, with blood, and escalating into nightmarish, disturbing imagery. Language is fairly constant, but rarely escalates to the ""big"" words, ""s--t"" and ""f--k."" ""Damn"" and ""hell"" are used regularly. There's one scene of female tonelessness (in a moment of violence rather than intimacy), and a moment of sexual groping in the background of a scene. This is essential viewing for any serious teen fans of anime, though it's one of the most intense examples."

Any fan of anime, science fiction or anything of the sort should be interested in seeing this film. This movie is a bit confusing at times so I would say that anyone who is planning on seeing this film should should set aside some time and actually pay attention to what is happening. This is a movie that is stylish and a bit of a mind bender at times, so I would say that people should let this movie be one heck of a ride."
"anthonymora2","10","0","3","22 September 2014"," Akira Review
","So after what I consider a good start to my anime review series, I thought a good follow up to my review of ATTACK ON TITAN, which is probably one of the most popular new animes out today, would be a review for AKIRA, probably the most popular and acclaimed anime of ALL TIME! AKIRA is set in the dystopian future of Tokyo, Japan in the year 2019. Tetsuo and Kaneda are the characters we start with and they're these young, motorcycle riding hoodlums that drive around the neon lit streets just living their young, motorcycle riding hoodlum lives. During a seemingly everyday gang fight, Tetsuo gets in a crash involving a mysterious, wrinkled child. The government comes flying in on choppers and scoop up the kid and Tetsuo and take them away.After the abduction, Kaneda decides it's up to him to get back his friend with the help of Kei, a kick ass anti-government chick that is also involved with the mysterious kid, however government cover ups and secrets are discovered along the way and leads to a mind blowing amount of chaos and destruction. The plot of Akira is one that demands your full attention and patience.By that, I don't mean it doesn't make sense or is boring.If anything, the script and story have a surprising amount of depth and covers many themes,which honestly threw me off guard.Themes like religion,politics,even the theme of having power.HOWEVER, as much as I was engrossed and in love with the movie's story, I can't see where non casual anime watchers can get into something this...ALL OVER THE PLACE, for lack of better words.If I showed my mom Akira, she'd be scared off as soon as a she saw a grey child witnessing a German shepard dog getting face shot.That doesn't mean the story telling is all that perfect though, there were some certain characters that take forever to really get behind.A big majority of the first half,I DID have trouble figuring each character out and their motives and purpose.Thankfully the story DOES get into each character further into the run time, but it takes a while for certain characters to flush out.That problem isn't there for the two main characters of Tetsuo and Kaneda.The two have this real bond and brotherhood and it really carries the story along.A thing I did find odd and never really thought of was how a lot of the movies promotional art and DVD covers, heavily show the character of Kaneda.While he IS a major character in the movie, there are so many other people like Ryu,The Colonel(personal fav),and of course Tetsuo that are just as important. The beauty of the film's animation is damn mear perfect!Pixar and Dreamworks have given us pretty films of recently but this was made back in 1988.That means HAND DRAWN ANIMATION!There is not one moment that doesn't look absolutely gorgeous.Backgrounds and settings with constant ruins and destruction are beautifully detailed and character models are some of the best I've seen in any anime.Usually in anime, no matter how good it is, the animation can get pretty stiff and jittery at times.Akira has constantly fluid and crisp animation that keeps you glued to EVERY frame.It still blows my mind when I think of just how much care the artists behind the scenes put into this movie. The influence of this movie, like its animation, is also very strong.If I told you this anime influenced today's blockbusters like The Matrix and Chronicle, you'd probably can see why with the highly stylized action and effects it uses.You can also see where Akira was influenced by other classic sci-fi movies like Blade Runner with the bright, hypnotic city skylines. Akira is an animation lover's anime; it's shockingly nice to look at, even at it's more twisted and trippy moments.The story is both epic and deep while also giving us likable lead characters to get behind. If you're not into Anime I highly suggest A RENTAL AT LEAST. It's just a beautifully made anime that deserves a watch but for fans and true animation/film lovers I GIVE IT MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. BUT IT!"
"chribren","10","0","3","29 August 2013"," Anime of DOOM: The BEST anime ever!!!
","""Akira"" is an Action/Sci-Fi/Anime feature directed by Katsuhiro Otomo 1988. Not common with animated movies generally, this film runs for about two hours. It is also based on a manga/comic which Katsuhiro Otomo made back in the early 80s.<br/><br/>The film starts out with Tokyo 1988 getting destroyed by a mystical power which looks like a ""giant, glowing ball"". Skipping straight forward to 2019 Neo-Tokyo is dominated by violence, especially gang violence. A biker gang called Capsules, lead by the films main character Shotaro Kaneda, fight an another biker gang called the Clowns. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima crashes into Takashi, a child who's face resembles an old guy. Later in the film Tetsuo gets to know that he has a psychic power similar to the one that caused the Tokyo destruction, which can even lead to the end of the world...<br/><br/>This film is no doubt a MASTERPIECE, well to say my favorite anime movie of all time. The animation, the music by Geinoh Yamashirogumi, well literally EVERYTHING. And it has load of action-scenes enough to keep you entertained, including biker chases, explosions, fighting and shootouts and a somewhat disturbing ending sequence. Not exactly a film to be watched by children.<br/><br/>The film might not be as great as the original manga the film is based on due to lack of character development, according to the fans who has read the manga and watched the film. But anyway, I love this film as it is. Honestly, I haven't read the manga.<br/><br/>Some extra story: I had a rare Norwegian VHS by this film, released in later 90s by Polygram Video. It was based on the original English dub by Streamline. The film was rated 18, exactly like ""Shadow Skill"", ""Venus Wars"" and ""Ninja Scroll"" were. When I was on vacation in Paris 2009, I bought this film on DVD, together with ""Golgo 13"" and ""Venus Wars"". Finally I got to watch this film with Japanese dub, so I got rid of the VHS. The DVD version I have now is based on the new English dub by Pioneer, hence a restoration credits, as well as the Pioneer logo (shamelessly) replacing the Toho logo.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Are you an Anime-fan, and still haven't watched ""Akira"" yet, then I highly recommend you to watch this at least once! :-)<br/><br/>Other violent, epic anime films include ""Fist of the North Star"", ""Golgo 13"", ""Ninja Scroll"", ""Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend"", ""Wicked City"" and the three ""Violence Jack"" OVAs."
"ejackimowicz","10","0","3","25 August 2013"," The best anime/animated movie on EARTH...and most underrated...
","I'm not going to lie, I was a bit reluctant to watch this at first because I was afraid I would be bored. After watching it several times, I'm still not bored. After 25 years, it is still the best.<br/><br/>First let's talk about the story....Phenomenal and original. This story displays optimism in the face of real despair. Katsuhiro Ohtomo has a genius mind. A mind that might as well dominate the works of Hayao Miyazaki. Others might say that this story is confusing and boring, but they are dead wrong. What makes the story so interesting to me is how difficult it is. A complicated story line is always fascinating to those who like to watch movies and figure them out themselves.<br/><br/>Now, characters....Kaneda: the only animated character with real guts. Tetsuo: the only truly frightening force of any animated film. The relationship between Kaneda and Tetsuo (main characters) is so tragic and heartbreaking that it adds a different theme to the story: friendship. Kaneda is shown doing everything he can to snap his childhood Tetsuo back into reality. Others characters like Kei, the Espers, or the Colonel are absolutely works of art. Supporting characters may not be important to some, but to me they add a certain sense of depth to the plot. The fate of Kei's character was a surprise to me. I will not say anymore beyond that point...The Espers were so mesmerizing in personality. Their looks are certainly deceiving (some think they were creepy). They may come off as the ""bad guys"" but in the end they are just trying to re-balance what they've been born into. The Colonel, however, was one of my favorite characters. He is so determined and strong-willed which made me admire him. None the less, these characters are distinguished and definitely underrated. <br/><br/>Now, the animation....This movie was made and released in 1988. Now I know what you may be thinking, it probably sucks. Well, again, you are WRONG. The setting of 2019 Neo-Tokyo was a marvel to watch. The bikes of the gangs were gorgeous, and I must compare them to the light bikes of Tron. They add the same intensity to the gangs in Akira as they do to the programs in Tron. The music along with the setting was mind blowing. I think that the best time I saw the city was when it was in ruins after the destruction of Tetsuo's path on his way to find SPOILER***the great power of Akira***SPOILER. <br/><br/>Now that I am done ranting about the best animated film on earth, just letting you know, It's Mr. Kaneda to you punk."

","In 1988 the animation audience were used to watch the same fairy tail since 1937 that Disney provided with 'snow white' where ""happy and ever"" ruled and there was no violence or anything to create a REAL climax between the characters with a good mix of blood and explosions. But that was until 1988. After Katsuhiro Otomo released his controversial ""Akira"" the world of animation realized that there was no limits for story or action to make a good movie. With a unusual and powerful story, combined with explosive actions sequences and outstanding visuals, Akira turns out to be one of the greatest animations ever made, and open the doors of this entire anime universe we have today."

It took a friend bugging me and loaning me with the DVD of it for me to finally check it out. I must say I was impressed.<br/><br/>Film starts out in New Tokyo 31 years after its destruction, and seems like a standard future. There's biker gangs, ruined building and lack of institution, strong military presence and the like u see in these dystopian/apocalyptic movies. During a rival fight with another biker gang, a kid with telepathic powers collides with one of the protagonists biker friends, Tetsuo which gives him the same powers. I'm not going to spoil more than that for u because its such a great story I hate to ruin it. <br/><br/>It's truly an animation masterpiece and up there with anything of Miyazaki's. The story is well written and shows great coherence(pretty rare in anime). The Japanese seiyu's or VA's were also spot on. Fe only complaint I have is the animation but that's most because of the time it's made(although Miyazaki's work at the time is so much cleaner and neater) <br/><br/>Overall this really is a great movie. It's so iconic with early American anime fans and is treasured as a classic. I'm going to keep that sentiment. It's an anime Masterpiece.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Akira is arguably the most influential anime to have entered the western world and despite its flaws it manages to hold up as the defining example of adult animation. The vast scale of the Akira manga was never going to fit into a feature film because it's just too big, but this film does an incredible job of representing the story in all of its spiritual and stylistic traits. The animation is literally flawless and in terms of detail and intricacy is unmatched in anything else I have seen. The story is one of mystery, basically centring around the weary and emotional friendship that Kaneda and Tetsuo share. The bigger picture however focuses on the government and revolution, exploring themes of control and modern science. You leave asking more questions about our modern world than about the film itself. Another impressive element of Akira would be the soundtrack; the ferocious and bizarre music binds the film together and really intensifies the opening scenes when the bike gangs are roaming Neo-Tokyo, the most spectacular sequence in the film in my opinion. Akira may require multiple viewing after you first watch it but is definitely worth your patience. One of my criticisms of the film would be that we don't see enough of an on screen friendship between Kaneda and Tetsuo to feel too emotionally sympathetic toward them. Overall it stands still 25 years since release as the most impressive body of work in adult animation anywhere in the world, an iconic and influential movie!"
"jose-cruz53","10","0","3","29 September 2012"," Excellent action/sci fi film
","Akira is one of the most important films in the history of Japanese animation. Mainly because it broke new ground in making an adult, extremely violent and visually stunning film that greatly influenced the design and themes of later anime films. However, I do not think this film is among the greatest anime films of all time, I think that Miyazaki alone made about 6-7 films superior to this one. That's because I did not find the characters and the plot as engaging. The level of emotional deepness is not comparable to Miyzaki's output, also, the soundtrack is not as ""great"" as well. It was an excellent, but flawed movie, like Citizen Kane, which I watched in the same day.<br/><br/>The animation has a flowing quality like no other anime film I ever saw. And the story is interesting, basically about government funded research on the manipulation of an a semi-mystical ethereal quality that living beings have with the purpose of producing ""super humans"", probably for military use. It's said that the first time such attempt had been tried in 1988, a world war followed due to the awakening power, which had destroyed the massive city of Tokyo. The film is set in ""the future"", 2019, when another awakening is occurring. Basically, havoc happens and we are for a treat of awesomeness.<br/><br/>It's an excellent action/science fiction film."
"Eternality","8","0","4","16 December 2010"," Akira is a dizzying ride that's enjoyable, but the ending doesn't lend a lasting touch to a potential great animated classic.
","Released in 1988, Akira had a faithful cult following. One of the most influential Japanese animation (or anime) ever produced, it explores deep, mature issues that are rarely showcased in animation form. Including graphic violence and gore, and profanity, Akira's target audience is aimed at largely teens and adults, not small kids. The filmmakers' intention is to show how future Tokyo will look and feel like. Their vision is uncompromising; a post-apocalyptic, polluted city with gangsters and corrupted government officials, plus unethical scientists.<br/><br/>Akira's animation is mostly cell-drawn, immaculately detailed, and very colorful. It seduces us from the start, hooking us right into the polluted world of neo-Tokyo. The characters evolve into something quite substantial; their developments seldom paper-thin. Akira has many exhilarating set-pieces, and its own fair share of great action sequences. With fantastic music accompaniment and stunning remastered sound effects, watching on home video is a blast.<br/><br/>The problem of Akira (and it's a major one in my opinion) lies in the last half hour. It starts out in the most brilliant way, but ends in an overblown, exhaustive, and indulgent manner that is nearly suicidal. While the creativity is there, the long-winded ending sequence is likely to end up saturating viewers whom have already been through almost two hours of mind-boggling stuff. Akira is a dizzying ride that's enjoyable, but the ending doesn't lend a lasting touch to a potential great animated classic. Cult followers will be likely to think otherwise though.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."
"rooee","8","0","2","12 April 2010"," The silver lining in the mushroom cloud
","There's a vast allegory here - a post-Hiroshima distrust of the wheels of industry - that runs through a lot of modern manga, from Doomed Megalopolis, through Patlabor 1 & 2, to Katsuhiro Otomo's own Steamboy. (More recently, with films like Ghost In the Shell 1 & 2, the dominant fear has been of a kind of hidden cyber-apocalypse.) But the urban apocalypse was most powerfully and poetically realised with Akira. Otomo's movie, based on his own manga comic, clocks in at over two hours; it is a dramatically arresting epic. It's also visually sumptuous. Remember this was 1988, before the CG revolution - the huge images contain herein would have been impossible to recreate 'live'.<br/><br/>Some might resent the characters' lack of personality. Indeed, they're far less outwardly expressive than the more caricatured efforts found in, say, Wings of Honneamise or Metropolis. But Akira is not concerned with sentimentalising its characterisation. Key players are wantonly dispatched amongst Tokyo's toppling tower blocks - Tetsuo's (Nozomu Sasaki) girlfriend, the ghost-white Kaori (Yuriko Fuchizaki), for all her stubbornness and pleading, is a vessel of tragedy. The closest we get to an intimate relationship is between Tetsuo and Kaneda (Mitsuo Iwata), although ultimately even this comes down to some nuclear-fuelled fisticuffs. This is not to say that Akira's characterisation is lacking - far from it. In fact, the psychological plight of Colonel Shikishima (Taro Ishida) as he realises the folly of his lust for power, and then his subsequent forgiveness, is moving; likewise, the horrible ordeals of the ever-young 'Espers' gives their final sacrifice added poignancy.<br/><br/>There are murmurs of a live action remake of Akira (at one point with Stephen ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" Norrington attached). Quite apart from the intrinsic pointlessness (unless your point is profit) behind remaking perfectly good films, what will become of the original's real trump card: namely its sheer unhindered scope? Here is a movie which not only dares to look the apocalypse in the eye, but even shows us what lies beyond. What will it sound like, for instance, as Kaneda's bike rolls across the empty road bridge towards the ruins of neo-Toyko, when Shia LaBeouf utters those simple yet profound words, ""I am Tetsuo""?"

","Yes, Akira needs to be at least in the Top 20 of 250! It is a landmark in visual cell animation that now, not even a mere experienced artist can fathom... The story is the most original that it can be and is the closes thing to a futuristic perfection like Blade Runner. The violence that is in this movie is not without noticing, but isn't something that needs to be put down, this movie to a mere 7.9??? It's a visual wonder and a epic piece of emotion when it comes to knowing your breaking points and what to do with them when you began to lose it. I got say this is my favorite anime cause seeing it when I was only 12 or 13 was like watching something unfold like a fairy tale of dark vs light.. A very unforgettable film that will have people wondering why Katshiro Otomos epic was never considered to be a visual wonder..."

","Okay, so this is considered one of the best anime of all time. Well clearly that is a stretch due to a human's preference, but nobody can deny that this is the most influential anime to hit the western hemisphere.<br/><br/>To start off I watched the 2001 English dub version because Johnny Yong Bosch did the voice for Kaneda (I love Johnny). The voice acting was terrific and it was very powerful. The setting was beautiful, you really felt like you were involved in their struggle. The story was awesome until... you learned more about Tetsuo's condition.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'm crazy, but I really felt like the story all went down hill whenever Kaneda finally found Tetsuo in the lab/hospital place. The story was far more interesting whenever you were kind of confused and didn't know exactly what was going on. <br/><br/>The beginning of the film is so epic, it's beyond words. The introduction of The Capsules (the bike gang led by the protagonist, Kaneda) is just spectacular and I honestly feel like they had a better story with the bike gang as a whole, but instead the story went completely sci-fi and way over the top.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is definitely a must see. It is very inspirational and nothing is held back from hitting the screen. It is very mature with the inclusion of loads of blood, death, language and even somewhat of a rape scene. If you have not seen this, WATCH IT NOW!<br/><br/>I rated a 7/10 because I was more interested in the bike gang and Kaneda more than I was Tetsuo and his condition. Kaneda is a much better character and he should of had more time on the screen."

"joebloggscity","9","0","2","5 January 2009"," Landmark seminal sci-fi anime set in a nihilistic Neo-Tokyo
","I first watched this seminal piece of work back in 1997 and instantly was in awe of the whole production. However, after watching it I vowed not to watch it again until I got the chance to see it on the big screen, and finally in 2008 I managed to get to view it on a big screen in a cinema, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. If anything I was again left in awe as if it were the first time I'd ever seen the film.<br/><br/>The film is a sci-fi classic that encompasses a myriad of the sections of a post-apocalyptic ""Neo-Tokyo"", including corrupt politicians, high school gang members, underground terrorists and frustrated military men. The whole encounter begins when an accident between a high school gang member (Tetsuo) and a strange ""child"" somehow unlocks powerful and destructive forces in Tetsuo, and the race then begins to control/stop him. The enigma for the viewer is then trying to unravel who and what exactly ""Akira"" is, and who (and what) are the three strange ""children"" with the paranormal abilities.<br/><br/>It's difficult to succinctly define what the film captures. Suffice to say that each viewer will take from it a different perspective as at no time does this ever preach to anyone despite certain heavy subject underlying topics. As it's an animated film there is scope beyond what could be possible elsewhere, and this film more than most influenced other film-makers in how to combine a strong deep intelligent-themed storyline with action. The story can be nihilistic, and in what seems an increasingly dangerous world today, the themes of the film are as relevant now as ever (or possibly even more so). Must add there are some well-placed moments of humour in the film that help to soften the darker elements of the film.<br/><br/>The film's animation was at the time a landmark in Anime which in itself gives the viewer a reason to watch this. The opening sequences of the motorbike chases through ""Neo-Tokyo"" gives the viewer a taste of the exceptional artwork in this film as we see a panorama of the futuristic city, both from above and at the street level. <br/><br/>I can wax lyrical about this film ever more but then I'd likely give elements of this film away. If you have not watched this before I'd highly recommend it to you."

Going on with the plot, some or most would find it overly complicated (Personally, I didn't, I chewed it down in one gulp)and might need to see the film a few more times.<br/><br/>A lot of people don't understand this film's importance in history. What they're failing to see is that without Akira, there wouldn't be The Matrix. If Andy and Larry Wachowski never saw Akira or any anime, it would never have come to fruition.<br/><br/>Overall, this has something for everyone, including action-lovers, critics, and even people who don't like anime.

"Real77","7","0","3","27 November 2008"," A little over-rated but not to be overlooked
","'Akira' can be said to have helped in making anime (kind of) popular in the United States a long time ago in nineteen-eighty-eight; I keep a copy of the movie inside of my personal library because of how it's a sort of landmark. I suppose 'Akira' really WAS an enormous contribution in making anime a little more mainstream here, and it always will have a special place inside of me because of that, though I have to disagree in that it's not 'THE GREATEST ANIME MOVIE EVER'. Being an self- proclaimed Otaku (and because I call myself as such for truthful reasons) I can say that I've seen better through my experiences with the medium, though that's not to say that I dislike Akira either; only, I think it's over-rated (my personal favorites are 'Ghost in the Shell' and 'End of Evangellion', but I'll talk about those two later). I'm going to keep this review brief by leaving the story vague; of the story are elements of science fiction and surrealism which feel to me as leaving the audience in a state of being helpless. The characters show a contrast with future anime heroes and heroines; that they have a grittiness to them and appear void of melancholy (they're like a homage to American comic-book characters even). The story too feels like a homage to American actions comics; super-human-powers fill the story with conflict.<br/><br/>This film is 'fun' and it gets for it's audience to think too, but again, there are better anime films existing, and I can say that 'Akira' has little of some important things like character development; I feel like the director didn't care too much for that stuff anyhow, and focused his attention on violent scenes so to interest the action fans (and I'm sort of fine with that). <br/><br/>7/10"
"machngunjoe","10","0","3","4 August 2008"," Akira - original, thought-provoking, and spellbound
","First let me get the negative out of the way.<br/><br/>I felt very strongly that the original American voice acting for it was better then the new 2001 release of the film. The dialog is slightly different and you got more into the characters through the art of voice acting. Makes me appreciate voice acting so much now that I have heard both versions.<br/><br/>The movie still has me thinking and I've owned it or over ten years now. THe story is so profound, so deep, it certainly is a moralistic as well as a philosophical movie.<br/><br/>This is not an action movie as many Americans sometimes categorize anime (although there is action in it). Nor will you find cute talking animals. This, all in all, is an adult movie, not for kids under the age of 13 in my opinion. One thing you can generalize about serious anime is that their plot lines or stories are so complex and don't usually focus entirely on a single characters. More times than not they focus on idea's rather then people, which makes for a good thinking movie.<br/><br/>Without giving away the movie, this is a serious film about morality and technological achievements in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo, which is always interesting to me since there are many post-apocalyptic movies coming out of Japan and the fact that they are in a very real sense, a post-apocalyptic nation, having atoms bombs dropped on them at the end of WWII.<br/><br/>This film does stand the test of time"
"cheeks9","9","0","3","25 June 2008"," Simply too important to miss.
","Probably one of the most claustrophobically dark and atmospheric anime films out there, Akira is also an incredibly important movie. First of all, the back-story and the politics would lose a tremendous amount of impact if not for the chilling darkness, and the perpetual ""end of the line"" environment that these teenagers live in. This dark depiction is owed largely to William Gibson and his invention of the ""cyberpunk"" (""high tech, low life"") environment; towering, pristine skyscrapers lit up like plastic Christmas trees, and cracked pavements and old, dilapidated buildings left to rot in the 20th Century, it simply adds marvellous tone to the film.<br/><br/>And the back-story itself? Seamlessly interwoven flashback scenes not only reveal a lot more about the characters' histories with each other, but the white, washed-out optics and the dreamy tone make it seem like a world away, and thus we are left with one window to light and innocence in this dark, coming of age tale. Teenagers fighting for themselves in gangs, teenagers subjected to psychic experiments, all paint a tragic picture. A brilliant picture at that. A picture that has influenced other favourites of mine, such as The Matrix.<br/><br/>My qualms are that, whilst it remains an influential piece of work, there are better anime (the Ghost In The Shell franchise has consistently delivered 10 out of 10 perfection, for instance, well, save the first film) and there are less confusing, more rewarding ones. The story can seem a bit unreal at times; the pacing often throws the film into an intangible realm which the viewer can not understand with flashback after dream sequence and so on; the dark atmosphere sometimes throws off the reader from the plot itself. <br/><br/>A marvellous film, nonetheless, only shy of a perfect 10 due to a slightly confusing presentation of plot and often counterproductive pacing that doesn't focus as much on plot as we should do. This does little to cloud the fact that this piece is an artful depiction of a high tech, low life environment, with credible characters and realistic dialogue."
"brando647","7","0","3","24 April 2008"," I think Masaru kind of looks like a small Louie Anderson....
","I am generally not an fan of anime, but there are a couple of exceptions. This movie is the biggest exception. This is one of the few animes I really enjoy. The story revolves around Tetsuo Shima, a young member of a bike gang in Neo-Tokyo. After an incident with a strange young child leaves him injured, he is taken by the government, who awaken latent powers inside him that Tetsuo finds himself consumed with and unable to control. The movie, based off the manga of the same name, is probably one of the few anime films that will ever find itself in my collection.<br/><br/>The animation in this movie is fantastic; the movie looks great. My favorite scene in the movie would have to be when Tetsuo awakens in his room at the government facility and he finds himself hallucinating, the toys in his room coming to life. It's one of many awesome visuals in the film. The film contains a good amount of graphic violence and 'frightening' imagery, so this is definitely not a film for a younger audience.<br/><br/>I can't think of much to say about the film, except that its worth checking out. It's got an intense story that keeps you entertained throughout and it has sweet/sick animation. There you have it. As I mentioned before, I'm not a fan of most anime but I would recommend this movie to anyone, fan or not."
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","0","3","26 March 2008"," Up there with the greats of science-fiction cinema
","Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira (1988) is a bold and vivid cyber-punk saga; wherein the story is a simple tale of good versus evil blown up to multi-layered proportions, further developed through the sublime, visually-transcendent animation and intricate character details, which both combine to create one of alternative cinema's greatest ever achievements. Everything you could hope to find in a science-fiction film is brought into play here, with warring street-punks, shadowy government conspiracies, psychological manipulation, body horror and nuclear holocaust all figuring heavily within the writhing and labyrinthine plot. It shows a continuation of the themes established in earlier classic of the sci-fi genre, most notably Fitz Lang's Metropolis (1927), Ishirō Honda's Godzilla (1954), LQ Jones' A Boy and His Dog (1975), Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker (1979), George Miller's The Road Warrior (1981) and Ridley Scott's iconic Blade Runner (1982), with the post apocalyptic theme and the further depiction of a technologically advanced, noir-like metropolis spiralling out of control.<br/><br/>Alongside this we have the ghosts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki referenced in the opening sequences, and the parallels of those atrocities revisited here as the trigger of World War Three. However, despite these more elaborate historical juxtapositions and themes of science fiction, the story's main focus is that of friendship; in this instance the friendship of two characters being pushed and strengthened throughout the film, finally reaching a climax with the final fight between Kaneda and the bizarre mutation of Tetsuo. This theme is central throughout Akira, posing serious questions of loyalty, contempt and ambition, as well as ending with the ambiguous idea that further battles must be fought before any of the characters (and by extension, the audience as well) know the truth about Tetsuo and the tree, mystical little children so central to the plot.<br/><br/>If you're already a fan of Manga and Anima, then Akira should be an absolute must see, that is, if you haven't experienced it already. However, please don't let a lack of interest in animation, or more appropriately, Japanese animation deter you from experiencing this film, as really, it is one of the most interesting, intelligent and accessible works of sci-fi cinema produced in the last twenty-five years. It is also incredibly influential, with its influence apparent in a number of subsequent great works of science fiction, including Shinya Tsukamoto's Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1988), and sequel Tetsuo II: Body Hammer (1992), Rintaro's Metropolis (2001), Spielberg's A.I, (2001) and Minority Report (2002), Takashi Miike's Dead or Alive: Final (2002), Michael Winterbottom's Code 46 (2003) and Wong Kar-Wai's misunderstood masterpiece 2046 (2004). Already twenty-years on from its original release, Akira remains a bold, interesting and unforgettable work of vibrant, visceral, intelligent science fiction cinema that deserves to be experienced."
"revenge_of_shinobi","10","0","2","28 July 2006"," Poifect
","Akira blew my mind when I first saw it on BBC2 in 1994 and i rate it as one of the best films I have ever seen. From the first scene with the motorcycles whizzing through a neon jungle with the tail lights leaving trails across the screen and with a cool tech-no soundtrack blaring as young kids try to beat, maim and kill each other, to the explosive and catastrophic end which delivers pounds and pounds above and beyond anything you could expect from a films conclusion, Akira is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>What you get in between is great humour, both slapstick and dialogue based, tension, horror and a sense of being dragged into a bizarre world in which you could easily become overwhelmed and confused if it weren't grounded by easy to relate to characters.<br/><br/>The cast is huge and the story never sticks with anyone too long to let them hog it, but we are given 2 main ones to follow and relate to. kaneda is a happy go lucky hero type, a leader, the type everyone likes and wants to be around. In the film he seems to take every situation with a pinch of salt and is entertaining till the very end. The true star for me though is Tetsuo who brings all the tension, horror and gore to the film. He plays a sort of outsider lackey who's jealousy of kaneda and resentment of society proves catastrophic for the whole of Tokyo as he discovers powers within himself and becomes a sort of demented twisted superman (red cape n all).<br/><br/>Throw in to the mix a pulsing sound track, great and grizzly animation, lots of odd and exaggerated characters: power hungry politicians, crazy doctors, soothsayers, prematurely aging kids, psychics and a whole lot of unruly biker school kids - and it seems too much for one film , but it's not, it all comes out about perfect, the story is on point all the way and the end satisfies all expectations with a suitably ambiguous and philosophical end."

It can never hurt to go back to the classics, and this is a classic. for nothing else, this movie would merit applause simply because of the quality of animation. I have never come across an anime with a better sense of movement! the way the character mounts his bike, or the way their bodies move, its all so fluid.

","I have to admit that when I first rented this movie out in 1990, I watched it about 5 times before I returned it. 5 times in 2 days. I'd love to say that it was because of the thoughtful characterisation or the deep and intriguing plot but I'd be lying. I watched it over an over again because I had never seen anything like it before.<br/><br/>I now own ""Akira"" on DVD and I sometimes catch myself scanning certain scenes frame-by-frame, just to see how they would have looked to the Japanese animators who built the story sketch-by-sketch. OK, you could do the same thing with ""Bambi"" if you wanted to, but ""Akira"" is no Disney cartoon.<br/><br/>Even when Bambi's mum got shot, you never got to see any blood in Disney cartoons. ""Akira"" has blood. ""Akira"" has violence. ""Akira"" is literally a moving sci-fi comic book. Today you could turn it into a live-action CGI-packed blockbuster, but in 1988 the only way to make a movie like ""Akira"" was with conventional animation. The resulting film is visually spectacular. <br/><br/>The Neo-Tokyo cityscapes in ""Akira"" have sometimes been compared to those of the ""Blade Runner"" version of Los Angeles. This is more due to the ""Blade Runner"" set designers basing their vision on Tokyo circa 1982 than the later movie copying ""Blade Runner"". Both movies take a dystopian view of the future, but the genetically-engineered nightmare of ""Akira"" has a uniquely Japanese perspective.<br/><br/>This means that it's not a movie for everyone. Mark Stephen Johnson, however, has watched ""Akira"" as many times as I have. In Johnson's 2003 live-action movie ""Daredevil"", there is a blatant copy of the sequence where Kaneda runs headlong at an advancing Clown gang member riding a motorcycle. Kaneda then jumps onto the front of the bike and kicks the Clown out of the saddle. DareDevil does exactly the same thing to Bullseye, shot-for shot in Johnson's movie. Who says cartoons aren't influential?"

This film based of the manga(comic-book) of the same name, has a great story, likable characters, and extra-ordinary situations, that show animation is a great way to show these things. From the motorcycle chase, to Tetsuo's rampage, the animation stays brilliant and the pace never lets down. The film is worth viewing at least once for those who have never seen anime before, or is an animation fan. The voice acting ranges however, depending on which version you watch. The Japanesse version is great through and through. The English dubs, although not as good, still great. A lot of people will argue that the Pionieer dub is worse than the original dub, but I disagree. I believe the Pionieer dub is much superior but the original isn't bad either.

","this, an animation, is as fully as any other work, a film... and it is among the greatest. it is both and at the same time a social critique and a visual and entertaining prediction and suspension of reality.<br/><br/>this film follows the oppressed life and times of one Tetsuo, the antihero of the film, and his friends, the foremost of whom is his best friend Kaneda (the leader of his bike gang - one directly opposed to the Clown gang). when Tetsuo is injured and as a result taken aboard the cause of a scientific research team interested in the fast-track evolution of humanity he finds himself in control of the power of a god.<br/><br/>and the power of god in the hands of a PEE~EED OFF teen is a bad, bad thing indeed. this film explores the possible futures of humanity: not the evolution, but the DEvolution of our society through the ages. Kaneda finds love through the initial impulses of teen hormones, Tetsuo finds peace through his pain, and a multitude of peripheral characters find peace through very energetic, very bloody death.<br/><br/>all in all, i rate akira as one of the greats. a film worth watching at any time of life, i see it now at the age of 21, the first person i heard of it from was 18, the next was 30. akira carries now the same impact as it did when it was first released, and i hope the shock and entertainment of it never fades."
"laviskrg","10","0","2","29 December 2005"," this is a brilliant movie, a Japanese work of art
","It would be futile to say that I loved Akira. The term ""love"" is far below what I felt when I first saw this magnificent Japanese manga. It happened when I was 8 years old. I had rented it, and the tape was black and white and in French. I knew a little French, but still... I rented that movie for two weeks, and during those 2 weeks, Akira was the only thing I watched. I watched it over and over, non stop, that means, I rewound it over and over again. What can I say, I became addicted to that movie. Now, I finally got it in English, and I have to say everything has enlightened. Akira is a very special film. Yes, it is full of blood, and yes, it may appeal mostly to gore addicts, but do not misunderstand. Akira is full of philosophy, drama and action. It is an excellent display of human emotion. However, it's depth will be observed and understood if the person watching knows how to relate to the facts and the characters, and also has patience to see the whole film and then mix it around in his head. This film is extremely appealing and it will intrigue you. The music is great, the rhythms and the occasional ""bangs"" will help you feel everything better. The characters are complex and do not be fooled by the similarity to regular teenagers. They are human beings capable of many deeds. Finally, this film excels as a Science-fiction thriller, and its story is not as far-fetched as it may seem at the beginning. I recommend this manga to all manga/anime fans, but also to anyone who wants to experience something between ""an already used idea"" and ""a unique film creation""."

","Akira, a film by director Katsuhiro Ôtomo, is classic Japanese Anime. This is truly a stand-out film that is very Japanese in nature - it is both ethereal in its story with a social commentary on the effects of nuclear weapons (this isn't surprising since Japan is the only country that suffered the effects of nuclear weapons in the form of the atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki). I would also want to mention that while this is a great film for adults, parents beware - this is definitely not a film for kids (there is both realistic gore and nudity as would be in live action films).

Its become a landmark in modern times.<br/><br/>There are many people who say this is the greatest anime ever made, and yet many who say it was terrible. Yet I can't officially say anything because I haven't seen every single animated movie/show to come out of Japan and I don't plan to. Though i can say with out a doubt this is better then most anime movies i've seen. First off the film isn't so bluntly..how would you say it...depressing! Most Jap Anime films are very melancholy and depressing. With smug environments and Drama thats wayyy over the top. This one doesn't. Sure there's that same ol' Japanese them of ""Lets bring destruction upon our country or for that matter the world."" But its not overdone to an extreme! The Animation is top notch for its time period, the music is wonderful and hell the voice acting on both the Jap and US versions aren't that bad. Though many Anime fans usually love the Jap voice acting better...usually i find it to childish and with not much emotion. Though I don't mind either version.<br/><br/>So hell if your a fan of Anime, or if you HATE anime! give this film a try. Check it out, buy it, rent it...whatever. Maybe you will come to love it as I did...or you'll hate it."

","Akira is one of the milestones in film-history. Its a dark vision of our techno-future and portrays the decadent society of neo-tokyo. It was the first animated movie that was so thrilling, so extravagant, so sublime in its animation that it became an unique movie experience. Although the end of the film is pushing it a bit too much it still remains a ""Gesamtkunstwerk"". It set the standard for all following anime and contains revolutionary CGI. Its a rough and raw movie with a lot of violence and disturbing images but the film doesn't exploit that. I still think that the motorbike-scene at the beginning is one of the most brilliant action scenes ever."

","Akira is one of the best animation films of all time. Wait, scratch that. Akira is one of the best FILMS of all time. This movie is the very definition of 'ahead of it's time'. Thought-provoking and at times even moving, Akira isn't one of those movies that you pop on with your girlfriend, or when the guys come over on movie night. It's visceral, it's unapologetic, and it's heavy man. Real heavy.<br/><br/>Many people find Akira hard to keep up with, and have to go back a second and third time to pick up all the finer plot details. My recommendation - read the graphic novels. The ending will make a lot more sense. Trying to compress Katsuhiro Otomo's seminal graphic novel into one film was an astounding feat, but I think the results are just this side of absolutely incredible. From the intricacies of Tetsuo and Kaneda's relationship, to the fast-paced action of the street-bike sequence, to the astounding, disturbing finale in which the film lives up to it's tag-line, this movie never loses your attention. There are no 'boring parts'. <br/><br/>A lot of my friends dismiss anime as 'just a cartoon'. I show them this movie. <br/><br/>They usually never say that again."

","I'd heard about Akira for a number of years but had never felt particularly compelled to watch it. Yet after stumbling around the music store and finding nothing of any real interest i fought what the hell and decided to buy the two disc DVD set the first disc been the original re-dubbed version and the second the newly digitally enhanced version. I have to be honest the first time i watched i was somewhat confused and wondering if spending £17.99 had really been worth it. Sorry to bring up my consumer history but the point iam trying to make is that one must really be patient when watching Akira. Some people (disneyites and airheads) will probably tire quickly of its somewhat elaborate plot and grisly beginnings. But if one watches this film with an open mind then you should come to appreciate just how good of this movie this is. I really only came to realise this fact after watching it for a second time and started truly appreciating not only a visually stunning movie but one with a gripping storyline and some excellent characters. I've decided not to go into the storyline namely cause i don't want to ruin it and every other review on this website seems to tell you anyway. The point Iam trying to make is to not be put off if you don't feel yourself initially warming to this film because if you stick with it you'll come to realise like i did that this film is a masterpiece and deserves to be talked about in the same breath as films like the Matrix etc. For gods sakes my 16 year old sister who loves Disney films and pap like Bring it On thought it was cool if a bit odd. Don't be put off Akira rules!!!! One other thing watch the digitally enhanced version the animation is far superior plus the English re-dubbing is miles better"

","Never has a more complex plot and storyline been used in making an animated film. Akira is a mind-boggling work of art, and is without a doubt the greatest anime film ever created. Writer and director Katsuhiro Otomo was decades ahead of his time when he created this film and had made an incredible impact in the traditional ways of anime. This film has been critically acclaimed across the planet for its highly detailed animation and creative storyline. Before Akira, anime was regarded as sub-genre in the United States. Most anime films had nothing but cheap dialogue, gratuitous sex, and choppy animation that would give you a seizure. But Akira came along and completely set new standard in anime due to its sophistication. It is among my all-time favorite movies and deserves nothing less than a standing ovation."

","In between The Terminator (1984) and T2 (1991) and some 11 years preceding The Matrix; this movie was a groundbreaking feat which should be congratulated for it's light year vision. The cinematography blends Blade Runner-esque wide shots of a thriving neon lit future city with some themes of urban degradation and violence that can be compared to the likes of such movies as Menace 2 Society; The Lost Boys or; more unusually; The Running Man. Why this movie appeals to typical anime conventionalist's is because of it's inspiration from the mix of Samurai and John Ford Westerns of the 50's and 60's in terms of violence and black humour and compelling; claustrophobic music score. Look at more recent but fundamentally similar movies such as Battle Royale (1 for it is far superior than requiem) The Matrix anime project. Akira Kurosawa; Kinji Fukasaku; Sergio Leone; Martin Scorcese; Tarantino; Oliver Stone. Controversy should go hand in hand with these major players throughout the history of movies; but akira is not controversial. The violence may be graphic but should it is perpetrated by very young antagonists and protagonists who realize their worth in a world (which we should gratefully never have to experience) and their own attempts to survive in the more harsher reality. That'll do for now."

"diversitycommittee","8","0","2","2 September 2004"," When Anime goes right
","In general, I dislike Anime. I think most of it is godawful formulaic crap full of horrendous clichés. But it has it's strengths, and a good director knows what they are and knows how to use them. Akira knows what the strengths of Anime are and uses them. <br/><br/>Visually, it's about as good as it gets. Neo-Tokyo is brought to life with detail that would make any sci-fi fan giddy. You enjoy watching the sprawling megalopolis come to life in the bike sequences and the riots and protests throughout. The long sequence at the end is beyond description. All that should be said is that it couldn't be made without animation. Any Hollywood attempt to pull the sequence off would be computer generated and tacky. It could only be made by hand drawn animation, and it's proven to be a formidable format.<br/><br/>Throughout the whole movie this amazing drum music plays in the best parts. I'm not sure what it is, I imagine it's Japanese, but I'm not sure. Whatever it is, it complements the on screen action perfectly. The director knows when to put what music where, and does it. <br/><br/>The entire movie is able to give you an extreme sense of unease and fear. It isn't fear in the horror movie sense of the word, or in the David Lynch surreal sense, but just a fear of the world you're being shown. It's a scary place, and Akira conveys it perfectly. <br/><br/>The characters aren't well developed. Any anybody who tries to tell you otherwise doesn't know real character development. But that's not what the movie is going for. The movie is showing you characters that are as well developed as they need to be. They are well animated enough to seem realistic and do what you would expect them to do in their situation. You don't need to feel for any of the characters. The movie doesn't need them to be interesting people. But for what they are, they are extremely believable and effective.<br/><br/>The movie is deep beyond a normal science fiction story. No, it won't question yourself most likely, or your relationship with others. But it will haunt you for a very long time, and it richly deserves it. There are better movies out there, but there's always a better movie. I recommend this to anybody, but especially someone interested in the strengths of animation. This movie is the embodiment of what can go right in animation."
"grafik-3","Null","0","2","1 September 2004"," Ninth wonder of the wrold
","Akira was THE FIRST Japanese animated movie (and to date one of only 3) to be made for and reach, the art-house movie theaters of Europe and America. At a consistent 26 frames per second, with no cheating (panning and zooming on static artwork) it's still the only one to do so. Akira, like most ""anime"" of the time had a storyline borrowed in part from the Novel: ""Neuromancer"" and from the Japanese experience with American nuclear ""weapons"". Most Anime features (such as ""Laputa - Island in the sky"") have some reference to annihilation by thermonuclear holocaust. In Akira, the agency of Neo-Tokyo's second destruction ( the first being WW3) is 11 year old AKIRA, a boy with magical powers. Years later, in the ruins of the Megacity (mainly culled from 2000AD's Judge Dredd series) known as Neo-Tokyo, young Tetsuo Shima finds himself the focal point of a re-activation of a nebulous, nefarious scheme involving PSI-abilities.<br/><br/>AKIRA was originally as an 8 book series. The movie explains -SOME- plot points of books one through four. And does a good job to boot. But no 2 hour(plus) movie could encapsulate the whole story. And it is a story - not a saga. Events in both Akira the movie and Akira the book, move at an extreme pace. Multiple characters have simultaneous events that affect the storyline along a fractured, dangerous fault-line. <br/><br/>What impresses most about this movie is not, the violence - which directors like Paul Verhoeven have mirrored in the mainstream, nor the breathtaking action. What made myself and my friends pay attention to this piece of celluloid, was the ability of this filmcrew to let a story develop, beyond the bounds of belief, and revel in it. We had not seen this before. Seldom have we seen it since.<br/><br/>To answer the question: why is it the ninth wonder of the world?<br/><br/>Akira was one of the last animated movies to be scripted, drawn and coloured by hand.<br/><br/>Now look at your hand."

","Akira really ventures into a realm more then just sci-fi. I think it's a stand alone story. I think it really shows you something you can only find in that group. someone spoke of the fact they couldn't identify with the protagonist. I think this movie(and especially the manga) really bend the rules for this. It's not your typical beat'em up batman bad guy movie(most American flicks) The protagonist isn't really a protagonist he's a hopped up pill popping biker. If you can relate to this type of person, you're probably in jail, right ;). I felt like it was giving me a look into the dark. A look into people that live on the edge, with a variety of personalities, and what really happens when someone with no power is suddenly given too much.<br/><br/>The movie did have holes. I had no choice but to read the manga to fill them. When you compare the movie to the manga, the manga is much deeper and you really understand. You understand more about the rivalries between the bike gangs. More about who the people really are(the test subjects).<br/><br/>Overall I think I give Akira an 8.5 out of 10.<br/><br/>Pros: Stellar animation, Fast bikes and bad attitudes, a antagonist you have no choice but to like.<br/><br/>Cons: Tries to cram too much info into the allotted time, poor translation in some scenes, not enough biker smashing action"

","Akira is one of those films that EVERYONE should see.<br/><br/>If any movie has ever deserved a ""5 star rating"", 10 out of 10, then this is the one.<br/><br/> From the stark musical score of the opening frames, till the final names in the credits disappear from view, I was hooked.<br/><br/>The movie is a portrait of friendship and love, as well as having some kick ass action scenes, and the obligatory romantic story doesn't feel as though it was merely tacked on, like many other films I could mention.<br/><br/>On the issue of ""the rape scene"" and the gore, they have both been blown out of proportion. Neither is as graphic as I expected (it only just scrapes the definition of rape, and she's topless for less than 10 seconds), but I will accept that under 15's should probably be kept away from the household copy of ""Akira"".<br/><br/>The two leads, Kaneda and Tetsuo, are such wonderful stereotypes of the genre while still remaining unique to themselves. And our trusty heroine, Kay, is a sturdy, resourceful, independent woman, who will do her all for something she believes in. This too sounds like a stereotype, but she is much more than that. Even Kaneda and Tetsuo's gang are depicted as real people, rather than the standard kinds of chaps we see in most stock Japanese animation.<br/><br/>The movie is a sad tale of boys in world that does not allow them to grow or express themselves in any way. Our two heroes drift apart, one able to overcome the obstacles, the other spirals down, unable to cope with the power and responsibilities in his life.<br/><br/>A true classic."

It reminded me that you don't need CG special effects for great sci-fi, you need artistry and vision. I didn't know what to expect from Akira, but the film totally blew me away.

This movie is not only aesthetic delight but a work that provokes me to think in a different way, a way expressing the meaning of life in a wholly new but still right way. I really started seeing that human possesses all the energy inside and all he has to do is to find the right, the truthful way of using it. All you have to do is make a choice, when ready, and follow it. I do think AKIRA is a work of art that shows the beginning of a new era..something that can create and destroy... something that possesses the energy of the ""new world""... though we are far from it we see it coming to life... we watch (but not all of us see) the changing of the world!"

","The first ever anime I ever hired out and watched..and it blew my mind in a way I can't describe. I have since read the Manga of Akira (and most of Otomo's other work) and am still amazed at the awe inspiring effort that went into his masterpiece.(especialy since he hadn't drawn more than fifty pages of sequential work in his career beforehand) The film, despite being the highest budget animated film of the eighties was just mindboggling, and also one of the pioneers of digital elements incorporated into traditional animation.. Unfortunately for my apreciation of anime, I saw the best first, and everything else pales in comparison.   ...sigh.. Also, the soundtrack is Magnificent, with a subtle but noticable influence from the BladeRunner soundtrack(Which also rocks).. This equals about one hundredth of my total rant about Akira, My favourite Anime ever.     KANEDAAAAA!!!!!"

"dirtychild","Null","0","4","30 January 2004"," Wildly slick and original ride
","Akira is an anime classic.  The plot revolves around a bunch of motor-riding punks who accidentally get caught up in a Japanese military / government experiment.  Tetsuo, a gang member, is subjected to various scientific tests where he develops a latent psychic ability.  When he is unable to handle the new found powers - he takes it out on the world. I've been a big fan of this film since it's release in the 80s.  It brought a new darker, more adult orientated wave of animation to an unsuspecting audience. The film's animation is still astonishing - it was the first Japanese anime to use the Western process of recording the actors before developing the animation - and it shows.  It looks more realistic and gritty - less cheesy than other anime contemporaries. The plot and character development for an anime film is second to none - it doesn't hold up and isn't compromising for audiences who don't pay attention. The new English ""re-dub"" is much more recommended than the original - it actually makes the ending less complicated and cryptic. A wildly slick and original ride for those who are into futuristic sci-fi films."

"Tim_Lamballais","8","0","2","27 October 2003"," one of my favorite animated movies
","Perhaps one of the flag-bearers for the anime genre, even this classification does not do this movie justice. This movie has a lot more merits than most anime films (and I've seen many), one of the biggest being the fact it was made in 1988. This movie portrays the struggle of a group of young punks in the slums and the anonymous massiveness of future Tokyo. As far as content goes, this movie does a great job of pointing out various social issues in that typical nihilistic Japanese/Anime view, and it features an (at that time) relatively story with some of the best written characters I've seen in animated movies so far. The animation is extremely well done, the makers did not shy away from being bloody to get a point across, and they succeed very well in creating a unique atmosphere.<br/><br/>
To summarize, this is a great movie with a good storyline, good character development and perfect execution.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Before I give out the information about dubbings and such,I'll get to my brief review.Akira is based on the manga series which lasted from 1983 to 1993 therefore the ending to the movie is different from the manga ending.I think both endings are good,but the movie does leave a lot of unanswered questions.The story is detailed,but comprehensive,the characters are good,and it's visually awesome.<br/><br/>Now to the subs and dubs.Most likely the people who don't like this movie probably saw it in the original 1988 dub,which isn't very good.The 2001 dub is far more accurate,but if you want to see Akira at it's best you should watch it with subtitles unless you speak Japanese,then there is no need for them.Akira gets 9/10."

If there was ever a movie that earned it's place in the hallowed halls of SF perfection, this would be ahead of Star Wars. The film is far from flawless, though, even people who have read the entire foundation series from Asimov would still get confused at the ending, and someone who got sucked into the first watching would rub the tape clear at the last 15 minutes. Nevertheless, it is still a masterpiece and should be held as such.

Back then though everything was just a cartoon and who drew it really didn't matter.  Anyways, I rented Akira because I have heard a lot about it. I rented it and was pleasently surprised.  I thought that while it was one of those films that was heavily influenced by the style of Blade Runner, the story itself was different and it had a great visual style.  I think the action was excellent (for a cartoon) and the scenes were really memorable. I can't say that I would rent more anime movies because of it, but I'm definetly more open to the idea that cartoons can be entertaining to adults. Rent it if you are interested in sci-fi/action or want to see something we a great ""look"" to it.  <br/><br/>

"flanger216","10","0","2","9 June 2003"," Essential Anime
","Akira is the epitome of anime:  uber-violent, complicated, and, especially for us western viewers, cryptic and difficult to decipher.  Of course, it also features an end-all, kick-in-the-head, apocalyptic ending from hell that should remain with you for quite a while.  To put it in terms of American movies, Akira is essentially an ultra-violent Blade Runner ingrained with heavily Japanese subtexts (search for identity, suffocation from the urban sprawl, fascism, atomic destruction) and with some 2001-tinged metaphysics thrown in at the end for good measure (and to confuse most viewers even more).  It's all too sprawling and unfocused to be real a classic, but Akira still remains as one of the most, albeit sporadically, impactful sci-fi/action movies ever made.  It also set the mold for just about every sci-fi anime made since, though it would be 13 years before Rin's ""Metropolis"" (2001) came along and finally turned the disparate elements of sci-fi anime into a truly excellent movie."
"ergo2497","10","0","2","21 May 2003"," Deservedly a classic
","This film is unquestionably one of the best anime films (if not films in general) I have ever seen.  The variety and richness of plot, incredible animation and imagery and the sheer mind-blowing total when it all comes together make it amazing.<br/><br/>As far as comparisons go, I don't think contrasting it with other anime does it justice.  Undoubtedly, the movie shares many similarities with Princess Mononoke (the endings have an incredibly similar feel), it is sci-fi, and not fantasy as Mononoke is, and feels much deeper.<br/><br/>Instead, I'd compare it to films like Terry Gilliam's Brazil, A Clockwork Orange, and other films as such.<br/><br/>Perhaps the one thing that marred my interest in the film was the music. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I dislike ethnic music (in fact, if I was merely listening to the music I'd enjoy it) but more that the music seemed, at many points, jarringly dissonant from the action onscreen.  This is perhaps best evidenced in one of the earlier scenes when Kaneda's proud, thumping theme is played as ultraviolence occurs.<br/><br/>In addition, the beginning of the movie is incredibly difficult to follow the first-time out, and if you don't watch carefully the movie will quickly become incomprehensible.  However, by the ending, the elements come together, things become clear, the music finally gains some relevance and it all adds up.<br/><br/>I left this movie totally stunned and blown out of my head.

","Akira is one of the films that bridged the gap between East and West. Visually stunning and written with the flair and style we have come to associate with Manga, years before many Westerners knew what Manga was; Akira was a turning point in Anime for many people.<br/><br/>It is centred around two boyhood friends, Kaneda and Tetsuo, during the aftermath of a bike accident Tetsuo is involved in. He goes on to be altered by the Government trying to create a super-being. Years before, they had attempted the same thing and destroyed Tokyo. As Tetuo begins to change and become stronger than Kaneda, the roles they have had since childhood become reversed. As this happens, Tetuo is losing control as his power becoes greater. With the arrival of Tetsuo, the end of the world is prophesised and the return of Akira (The name given to the super-being that destroyed Tokyo) is said to be at hand.<br/><br/>The plotline is deep and involving, as the characters grow - both up and apart - as their lives diverge. This has resonance with the age they are at; late teens, no longer kids and not yet willing to be adults, making and breaking the friendships they will keep or not.<br/><br/>Akira is a serious film about many aspects of life in Japan - both the rise of the cyberpunk and the survival of tradional values.<br/><br/>As a film, it is absolutely fantastic, and as a social commentary, it provokes thoughts.<br/><br/>Don't ignore this simply because it's animation. Give it the respect it deserves, dedicate some time to it and you'll be amazed at what you find.<br/><br/>10/10 - no questions"

But what about something flawed at times, but yet so transcendently glorious at other moments that it seems to deserve the 10 as well. If a case can be made for the later (and I do think it can) then the extant corpus of Catullus and AKIRA certainly fall into that category.<br/><br/>This movie was often breathtakingly brilliant and beautiful. It also portrayed it's themes in a sort of muddled vague sense..go figure. At first I thought meaning was lost in the translation. But look at a film like mononoke. Nothing lost there. Anyhow.

","After years of being peripherally aware of this thing called ""Japanimation"", I decided to sample the genre. I thought ""Akira"" would be the place to start: I'd always heard the 1988 film is a landmark, and a model for many Japanimation movies to come. As an outsider, it took me a while to adjust to the animation style. This stuff hasn't the fluidity of great classic animation, it's worlds away from Snow White.  But there is a visual style, and a depth of background detail, and an often grotesque imagination, that provides some truly stunning moments. It's too long, overall, and although I've read many complaints that the film is confusing, I find it overly simple. I believe the ""confusion"" comes from trying to find meaning in long scenes that, while allowing for wild visual flights, do nothing more for the story than stretch simple plot points beyond their natural endurance levels.  Still, a worthwhile cinematic experience, and a great introduction to a genre unlike any other."
"HPeep","10","0","1","19 January 2003"," Tetsuooooooo! The most depth-charged film ever created.
","In Walt Disney's groundbreaking Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, the villain is an evil sorceress and the heroes are seven `funny' dwarves and a beautiful woman who sings to cute animals while sitting under a tree. In Katsuhiro Ôtomo's groundbreaking AKIRA, the villain is a corrupt government and the heroes are `terrorist' revolutionaries and amphetamine-addicted biker gangs who hit rival gang members in the head with ratchets at 140 km/h. Sound different Disney lovers? Well it is. It is very different.<br/><br/>
This ultra-violent and dark vision was brought to life in 1988 by creative genius Katsuhiro Ôtomo. It was the most expensive Japanese film at that time and it became the all-time anime classic. The only film ever made that truly defines its genre.<br/><br/>
The story of the film is as follows: In post-apocalyptic Neo-Tokyo, a biker gang member named Tetsuo has mysterious powers ""awakened"" inside of him and goes out to find Akira, the one who gave him his power.<br/><br/>
Not as simple and straightforward as you think (or wish). Many filmgoers complain that AKIRA makes no sense and never goes anywhere. Here is what I have to say to them, ""Read the manga.' The manga is over 2,000 pages long while the movie clocks in without end credits at 122 minutes. And if you watch it several times it actually makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>
The most mind-blowing aspect of the film is it's ""organic"" music. Recorded before a frame of animation was finished, the music sounds absolutely stunning and fits the images on screen almost perfectly.<br/><br/>
Another stunner is the animation. The only CG used is in the comparison of Akira and Tetsuo's power (the glowing hologram). The cel animation looks unbelievably realistic even today and the introduction of Kaneda's gang is a real eye-opener.<br/><br/>
Warner Bros. is apparently trying to remake the film as an animated movie. Let's hope they fail, because the only time this movie should have been ""upgraded"" was in 2001 when Pioneer released their great remastered edition.<br/><br/>
With it's ultra-violent kinetic real-time action, mind-blowing visual designs, and complex story, AKIRA made my top 150 list at number 4. If you want it, get Pioneer's 2-disc SE and DTS disc. And yeah, I got the story.<br/><br/>

The only part I didn't understand is the end, when Tetsuo enters another dimension and meets Akira (I think...). I wished it would continue a little longer so the story resolves clearer.<br/><br/>Some parts are just Dragonball Z, which I didn't totally enjoy, but other than that, it's meant to move you, not just make you sit there for 2 hours.

"Whetzell","10","0","3","13 November 2002"," An amazing film somehow dubbed as over-hyped when it is clearly under-rated
","Akira is a tremendous achievement.  Some anime purist may say it is over-rated but they are used to the traditional anime full of non-stop, violent action.  These fans of traditional anime were bored by this film. This is a movie for serious film watchers, not for those who enjoy only anime.  I have only enjoyed maybe a half dozen anime films and this is at the top of the list.  Another thing that people may be critical about is the English dub that is of course no fault to the Japanese filmmakers themselves.  There is a new dub now, yet any true fan of cinema or any person who respects the directors work, will watch a foreign film with subtitles.  The movie is seen as complicated and hard to understand by some, whom I believe have a short attention span and never really gave the film a chance.  These people in turn call the movie boring and over-hyped, this is because people call this the `Matrix Animated' or something silly like that. The story is more complicated than Matrix, since the Matrix is complete spoon-fed, cliché, fortune cookie philosophy.  If you think The Matrix was original read a Philip K. Dick book and you will see it has all been done better, and 60 years earlier.  The other opinion on Akira is that it is stupid, it ideas are bland, and it is way too easy to understand.  This is an obvious attempt from pompous above-it-alls to show how smart they are and how the film couldn't possibly do anything for them, because the thoughts have already existed in their heads.  Compensation, truth is neither of them understood it.  It is not difficult and it doesn't hide anything from the audience, but it does take multiple viewings, but the first audience is too bored and the second too arrogant and frustrated to be open for another try. I do get upset when directors purposefully try and hide things from their audiences as a David Lynch does in his latest movies, his earlier films told a much clearer concise narrative, which made for better storytelling. This film is only complicated in that it does not spoon-feed, much like other films of the 80s.  However since this is sci-fi you would expect an explanation, there is none given.  I am happy for this because it makes it real, you watch the film as a spectator and you have to deduct what you are seeing.  This film has a brilliant story, marvelous artwork and animation, and it is powerful.  It is all a matter of taste I suppose, but I believe most of the critic of this film are reactionaries or ignorant. 10/10"

","Pros: Animation, score, directing.<br/><br/>Cons: Storyling gets very confusing at times, need to have an understanding of japanese culture to get this.<br/><br/>The film Akira centers around a motocycle gang and the Government. The setting is Neo-Tokyo which is an urban hellhole where rival biker gangs race the streets seeking and causing destructions. Our hero Kaneda, who is also the leader of the bike gang, is out with his buddies where he meets up with a rival gang called the clowns and they have a little gang war. While this is happening, there is a strange man and equally strange kid walking around a student riot. The story is confusing to tell because there is a lot of subplots going on. Akira, as the title is called is apparantly a boy who has this energy capable of explaining the universe. The film boasts better animation than Disney has even till today and is sometimes shockingly but refreshingly violet. My quibble with this film is that the last 30 minutes are about as wierd as anything out there. I am no expert at mangas but how come everyone i  watch always has to have some giant blob reeking havoc (Mononoke, Metropolis, e.t.c). This film has been called a classic by many and watching the animation u can see why, but the story is one big overbundled mess that tries to get philosophical. Not better than The Fist Of The North Star or any of the Dragon ball series in my opinion but quite good<br/><br/>Premise: A Biker gang leader and his girlfriend tries to stop a manical super-human with the help of three superhumans.<br/><br/>Akira won a Screen Scream Award at the Amsterdam Film festival<br/><br/>Grade: 7.2/10 (Good but not my cup of tea)."

The visual revamp take years off it and it looks as fresh as ever.<br/><br/>I sometimes wonder where it could all lead. What would have happened if Hollywood had dramatised it (After the success of LOTR, Sony may reconsider) or if (and this is my personal wish), a studio could animate a serial of otomos original mangas.

","I'm going to be honest. I only saw Akira because I heard it was the inspiration to one of my favorite video games, Final Fantasy VII. My experience with Anime movies was bad to say the least, so I didn't expect Akira to be any good. I was blown away.<br/><br/>I was at the edge of my seat from the beginning. This movie was an 80s Matrix. You have to pay attention in order to get it. There are scenes where reading between the lines is required.<br/><br/>Now, the acting. Unless the leads were shouting ""TETSUOOOOOOO!"" or ""KANEDAAAAAAA!"", the acting was well done and very believable.<br/><br/>Now, there is a scene where some girl's shirt is ripped off, exposing her entire upper body. THAT DOES NOT MAKE THIS MOVIE HENTAI, but it does give it an R-Rating (as well as some mild language and someone having a graphic hallucination that his guts were spilling to the floor, but I digress).<br/><br/>If you were disappointed by bad Anime (which seems to be the ONLY Anime they send us) like I was, give this movie a chance, and I swear that you will not be disappointed. If you like Final Fantasy VII, watch this movie. I swear to you as well, that you will not be disappointed. If you like movies that make you think and force you to pay attention, I got one word for ya: Akira. Finally, if you simply want to gawk at the shouts of ""TETSUOOOOOO!"" watch this movie for that, and believe me, you will enjoy it."

","Astonishing, breathtaking, prophetic.

","I didn't think it was possible, but this movie really is more hyped and exalted than Shrek.  Now, I will be the first to admit that the Japanese are more intelligent (on the whole.) than Americans are. They have a strong work ethic and are logical, scientific thinkers who are better educated, and for some reason the adults in their society actually <value> education, unlike Americans.  If you don't believe me, go into any American chatroom and comment on how it seems that very few people know how to string a sentence together or even use their own, English language properly, and just see how harshly you get flamed.  Tell them how much the school systems have obviously deteriorated, to the point where most kids who leave high school these days can barely communicate if they have to do it through writing. And just watch as everyone in that chatroom gets angry with you and tries to rationalize, explain, excuse, etc- the poor usage of their language - and they will all tell you how idiotic you are to suggest that people ought to be able to read and write proficiently.  Because they just don't realize that other countries <laugh> at the United States and think most of us are fat, ignorant and uneducated.  And the sad thing is, they're basically correct.<br/><br/>***Given this, it stands to reason that Japanese animation is a lot more complicated and intricate than the animated films produced by the United States.  And herein lies the problem (I think.):  A movie like Akira is just TOO difficult to understand.  All you have to do is read the Plot Summary: ""A secret military project endangers Neo-Tokyo when it turns a biker gang member into a rampaging psionic psychopath that only two kids and a group of psionics can stop.""  And you're already lost.  And it only gets worse when you watch the movie.  The plot is just tangled and confusing, and it is really, really long.  The animation is beautiful, but that grace does nothing to help explain the movie or answer all the questions that come up in the viewer's mind.. And that is why Akira will never be as popular as any Disney movie.  It's just too confusing... you have to be an Anime buff, or Japanese, to understand it.  So this select offshoot of society (These Anime buffs.) will tell you how wonderful it is, how it's the best animated movie in the world- how it changed their lives, etc.  So people read these accolades and rent the movie, and they're totally lost and bored and disappointed by it - So it's the Shrek Effect, just translated into Anime. What people need to say is that you have to have a real grasp for anime and understand how the stories are told, and be able to follow eleventeen different plots and characterizations at once, if you want to really enjoy this movie.  Just like you need to be pretty immature and find bodily emissions and other childish things funny and not be bothered by stiff-faced CGI if you're going to enjoy Shrek.  Both films are very similar in that they have these certain ""prerequisites."".... ""Akira"" I could take or leave. I would score it 9 in Japan, but 3 here in the US, because it will be a confusing letdown to most people."
"quinlan_vos","9","0","1","30 July 2002"," Classic
","I first saw 'Akira' a little over ten years ago.  Like many others, it was my first exposure to Japanese animation (not counting television series like Robotech and Speed Racer).  Over the years, my perception of this film has changed.  What I once saw as simply a quirky yet elegantly ""animated film"" is now a classic in the genre of science fiction.  The film has aged very well.  I sometimes have to remind myself that it is almost 15 years old! <br/><br/>
In my opinion this film deserves to be mentioned in the same breath along with other genre masterpieces like '2001: A Space Odyssey,' 'Blade Runner,' and 'Brazil.'  Definitely not for all tastes, but I urge those looking for something off the beaten path to give it a try."
"Luke-Walker","10","0","1","30 July 2002"," Information Overload...
","The first 15 minutes of Akira is a beutiful example of one of the main themes of the film. Information overload. Every single plot of the film is thrown into the mix with amazingly chaotic and hectic results which are absolutely spellbinding to look at. The film always captivates its audience, they never want to look away.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is because of the beautiful animation, or the original story. Essentially the film isn't perfect. The plot is rather complex, with so many characters and stories running around, it doesn't allow enough time to flesh out all the characters. And the story, while deep and interesting, doesn't really touch on all the issues as much as it should, leaving the film with a few loose ends. But then again one can't help but feel that this is intentional, as the fundamental theme of the film is information overload. The tag line says that Neo Tokyo is about to E.X.P.L.O.D.E. and one believes that!<br/><br/>It is by no means one of the greatest movies, but it is a great movie, and one of the best manga's out there. This film deserved to do well because of the obvious effort that went into its production, and that it opened up Anime to us westerners, and we couldn't be happier for it. We needed Akira. Without it there would be far less anime available to us today you can gaurantee it."

"dustinjhogan","Null","0","1","26 May 2002"," Epic work of detailed cinematic art @ many frames per second.
","I'll start out with this anime rant.<br/><br/>Most anime I've ever seen suffer from being overly stylized, corny, cheesy, melodramatic, and/or being in detail/fluidity.  A few common flaws are the overly dramatic ""freeze frame moments"" and painfully common instances where the character shape, height, weight, and surroundings change inexplicably from scene to scene.  Very amateur.  Most anime you see in the U.S. is junk(ie: Zoids, Pokemon, Sailor Moon, Dragonball (Z and otherwise), Gundam Wing).<br/><br/>AKIRA suffers from none of this.  It stands up to the very best anime produced even today, almost 15 years later.  This was not achieved through technology or any other shortcut.  This was achieved through hard work. Painstaking concentration on detail kept the level of detail, character design, and surroundings seamless.  The level of detail is every bit as high during the mundane or dialogue scenes as it is during moments of high action.<br/><br/>THE EMOTIONS of the characters are conveyed very well through their facial expressions.  This was incredibly well drawn.<br/><br/>THE STORY could be called sort of a sci-fi take on Stephen King's ""Carrie"". Look at the synopsis or other reviews to see what I mean.  It could easily have fallen into something typical, but it focused on the characters and their emotions and developments as human beings, never becoming corny or overly sentimental.  Oh, and none of those stupid toony moments either."

","Akira is a masterpiece, classic anime which has not been bettered since its release way back in '88 - incredible that its all hand-drawn.<br/><br/>The film is based on the 2000 word novel and does a pretty good job of condensing the plot into the 2 hour running time, although you may have a job understanding if you are not familiar with Manga anime's or your old (like my grandparents - they didn't have a clue! Bless 'em.).<br/><br/>The plot - Akira is a very powerful being, who blew up Tokyo through his sheer energy, afterwards the government dismembered his body and began to run tests on Akira and other test subjects - looking to use this energy for their weapons and machines. <br/><br/>Some 30 years later Tokyo has been rebuilt and is now known as Neo-Tokyo, Kaneda and Tetsuo are two friends who have known each other since childhood now they are members of a bike gang who frequently fight with their rival gang - 'The Clowns'. On one such occasion Tetsuo is injured in a head-on collision with Takashi - one of the test subjects (number 26 - who appears over-aged due to all the drugs the government use to suppress the power that has been given to him). The government agents take Tetsuo away to use him as a test subject, after which he escapes only to become over-powered with the sheer energy that he now possesses. <br/><br/>I have seen both the dubbed version and the special edition subtitled version which included a 'making of...' feature - the time that was taken to create this anime and the amount of people that were needed is astonishing (see the full cast and you get the idea). <br/><br/>The result - one of the most realistic, graphic and beautiful animes ever produced - you forget that you are watching a cartoon and are just engulfed into the whole story.<br/><br/>The greatest manga film period.

Many films have a good basis, but are held back by the special effects of the day.  Akira has the ideas and foundations, and due to the animation it can achieve it's full potential and does.  With no characters who are fully good or fully bad, it is easy to relate and understand to each situation, whether we have experienced them ourselves or not.  The pure idea of Akira is powerful enough, but to create the film with such an impact as this has is one hell of a task and one that should be credited fully.  This film is abosolutely flawless.

","Apparently, many people already had much to say about ""Akira""-- and with good reason.  The animation for this movie (and mind you, it was made in the mid-1980s) surpasses any animation done in America, and frankly puts the ever-increasing trend toward computer-drawn imaging TO ABSOLUTE SHAME.<br/><br/>Also-- and this is a big ALSO-- like most anime which have followed it, this movie is not for the kiddies.  Characters are routinely beaten and/or shot, with many gallons of blood and entrails thrown liberally around.  But if you are already a hardcore anime fan, then you already know this is par for the course.  It IS what makes Japanese anime so very different (and, indeed, superior) to American cartoons.<br/><br/>And, on a tangent-- and a bit of a rant-- despite the adult nature of most anime, Japanese kids usually watch them on a regular basis and seem to emerge well-adjusted.  Go figure; we Americans apparently can't even let our kids watch the simplistic stylings of ""Beavis and Butthead"" for fear they will set each other on fire-- imagine if they tried to copy the semi-realistic fighting moves they saw in something akin to ""Fist of the North Star""<br/><br/>For those of you who enjoy anime, and have seen ""Akira"", the best advice I could ever suggest is to go watch it again, for the same reason I will give those who have never seen the movie: The first time you watch ""Akira"", watch it for the purely wonderful assault it puts on your senses as you begin to experience the world of Neo-Tokyo. The second time you watch ""Akira"", watch it in order to better understand the rich and complex story BEHIND the movie, which you most likely missed while drooling over the incredible artwork."

Speaking of records, the soundtrack is, for lack of a better word, INCREDIBLE.<br/><br/>However, it's extremely violent. Not as violent as, say, ""Legend Of The Overfiend"", but more violent than ""Pokemon"" (no, I take that back).<br/><br/>Of course, much of the anime films released today mirror on this picture, but it will always be a groundbreaking film because of the way it was presented.

","The movie takes place in the near future, where Tokyo is in a state of insurrection, decay and confusion. In the middle of all this, we meet Kanada and his biker gang. In the background, we meet the government. They are trying to recreate an entity of pure knowledge, the title's Akira. Some strange, psychic beings are forced to help the government in this, or so it appears. Hell is unleashed when one of Kanada's gangers, the young, insecure Tetsuo, collides with one of the aforementioned psychic beings.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot on its heart, from social commentary (and occasionally satire) to the danger of testing limits. Actually, the movie benefits from being seen some times, since you'll probably have more than enough to do trying to follow the plotline the first time, and since the deeper, double meanings of the movie. Especially if you have the English dubbed version, which contains some horrible voice acting. But, that's a minor nuisance, since the backgrounds, the characters, everything is b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l-l-y animated, running at 30(!) frames per second, hence making some Disney movies look like stuttering low-budget scrap. And Disney's movies are scrap compared to this.<br/><br/>The movie's music is a worth the movie in itself. The publishers haven't remixed/remade the music as they have in other manga titles, keeping the dark, doomsday-like atmosphere the music creates. Even in it's happier moments, the music is enough to make you feel that something terrible is imminent.<br/><br/>I particularly like the movie, with it's deep plot, it's many-faceted meanings, it's art, it's music -- this movie is for the casual manga/animation fan (the art), and for the movie lover (the plot/music) and for the true manga-maniac (all of the aforementioned). However, the ending of the movie is a little bit strange, and will confuse some not accustomed to manga. For me, the ending is not a problem, but some may be disappointed.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is a must-see for anyone interested in animation, and for any film-lover with an open mind to animation.

","A cinematic experience of the highest order, AKIRA is in my opinion the finest and most detailed movie of any category. Composed of an intriguing and deliciously complex storyline carried by incredible visuals and a riveting soundtrack, watching AKIRA is like passing your consciousness though a megawatt sensory amplifier. A monolith of chaos and demonization, the movie is significatly intensified by a highly unsettling quality and an indescribable, apocalyptic-psychotic climax that threatens to push the already sadistic violence into the NC-17 category. It's very easy to get lost in this berserk supernatural nightmare, and find oneself immersed within an unnerving vision of hyper-reality that is experiencing to say the least.

That aside, once the initial wonderment at the detail and quality of the drawing wore off, I was confronted with an incredibly engaging look at a crumbling violent society, with no human rights and irresponsible scientific manipulations employed by the government to keep the people in check.<br/><br/>The plot encircles a teenage gang of bikies, led by Kaneda, who find themselves embroiled in a revolutionary movement. One of them, Tetsuo, is injured and treated at a secret facility where scientists attempt to augment his powers in a effort to create another Akira, a being who transcended into pure energy 30 years before.<br/><br/>The depth of characterisation in this film is also noteworthy: Kaneda and Tetsuo share a complex past and develop unto themselves realistically throughout the movie. The only fault I could find was that the plot was unnecessarily complex and bewildering, especially the end where it became a little wayward.

","The first time I saw Akira (on dubbed, pan & scan VHS) I was very disappointed.  I had pretty much misunderstood the entire film and sat in stunned disbelief as the end credits began to roll.  Having been familiar with various animes, such as Ghost in the Shell and Wings of Honneamise, for a long time, I just couldn't believe that THIS was the classic everyone was talking about.<br/><br/>I now know better.  Akira is like the anime 2001; you just don't get it the first time around.  Look at the explosion we see at the beginning of the film, for instance--despite the initial reaction you'll probably have, that isn't a nuclear weapon of any kind.  It's something much, much different, and the only clues we have as to what it really is turn up towards the very end of the movie.  Because of stuff like that, Akira is a demanding, obtuse film that really requires a lot of work on the part of the viewer, and the funny thing is that it doesn't have nearly as much gore or nudity as one might expect. <br/><br/>The story has its flaws.  Writer-director Katsuhiro Otomo was faced with the seemingly impossible task of compressing his 38-issue (I think) manga series into a two-hour film, in a way that would please both fans of the comics and Akira newcomers.  As a result I think there are too many characters and subplots swirling around.  Personally I would have liked the film much better if Otomo had left out all the confusion with the corrupt parliament and the underground resistance movement, and focused more on the complex relationship between Tetsuo and Kaneda.  The movie's greatest story strengths are the statements it makes about friendship and teenage violence, and most of the other plot elements made sense in the manga but aren't really necessary here.<br/><br/>But in the final analysis, Akira is an intelligent and provocative film that deserves its cult classic status.  And it need hardly be said that the English dub is pure garbage compared to the Japanese version with subtitles. Watch it, and then watch it again."

Sure it's got its gory moments, and yes, I do agree that some parts of it do ramble. But when you take this whole film in, from plot to characterization; from Direction and animation style to score and soundtrack, you have a combination that makes for an incredible package. <br/><br/>It's been said by other reviewers here that this is a 'fattened', ""Americanized"", ""Disneyfied"" version of what Anime is in Japan. It is so far and above that. The decision not to use the big, round-eyed stereotypical anime character was actually a concsious step away from the large eyes, which originated as Tezuka Osamu's homage to the Disney style of the fifties. The animators were more interested in characters that actually looked somewhat realistic and more Japanese than the typical Anime character.<br/><br/>As has also been said before, the story is rather deep, but the film does not do the manga justice.

","For better or worse, ""Die Hard"" is the benchmark with which most modern action-thrillers are compared.  You can see it in newspaper articles or reviews.

""Sudden Death"" was ""Die Hard in a hockey rink.""<br/><br/>Well, ""Akira"" is the ""Die Hard"" of all Japanese anime.  I'm not an ardent follower of this genre, I must admit.  I like only a handfull of these films, and I own all but one of the ones I enjoyed (i.e., ""Wings of Honneamise"", ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Princess Mononoke"", and ""Akira"").  The reason is simple, if not totally fair: every anime I see, I compare to ""Akira.""  And more often than not, they come up short in one area or another.  ""Akira"" represents, to me, a near-perfect synthesis of action, science-fiction, and high-end animation.  I've seen an awful lot of comparisons to ""Blade Runner"", but the two films have little in common except the time in which they take place.  While ""Blade Runner"" took its time with the storytelling, ""Akira"" starts with the tachometer at the red line and rarely hits the brakes.  It's ultraviolent, semi-gross, and downright startling in places.  Anime just has no right being this good."

Quite the opposite. The involving plot, regardless of whether you understand it or not, will hypnotise you while the sheer beauty of the drawings will simply take your breath away (lest we forget, this was made in the days before computer graphics replaced CEL as the standard animation technique - which makes the workrate behind Akira all the more impressive). Nonetheless, you need to watch this movie several times in order to fully appreciate the Akira experience.

It's not an easy movie to watch-- the story meanders between many different interlocking plot threads (personally, I find the sections dealing with the underground resistance movement to be boring and needlessly complicated).  At its core, though, it's a story about a biker, Tetsuo Shima, who suffers from an inferiority complex and lives in a self-imposed cloud of low self-esteem; when Tetsuo gains psychic powers after the government experiments on his brain, he uses his new-found abilities to take revenge against a world that rejected and scorned him as a child.  ""Akira"" disguises itself as a big crazy science fiction movie, but it's really about the Columbine syndrome, how some misguided young people can only escape their self-imposed feelings of isolation through violence against the supposedly happier, more 'accepted' people they see and envy every day.

","""Akira"" was the first Japanese Animated film (anime) to receive theatrical release here in the United States.  It is considered to be the bringer of anime to the American mainstream, despite the fact that it was only in limited release.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought Akira was a bit over-complicated.  This was probably the result of the difficult transition from comic to screen, and the limited time frame of film.  But even so, Akira's story leaves the viewer somewhat lost and confused.  In it, the viewer follows the exploits of a teenager who becomes endowed with powerful psychic abilities.  The character development was rushed, and the establishment of scenarios was a bit weak.  Akira did excel in cinematography and animation.  Unrivalled in its pacing and high quality animation, few other anime has been able to meet, or match Akira for production quality.  The English release was somewhat lacking in vocal acting, but not the worst.<br/><br/>All in all, Akira is deserving of it's ""anime classic"" status, if not simply for bringing about a new type of animated cinema."

Right from the beginning of the movie you are thrown head first into a Blade Runner like world of future Tokyo.  This film is extremely violent.  It is not just a cartoon; certainly not anything you would want to show your kids.  Its grittiness makes it more real and adds to the fact that this is a bleak distopia that the Japanese now live in.  Although action or sci-fi enthusiasts would enjoy this film for what it offers them, the film's message would escape someone just watching it for the gore factor.  Its more a film about what is wrong with society and less about killing and cool animations."

With zooms, 180 degree camera pans, lights, explosions in 65,536 colors (or something close), slow-motion, Akira makes the best efforts of Disney and Dreamworks look like Saturday morning cartoons back in the sixties.   Then you get into the rest of the film.  The dubbing job is not perfect, in fact it's far from good, but you can't hold that against a film that wasn't made to be in English.  The story is innovative at times, but seems like a mish-mash of New Age ""I am in control of my universe"" sayings etc. at other times.

","I could go on about how amazing and groundbreaking this film is, but you've probably already heard it before.  That having been said, it is an amazing film.  It has some of the best animation I've ever seen, it has a very realistic look and feel, while having a distinctly animated style, if that makes any sense.  Despite being almost 12 years old, it still looks very fresh.  The film has some very impressive action setpieces, like the opening battle between biker gangs, famous among anime fans.  Anyone who's a fan of 80's style ""body-horror"" films is sure to like this one.<br/><br/>One thing the film is notable for is direction by the creator of the comic that it's based on (Katsuhiro Otomo), which is pretty rare.  Sure, it's not uncommon for a comic's creator to be involved with the film version, like co-writing the script or producing, but for the original creator to have this level of control over the film version is unusual.  Just imagine if Frank Miller wrote and directed a Sin City film.  The only other example of this I can think of off the top of my head is Hayao Miyazaki's film of his manga Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind.<br/><br/>On top of all that is the excellent musical score composed by Shoji Yamashiro and performed by the group Genioh Yamashirogumi.  The score ranges from both dynamic pieces for the action scenes to very spooky, otherworldly music.  Vocals (including Buddhist chanting), instruments, and synthesized sounds are combined perfectly.  Unfortunately, this is the only film project Genioh Yamashirogumi has done.<br/><br/>If you can, watch the subtitled version of the film (of course, that's true for most non-English films, but particularly advisable for this one).  The Japanese voice actors do a much more professional, less ""cartoony"" job than the American actors.  You also have to take into consideration that the actors' performances were recorded before the animation was produced, to better match up the voices to the characters' lip and facial movements.  Needless to say, this effect is ruined by the English dubbing.  Not only that, I really prefer the translation of the subtitles to Carl Macek's ""adapted"" script.  After having seen the subtitled version, I find the dubbed version painful to watch.<br/><br/>For all the fancy visuals, the plot isn't bad either, despite suffering a little from being condensed from a fairly lengthy manga series.  I've seen few other films to present a near-apocalyptic world so compellingly (George Romero's Dawn of the Dead comes to mind).  It also has a healthy dose of satire mixed in, which is appreciated.  The scene with the council meeting around a circular table evokes the War Room in Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. Many other reviews have made comparisons between Akira and 2001: A Space Odyssey, with it's mystical ambiguous ending.<br/><br/>It may not be the ""ne plus ultra"" of anime that some people have described it as, but I would still say it's indispensable for anyone interested in science fiction or animation."

","Akira is definately one of the greatest animes of all time, and it is also the one which showed uninitiated people that there was more to anime than just 'demon rape', ie. Legend of the Overfiend. Something that tends to get mentioned in previous comments on this website is that Akira is 'bloodthirsty'.  This is simply not true, espescially when you compare it to countless others in its genre.  It does however have the fairly obligatory nudity, but the scene only lasts a few seconds and we're all used to that by now anyway. The only flaw I can think of in Akira is that it may be a bit too complicated.  This would be because the creators tried to sqeeze such a complex story into two hours, but they did do a good job - you will understand the many intricasies and finer points upon second or third viewing(much like Ghost in the Shell). To wrap up this review I will just say that Akira is a wholey remarkable movie compared to anything out there - and if you find it boring, as someone stated in their review, you must not be intelligent enough to appreciate it anyway."

","Akira was hot wired directly into the sizzling, 'Bladerunner', William Gibson fueled cyber-punk movement of the 1980's and was rightfully the first Japanese anime to make an impact on Western audiences. The screen burns with the glowing neon of Neo-Tokyo, where giant advertising hoardings float over huge skyscrapers and bustling street markets while motorbikes paint streaks of light across the motorways. It's easy to be carried away with Akira's sheer style, it positively drips with light and colour, most notably in the films unforgettable opening ten minutes. Akira is the true spirit of cyber-punk, anarchic, intense, dark and virtually crackling with sheer energy. The plot is too complicated for it's own good, becoming somewhat entangled in the ideas it is juggling, with a few too many sub-plots and minor dramas too keep it's focus. Furthermore, the imagery occasionally goes just a bit too intense and mind-bending, making it easy for a less commited viewer to sneer and miss the film's more interesting subtlties. However, there are some great ideas swimming around in the pool of concepts behind this film, as well as some unusually complex characters for an anime, such as the brooding army officer in charge of guarding akira, whatever that might be. Most notable though is the film's hero, Kaneda, who embodies the spirit of the film, full of berserk energy and simmering rebelion. A flawed film, but a great one at that, it looks great, it's very exciting and that first sequence just can't be faulted."

It was my intention to forget this film and never watch it again. A couple months after the first time I watched it I rented it again at a friends house. I started to enjoy the film more. Today this is one of my favourite movies. The main reason I started to like this movie so much is because in time I began to understand the plot more and therefore the movie was more enjoyable. I find that most of the people who hate Akira don't understand the story and don't like the violence and blood. Recently I rented Akira again. I told my friend about it and he said he wanted to watch it with me. I warned him about the blood and that didn't seem to bother him. I also told him that the plot is very difficult to understand. After the movie I asked him what he thought of it. His response was ""What in the hell was going on in that movie?"" He didn't really care for the movie but again the main reason was not being able to understand the plot. I think Akira is a great movie but it takes an open mind to enjoy it. Be prepared, the plot is very complex and it might take you a while to fully comprehend it.

","Akira is without a doubt one of the animation classics. Similar to Fantasia in its uniqueness and originality, but of course not in its content matter. Every scene has such an attention to kinetic detail that is lacking in modern anime. Capes folding after human jerks and movements, hair blowing in the breeze, just as many smoke effects as there are explosions, rocks crumbling. Akira is also a study on the mind, almost any physic power that you can think of is found in here.<br/><br/>What is even better about Akira is that it is a character drama where no character is really the main character, some are just more focused on than others. Instead of having good and evil characters, the personalities of the characters unabashedly play off each other and cancel each other out. The characters do what they feel they have to do and more often than not these are the characters which survive to the end. There is also a great scope to the story of Akira. Tetsuo is either the chosen one to fulfil the prophecies of the Akira cult or just a teenager on the loose, we see both possibilities with just as much probability through the use of many different perspectives. The movie creates a feeling for what is happening to Neo Tokyo just as much as it does its main characters. The riots and military actions are just as interesting as the rivalry between Kaneda and Tetsuo. Because it is such a well put together film, it is very easy to rewatch. In fact while the film is only two hours long (of course that's long for an animation film) it feels like the longest movie ever produced when you sit through it for the first time. One of the final good points of this film is the music and sound effects. The music is just awesome, has a great tonal quality to it as well as good composition. There is great fore-shadowing and sound effects. The director knows just what to show you to make the scene work. Seriously, this is one of the best directed films ever. If you think it is violent, there are plenty of places where the violence is taken away from the center of attention to drive the point home. Akira is a film that takes all the explosions and unabashed emotions and creates an aura of beauty around it."

SHREK, FINAL FANTASY.These movies are synthetic in terms of animation and pure bubblegum fluff in terms of story, which most people seem to love, thus marketable. Akira is hand drawn and although there are some computer effects they act only as an aid to true artwork. When people don't understand something they will stay away and continue in there mainstream way of life;Hence people comparing this to SHREK (what a joke). AKIRA is not what most people call conventional storytelling. In these terrible days of hollywood movies one might think this would be a breath of fresh air. As for the dogs being blasted near the begining of the film; this shows the type of society Neo-Tokyo is with terrorists posing a threat on the city every day. Yes it's brutal and if you understand that , good, your on your way. The people that come on here and compare this to ICE AGE are the same ones walking out of Scorpion King saying ""That was great!"" There is a story in AKIRA and it does make sense. If you understand the movie and it's social comments and still don't like it I respect your opinion.

Some people complain about the violence in this movie, but compared to other titles like Fist of the North Star and Urotsukidoji, it's almost tame by comparison. To add to this, in Canada this only obtained the ""14a"" rating, which is supposed to be equivalent to the USA's PG-13. Hurrah for the liberal Canucks!"

","The 1988 Science-Fiction Thriller from Japan became a landmark for Anime and started to introduce American audiences around theaters back in 1989 to Japanese Animation. This movie is set in the future of Tokyo, where a gang of Bikers led by Keneda are at war with another Biker gang but one of the good Bikers named "" Tetsuo"" gets hurt in a accident. He is then taken to a governmental Hospital where he becomes the subject for an experiment that gives him incredible Powers including Telepathy and he goes on a rampage to find the source of his powers. It's an entertaining, powerful, violent, and dazzling animated Sci-fi Epic Extravaganza that will knock your Socks of your Feet and into another dimension of Animation.<br/><br/>Other similar movies i would recommend: Ghost in the Shell, Scanners, Carrie, Firestarter, Roland Emmerich's Making Contact, Total Recall, Blade Runner, X-Men, The Matrix, Day of the Dead, Starship Troopers, Robocop, Rats: A Night of Terror, Mad Max, The Toxic Avenger, The Road Warrior, C.H.U.D., The Terminator, Jin-Roh, Princess Mononoke, Ninja Scroll, The Professional: Golgo 13, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Alien, Aliens, Escape from New York, Face/Off, Die Hard, Fist of the North Star, and Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>10/10 ( a must see if you are interested in Japanese Animation.)"
"Don Armageddon","10","0","2","21 February 2002"," The three (and a half) defining moments of my anime experience
","Anime is one of the most misunderstood genres of animation and film in general, at least in the Western world.  Anime movies (apart from  the awful Pokemon franchise) are almost never shown theatrically on the big screen, as some of them are intended.  And that is a real pity, but three weeks ago I was in for a massive treat.<br/><br/> I'd first gotten into anime when I was about eight.  And, of course, that exposure was due to the massively popular Dragon Ball Z television series. While a very odd show to sit through now, the Japanese superhero saga was amazing to my younger self, despite the lack of (albeit impressive and unique) fluid animation.<br/><br/> As I'd gotten older, and my younger brother was turned on to the Pokemon craze (I'd barely avoided it, with only a brief flirtation with the original video games), I ended up with a bad opinion of Japanimation: the dub jobs were often bad (and the dialogue was cheesy for a Western watcher anyway), the animation often awful, and the less said about the huge eyes the better.<br/><br/> That was a philistine's belief, however.  Yet while I wasn't too keen on the genre, I'd heard good things about one movie in particular: ""Ghost in the Shell"".  So when it came on the Sci-Fi channel last summer for a midnight screening, I decided to watch it (what the hell, right?)<br/><br/> Hoo boy.  ""Ghost in the Shell"" was not Dragon Ball Z.  Hell, it wasn't anything I'd expected it to be, and it was even better than many live-action flicks of the same yarn.  FAR better than almost ANY Western animated film (to date, my slim liking of animated films from the States include The Lion King, Shrek, and pretty much any of Pixar's work.)  I thought, damn, this was one of the best movies ever, certainly animated.<br/><br/> Well, thankfully I was wrong.  During my last visit to the States, in my massive DVD shopping sprees I saw the Special Edition Akira DVD, and read the cover.  It seemed interesting, but I chose not to buy it.  Instead, when I got back to England, I downloaded a copy.  I figured the animation wasn't perfect anyway, so why not get a grainy, online version?<br/><br/> Well, I watched it, and was pretty impressed.  It was cool, but I didn't think it was as cool as ""Ghost in the Shell"".  But after hearing a lot of hype about it, I felt sort of disappointed.<br/><br/> So THANK YOU SCI-FI CHANNEL for hosting Sci-Fi London!  A three day festival centered around the date 02-02-02 (get it?  ...no, I suppose not), it heralded the theatrical release of several gerat sci-fi movies, including the Aliens series, The Thing, and many top-notch Japanese movies.  Including Akira.<br/><br/> Well, all I can say is BOOYAH!  The film was ASTOUNDING on the big screen, especially since it was the THX remastered version.  The haunting music was far more impacting, the visual detail was the best I've ever seen in Japanimation (though some scenes of ""Blood: The Last Vampire"" were a bit better animated) and the new dub was far superior to the old one (why does no one like it?)<br/><br/> Well, needless to say I'm aching to head back to the States for Spring Break and pick up the Special Edition DVD.  A truly outstanding movie, but one which, unfortunately, has spoiled me for (almost) every other anime out there.<br/><br/> SCORE: As a film: 9/10 As animation: 11/10"

","Akira is an interesting concept, it's an animation for a mature crowd. Sit back and enjoy the visuals, Akira works on a visual status, so you have to listen to the English dub. <br/><br/>Akira's animation is moody, dark and unique in design, although it has been copied, I'm guessing not many have attained the God-like status of Akira.<br/><br/>What is it about? I don't quite understand it all, it does require a few viewings. <br/><br/>The English dub isn't perfect, ideally you want to read the subtitles and listen to the Japanese soundtrack, but the visuals make it impossible to do this for the first few viewings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Enjoy Akira, it's a unique animation picture."

","This movies far surpasses everything Disney has ever made.  The intricately woven story (based on Otomo's best selling 6 book series) has been an inspiration of everything form future movies and stories to video games.  I admit that the early sound version, ie. the first English dub, was pretty poor, but the new 2001 version is excellent.<br/><br/>As far as technical aspects: the animation is flawless (2 years of frame by frame animation cells), the colors are vivid and life-like, and, even though it was made in 1988, it still has an aura of the present inherent within it. The musical score is probably one of the best I've ever heard.  It is the kind of music that you can listen to without the necessity of context (that is you can appreciate the music without ever seeing the movie).<br/><br/>This is just one of those movies you can watch, say ""Wow"", and then watch again."

","Akira is great.  Great story, great animation... great everything!  It's a shame that people would dismiss this film just because it's an animated movie. It's one of the greatest sci-fi films out there. It's right up there with 2001, Alien, Blade Runner, and The Matrix.  Though the film can be extremely violent at times I wouldn't refer to it as a ""gore"" anime or whatever it is I've seen other user comments call it.  It's a great futuristic tale about a boy driven mad with power and psychic abilities. Actually there is sooo much more involved in the story and so much depth that is involved that I might as well not even bother to try to describe it. Friendship is also a big theme throughout. It's just a great great great movie, if you haven't seen it you must. You won't be disapointed.<br/><br/> *SPOILERS AHEAD!* One thing I wish the movie did have would be a battle between Tetsuo and Yamagata.  In the comics they both have a really cool motorcycle battle with one another and Tetsuo causes Yamagata's head to explode.  In the movie Tetsuo just knocks over a large object on Yamagata, which pins him down.  We don't even get to see Tetsuo deliver the killing blow.  Also, it would've been nice to have seen more of Lady Miyako who I think is actually supossed to be a man in the film!  She isn't even #19 in the movie!"

","I am not a hardcore anime fan. However when my friends told me to see Akira I decided to check it out and what I found is simply amazing. The animation is stunning, making a solid bridge between the world of anime and typical style of animation we are used to in american cartoons. The characters are very much alive, with distinct and varying personalities that the viewer gets acquainted with. And the story is well developed, with various plots entangling and carrying the viewer onward. Akira is a trip. It is a journey from simple view of the world to a more enlightened one. Thus, it is not for everyone. THe movie contains a rather entangled story that requires a certain understanding of the Akira philosophy. I suggest reading some FAQs (Search for WHO IS AKIRA) either before or after watching it. So what is Akira about? It is hard to say. According to the creator, it is about friendship. Indeed, some interesting relationships are explored. It is also deeply philosophical, exploring various concepts dealing with destiny and the value of human life. Watch it. You might not understand everything from the first time, but it will be entertaining nonetheless. My only wish is that I knew Japanese so i could watch it in its original, and perhaps even more meaningful version."

","So here I am, the only animation fan I know who's over the age of ten, and I had never ever watched ""Akira"" before yesterday morning.  I am very ashamed of myself.<br/><br/>So let me just say that ""Akira"" is awesome.  It's pretty much everything I'd ever heard about it and much more.  It will literally blow your mind. <br/><br/>
I'll only share a few things because I don't want to spoil it.  You'll want to be in the same mind-set as the unsuspecting folk who went to see this movie in the late eighties, back when animation meant Disney and nothing else.  Two small bits of information might help, though.<br/><br/>First of all, the story is a little confusing.  Fortunately, I read a criticism of the movie a long time ago and one of it's helpful points came back to me while I was watching it, so I'll share it here.  The story is basically a darker ""Star Wars"", one where Luke goes insane after all he's been through and Han Solo is a horny jerk.<br/><br/>I'm also telling you not to eat while you watch it.  It is *very* gory in parts.  The final half-hour is especially insane.  As I told my sister, ""Well, it's real pretty they way they animated the horribly mutating corpse!""  (Poor, poor Tetsuo...)<br/><br/>I should note that the version I saw was the letterboxed subtitled edition. I know many people make a big deal out of that sort of thing."
"OptikMatrix","Null","0","1","15 August 2001"," Man, machine, and psychic mutation...
","If you got the balls to handle it, Akira is a great movie.  The animation is frighteningly detailed with movements so smooth it's good enough to be the equivalent of a live-action thriller.  The story is chock-full of cyberpunk fun, complete with a monolithic Blade Runner-esque city and a hard-core biker gang with a taste for anarchy.  Sound like a bloodthirsty teenager movie?  There's more to Akira than meets the eye.  Under it's gore-and-violence tinted shell there is a deep message concerning the social makeup.  Will I tell you?  Now that would ruin all the fun, now wouldn't it? Part of Akira's greatness is that it doesn't have to be taken seriously for you to like it.  You can just pop back on the couch and watch it as if it were a moving comic book.  But, if you want to understand it's message and leave with something to think about other than wanting to be a biker-punk, you'll need to pay attention.  This movie can be pretty hard to follow when it gets into full-motion, and missing as much as a minute will throw you completely off track.  But have no fear.  If you lose the plot you'll always have the beautiful imagery to feast on for the rest of the movie. To the teenaged viewer, Akira is just awesome.  To the anime fan, it's a masterpiece.  To the average adult, it's a heartless bloodbath with nothing to be displayed other than senseless violence (which is totally untrue, to anybody who thinks that). It may not be for everyone, but Akira is a movie to experienced at least once in your lifetime."
"tha psychedelic phunkster","Null","0","1","8 August 2001"," is that what you call evolution?
","Science fiction is a very diverse genre, and tackles many subjects and takes different views on hellish futures and future revolutions. Akira takes science fiction to a whole new level. Like most Japanese animated films Akira is equipped with a very complex plot that deals with everything from human relationships to human mind experimentation. The film begins after the third world war in a corrupted and polluted Neo Tokyo. The streets Neo Tokyo are in the midst of a revolution against a repressive government and the streets are over run by bike gangs and rebels. This is where the story begins but where it ends you may never guess. The themes that are left with the viewer are very immense they contain, friendship, political corruption, psychic power, evolution and the loss of childhood. The story is very complex and requires a lot of concentration so make it a pass for family viewing. The animation is fantastic but still it looks very dated compared with the likes of Ghost in the Shell and even the Legend Of the Overfiend. You can tell the animators really went wild on the budget strait away with the first bike chase. It is obvious when Akira is compared to other lesser funded apocalyptical animated films like Demon City how much money was really spent on the animation. If you keep in mind the original prints were made in 1988 the animation will not fail to impress even the most critical of viewers. As the story spirals out of control the animation complements the madness, not to mention the almost horror sound track.<br/><br/>Japanese animated films are mostly cursed with a cheesy sound track and if I could I would re-write most of them for example The Legend of the Over fiend. Akira is where I would draw the line when music is used it creates the perfect atmosphere for the artwork, animation and builds up tension perfectly. There you have it Akira is for all animation / Sci-Fi fans and people with brains in general"
"neoginyu","9","0","1","4 August 2001"," One of the greatest achievements in anime.
","I have been interested in Japanese animation since I was a small child. Shows like Thundercats and Gundam introduced me to anime (Japanese animation). However, as I grew older I began to slowly become less interested in anime of that kind. One day I was going through my old toy collection when I found one of my Gundam action figures and I remembered how much I liked those shows. At that point, I became more and more interested in trying to find an anime film that is made for a more mature audience. I went out to look for that kind of movie one night and found Akira. At first I had little interest because of the cover (Kaneda walking up to his motorcycle). There weren't many other options, however, so I decided to go for it. That night I once again became hooked on anime. The animation of Akira is simply breathtaking, and the plot is so involving; many adults will have to think about the ending for a few hours to clear everything up. I will not hesitate to say that some people will be turned off by the intense violence of Akira, and many will be disturbed by the powerful story about two friends being torn apart by a force that no one can control. You absolutely must have an imagination while you are watching this film. Anyone who approaches Akira without an open mind will be disappointed and confused. This film was the beginning of an incredible genre including great movies like ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Ninja Scroll"", ""Perfect Blue"", and ""Princess Mononoke"". Akira is the masterpiece that introduced the world to anime, and with its stunning visuals and complex plot many fans will agree when I say that Akira is one of the greatest achievements in anime."

","8/10.

Short of being an allegory about the use of nuclear weapons (and our current inability to properly control that power), it doesn't really have any parallel in actual life--something all good works of social satire should have (assuming you are inclined to consider Akira a social satire)."

","I decided to review this film after seeing that it has a lower user rating than expected.  Also, its re-release is coming down on the heels of Princess Mononoke, so i feel i have to reiterate its importance since many fans have since forgotten it.<br/><br/>First off, i'm reviewing the subtitled film.  I feel no film should be appreciated in its dubbed form, for that is not the way the film was intended to be seen.  Subtitles offer accurate dialogue and dramatics, not what the english voice actors and scriptors want you to hear.<br/><br/>Akira was one of the greatest undertaking in animation ever. Creating the fluid animation of the film without computer assistance was an achievement alone.  This alone makes it one of the greatest animated films ever, at least in a technical aspect.<br/><br/>Alot of people complain about the story.  The thing about Akira is that it was originally a 2000 page manga story, which means one second of the film equals about 3 manga pages.  To cram all this information in, the story gets complicated and intricate on many occasions.  Many anime fans are turned off by this because it means they might actually have to watch the film several times or pay close attention.  This isnt Miyazake stuff, this is very complex material, with multifaceted viewpoints and morals, which is common in Katsuhiro Otomo's work. Once one watched it to the point where an understanding is reached, the film can be truly appreciated.  And since the manga has been released stateside, fans can now get a better view on the full story, and can see what Otomo's full vision was intended to be.<br/><br/>Frankly, i don't know how Mononoke came to replace this film as greatest anime movie ever.  The undertaking for Akira will never be matched again. The only film to come close, at least in complex moral/emotional issues was Hideki Anno's End of Evangelion, but that really is a different kind of film that works on a whole different level than Akira does.<br/><br/>In my mind, Akira will always be the grandaddy of all Anime films, the pinnacle to be reached, the king that has yet to be toppled off of its hill.

","If there is a child in your house, send them to sleep over with a friend. This anime is arguably the most violent one in existence. This, of course doesn't mean that it sucks. This anime is also VERY intelligent. It makes Blade Runner look like Disney's Cinderella. Its plot is ingenious, mixing the supernatural with the scientific. It is not only a bloodbath, but a sensitive yet strong cry against society, as well as a visual delight. It seems impossible that it was created in 1988. The story of a bike gang who lose their youngest member to the army. Scientists continually research on him, until something inside his head snaps, and all hell breaks loose. The boy, Tetsuo, decides to find the only one more powerful than him...Akira. His best friend and blood brother, Kaneda, tries to stop him, but in vain. On the way he becomes a revolutionary, and sees the true way society is these days...under a veil of a cult who believe Akira will return, and a perverse authority enforced by the police and the army working hand-in-hand. Akira is currently my favorite anime. It is perfect, except for the English dub's script. A pathetic effort to censor it, and that takes away from the movie. Thankfully, it is only minor. The rest of the movie is very enjoyable. Just try to be over 18."
"Neko-6","Null","0","1","15 December 1998"," Massive graphic novel series turned into a confusing (yet fantastic) film
","This was the second Anime movie I had seen (Orutsikadji: Legend of the Overfiend was the first), and I must say that it is the best I`ve seen EVER. The plot can be a little strange the first time around, but after the 3rd time watching it, it all falls together! Its main fault is that it was based on an unfinished Graphic Novel series (28 issues, I think) and was absolutely massive - they cut a LOT of it out to fit the movie into just over 2 hours!<br/><br/>The animation is great (surpassed only by Ghost in the Shell), the detail is fantastic and Tetsuo`s dream sequences are really cool.. the music is eerie and atmospheric..<br/><br/>A fantastic film."

","I rented this because my uncle told me I would be blown away by the animation. I WAS!! I had seen ""Ghost in the Shell"", and thought that was my favorite, but now it is this.<br/><br/>     It did suprise me, though. I kinda thought it was about a group of motorcycle gangs going at it, but it wasn't. I didn't really expect that whole sci-fi thing coming in. But it was still awesome.<br/><br/>     The whole movie I was thinking about what it would look like if it was made with real people. I wonder how that would ever get past the ratings board. The violence in this film was, well...violent. But I'm not complaining, I thought it was cool.<br/><br/>     Actually, right now I think I'm going to go watch it again. Sorry, but this review is shorter than my usual because I can't really talk about acting or anything. What am I going to say, ""Oh, and the way the actor pronounced that word was brilliant"".? 9/10"
"mirai_no_ransom","9","0","1","15 April 2001"," A great movie for bright people who like anime.
","This movie, being one of the first animes that I saw, gave me the impression that the whole genre of japanese animation was gory and violent (Vampire Hunter D being the first I saw). But as time progressed, I saw that this was not true. Dispite the bits of ultra-violence, Akira is a very good story. Many newbies may come along and say ""Hey! This movie is cool! I like action and violence!"" But the story is more deep than that. In summary: In Neo Tokyo, a boy had tests and experiments conducted on him that brought out his psychokinetic powers, enabling him to destroy buildings, armies, and even a city, like what happened many years before. His friends, dispite treating him like an inferior, attempt to rescue him with the aid of a group hell bent on ending the project. Maybe I'm not the best suited to explain the plot, but just open your mind and give this film a shot."
"psychoman069","10","0","2","10 April 2001"," Great Anime begins with Akira!!
","If your looking for classic anime that can kick any Disney movies' a$$! Then Akira is your movie. The Animation is highly detailed, cutting-edge. The story is great. Theres tons of destruction, bikers fighting, insane psychics, and blood! Lots of it! You won't believe what they do to Tokyo. Akira doesn't hold anything back. Especially the blood or violence. I was 10 years old when I first saw Akira and it blew me away. Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira manga series and animated movie paved the way for mainstream anime in the U.S. today. Any anime fan recognizes Akira as a classic and will remain one of the greatest animes' ever! Before I go I just want to say look out for the 2001 rerelease of Akira that has been digitaly remastered!"
"BlackBalloon","8","0","1","4 April 2001"," Stunning animation, Japanese or otherwise
","As a peripheral fan of Japanese animation, I somehow avoided seeing this movie until recently.  Being disenchanted with the genre in general since it really blew up in the last couple of years, I was pleasantly surprised. This movie's reputation as a classic is well-deserved.  I found myself wanting to watch it again the next day, something that really suprised me. The animation is so smooth and pleasurable to watch in some sequences, even when disgusting things are happening (there is some gore in this).  I wonder how they acheived this technique.  There's a more human story here than in Ghost in the Shell, and I liked this subtitled version of Akira better than the dubbed version of Ghost in the Shell.<br/><br/>The story here is not terribly important, but the characters are interesting, their faces are wonderfully expressive, and the images are unforgettable.  The last 30 minutes or so will blow you away.<br/><br/>At least a couple very striking similarities to Blade Runner-  the music (especially in the opening scenes), the golden buildings and the punks in the street.  And I thought the ""milk"", or whatever it was, spewing out of the giant stuffed animals was inspired by the demise of Ash in Scott's Alien, as perhaps the ""cloak"" scene in Ghost in the Shell was inspired by Predator.  To me, such touches aren't ""rip-offs"" but a sign of respect for the films and their creators.  They're put to good effect in both movies."
"BuzzardHawk","8","0","1","1 April 2001"," Signature animé
","With its lightning pace, smooth animation, and character insight, I found Akira thoroughly engrossing. It tells us about the corrupting influence of power, and what happens when science takes that very power too far (reminiscent of The Terminator). Although ""Akira"" is largely remembered for its generous amounts of gore, it is not mindlessly Hollywood-style - it seems to be there for a reason.<br/><br/>However, one may find the plot a little confusing at times, especially the ending. This is probably from the fact that Katsuhiro Ôtomo faced the challenge of condensing a 38-volume manga into a 2-hour film. As others have mentioned, you may have to see it more than once to fully appreciate the plot.<br/><br/>Barring that, Akira is right up there in its genre. Keep in mind the holocaust in the intro is not a nuclear weapon - I'll leave you to figure it out."
"neogamer","10","0","1","28 March 2001"," Best Japanimation
","I've seen a couple of Japanimation movies, but I guess I like this the best. It has everything a good sci-fi wants. There are many gruesome scenes, but that's what reality during war/anarchy is like, a bunch of gore. No animation has reached the standards of this movie yet (perhaps except for Miyazaki's movie)."
"Blinking_Fish","10","0","2","5 August 1998"," Still my favorite anime film
","Akira was my first anime film I have ever seen and it hooked me from the start.  Before seeing Akira my only experience in cartoon films have made for family viewing.  This is definitly not for children under the age of 13 or for people who have a low tolarence for blood.  Akira has a good view of a very violent and futuristic city.  Although it is set in the future it still looks like what was created in the movie can be acheived by that time.  The animation for this movie is fully animated unlike most anime films.  If anyone is looking to start watching anime they should start on Akira and pay very close attention to it (I had to watch it  3 times before a caught every detail about it.)  Although Akira looks like a 2 hour film of destruction it has a very deep stroy line in it."
