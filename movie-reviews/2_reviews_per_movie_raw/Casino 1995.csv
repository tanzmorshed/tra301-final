"contronatura","10","297","351","20 February 2000"," The most uncompromising studio picture of the 1990s.
","A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese's Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the ""blue collar"" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come."
"famsmith","10","334","416","28 October 2000"," An underrated and undervalued Scorsese Classic
","If you haven't seen Casino yet, stop whatever it is you're doing, rush to the nearest video store, rent it, and watch it.  Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture.  I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both.  The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done.  The acting is superb.  I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino.  Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again.  This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in.  Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","283","360","30 October 2003"," ""Now it looks like Disney Land""
","This is one of the best films of the 90's hands down. Without a doubt this has become one of my favorite movies. I'm not sure why really, I just love it. I think because I read the book and a lot of what happened in real life happened in my little town in Chicago. No names, and my old boss who runs our town grocery store actually knew ""Ace"". Again, no names. That was always pretty cool to me, since my town really didn't have much excitement. I guess also because I'm a huge fan of Martin, Robert, and Joe's. When they work together, they create masterpieces. <br/><br/>I've read a lot of comments on IMDb, and more than 50% of the comments are calling this ""Goodfells Part 2"". Is it ""Goodfellas Part 2"", in my opinion, no. Yes, it's very similar situations, but it's not the same plot. It's a little more gory and more bright. ""Casino"" is mainly about the rise and fall of Las Vegas. When Robert DeNiro's character says ""It's more like Disney Land now"". Actually that's true, it's not like it used to be. I'm only 20, but my mom and dad told me how different the times were in the 60's and 70's. Everyone was more close and wanted to know who you were and how everything was going. Everything is more corporate greed now-a-days. But back onto the movie, it does have gangsta's in it, and with that comes some pretty gruesome violence.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro. No words can describe how wonderful of an actor he is. If you read in most of my comments, you can tell I'm a fan. This movie is actually what made me into a huge fan of his. He's dialog and image is very powerful and you understand his position. You want to love him, even though technically he's a bad guy too, you still think he is so cool. A lot of people I talked too: the guys wanted to be him and the girls wanted to be with him. What a performance, it deserved more praise.<br/><br/>Joe does it again being the A$$hole who thinks with his gun and not with his head. Joe as an actor is very remarkable. He's only 5' 6'', but he is so intimidating. His speech in the desert with Ace and the big confrontation. ""You want me to get out of my own town?! Don't *bleep* with me, Ace!"" Does he swear in this movie? Oh, yeah. A lot, we're talking 400+ f-words, guys. But you get past the vulgar language and just enjoy what Joe says and does. The head vice scene and the metal bat scene with Joe is two of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history.<br/><br/>Sharon Stone, what can I say? What a remarkable performance! She was very much robbed of her deserved Oscar. I was reading in my ""Rober DeNiro: A history of his films"" that Sharon over shined both Joe's and Robert's performance. In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has ""hired"" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace ""I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I'm not protecting you anymore!"", you get scarred and can't help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours. You hate her character so much, you want her to get what's coming to her, that's what makes a terrific performance. When you actually want to make sure that this character gets the justice he or she deserves. Sharon, I apologize, you deserved more praise as well.<br/><br/>Martin Scorcesse. One of the greatest living directors of our time. This film was very wonderfully made with great visuals. The soundtrack really adds a lot, I'm telling you, and the theatrical trailer with the song ""Gimme Shelter"" by the Rolling Stones, what a great feel. Martin has been nominated several times for an Oscar, but they snub him. I think because his films are so violent and typical. But they remain classics. I'm disappointed with the Oscars, this man deserves more. <br/><br/>Whew. ""Casino"" is an excellent movie that I highly recommend for mob movie lovers. Don't compare this to ""Goodfellas"", let it stand on it's own. But please, this is not a movie for children in any manor. For the parents, this is a movie that should be on the wait until the later teens. It's very violent, we're talking a head in a vice, a beating with a metal bat(just to name a few violent scenes, there's more)drugs, sex, and very vulgar language. This is for adults only!It's a great movie that deserves very much to be on the top 250. I'd like to see it in the top 100, but we'll see. <br/><br/>10/10"
"powermandan","10","33","39","22 July 2015"," I Know I Am In The Minority When I Say This Was Much Better Than Goodfellas.
","I saw Goodfellas first and more times than Casino. Yet, I totally love Casino as it is one of the best movies I have literally ever seen. I find Goodfellas to be overrated and Casino to be the movie that learned from the former's flaws.<br/><br/>Something I really do think (more than my own opinion) is that if this was released before Goodfellas, this would be more liked. No new ground was broken, everything was just elevated.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro gives his most underrated performance--as well as the second best of the year (behind Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas)-- as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein. Ace is an unbeatable gambler who secures the mob's casino shenanigans while his lifelong best friend, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) keeps everybody in line. The only real difference between Nicky and Tommy from Goodfellas is Tommy has curlier hair. There's divided opinion on who is crazier/more violent. I lean towards Nicky. Ace helps the casino grow and eventually seizes full power by becoming the owner. Nicky's wild and crazy antics get him banned from every Las Vegas casino, so he decides to create his own. Meanwhile, Ace blindly falls for a beautiful prostitute named Ginger (Stone) and they get married. Her habits don't change and Ace does all he can to help her out. The love story in this is amazing. Ginger is unlikeable but we can't turn away from her. Her and Nicky both contribute to Ace's fall as well as the rise of other casinos in Vegas.<br/><br/>One easy thing I loved was the performance by Robert De Niro. He is very likable and my heart breaks every time he is screwed over by Ginger and Nicky. He was easily a better lead than Ray Liotta and his character was more likable and deeper than Jimmy. In fact, all three of our leads in this are much deeper developed than the leads in Goodfellas. Ray Liotta is a dummy who is not cut out to be a mobster, while we see the conviction in Ace as he tries to make everything work out. Casino is also much more flashy and nicer too look at than Goodfellas which takes place in New York. The music in this is not distracting or overpowering. The filming is a step up. the flow is much better. And the story is superior. This has more of a linear and stable story than Goodfellas, which is just a man's escapades in the mafia. Everybody that watches Casino is impacted more than Goodfellas. To watch Casino, you have to be in a mood and well prepared. A movie has really done its job if it does that to a viewer, and actually has a purpose for its content.<br/><br/>4/4"

"ray-280","10","111","152","16 August 2005"," A Can't-Miss Story No Matter How Told
","As a lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with a few fringe types portrayed in the film, I'm well aware of the story, the culture, and the ambiance of the Tangiers, the fictional casino placed in the control of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert Deniro). Rothstein is not a mob member, but a ""moneymaker"" for them because he's the nation's best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.<br/><br/>Rothstein's partner in crime is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), who is far less convincing as a mobster than he would seem to like to believe. Sharon Stone plays the psychotic Ginger, a once-in-a-lifetime role in that it was the only time in my life I could bear to watch her on film. The supporting cast is strong, led by James Woods and Don Rickles (excellent in his dramatic capacity), and the movie is generally well-acted.<br/><br/>If you are a gambler or know the ""wiseguy"" culture, the movie doesn't have to be explained, while if you aren't, you'll feel like you've stumbled upon the secret meeting place of the mafia and made privy to what is said, without anyone knowing you were there. This film is based on the true story of what happened when the mob tried to put its men in suits and have them heading a casino, and why it has never been tried since. The homage paid to the incestuous nature of Nevada politics was an excellent touch.<br/><br/>Most of us wouldn't like a guy like Sam Rothstein, nor would we like to be him, but if we go to Vegas for a weekend and stay at a casino/hotel, we'll have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film's nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the ""old school"" types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences)."
"FilmOtaku","8","135","189","14 May 2003"," Typically fantastic Scorcese film
","I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever.  Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the ""great film"" line, and Casino is certainly no exception. <br/><br/>Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos.  Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino.  Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci).  Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.  <br/><br/>Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance.  As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point.  Scorcese's normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable.<br/><br/>
Scorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary.  A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion.  The entire production however, is sleek and very quick.  The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene.  Being a child of the MTV age, I'm a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master.  Scorcese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone.  One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of ""Satisfaction"" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.  <br/><br/>Being a complete film geek, I generally don't go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them.  While this was probably the tenth time I'd seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I'm sure I'll notice more upon my eleventh viewing.  The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, ""A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies"" which was done the same year as Casino.  The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres.  You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

"optimism_always","10","82","128","22 January 2005"," Brilliant acting. Superb story based on events that happened in real life.
","Martin Scorcese's harsh and yet delicately balanced masterpiece rises above anything petty meaning that if one wishes and has the ability and means to create a Sicilian mafia movie he should do so with grandeur and put into it as much effort as possible for people remember those who take advantage of their talent and circumstances and are diligent in their undertakings. Casino is in my opinion an epic, but it's much more than that. This film speaks even to those who dislike the subject of organized crime. You have to be objective when judging this movie and those of us who criticize everything that stands out amongst the grey background of that which is mediocre are fools who envy others' accomplishments and view them as insults to their own personal uselessness. Casino is one of the best movies of the 90's. In fact, in my opinion, it's one of the best organized crime movies of all time. Its moral is that no matter how tough you think you are there's always someone you answer to and that you ultimately will, indeed, if you screw things up."
"RogueXVI","10","116","186","18 December 1998"," I never knew Sharon Stone was so talented
","What a fantastic movie, thanks to its cast, top heavy with stars and fine direction of the ""Oscar begging"" Martin Scorsese. Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are great, as always, together. But, surprisingly, it's Sharon Stone that comes of with all the acting credit, she simply effervesces as the gold digging casino hustler. After witnessing her performance myself I couldn't agree more, and think she deserves a place above Susan Sarandon who ""stole"" the Academy Award from under Sharon's nose.  The photography is phenomenal and combined with great acting is a recipe for a classy film.  However occasional brilliant sequences, are often marred by the continuous commentary, which prevents any real, deep, emotional involvement with any of the characters.  Great stuff, just slightly flawed.9/10."
"The_Void","7","23","35","3 April 2005"," Entertaining, but it lacks bite and emotion
","Martin Scorsese's Casino has all the ingredients for a great crime film. It's got hits, bad language, Robert DeNiro, gambling, lots of Italian Americans - it's all there. Furthermore, it's got a great soundtrack, the Las Vegas setting makes for a great location and the acting is largely very good...but somehow, this just isn't a great film. Scorsese has missed the mark thanks to a lack of emotion. There is no reason to care for the characters in this movie, and that makes the film hard to connect with on the whole. The movie also follows the common Scorsese format, in that some guy gets rich and respected, then something bad happens and he finds himself back where he started. In fact, the ending of this movie is only an ""I'm a schmo"" away from being a complete copy of Goodfellas. Still, at least the movie manages to stay interesting for most of it's runtime, and it's easy to forgive the flaws when you're watching Joe Pesci threatening someone who's head he's jammed into a vice.<br/><br/>Casino lasts almost three hours, and it's fair to say therefore that this movie is overlong. It's not so bad for the first two hours, but once the film enters the final third; cracks begin to appear and the film isn't as interesting as it was, not much unlike Goodfellas; which also suffered from a trite final third. Tarantino's influence on cinema is felt in this movie, and that is obvious from the way that Scorsese has seen fit to saturate the movie in 'cool' old classics. Still, some of these songs; such as Fleetwood Mac's ""Go Your Own Way"" and The Animals' ""The House of the Rising Sun"" are really good songs and actually bode well with the action on screen. For this movie, Martin Scorsese has re-recruited the excellent pairing of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and both give their trademark excellent performances in this film. Casino may well be DeNiro's last great performance before he went on his downward spiral, which started with the fellow 1995 movie ""Heat"". On the whole, while this film is technically sound, it lacks emotional bite and there will be times during the film when your interest will trail off. It's an entertaining ride, but it's one that is ultimately shallow."

"BrandtSponseller","8","99","178","26 June 2005"," Very good but not without flaws
","Casino is a very good film. If you're at all interested in gangster/mafia films, or if you're at all a fan of director/co-writer Martin Scorsese, novelist/co-writer Nicholas Pileggi, or actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods, then Casino is without a doubt a must-see. I'm a huge De Niro fan, and I'm a fan of Scorsese and Woods as well. I certainly enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>But I don't think that Casino is at all a ""perfect"" film. An 8 out of 10 may seem high, but if you're familiar with my reviews, you'll know that it's not that high of a score from me--it's closer to average from me. There are plenty of flaws here, and I'm going to spend some time pointing them out, particularly since the film receives so many 10's.<br/><br/>Casino is based on the story of Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal and the Stardust casino in Las Vegas. The Rosenthal character is here named Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein and is played by De Niro. The hotel became the Tangiers for the film. The mob backs Rothstein but has to set up a false front while Rothstein ""secretly"" runs the hotel, because of his gambling charges back East. He falls in love with and marries former hooker/call-girl and current Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone), who remains in love with her pimp, Lester Diamond (Woods). Meanwhile, mob strong-arm Nicky Santoro (Pesci) heads out to Vegas to protect Rothstein, but eventually ends up running his own rackets and trying to effectively take over the town. Casino is the story of the relationship and political problems that this cast of characters and a number of associates run into. It's roughly a gradual road to destruction for everyone involved.<br/><br/>The film is unusual in many ways. The most prominent oddity is that a large chunk of it is told via alternated narration from the two main characters, Rothstein and Santoro. The aim was probably to include a lot more of Pileggi's book, in a more literal way, than would have been possible through more conventional means. It's remarkable that the narration works as well as it does, especially because a lot of it is given a rapid-fire delivery. For at least the first 15 minutes, there is barely a pause in the narrational dialogue.<br/><br/>One of the reasons it works is because of the style that Scorsese uses to accompany it in the opening. He employs a lot of fast cuts while presenting very stylized, documentary-like footage. The opening feels as much like an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at how the typical casino works as it feels like a fictional film about gangsters.<br/><br/>Eventually, the film evolves from almost 100% narration to almost no narration (although the narration never completely leaves the film). This happens so subtly that one hardly notices. Scorsese's directorial style likewise evolves from the fast-cut documentary approach to something more conventional.<br/><br/>This is all well and good, but on the other hand, the gradual evolution can only happen because the film is so long--it clocks in just a couple minutes shy of 3 hours. That's a bit too long for the story being told. By at least the halfway point, it starts to feel a bit draggy. All the material is necessary to the story, but it could have been tightened up a lot more.<br/><br/>Another unusual aspect is the score/soundtrack, which consists primarily of pop hits from a wide time span--30 years or more. While I like the songs--I've owned the CD since it came out and I listen to it often enough--and the songs can help set the mood for some scenes, they become a bit too incessant and overbearing for the story after awhile. It begins to approach the dreaded ""mix tape"" mentality, where the songs are just there because the director wanted to share some bitchin' tunes that he likes a lot. A bit of ebb and flow with the music, and music better correlated to the drama, would have worked even better.<br/><br/>Presumably, Scorsese was shooting for something like a sensory assault, since that's what you get in Vegas. The visuals are filled with neon lights, flashy clothes (I love Rothstein's suits), flashy people and such. The soundtrack is probably meant to match. But in that case, if I were directing, I think I would have went for a combination of commissioned music that incorporated a lot of casino sounds, or that mimicked a lot of casino sounds--the cacophonous electronic symphony of various machines constantly going through their modes--with schmaltzy show tunes, ala Liza, Jerry Vale, Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, etc.<br/><br/>That Scorsese was trying to give a Vegas-styled sensory assault is also supported by the audio-visual contrast between the Vegas scenes and the scenes in other locations, such as Kansas City. So I can understand the motivation, but I'm not sure the final result exactly worked.<br/><br/>Of course the performances are exceptional, even if everyone is playing to type, except for maybe Woods. The plot and characters are written and performed so that the viewer can see the disasters coming way before the characters can--and that's how it should be. For example, as a viewer, you know as soon as it starts that it's a bad idea for Rothstein to kowtow to McKenna to win her hand in marriage, but Rothstein is blind in love and he ends up paying for it. Everything unfolds almost a bit predictably in this respect, and another slight flaw is that we're shown the penultimate moment of the film right at the very beginning. It tends to make it feel even more stretched out, as you keep anticipating that scene.<br/><br/>But the slight flaws shouldn't stop anyone from seeing this film, and of course, quite a few viewers feel that there are no flaws at all."

Pesci plays tough guy Nicky Santoro, who has more of an old fashion way of solving problems, but none the less, gains power and succeeds throughout this film.

I also think that Casino is far, far superior to the over-rated Goodfellas. Even though it's longer, it passes in a breeze. Casino is just so colorful, multi-layered and intricate despite it's apparent simplicity. The film has three different characters narrating the story but none of it feels like exposition and it's never over-bearing.<br/><br/>Adapted from a true story, the film focuses on the fictional Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. The boss is Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, his wife, volatile hustler Ginger and his psychotic 'friend' Nicky Santoro. All they needed to do was to keep the cash-flow at the Casino steady to satisfy the bosses back home. But it was just never meant to be. And everything implodes at the end.<br/><br/>Casino is filled with dozens of sub-plots, tangent stories and brilliant side-characters. James Woods is especially funny as a lowlife con-man who can't even win a fight with a ten-year-old girl. Vinny Vella also amuses as long-suffering Artie Piscano. But it's Sharon Stone who walks away with the movie. Despite starring opposite loads of well-established male lead actors she owns Casino. She was absolutely robbed at the Academy Awards when they gave the Oscar to Susan Sarandon. Stone delivered a performance so authentic that it's truly unfair the amount of criticism she gets for her other, less-important films.<br/><br/>The violence will satisfy gore fans. In this lovely film we have a dope with his head in a vice (after getting icepicks in his balls), a truly brutal beating with baseball bats, some moron getting a pen shoved into his neck and a cheater getting his hand mashed by a hammer. Don't let this put you off, that was the old Vegas. Nowadays you just get told not to come back.<br/><br/>I know most people will call it sacrilege to condemn Goodfellas but Casino is just the better film of the two, plain and simple. Better lighting, far more impressive cinematography and more entertaining characters. It just has so much going for it that Goodfellas did not."

","This movie is entertaining, for sure, but just one attentive glance at the editing and you know Scorcese's struggling to make it work.  The voice-overs simply function to move the plot in places where the filmed action can't take it.  A film relying on voice-over for exposition is usually missing some pieces.  Plus as a movie about how relationships can dissolve there really isn't much to work from.  The Rothstein/Ginger connection is totally breezed over and you get no real sense of their relationship, other than ""he's controlling"" and ""she's nuts.""  Plus Joe Pesci is simply reprising his role from Goodfellas.  In fact it seems the entire movie is just a Goodfellas retread, but without the great pacing and script that kept that classic together.  Just because Martin Scorcese directed it, doesn't mean it's good!"
"bkoganbing","10","12","19","5 August 2005"," How Others See Us
","Casino is my favorite movie of the last decade of the last century. Just like in Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese rivets the audience to their seats without a real hero to root for. It's the power of the characters he creates.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro as the gambler boss of the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s and Joe Pesci gangster are long time boyhood pals from the mean streets of Brooklyn. Both move out to Las Vegas seeking their respective places in their related fields at the orders of the higher ups in the criminal world. But circumstance drives them apart and one of those circumstances is Sharon Stone.<br/><br/>People descending into degradation is always a role that will get you noticed by the Academy. Sharon Stone's part as Ginger is no exception here. She's a high price call girl when we first meet her and her descent into drug addiction isn't pretty, but Scorsese keeps it very real.<br/><br/>But the main story line involves DeNiro and Pesci. To see ourselves as others see us is one elusive goal not attained by many in this world. These two aren't an exception. Each can see how the other is screwing up and absolutely cannot see what he's doing.<br/><br/>The key scene in the whole film is when DeNiro and Pesci meet in the desert where a lot of problems have been known to disappear. If you can get passed all the cursing which is how you would expect gangsters to talk, each is making very realistic assessments about the other one and neither is listening to a word the other is saying. <br/><br/>This is why I love Casino so much. I've never seen that particular theme ever handled so well on the screen."
"mcfly-31","5","6","8","16 March 2011"," odds in favor of Marty fans....
","""Goodfellas"" takes Vegas sees Scorsese's usual players meandering their way through the expected labyrinth that is Lost Wages, Nevada. The mob portion is kept very brief near the front end, with DeNiro then heading West to man a mob-run casino. There's your basic dealings with skimming, teamsters, the feds, cheats, and whatnot. Pesci is then thrown into the mix as an enforcer to keep everybody who threatens DeNiro, in line. For good measure Stone arrives as an all-flash bimbette who placates well-to-do men with her wiles.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film lied mostly in the Scorsese going shockingly against type. First, we have one of the most passive DeNiro performances of his Marty career, as a (Jewish??) guy I kept screaming at to take some freaking action. He allows those who pose a threat to his world to just walk all over him at an alarmingly high rate. Namely, Stone, whom he inexplicably has some undying love for, despite her personality not going beyond a hot blonde of opportunity. That he could be so incessantly forgiving, made me nuts. I kept praying for the explosive Bobby D. we all know and love to show up, but he never arrived.<br/><br/>Then you have Pesci, basically aping his own ""Goodfellas"" character, as a leprechaun-esque tough guy whose main fear-striking device is drop F-bombs at top volume. Or kicking the sheeyit out of guys as long as he (Pesci) has others there to watch his back. At least his character takes an unexpected turn that we're told is a huge no-no in the mob culture.<br/><br/>People have always been vastly divided on Stone; some hated her, some were surprised and vaunted high praise. I was pretty much on the fence with her, as her two-note (sexy or drunk) offering had your standard indifference to it.<br/><br/>James Woods is wasted (and realizing who his co-stars were, seemed to go into Pesci mode for the one scene he was allotted), Rickles and Smothers are thrown in for some Vegas flair, with your usual assembly line of reliable Scorsese Italianos rounding out the supporting roles.<br/><br/>Then there's Scorsese himself as they guy at the helm. I've never really been a fan of forced or tortuous violence in a film (the Freddys and Jasons were always quick about it), but where was it here??? Where's the Marty Scorsese of old who covered his filmstock in off-putting gore? The fact that he (finally) shoehorns in some toward the last reel was a real let-down.<br/><br/>The film hardly drags, and the narration was an acceptable technique, but in the end I couldn't have cared less whatever happened to any of these people. Unlike ""Goodfellas,"" where, though the main characters were ""villians,"" I felt so awash in their journey by film's end, that you feel you've really been taken to another place by the actors. Casino, not in the slightest.<br/><br/>At the very least Joe Bob Briggs had more than one scene. Because the drive-in will never dah!"
"rmax304823","7","8","12","3 September 2002"," Ossessione
","A reprise of Goodfellas, mostly, as has been pointed out, and although long, not as tired or boring as some have felt. How could a movie with Steve Allen and Jerry Vale be all bad? <br/><br/>People have wondered why Scorcese and Coppola keep coming back to mobsters, specifically the Mafia, and all that corruption mixed with loyalty. Of course no one knows, perhaps not even the directors. <br/><br/>But I suspect there are at least three reasons: First, it works economically. It draws the audience in. There is power and violence and sex to appeal to the men's fantasies. There is loyalty, intrigue, sheltered family lives, and the excitement of a wealthy rogue male for women. <br/><br/>Second, Italian-Americans may return repeatedly to stories of the Mafia for the same reason that Southern writers deal over and over with themes of minority relations. In spelling out the stories, they are explaining the odd customs of their subcultures to the rest of us. Yes, we are hung up on these obsessions, just as you believe, and here is how things work -- a bit more subtle than you'd thought, aren't they? <br/><br/>Finally, in exploring these themes in the interests of the outsider's better understanding of them, they can explore their own conflicts in model form, as stated in the anthropologist John M. Roberts' conflict-enculturation hypothesis. When we view something with ambivalence we tend to poke around in it, to touch it, fascinated by it. If we can't actually DO the thing itself -- become a mobster, endorse slavery -- we can play games with the idea, constructing little mock worlds in which we can jiggle the concepts around. In conflict about having children? Well -- you don't really need to. You can nurture something that is a model or surrogate child. Cats and dogs will do fine. But if your conflict is more intense, you are driven to less recognizable models. House plants, say. And if the conflict is VERY intense, you can start a coin or a stamp collection. What, after all, do you do with a stamp collection? You conceive of the idea, you start it when it's small, you feed it, you watch it grow and get bigger, and when it gets too big, or when you lost interest, you sell it on eBay and it moves out of the house. Directing a movie means constructing a model world too, like the model social world of a chess game.<br/><br/>In a movie, you lay out a plot, cause the characters to do certain forbidden things, and imagine how you might feel if you were doing them yourself. I'm not surprised that Scorcese made this movie, or that he's filled it with Italian-American actors. I'm not surprised that Faulkner wrote Intruder in the Dust, or that Judith Rossner wrote Looking for Mr. Goodbar, or that Philip Roth wrote Portnoy's Complaint. These model worlds they've created deal with issues like crime, race, female sexuality, and ethnic loyalties that have kept Italian-Americans and Southerners and feminists and Jews marginal to the rest of our culture. The artists are trying to explain to us and to themselves how things look from the inside. If these issues ever disappear, which is most improbable, the conflicts will ease, marginal populations will no longer be prompted to produce such intense work, and the rest of us will be poorer for it.<br/><br/>Maybe in this case Scorsese did too good a job of it. I found myself listening to DeNiro's voice-over telling us that the James Woods character was a ""scumbag"" because he was a small-time chiseler chasing dentists on the golf course, taking money from the whore Sharon Stone. But who is DeNiro's character to make such judgments? Woods is detestable because he's a vellicating minor hood with no money? Whereas DeNiro is morally superior because he's a major player with LOTS of illegal gains? We admire DeNiro because he is the more successful crook. The moral calculus is a little confusing. <br/><br/>On top of all that highbrow stuff -- man, does Scorsese know how to stage a fierce family fight. I should know. And that opening scene -- a car explosion backed by the majestic sweep of Bach's Missa Solemnis!"

","Casino is so fast-paced and entertaining, it doesn't even feel like it's 3 hours at all. Fans of Scorsese, DeNiro, and Pesci will love this. They're all at their usual greatness, but the pleasant surprise from this movie is the electrifying performance by Sharon Stone (who won a Golden Globe award and got an Oscar nomination for her role). She's truly the crazy bitch you love to hate.<br/><br/>It isn't all too original, it uses the same formulas as other Scorsese movies (particularly Goodfellas), but it just works. It's a fun movie. The camera moves as if it has a life of its own, almost every scene is set to great music, the dialogue and narration are top-notch, and everything is just perfect. What more could you possibly want?<br/><br/>It's the closest thing to Goodfellas II, but it still stands on its own very well. Everyone should see this movie. It's 3 hours well spent.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"
"son_of_cheese_messiah","1","70","152","22 October 2010"," Notify Mr Scorcese: Its show, not tell.
","One of the gravest sins of cinema is spending too long on exposition. For this reason film makers are given adages like: Show not tell, cut to the chase and so on. This lesson seems lost on Mr Scorcese.<br/><br/>This films consists of nothing but expository narration through out the entire length of the film. I simply could not believe it at first. I felt sure that the two narrators, De Niro and Pesci, would stop talking at some point and the acting would start. This point never comes and you realise that this is what the movie will be: nonstop narration telling you what to think about a character, what the characters think, what's happening and what's about to happen.<br/><br/>It is unbelievable that someone would set out to make a movie this way.<br/><br/>In addition there is a constant 'commentary' of old songs through out. Some of this yet more underlining of the banal obviousness of a scene, such as when we see De Niro looking at Sharon Stone intently, the previous music is suddenly interrupted with ""baby baby you're the one"" and, just in case we haven't got it, we told in the narration that he has fallen in love. Is this film making for the under 5s? At other times however it seems that Scorcese is simply using the score as his personal jukebox and playing favourites from his own record collection. <br/><br/>All of this limits what little character development there is. The characters appear on screen, we are told who they are and what we should think about them and then move onto something else. A case in point is the romance between de Niro and Sharon Stone. He sees her and we are told (in narration) he is has fallen for her. Next we see them together and he asks her for change which she says she spent in the machines. We are again told in narration that this is untrue. So much for subtlety and acting eh? Then we next see them, we see De Niro proposing to her (after a voice-over telling us he was proposing to her naturally).<br/><br/>Joe Pesci does his usual schtick of an Italian-American psychopath, so we see him engaging needless brutality from early on. De Niro is his usual commanding self but the non stop narrative actually diminishes him as an actor. The same applies to all the other characters.<br/><br/>I could not make it to the end."

This is a fascinating and powerfully dramatic film with great performances by Robert De Niro and the unforgettably talented Joe Pesci who won the Oscar for best supporting actor in ""Goodfellas"". No one can play a more dramatic role and act as dramatic as Pesci.He can blurt the F-word several times non-stop and go absolutely berserk on screen, which really captivated me in ""Goodfellas"" and now has done it again in ""Casino"".I'm kinda upset with the movies rating on Yahoo by the film critics.Why and how did this movie get a B- by the critics.Okay, I'm with Roger Ebert on this one and I'm gonna say that it's an absolutely great film.Everyone else can go chop their schlong off and die somewhere.Not as good as ""Goodfellas"", but like ""Goodfellas"", it's a four-star masterpiece by the legendary Martin Scorsese and I wonder if he'll ever make another mob movie.If he does, I'm there."
"billymartinsrevenge","4","14","25","3 November 2010"," Two Words: Staggeringly Overrated.
","It should be clear to anyone who has followed Scorsese's career that he continues to fall back on several crutches in the construction of this film: casting his cute lil' mama, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and a boat load of the other goombas who ended up on ""The Sopranos""; the utilization of character voiceovers (a totally lazy device employed by otherwise ineffective storytellers) and yet another boring and way-too-loud classic rock soundtrack handpicked by a guy still living in the 60's. We get it, Marty: you REALLY like The Stones.<br/><br/>Take your pick, and I will show you several films for which Scorsese received well more credit than he deserves: the muddy, ponderous ""Mean Streets,"" the mediocre ""Taxi Driver,"" the execrable ""New York, New York"" and ""The Color of Money,"" and the predictable duo of ""Cape Fear"" and ""The Departed,"" the latter of which was utterly ruined by Mark Wahlberg's shrill, one-note performance. Additionally, Scorsese's overblown video to Michael Jackson's ""Bad"" was complete jive and gave the regrettable Wesley Snipes a stairway to stardom.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Casino"" is poor relation to the superior ""Goodfellas,"" which, along with ""The King of Comedy,"" is Scorsese's only film worthy of the heaps of praise showered upon his overall body of work. I should also mention that Sharon Stone's performance in ""Casino"" is just plain embarrassing. Don't get me wrong, friends.

","""A lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.""<br/><br/>I learned three things from Casino: running a casino is a tough business, Las Vegas is a complicated town, and a terrible wife makes life much harder. <br/><br/>Casino is a lengthy movie about the rise and fall of a couple of Vegas big-shots, and  the loss of the essence of old-school Vegas, itself. The story is told primarily from the points of view of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niero) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), two guys who have known each other for years, and come to make money in Vegas in very different ways.<br/><br/>Sam is a genius at all aspects of gambling that's tapped by the mob bosses back east to run a casino for them, while Nicky is a muscle guy who's there to protect Sam's operation. We watch them make a lot of money, and get into a lot of trouble because of their respective weaknesses/excesses. It's an entertaining movie, and the 179 minute runtime will pass by pretty quickly.<br/><br/>Both De Niro and Pesci were excellent, with many other great actors supporting their performances. A lot of your enjoyment of this movie will hinge on your preference for the genre. Casino is very much a mob-type movie, though it's not a Godfather Part II Las Vegas re-tread, by any means. If even someone like me who's not a particular fan of this kind of movie can enjoy it, then that's a promising sign that most others will enjoy it, too."

","Anyone seen Goodfellas? You know ... gangsters, violence, long story, Joe Pesci being a complete and utter maniac? Well, save your bucks. In a nutshell, CASINO is a total replica of a very good film. I'm not saying it's not good. It's just a replica.<br/><br/>Sam Rothstein (De Niro) is the man; a gambling genius who (his Jewishness holding him back) becomes THE man in Las Vegas. The problem is that he isn't a made guy cosa-nostra-wise. Doh!! If only he had an Italian background, so many lives could have been spared. As it happens, the Vegas mob bosses insist on Mr. Pesci being there to 'take care' of business. In other words, sadistically maim any idiot who messes with our Sam's good business. Watch out particularly for the 'hammer from nowhere' and Joe's novel use of a Black and Decker workmate which will, guaranteed, bring water to the eyes.<br/><br/>Much is made of Sharon Stone's tour de force in this movie as Ginger, Sam's moll. It's definitely a cut above her previous acting credits (who remembers Sliver? answers on a postcard) but at the end of the day, it comes down to her being given a decent script for once, and the chance to ham it up for all she's worth. If screaming and ranting on coke guarantees you plaudits, fair play. Worth a nomination? OK. The Oscar itself? Please.<br/><br/>Scorsese is the best director around for this kind of film. You will come out of the cinema saying ""Wow"", ""Yipes"", ""Cool"" etc. Even after a good three hours. No arguments - it is hard hitting and scary. BUT Martin - it's been done before. By you. And with Goodfellas, it was so much more original and, basically, better. De Niro, Pesci and Liotta were seminal. Replace Liotta with Stone, and it's only semi-seminal.<br/><br/>Casino will appeal to those who love a good shoot-up, blood and guts and plenty of actors yelling at each other. You will get value for your video rental, if that's what you're after.Let's face it - three hours! But if you want better value, hire out Goodfellas again."

","To the fans of Casino, <br/><br/>I see the whole film as an allegory for the way the world is run. Think about it. A bunch of mediocre and incompetent Italian gangsters send their cleverest Jew to take over the gambling business in Las Vegas. He does a great job and makes them rich. But these moronic and aging Italian gangsters send one of their own (a violent and psychotic Italian enforcer) to watch over the Jew. The Jew is doing a good job but he gets carried away and marries a beautiful but materialistic and drug addicted woman under the false notion that he can change her ways. He also pisses off another ethnic group when he refuses to take back an incompetent employee. Meanwhile, the psychotic Italian systematically undoes all of the Jew's hard work. Things get messed up. So like I said earlier, I thought the film was an allegory for the way the world is run. There are some really incompetent and mediocre people at the top. The really clever guys are in middle management but even they get carried away. Ethnic groups are perpetually involved in power struggles. And in the end, the large corporations and the squares replace these guys. The film is almost like an ode to the old ways (however mad and violent they might have been) before the corporations took over everything. <br/><br/>The film predicts Wolf of Wall Street in the way Scorsese's films would be made and edited. There are two narrators who talk us through the sensory assault filled with interesting camera angles, fast cuts, violence, beautiful women and the opulence of Las Vegas. Three hours simply ran by. <br/><br/>De Niro and Pesci are ably supported by Don Rickles, Sharon Stone and James Woods. <br/><br/>Best Regards, Pimpin. <br/><br/>(10/10)"

","***SPOILERS*** Almost three hours long with some 150 character references or credits in it the film ""Casino"" has to do with the rise and fall of big time Las Veges operator and Tangiers Casino manager Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, Robert De Niro, who's fate remains uncertain until the movie is just about over.<br/><br/>We see Sam in 1983 getting in his car and then blown to pieces as a bomb exploded as soon as he turned on the key to start the engine going. As Sam is put, by the explosion, in some kind of state of suspended animation, floating aimlessly in outer space, he tells us in flashback what lead to him getting into the situation that we find him now in. It all had to do with Sam's boyhood friend Mafia made-man Nicky Santoro, Joe Pesci, who was brought to Vegas by the mob to be put in charge of the casino's security. It was Nicky who's strong armed actions like beating and clubbing the customers fond cheating, as well as showing disrespect, on the floor of the casino that brought the heat, cops, as well as local politicians down on Ace Rothstein. This made things hot for Ace who with his criminal record now being scrutinized,instead of being looked the other way, to see if he can qualify to have a license to run the casino.<br/><br/>Things get even worse for Ace when Nicky after being banned by the State Casino Commission from ever stepping into a Las Vegas casino or gambling establishment still pesters him about getting his job back! That would cost Ace his job as casino manager for just associating with the blood thirsty little psycho. Things really come to a head when Nicky starts to warm up to Ace's old lady ex Las Vegas showgirl and part time hooker Ginger McKenna, Sharon Stone. Ginger is also still involved with her pimp ex-boyfriend Lester Diamond, James Woods, who's been leaching off her 2 million dollars in cash & jewelry that Ace gave her as a wedding present. This lead Lester to get worked over in a restaurant parking lot by Ace's goons with a terrified Ginger forced to watch.<br/><br/>As Ginger got more and more into snorting coke she became easy pickings for Nicky who got her to become his squeeze or woman in him supplying her, through his mob connections, with the white stuff. Soon Ginger got so hooked on both drugs and Nicky that she started to abuse her and Ace's 9 year old daughter Amy, Erika Von Tagen, by tying her up in bed as the two were out at night painting the town red behind Ace's back. It's when the word came back to Nicky's boss back east that he's fooling around with Ace's wife it was decided that he, despite being a made man in the Mafia, was more trouble them he was worth. A hit was set up for both Nicky and his equally psychotic kid brother deli owner Dominick, Philip Surian,who likes to spit in his costumers food especially cops whom he was forced to pay off. In a secret meeting site held in a deserted Indiana corn field both Nicky & Dominick were met by mobster and good friend Frank Marino,Frank Vincent, and his boys to talk over business. What was later to happen to the two sadistic creeps is far too brutal and shocking to be put down on paper!<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** When the film ""Casino"" is just about over we finally get to see what exactly happened to the what looked like at first the late and dismembered Samuel ""Ace"" Rothstein who's doing all the narrations in the movie. But by then with all the action and sub-plots in the film Ace's fate wasn't anything to write home, or in a movie review, about anyway! By then he was yesterdays news in him only being worth while to wrap fish or line your kiddie box with."
"chrisow","Null","2","2","30 August 2002"," Harshly judged
","Many consider this film as a sub - GoodFellas (1990) rip off, due to the style of the film and the nature of the violence and dialogue. While I agree that there are certain similarities, it must be considered independent from Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpiece. Indeed, Casino expands on GoodFellas and improves it.<br/><br/>We are now forced to care about Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and his downward spiral. In GoodFellas, we viewed the world of Henry Hill, but we were never really cared about him or his friends. Joe Pesci's performance as Nicky Santoro is, for me personally, far more disturbing than Tommy De Vito. Santoro is more vicious and is prepared to back stab Rothstein over business and his wife, Ginger (Sharon Stone, in an Oscar nominated role, and rightly so). <br/><br/>Even the violence is considered more graphic. I know a few people who were distressed by the intensity of the violence and had to stop watching the film. This is, surely, a success on the part of Scorsese and his cast on the fact that they are able to get such gut reactions from people who have been raised on slasher films, such as Halloween (1978).<br/><br/>There's also more of a story to Casino, which makes it a more engaging tale. No detail is too small for Rothstein, even down to the number of currents in a bun. It's a fascinating view about the rise and fall of the mob in Las Vegas, the playground of the world. The interesting thing about Rothstein is that he isn't actively involved in the violence, but he certainly doesn't condone it. Watch his face as the guy's hand is smashed with the hammer.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that James Woods is pretty weak as Lester Diamond, Ginger's former pimp. Considering his performance as a gangster in Once Upon a Time in America (1984), we know he can do much better than that. I don't know what Scorsese was thinking there.<br/><br/>Other than that, I give Casino a 9 out of 10."

","As films of around 3 hours go, this is one that will be able to keep you glued to the screen from start to finish - and it is easy to see why.<br/><br/>Looking first at the director, Martin Scorsese, he has once again turned out another masterpiece through not only his standard creative cinematography but through the use of an extremely clever and entertaining series of narratives from both central and cameo roles.<br/><br/>The lead actors have also done themselves proud in this film. Each of them allowing you a truthful and honest insight into  their individual persona's, giving the viewer a closeness to the characters and their plight that is rarely seen in films of today.<br/><br/>This film is frequently compared I think unfairly to 'Goodfellas'. Although the underlying theme is similar. 'Casino' has much less down time for the viewer and allows you to work away feeling less empty than 'Goodfellas' does.<br/><br/>With some of the most violent scenes since 'Reservoir Dogs' it is certainly not for the squeemish but certainly well worth a look.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

","Goodfellas is one of my favorite movies by far.  Martin S. is up there with Kubrick and Stone as my favorite directors.  When this movie first came out, I started to hear comparisons to Goodfellas.  This got me very excited because I loved the film so much.  I ended up loving this film almost as much as Goodfellas but no quite as much.  Still, I love almost anything Marty does and here he succeeds in telling a wonderful story.

","Now I've seen a lot of films.  And I have seen a lot of gangster films. But Casino...what can I say.  I've heard people say that this was simply Scorcese's attempt to remake Goodfellas in a different part of America.  I would say that while the idea behind it is the same, this has a very different feel to it.  Goodfellas was pure gangster stuff.  It was Liotta's ""Hey, this is a cool life"" description of how everything happened.  Casino was more ""How we f***ed everything up"" from the view of the cool De Niro. Scorcese simply used a winning formula, his usual winning cast and his usual classy soundtrack technique to put together what is the most absorbing film I have ever seen.  It may be very complicated to understand how the 'skims' work and which boss is which, but that's unnecessary.  The harrowing scenes with Pesci remain in the mind and De Niro's ice cold reactions as Stone falls apart make this a brilliant film.  Watch it.  Watch it again.  And I promise you, you will not be disappointed."

","This movie was great! The is was one of the best cast ever assembled, and the dialogue was great. When I watched this, I remembered when the Simpsons were watching Casino on TV and they said, ""Casino, starring Joe Pesci, due to violent content, Joe Pesci will not be seen."" Its so true. But even though Pesci's character was extremely violent, they showed the good side of him, making breakfast for his kid every morning. Sharon Stone finally shows she can do drama, and be believable. She shows that there can be slums in Las Vegas, while everyone around her is doing just fine. Then there is De Niro who stands as the calm, sensible guy that only f**ks everything up by making few very small mistakes. But ironically, he is the only one left, and continues his gambling life, and by what it looks like, succeeds.<br/><br/>Great Movie!"

","As a fan of Goodfellas and al of the Godfather's, I didn't think this one would be as good. Boy, was I wrong. All three main characters deliver award-winning performances, as expected. Sharon Stone is powerful as ex-hooker Ginger McKenna, her performance has many different levels. Joe Pesci is the villian we all love to hate, and DeNiro delivers yet another fantastic performance. Scorsese tells this one on many different levels-running the casino, behind the casino doors, who really gets your money, and what NOT to do when you visit the casino. As well as great performances, there is a great soundtrack, setting and cinematography. Take some time, watch, pay attention to detail, and take it all in, believe me you won't regret it..."

","It would be difficult to find a flaw in this film. It has been criticised for its violence - its a violent story, its language - the characters swear a lot, and even that it has all been done before - is there a completely original idea anywhere? I really liked the use of the narrative too.<br/><br/>I must admit, I saw a television version so a great deal of the language and violence was removed, but this was still a polished and classy film with an engaging story-line and talented cast. This film of paradise slowly unravelling is an interesting morality tale. Definitely worth a watch. My vote 8/10"

","During the first part, as we learn the ins and outs of a 1970s and '80s Las Vegas casino taking us so close to the mechanics of the operation we feel part of the roulette table or the dice rolling across... is intentionally created in the same fashion director Martin Scorsese showed us the mob's operation in GOODFELLAS.<br/><br/>But then something happens, or stops happening, or both.<br/><br/>The main character, Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, played by Robert DeNiro, is a man of mind, not action. He's to gambling what Scorsese is to directing a natural and the casino itself becomes an absorbing character: we feel pulse of the tables and machines, and the men behind the scenes, keeping the moneymaking beast alive while protecting her from cheaters, con artists, and crooked politicians.<br/><br/>Enter Joe Pesci as Nicky, Rothstein's childhood friend: the muscle who's cocky, dangerous, and ultimately undependable. And the flavor of the month, Sharon Stone, as Sam's trophy girlfriend turned wife, Ginger, who becomes the wormed apple of his eye – and soon, for a man who seemed infallible, nothing matters but trusting a woman who repeatedly warned him not to. The movie hits a wall with the escalating relationship between Sam and Ginger, but it was faltering beforehand – DeNiro, Pesci, and some of the other shady characters, although colorful and formidable, aren't very interesting nor are they people to care about – unlike GOODFELLAS, RAGING BULL, or TAXI DRIVER, they all seem more written than real.<br/><br/>And the duel-narration, beautifully wielded in GOODFELLAS between Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco, works and it doesn't: DeNiro's metronomic account of the proceedings is fine in the beginning, giving us a firsthand account of how the casino runs from the inside, it becomes a rambling safety net for the lack of a streamlined plot: especially when his business luck turns sour. While Joe Pesci's counterpoint is completely unnecessary, sounding like a goon version of Bugs Bunny, filling us with details better left for the audience to figure on their own.<br/><br/>And the last half runs itself completely ragged: juggling a doomed love story straight out of a nighttime soap with Ace and Nicky's doomed friendship that meanders to a predictably violent conclusion (and they never seemed that tight to begin with for an unraveling to really matter).<br/><br/>If Scorsese and scriptwriter Nicholas Pillegi stuck closer to the Casino, perhaps the film, and characters, might have had more purpose. What we're left with is too much style without substance. So to pay homage to vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen's comment to Dan Quayle's comparison of Jack Kennedy: ""I saw Goodfellas. I know Goodfellas. You, Casino, are NO Goodfellas."" <br/><br/>And (spoiler alert) has there ever been a character more deserving a bloody death than James Wood's pimp/hustler who not only repeatedly steals Stone from DeNiro, but kidnaps, and continually threatens, his daughter? While we witness the immense, overboard bloodshed of everyone else, James comes out with a few bruises. What the hell were they thinking?!<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

","Casino shows that GoodFellas, the milieu if not the overall tenor as this is more of a full-blown epic in Las Vegas can still be well done when people like Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi do it right.<br/><br/>For a long time this was among the top, top favorites from this director. I don't know if it's still one of THE bestest of the best, but it's still massively enjoyable and after all these years there's still things to love about it. And, actually, though he got the Oscar for Goodfellas, Pesci might actually be *better* here, more nuanced, crazier, more on-fire, more F-bombs. So much underrated material here. <br/><br/>And who doesn't dig James Woods as a pimp and Don Rickles as a casino manager?"

","Right from the opening sequence, with De Niro dressed in a cerise jacket and shirt, getting into car that blows up, and then circling across the title credits, it was clear this movie was going to be a stinker. I don't care if Martin Scorsese directed it. Even monkeys fall out of trees. Why would a cartel of rich men hand over control of a casino to a handicapper, i.e. someone who is good at betting. You need someone who is good at organisation and leadership, a CEO. Any rich man would know that. If he didn't know that, he wouldn't be rich. So the premise, introduced in the first minute, makes no sense. Joe Pesci's yapping voice - as a narrator?! Some silly staged stabbing in a bar over a pen. The other man's hostility didn't even make sense. Just a lazy set up to show how vicious the Joe Pesci character was. And Robert De Niro falls for the annoying girl that's stealing chips from men and throwing everyone's chips around, when with the status of a casino boss, he could choose any of 1000 non-annoying, non-criminal women? Time to stop watching."
"FilmSnobby","1","31","71","21 November 2003"," The reward for those who overrated *GoodFellas*.
","This might not be Scorsese's worst movie  (that would be  *Kundun*), but it may be his most negligible movie, given that it's very much a remake of the director's own  *GoodFellas*, which was a pretty empty affair to begin with. That makes  *Casino*  extremely empty -- call it a black hole.<br/><br/>Once again, we get the nonstop soundtrack comprised of Bobby Vinton-esque oldies and 70's album rock.  Oh, there's snatches of grand opera, too, especially when little Joe Pesci is killing someone.  The point of all this music, presumably, is to punctuate with either emphasis or irony what we're seeing on the screen . . . an easy indicator that the director doesn't have much to show us.  And in case that wasn't enough, Scorsese tries to fill the gaps with nonstop -- and I mean, NONSTOP -- voice-over narration.  This may be one of the few movies a blind person could watch without missing anything.  As cinema is a visual medium, I'm obviously not being complimentary to Mr. Scorsese, here.<br/><br/>Scorsese keeps trying to outdo his earlier film with MORE narration, more walk-on characters, more gruesome violence  (one guy gets his head squeezed in a vice), more domestic squabbling, more more more.  But it's all meaningless, quite apart from being as boring as hell.  What we have here is the story of small player from the Kansas City mob  (Robert DeNiro)  who wants to be a big player.  His bosses send him to Vegas, where he feels he has a real opportunity to not only be a player, but to be  ""legit""  in the bargain by becoming a real casino boss.<br/><br/>In the meantime, he's got to deal with an old associate, the violent Joe Pesci, and a whory wife  (Sharon Stone)  who's addicted to drugs and, most laughably, a mullet-haired James Woods.  I can buy the whole wife thing, maybe . . . men WILL do stupid things when it comes to blondes.  But I absolutely cannot take Joe Pesci seriously as a fearsome, bloodthirsty mobster who blows into Vegas looking for his own action.  De Niro and Pesci should've portrayed each other's roles.  But what do I know."

Most of the movie feature narration, which at first feels welcome and classic, but soon grows tiring because instead of the movie just ""happening"", the narration disrupts the acting all throughout the 3 hours.<br/><br/>Now I know many might consider this one a classic, but I will bet you right here and now, that non of the actors playing in ""Casino"" would willingly sit through this 3 hour torture."

","This is, unquestionably in my opinion, the best film of all time. I wont waste time outlining the plot in detail, I'm sure other reviews have that covered. The mixed reaction this film has been given has absolutely stunned me, reviews range from the worst film people have ever seen to the most impressive they have ever seen. This is of course the most underrated film of all time and not enough credit has been given to Scorsese, De Niro, pesci, stone and even the supporting cast including frank Vincent. The reason for much of this films criticism is its comparisons to goodfellas. This is not goodfellas or a goodfellas inspired film! (despite Nicholas peliggi's involvement). De niro and pesci surpass their performance in goodfellas with much to spare in this film. Pesci in particular has added more venom to his performance than seen in goodfellas (which was already as venomous as a venomous snake swimming around in venom).<br/><br/>Enough of this goodfellas talk, casinos finest quality is the development of the characters throughout the movie. The decade in which this movie covers allows Scorsese to work his magic and has time to brilliantly lay out this fascinating tale of the mob's control of a las Vegas casino...and the las Vegas streets. De niro is at his usual best which means long time movie partner Scorsese can direct with ease because nobody is better than De niro at his best. His performance is cool, calm and collected and his character is easily likable and understandable throughout. De niro's casual performance means it is down do pesci to take care of the more brutal parts of the movie, and he does this very well. Scorseses directing skills combined with De niro's fine acting and laced with pesci's raw power, not to mention a sprinkle of glitter on top in the form of Sharon stone, means there is no level on which this film does not deliver. the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be."

"TheUnknown837-1","5","6","10","26 November 2012"," Even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself.
","The opening 30 minutes or so of ""Casino"" embodies everything that I adore about pre-21st century Martin Scorsese cinema, most particularly the excellent craftsmanship he seems to have lost his grip in on recent years. As the picture begins, we get this fabulous quasi-documentary narrative with Robert De Niro, as the film's protagonist—nobody with any sense of morality can call a mob figure a hero—providing us all the details. What he's been given to say is fascinating, and the way Scorsese coordinates his camera is superb. The technique is pure, the edits are crisp and clean (there are none of those horrendous, in-your-face jump cuts that stabbed his 2006 film ""The Departed"" clean through the heart), and the amount of detailed information presented in an entertaining way. Scorsese and his co-screenwriter, Nicolas Pileggi, both of whom collaborated on the 1990 gangster masterpiece ""GoodFellas,"" are certainly to be commended as researchers. In this fabulous first half-hour, they know just when and where to tell us data about how the mob ran a Las Vegas casino and when to show us. They tell us who watches who during a big gambling night, and show us, in splendid detail, how to get rid of a cardsharp by giving him a bogus heart attack.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, for me, once Sharon Stone, as a prostitute who sets the protagonist's heart aflame, enters the picture, everything begins to drag. This is not a negative reflection on Sharon Stone's performance. Not only is this her best piece of work that I'm aware of—I personally do not think she's untalented as an actress—but she gives the best performance of the entire movie. There isn't a bad performance, really, but she does dominate everybody else in ""Casino."" So it's not her acting that wears out the movie for me; it's the pretentious and uninteresting melodrama that follows in her tracks.<br/><br/>The pseudo-romantic dynamic between De Niro and Stone is, at heart, just an old-fashioned gangster-and-his-moll story, with the feisty woman first being pushed around, then pushing back, standing up to the boyfriend with the gun. Why does this dynamic go wrong? Because the screenplay tries to make something monumentally important out of it all. It tries to go deep, explore the psyches of both characters, takes them out of the casino and into the deserts and apartments of Las Vegas, and attempts to bring a psychologically fascinating angle to their relationship. Here, it completely falls apart, and the remaining two and a half hours of the movie—the middle in particularly—really begins to drag. The other problem with this relationship is that De Niro's character is not interesting when the movie tries to explore his depth as a person. He's much more interesting in the old-fashioned personality of the 'rough-and-touch, silent but deadly' casino manager who, save for his cameras, supervises everything that goes in his establishment. Once he gets all mucky and muggy with Stone, the fascination is wiped clean from the slate. As was my ability to stay interested.<br/><br/>I wish that ""Casino"" had stayed inside the casinos and not gone into the deserts, apartments, swamps, of outer Las Vegas. For me, the heart of the movie was contained in that big, luxurious building with the omnipresent colors. And I do not see why the movie could not have just stayed there and told its story from that setting, venturing outside only when necessary. Obviously, it's based on true events, but since the true events, as told on screen, become this dull, what's the point? Even Joe Pesci, essentially repeating his performance from ""GoodFellas,"" seems to have little purpose outside the casino. There's some promising sequences with him forcing De Niro to come down in the middle of the night to get him fifty million-dollar chips for a gambling rage, but, once again, once the story leaves the casino and starts getting involved with all the other stuff, it goes downhill.<br/><br/>But to the filmmakers' credit, having Pesci narrate part of the story does make his denouement all the more surprising. I will not give away exactly what happens, but the way things unfold toward the end, with Pesci's narration almost completely eradicating De Niro's, really does leave the audience unexpected for what eventually turns out. It's a brilliant touch.<br/><br/>I admired the physical production values of ""Casino"" as much as any great-looking movie I've ever seen, and Scorsese's flair as a director is very impressive. But even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself. And that's the coldest feeling a movie can possibly give you. Whether it's representational or not, when you get the notion that the filmmaker lost interest in the story he was telling, it's all for nothing."
"cashman1955","6","6","10","22 March 2012"," Roll dem bones
","Two people whose movies I try to avoid are Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone; Pesci is a one trick pony with a very tired act, and SS just nauseates me. So, clearly, I held off seeing Casino for many years. The other day it was at Half Price for a dollar so I picked it up. I always enjoy stories about Vegas; it's fun to peek behind the scenes of the casinos. This was one of the last good roles DeNiro had, before he descended into the Valhalla of romantic comedies with the likes of Ben Stiller. The good is simply the story itself, which is essentially true. (It is certainly NOT true that the mob was not skimming in Vegas until the 1970's). DeNiro was good, especially when he tried to deal with an old friend who he realized and always knew was an out of control idiot. DeN was clearly ready to jettison Pesci if that was what it took to keep the casino running, but was afraid he could not do so because Pesci was a made man and DeNiro, a Jew, was not and never could be. The scenes ""back East"" with the big boys were always well done; good supporting jobs by all involved. Don Rickles was good. The bad, aside from Pesci and Stone, were: the soundtrack; I felt it got in the way because it was continuous, too loud, and often at odds with the tone of what was showing on the screen. The lighting; in many scenes Scorsese put a hot spotlight on a character or a desktop. I just can't figure out what he was trying to do. The running narration was not needed after the first few scenes. All in all, I'd recommend it. Get a bottle of pure strength ammonia to sniff whenever Stone appears on the screen and you will be OK."

"MovieAddict2016","9","6","10","12 July 2005"," Despite some bad reviews on release, ""Casino"" is closer to Scorsese's older work than any of his other recent films...
","""Casino"" (1995), a visceral examination of the Mafia's influence on the casinos of Las Vegas in the 1970s, is also the so-called ""companion piece"" to Martin Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"" (1990). Both films star Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, and were written by Nicholas Pileggi.<br/><br/>Some even go so far as to claim ""Casino"" is a semi-remake of ""GoodFellas."" And many critics found flaws regardless of its connections to the earlier mob film. ""Go in interested and you may find your interest tested way past the limit,"" wrote Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle. ""'Casino' is not about people, just Vegas. It's an ambitious film -- but also a scattered, unfocused one."" Viewing the movie a decade after its release, it holds up well. The film's real strength lies in its narrative and unflinching examination of its characters. Sam Rothstein (played by Robert De Niro) isn't a nice guy, and never really gains our sympathy. Nicky (Pesci) occasionally exhibits acceptable behavior, but if the film has a villain, it's him. And Ginger (Sharon Stone in the best role of her career) is selfish, spoiled and depressing.<br/><br/>Critics didn't get it. ""'Casino' runs a little under three hours, but (you) will feel like it is at least five due to the plodding pace by editor Thelma Schoonmaker,"" wrote Internet critic Steve Rhodes. Rhodes, along with countless other reviewers, complained about the level of violence  suggesting an NC-17 rating would have been more appropriate.<br/><br/>Whether you will like ""Casino"" or not depends entirely on your tolerance for character-driven films  and, of course, heavy violence. Ironically, despite its flaws, ""Casino"" is closer to Scorsese's older work than any of his other recent films  ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"" did not feature likable people, either. Whereas we followed Henry Hill's journey from youth in ""GoodFellas"" and felt empathetic towards him, ""Casino"" drops us square in the middle of Sam's story and there's no connection  this will either alienate or enthrall you, depending entirely on your taste in cinema. I personally love studies of characters  especially ones that examine the evil inherent in man, and Scorsese is brilliant at revealing these things.<br/><br/>His movie exhibits recognizable elements  a whiz-bang style with quick-cuts, rapid zooms, a diverse pop-and-classical music soundtrack (with no less than four or five Rolling Stones songs), and of course, his famous tracking shots (here, he stages an impressive three-minute examination of a casino without breaking until we exit the front door). But ""Casino"" doesn't confine itself to the restraints of Scorsese's styling. Here he goes hog wild with the visuals (more so than usual anyway), soaking up the vivid colors of Las Vegas, absorbing the dizzying array of flashing bulbs and tacky bright clothing.<br/><br/>Editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time collaborator, experiments with digital editing for the first time here  and employs some new techniques that are subtle but make a subliminal impact. The title sequence, designed by Elaine and Saul Bass, is simultaneously dazzling and haunting.<br/><br/>The performances are almost flawless. De Niro is Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a legendary gambler who is chosen out of the blue to maintain a new casino for the Las Vegas Mafia. Sam explains the economics of the system  the mob take their cut of the profits, the rest goes where it should, and everyone remains happy  so long as nothing goes wrong.<br/><br/>When Ace's old friend Nicky shows up in Vegas he begins to orchestrate a ring of violent robberies  becoming the new leader of a vicious gangster force that threatens to destroy Ace's chances at cutting it straight. Since Nicky is a made man, and Ace is Jewish, he can't stop him  but fears their new lifestyle will only lead to misery.<br/><br/>In the meantime Ace falls for the beautiful call girl Ginger (Stone), who doesn't love Sam, but marries him for his wealth. Her heart really belongs to her ex-boyfriend/pimp (played by James Woods), and at first Ace believes he can tame her into submission; but her free spirit ruins their lives and destroys Ace's confidence.<br/><br/>The movie does have its blunders, and is not on the same level as ""GoodFellas,"" but would at least make the list a few titles beneath it. Some scenes seem unnecessary, and Nicky's violent attack with a pen does seem a bit reminiscent of an almost identical sequence in ""GoodFellas"" when Pesci attacks someone at a bar. And as enthralling and entertaining as ""Casino"" is, it never really matches the overall energetic exuberance of ""GoodFellas""  they are, despite their close ties, very different films in a cinematic sense.<br/><br/>Still, this is a great film, well made and daring. You'll probably either love it or hate it, but there's no denying its powerful impact on the viewer."

","Casino(1995) is a fascinating and terrific behind the scenes look at the mob undergoings in Las Vegas during the 1970's and early 80's.  It deals with things that were hinted at in The Godfather(1972).  Casino(1995) received mixed reviews during its release which was due to ignorance from most film critics.  This film is one of the reasons why Martin Scorsese is the best film-maker of his generation.<br/><br/>The opening credits are beautifully done using colors to a greater effect. Casino(1995) is a film that was most deserving of a Best Picture award in 1995.  It should be considered as one of the top films of the 1990's. This is an another example of Martin Scorsese being done in by the Academy Award voters as he should have at least five Best Director[Mean Streets(1973, Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), Goodfellas(1990), and Casino(1995)], and six Best Picture awards[Mean Streets(1973), Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), The Last Temptation of Christ(1988), Goodfellas(1990), and Casino(1995)].<br/><br/>
The infamous ""Batting Practice"" scene near the end of the film is one of the five most brutal and vicious sequences in a Scorsese Flick.  The first part of the film are a summary of events and the narrative does not begin until twenty minutes into the story.  Its filled with multiple voice overs from Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent.  It was written by the same man who wrote Goodfellas(1990).<br/><br/>Casino(1995) takes a look at the upper level mafia as Goodfellas(1990) looked into the lives of low to mid level hoods.  This film deals with the themes of excess, greed, power, and self-destruction.  Like in other Scorsese films, the violence here is sudden and comes out unexpectively. Robert De Niro as Sam is at odds between being loyal to his bosses and retaining some kind of intregity.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes that were really masterful.  One, the scene where Sam explains the different roles of the people working at the casino.  Two, the murders during the climax of the movie. Three, introductions of the main and minor characters in the story.<br/><br/>One asset of this movie is Scorsese's Utilization of music used to fit many scenes and situations.  It deals with the end of an era when the mob controlled Las Vegas.  The camera is always on the move as well as being fluid and steady.  The difference between this film and Scorsese's early works is this film doesn't have the gritty of of his 1970s films.<br/><br/>Casino(1995) is one of Martin Scorsese's three or four best films of the 1990's and that includes Goodfellas(1990), The Age of Innocence(1993), and Kundun(1998).  Casino was the eighth coraboration between Scorsese & De Niro.  Many scenes(gory ones) were cut from this feature in order to avoid an NC-17 rating.  Casino follows in the tradition of gangster epics ala, The Godfather(1972), The Godfather Part 2(1974), Scarface(1983), Once Upon A Time in America(1984), and Goodfellas(1990).<br/><br/>One of the film's best lines is ""Before she could start counting her money, the bosses back home decided to settle the case out of court, so they sent me"".  Everyone contributes to the excellent acting in Casino.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her life.  In my opinion, Sam Rothstein represents Martin Scorsese and the mob bosses symbolizes the Hollywood execs.<br/><br/>Casino is more a big budget lavish Independant film then it is a mainstream feature.  Robert De Niro as Sam plays him with unusual restraint espically for Robert De Niro.  Joe Pesci plays a more psychotic version of Tommy De Vito of Goodfellas(1990).  After getting brutally beaten by a Pesci character in Raging Bull(1980), and Goodfellas(1990), Frank Vincent finally gets a chance to return the favor.<br/><br/>Scorsese directs with the craft of an experienced pro.  Sam Rothstein is based on career of professional bookie Frank""lefty"" Rosenthal.  This would be the final appearence of the mother of Martin Scorsese in one of his movies.  Casino(1995) as many years pass is a movie that will be acknowledged as one of the director's all time greats."

","I just started Martin Scorsese's movies one by one. By far this is the best movie ever. After I saw this movie, I read about the goofs in this site and to be frank I observed only two of them and I watch movies very closely.This is one of the best examples where director actually glues your bum to the seat.<br/><br/>Absolutely no highs or lows in the movie, the tempo is carried from very first scene, continuing in every frame until the last one.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone gave amazing performance. I felt jealous and pitied at Sam, frightened at Nicky and hated Ginger. Amazing performers and superb action. I never ever felt that it was a movie and everything is screen-played.<br/><br/>With the naive experience in watching Marin's movies, I guess camera becomes a slave to Martin ( of course right after Coppola). Beautiful angles and wonderful screenplay.<br/><br/>And of course Nicholas Pileggi is genius to begin with and Martin Scorsese is another to go into Nicholas' head and produce the same.<br/><br/>A beautiful movie which actually defines an R rated film without any gross scenes."

","I am a modern movie buff (meaning my movie history starts with films like Scarface and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, not Casablanca or From Here to Eternity).  I have seen close to 500 movies in my day - everything from DC Cab to Fast Break to A Bronx Tale - and Casino is without a shadow of a doubt the best I have ever watched.  DeNiro is sublime, Stone gives the best performance of her career, and Pesci is at his obnoxious, menacing best. The costumes, the score, the dialogue.  My brother and I can have whole conversations with each other talking only in quotes from the flick: (""Mr. Clark I don't think you understand what it is I do.  ...  About the time I'm coming out of jail, hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma.  And I'll bust your head wide open again.  Cause I'm f***in' stupid."")  There was a time when I thought nothing could touch The Godfather II as the ultimate mob drama with a real plot and authentic characters who make you care.  Then I saw Casino during my sophomore year in college, and, for me, nothing has come close cinematically.  If you loved the gore of The Untouchables, then this is for you.  If you loved the tragedy of Carlito's Way, then Casino is for you.  If you loved the authenbticity of Donnie Brasco then this flick is for.  Hell, if you loved the warped, anal retentive Melvin Udall in As Good As It Gets, then Sam Rothstein will blow you away.  Whatever you want in a movie, you got it here - with the notable exception of minority actors, save a few Japanese ""whales"" inserted only for storytelling purposes.  I challenge any true movie critic to name three movies with more depth, a better plot, a better narrarator, better actors than this epic.  After 50 plus viewings I'm still searching."

You see the rise and fall of each of the main characters, how it starts psychologically effecting each of them. In my opinion this movie has the best personalities aside from sifi movies, each character is greedy but they get the things they want in different ways than the others.

","I have never seen a film that captures the place it's set in so perfectly: Las Vegas. It reveals all of the dirty secrets the city has. One of them is that in the end, they get it all. All the bright lights and the poker tables and the slot machines and the room upgrades and the prostitutes and the booze, all of that stuff, it's all been arranged just for them to get your money. They're the only winners, the players are only pawns. The characters in the film have incredible depth, most notably Sharon Stone's character. Sharon Stone does a powerhouse performance in this film, especially towards the end. The film also has one of the best soundtracks ever. This is not the quintessential gangster movie, but it's definitely up there."

","Any cinephile could easily place CASINO in their top 25 favorite movies ever. There have been countless times when I turned to the channel it was then being shown on - just to see what scene it's up to - and end up finishing the last two hours of the film. The way it arrests almost anyone's attention is one of the hallmarks of a Scorsese film, and it is in this aspect that movie-lovers find his genius. <br/><br/>The casting is superb. Ace Rothstein - played by Robert DeNiro, a Scorsese regular - is probably the perfect model of what every aspiring gentleman wishes to one day become. The gorgeous Sharon Stone's performance is probably the best in her career as Ginger, but it is really Joe Pesci who shines most in this film. From his accent to his attitude, Pesci perfectly depicts the kind of criminal Nicky Santoro and his real- life persona were.<br/><br/>Anyone who even casually likes movies should definitely invest the three hours and watch CASINO. The way Scorsese brings you into the world of the casino and shows you the then-criminal element of its inner workings will give every viewer that curious yearning to participate in the dangers and defiance that all great crime movies instill. While we watch, most of us know what is happening on the screen is wrong, yet somehow we all want to be a part of it - admittedly or not :)"
"DanielRobertRoss","9","3","4","24 May 2016"," Scorsese's underrated masterpiece
","Scorsese is my favorite director working today. From his first great film Mean Streets to Wolf of Wall Street, he's given the world some amazing movies. Some are better than others of course, but I would be hard pressed to say that's he's ever made a bad film. Casino, when first released, was unfavorably compared to Scorsese's Goodfellas, and it's easy to see why. Based on another Nicholas Pileggi crime novel, the returning cast members Robert DeNiro, Frank Vincent and Joe Pesci, a long running time and ""rise and fall of a gangster"" plot. <br/><br/>But while Goodfellas is my number one Scorsese film (Followed closely by Raging Bull), Casino has slowly become one of my favorites. The violence is still sometimes hard to watch, two scenes come to mind that in my opinion, rival anything in Goodfellas in terms of visceral, shocking brutality. The infamous torture scene is still shocking, comparable to the ear amputation in Reservoir Dogs. Scorsese's eye for detail and use of narration serves him well, and the acting is across the board excellent. Sharon Stone deservedly won an Oscar for her role as hustler Ginger McKenna. And Joe Pesci is on fine form as hot tempered, coked-up muscle Nicky Santoro. <br/><br/>The eclectic soundtrack is great, filled with 70s classics like Jeff Beck's ""I Ain't Superstitious"" and Boogaloo Down Broadway. Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing, capturing the gaudy style of the era perfectly. And longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker edits the film beautifully and doesn't shy away from the sometimes brutal violence. <br/><br/>There are a few flaws. You could trim about 10 minutes of Nicky Santoro and his gang (We get the point, they're bad guys). And Robert DeNiro looks about as Jewish as Vladimir Putin. But these are minor complaints. A great film that i'll watch over and over for years to come. Highly recommended."
"shtj72","10","3","4","27 February 2014"," Perhaps The Best Gangster Film I've Seen
","Just to give a bit of background, I thought I'd start by explaining what it actually takes for me to score a film 10/10, because at this point the top score on here has lost a lot of it's significance. Not that this is a serious issue obviously, but I thought I should open by stating exactly how good I think a film should be in order for it to justify a rating like that, and hopefully in doing so the point will be put across as to how highly I rate this film.<br/><br/>For me, a 10/10 film is a film whereby not only each and every facet of is at least of a very high standard, but one that is so good that there is literally no single aspect of it that stands out as being even marginally weak, whether that be the acting performance of a character, a particular scene/section of the film, the dialogue or any other aspect that could be picked up on. Right from the off, the film must set a standard and a tone and keep on that course so as to at least remain within the same bracket of quality, whilst also excelling in every possible aspect along the way. Any deviation from this path represents an imperfection in terms of the way the film is balanced, and as such will prevent a perfect 10/10 score from being given.<br/><br/>Given this criteria, take The Godfather as an example: a timeless masterpiece that is rightfully held up as one of the greatest films of all time. The acting is sublime, the plot is compelling and the characters are all well fashioned. Despite these strengths however, Michael's development at the start is not handled with the same precision and quality as the rest of the film in my opinion. It stands out as being more rushed and less carefully crafted when measured against the rest of the film, and I felt the opening stages were in need of a couple more scenes to bridge the early phases of the transformation with what followed. This stood out for me in context of the quality of the rest of the film, and I would therefore deduct half a point on that basis. The difference in quality here is enough for me to call it a sizable imperfection in a relative sense.<br/><br/>Another example to use is Once Upon A Time In America, which is sometimes labelled 'the best gangster movie ever made', with people highlighting the exceptional plot and the wonderful soundtrack by Ennio Morrocone. These are, of course, valid points - the music is amongst some of the finest ever made for film, and the plot is as absorbing as it is complex. That being said, the acting is considerably lower across the board than in other classics in similar genres (Goodfellas, Godfather I and II, City of God, etc), and the score is often applied over-indulgently: the melodies of Deborah's theme and the main theme for example are destroyed by the end of the film, and scenes are sometimes made to seem exaggerated and jarring as a result. On top of that, there are occasions whereby these beautiful melodies are highly inappropriate, with one particular rendition actually making me laugh loud because of how bizarre it was (hint: the Cleopatra part of the film, after the...incident...in the car).<br/><br/>For those reasons, despite it's strengths, that film is an 8/8/5 for me. Very good, but there are too many imperfections and imbalances.<br/><br/>Anyway, I give that brief analysis of those two up there in order to illustrate my view that there are no literally no such relative imperfections and imbalances to point out with Casino. The film starts off well paced and sharp, and from the very offset it maintains an extremely high standard of acting, storytelling and pacing throughout.<br/><br/>Even nitpicking, I cannot think of a single weakness, and on top of that the strengths are seriously strong. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, as usual, are fantastic in their roles, and I honestly can't remember ever seeing anyone play a character like Sharon Stone plays in this so well. For all the right reasons, she made me feel hateful, angry and unpleasant. I cowered and cringed because of how well it was acted, and I spent most of the time watching her thinking about how much I wanted her character to meet a horrible, yet just ending.<br/><br/>Seriously... this film is a must-watch. There are a lot of unfair, unfavourable comparisons to Goodfellas in here, but I honestly think this is better. Does Goodfellas keep up the same standard of plot like this does throughout? I don't think so personally - the closing scenes are slower and weaker, where as Casino maintains an extremely high level, delivering accordingly right at the end. The ending is satisfying (for whatever reason - no spoilers here), and the tension that has been built up throughout is sufficiently capitalised on. Goodfellas, on the other hand, more peters out by comparison.<br/><br/>That is obviously is not to criticise Goodfellas - as a film that's about as close to 10 as you can get without it being 10 in my opinion. It's just that Casino is better paced, more consistent and more complex and nuanced in its plot. As well as this, it gains from the greater emphasis on De Niro and Pesci, who both play superior, more fleshed out characters in this. <br/><br/>The combination of these two and Sharon Stone in conjunction with this plot makes for an absolute masterpiece, and I highly recommend this film to anyone with even a passing interest in film and Scorsese. I was in awe of it throughout and think that, alongside Raging Bull, it's probably the most underrated film I've come across so far on IMDb."
"thesar-2","10","3","4","30 April 2013"," A Trusted Gamble
","Talk with most guys, at least ones around my age and they'll tell you they're Goodfellas fans. In addition, or subtraction, they'll also mention Scarface and, no doubt, The Godfather I, II or both. (Laughably, no one ever seems to bring up III without wincing.) Me? I'm gambling Casino will be my mobster movie for all my days.<br/><br/>It's a safe bet. Revisiting Casino, for the first time in probably a decade, is like visiting an old friend. And for three hours, it's a ride I can't wait to take again. For, I've done it many times before.<br/><br/>I'm not one to like very long movies, or movies that move slowly – and before I go further, this is NOT one that ever moves a bit slowly. But, ever since it came out on video (originally on VHS, back then) I couldn't help myself. I literally watched this three-hour movie over and over. And over. To the point sometimes, when it went to credits, I would insert tape one (yeah, again, VHS, humph!) and start from the beginning.<br/><br/>I lovedand STILL DOthis movie so much, in so many ways, it was easy for me to continuously watch it. With this third purchase – VHS, DVD and now, BluRay, I can't wait to plug it to experience it another time.<br/><br/>This movie is so near perfect on so many levels and depths, it's hard to sum it all up in one review. The movie's onion layers keep surprising me with each viewing. And it's bonus of two movies in one is fantastic.<br/><br/>Movie One, or the first half, is made up of all-but fantastic, interesting and driven narration of how casinos work, the rise of the two best friends/street guys and the mobsters in 1970's Las Vegas. From all my research and first-hand experience, this mentality of the 1970's is fairly close to what it is today. In fact, it's almost dead-on. Naturally, some things do NOT happen today – the place is now like Disneyland: any bad press is VERY bad for the place. So, good luck in smashing a cheater's hands and not having a hundred reporters/bloggers tearing apart your casino the same hour.<br/><br/>Movie Two involves every bit of the mistakes these guys made in order to eventually rid Las Vegas of the mob. (There's a lot more to it than from this movie, but for this story, it's centered on these wise guys.) Originally, when I watched this countless times, I narrowed it down to one main slip-up: the firing of a connected relative. But, examining it this time, there were so many nudges to their house of cards, it's hard to add them all up. Each and every bump to the base playing cards had an involvement to everyone's downfall.<br/><br/>To top it all off, it's enormously interesting, fun, exciting and suspenseful to see how this well-laid based on true events played out. Oh, and I haven't even gotten to the acting.<br/><br/>I never once saw Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods (amongst others) on the screen. Ever. These people were truly Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, Nicky Santoro, Ginger McKenna and Lester Diamond, respectively. How each of these excellent performances did NOT win Oscars is beyond me. Actually, while we're at it, how the movie didn't get nominated for, and win, for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Score, etc...baffles me.<br/><br/>I digress. These performances were mesmerizing. Each in their own way. All the way down to James Woods, whom I felt did the best of his career and Sharon Stone showing incredible depth.<br/><br/>Beyond the incredible feats by the actors was the brilliant direction, cinematography, story, score, soundtrack and pacing. Never did this movie feel slow, nor did I ever ""check the time counter"" because it's nearly three hours. The movie just kept going and on the right course. The plot unfolds as it needs to and the recounting of events and voice-overs were just as interesting as what was on screen.<br/><br/>This movie was so powerful, as were the performances, that I almost rooted for De Niro's Ace. His gal, Ginger (Stone,) not so much. On a side note, she was fairly despicable and we wouldn't have hated her so much, if not for Stone's great take on her. (Or, again, the weasel, Woods as Lester.)<br/><br/>Normally, I would absolutely and readily admit that I love this movie ten times more than the already very good Goodfellas or Godfather series because I am a gambler and have always (since early teens) been infatuated with Las Vegas and its history. It would be obvious that I'm naturally biased because of the reasons just mentioned. But, I am being honest: past my obsession with both gambling and Vegas, I loved this movie on all levels. Yes, it does help that this gives me a much more in-depth view of a certain segment of Vegas' past, I still love the journey Director Martin Scorsese gives me eachand...every time."

","""Casino"" is a near perfect and almost classic crime film. Why ""almost""? Well, in my particular case, it reminds me of ""Goodfellas"" way too much. You know, the plot, some characters, violence, etc.<br/><br/>Being objective, I think ""Casino"" is very well made. It has excellent Direction courtesy of Mr. Scorcese who once again proves he's a top class act. He created a dynamic, slick, spectacular movie with the aid of avid camera angles and his well known style.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Robert De Niro demonstrates he's one of the most versatile actors in modern film history. His display of different emotions, courage, and temper is outstanding. His character required plenty of temper. Sharon Stone delivers a very good performance. She's a fine actress. Joe Pesci once again shows his incredible talent while portraying mobsters. James Woods and other supporting actors deliver memorable performances.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is splendid. You really get to feel the vibe of a casino even if it takes place in another era. The whole gambling, tactics, and obscure interests behind the business is impressing. <br/><br/>This should be considered as a classic crime film. The 90's had genre defining movies and ""Casino"" perfectly follwed the tendency. It brought to cinema something never explored that way and it generated plenty of follow-ups."
"ngs712","9","3","4","12 November 2008"," An Underrated Classic
","I haven't seen too many Scorsese films. I've seen The Departed, The Aviator, and 'most' of GoodFellas. I just watched Casino last night and I think I can say it is one of the best, most involving and well-directed films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is great, De Niro and Pesci giving wonderful performances of 'Ace' and Nicky, respectively. I haven't seen Sharon Stone in any film before, but she also gave a great performance as Ace's wife Ginger.<br/><br/>In a way, Casino is a companion piece to GoodFellas. However, it needs to be judged as a film in it's own right. GoodFellas is a great movie, one that almost anyone can enjoy. But Casino, to me, is more in depth and gives a much more detailed look into the 'big' mobs, the ones that ran Vegas.<br/><br/>The photography is great, especially the camera movement. The voice-over narration may be more than you heard in GoodFellas, but in a way it's necessary to get into the minds of Nicky and Ace. It's like a documentary and these guys are just giving us the facts. Not using a traditional film score also helps to make it feel more 'natural', the pop music selected to give exactly the right mood to its respective seen. Particularly the 'House of the Rising Sun' played towards the end over a sort of 'epilogue'. It not only fit's the scene, but the film as a whole.<br/><br/>I think it's hard to actually say or write what this film is about, like any great film. All you can do is watch it and find out for yourself."

"joelparkjools","10","3","4","12 January 2006"," Critics have issues
","OK where do i begin, i'm flabbergasted! that Casino doesn't get the attention it deserves. Most critics will say ooo it's just a rehash of Mean Streets and Goodfellas. The film has similarities yes, he uses the same actors playing similar characters yes, but don't you think Scorsese realizes this, don't you think he casted them for this very reason! He not only uses the same actors, he uses the same songs on occasion, he even repeats shots, but in order to give the shot a different meaning. For me Casino is the third and probably final installment of his mob trilogy. With each film he climbs higher up the ranks! Mean Streets starts with local hoods, Goodfellas to the more organized gangsters and Casino to the very top of the chain. I think Casino is probably the finest out of the three, it is certainly the best to look at. The cinematography and use of sound in particular are almost unparalleled. He even uses music from Jean-Luc Godard's Le Mepris, which contrasts the two relationships that are falling apart. Do you really think Casino is just an overlong sequel, do you really think Scorsese would stoop that low. The editing alone is probably the best of his career. Critics are always afraid to pride new films over the classics (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull). Now they are great films don't get me wrong, but i believe Casino deserves to be up there with them, more so than Goodfellas. Some critics have gone on to the say the film fizzles out after the first act? What film were they watching, do they know nothing about narrative pacing. If the film were to continue the pace of the first act i think the majority of the audience would have heart attacks, if they don't anyway. Now get this, it's from the Rolling Stone review. OK, 'What trips up Casino is its straining toward art'. So what exactly do they think Scorsese should be straining for, it doesn't sound like they need a great deal of straining for their reviews. It's little comments like this that really get under my skin. OO Casino's too long, if you think you can put across that much information in a shorter time then you're welcome. OK, that's enough for one night, Casino is an epic gangster masterpiece. A landmark of the 90s. It's not Goodfellas no, in my opinion it's better. However, it does require the viewer to have seen Goodfellas to completely understand what Scorsese is trying to say. I hope time will give this film the recognition it deserves."

Once again partnering with the incomparable Robert De Niro and another of his favorite collaborators, Joe Pesci, he once again elicits superb performances. He also gets Sharon Stone to give the best performance of her career. The fact that the very talented James Woods would sign on to be the fourth wheel is a testement to Scorcse's reputation. Even Don Rickles adds something. He has an expression that if you mess with Ace, dire consequences will ensue.

Seen through their eyes, each as a foil to the other, the details of mob involvement in the casinos of the 1970's and '80's are revealed. Ace is the smooth operator of the Tangiers casino, while Nicky is his boyhood friend and tough strongman, robbing and shaking down the locals. However, they each have a tragic flaw--Ace falls in love with a hustler, Ginger,played by Sharon Stone, and Nicky falls into an ever-deepening spiral of drugs and violence.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely one of the best made about the mob.It definitely ranks up there with The Godfather and another Scorsese film,Goodfellas. Excellent story and acting are both characteristics of the movie.The story was great in the sense that it focuses on the excesses of language, of violence, of ambition in the life-styles of the rich and infamous which makes the movie smart from start to finish.Also,great performances were given by the lead stars De Niro,Stone and Pesci.

Repeated viewings get better and better, but I was star-struck while watching ""Casino"" originally...and I'm sure you will feel the same. ""Casino"" is an amazing achievement. Many kudos Mr. Scorsese.<br/><br/>It would be a mistake not to mention the tremendous cast...and they all bring their best work to the table. Sharon Stone, in particular, was tremendously impressive. Put it this way: When I originally seen ""Casino"" for the first time, Stone was one of my least-favorite actresses. After the movie, she was my favorite. She didn't just play ""Ginger"", she owned her! If I was asked my opinion on the ""Best Supporting Actress of all-time"", my vote would be Stone in ""Casino"". One of the best performances of all-time. Not to be overlooked is some of the all-time film greats in Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and James Woods. I am having difficult coming up with adjectives worthy enough to describe their performances. It's just an outstanding movie, played by outstanding actors, with outstanding direction.<br/><br/>""Casino"" is like a theme park for movie-going adults. It has it all...Violence (including one absolutely BRUTAL scene to watch), gangsters, drugs, sex and plenty of profanity. But it's also about loyalty, friendships and relationships...in a gangster sort of way. Ever wondered what daily life would be for a mob-dealing gangster? Or a hit-man? Or a married whore? Or a pimp and golf hustler? ""Casino"" covers it all! Just sit back with your favorite drink or cigar...and ENJOY!!! :) <br/><br/>Thanks for reading...now go see Casino!<br/><br/>JD"

","This is based on 2-Disc Special Edition release. I have not read the book, nor did I know anything about the real people this was based(apart from what's on the Trivia page). And yes, in case you have heard... this is quite similar to Goodfellas. There's the obvious, such as Pileggi writing the novels behind both, and some of the same cast. Beyond that, though, the story-telling(such as the frequent and effective use of voice-over monologues, and multiple narrators, I could go on) and overall flavor are similar. And why not? It fits for one as well as the other and they're well-done and not the exact same film(having watched one does not mean you've already seen the other, I'll put it that way). The plot is engaging and interesting throughout. Characters are credible, well-developed and consistent. The acting is excellent, for everyone involved(including the kids). DeNiro and Pesci nail their roles, Stone gives what may be the most powerful performance of her career, and Woods is spot-on as always when given appropriate material. The dialog is impeccable, with countless memorable and well-delivered lines. Cinematography and editing are marvelous. The music is great, the score well-composed, and they are used expertly throughout this. This has constant strong language, plenty of brutal, bloody violence, disturbing content and a bit of sexuality. The DVD holds deleted scenes(among them an outtake or two) and six featurettes, four of which are on this site, and that I will review individually, the last two being a documentary called Vegas and the Mob and an episode of a History Channel show entitled True Crime Authors, both of them well worth the time. I recommend this to any fan of Scorsese and/or anyone else who helped make this. And that's that. 8/10"
"neon47","8","4","6","5 May 2006"," One of the most under-rated movies ever.
","Most people I know haven't seen the true-story brutality that is Casino. Taking place in the early 1980s, two mob friends, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are put in charge of a Las Vegas casino. Their job? To make certain everything runs smooth and to make sure that the bosses get their black bag of money. What happens? To put it into a short context: things start to fall apart. The dysfunction represented in this movie is amazing, every little thing leads to something worse. The beginning shows the rise of the Mafia's empire in Las Vegas: from the towering casinos to the floors of the casino, you get a little taste of everything in here. What's really interesting is that if you played by the rules, they treated you like gold, but if you double crossed them things could get pretty ugly (see the hammer scene). Casino, put simply, is a great movie. The only problem I experienced was that there were parts that seemed to drag out. The movie weighs in at a hefty 2hrs and 59min so don't expect to go anywhere soon. If you haven't see this yet then give it a chance, it really is a great movie."
"madato","10","4","6","31 January 2006"," Greatest Movie of the Genre
","Easily surpasses Godfather and Goodfellas. The story is written very carefully and presented beautifully, with perfect narratives and dialogue throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The characters are quite complex and display much depth, played by actors that live and breathe for these roles. Robert De Niro couldn't have been better; even though he plays similar characters in flawlessly in many other movies, this one hit the jackpot. Sharon Stone's performance is exceptional, especially during the end of the movie, I wouldn't be surprised if she really was on drugs just for the movie. Joe Pesci hits the same note as De Niro -the highest one. Like De Niro, he plays similar characters in other movies, but in this movie it fits in with the other characters and the story so obviously, it wouldn't have been the same without him, nor his character. Like all other mafia-type movies De Niro and Pesci have been in, their characters, in contrast, portray a wide spectrum of opposite attitude, feelings, and motivation that is simply entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>In a style parallel to ""Goodfellas"" that's become the signature of Martin Scorsese, this movie might seem like just a repetitive sequel set in Las Vegas. But don't be fooled, this film is as underrated as Titanic is/was overrated, whether you judge by popularity, box office gross, or critics' ratings (or even IMDb's present user rating). Casino is a masterpiece and will not disappoint keen viewers."

","If you're ever trapped in your own house with that clueless neighbor who you wish would go home , it's good to have a copy of Casino in your DVD collection. Repeated viewing does not diminish the entertainment value of this film. At all. Maybe it's because each and every facet of the production is of the highest order. Scorsese really pulls out the stops. The three-ring storyline is engrossing. And the casting might be the best I've ever seen ,especially the Remo character who's method-acting/ non-acting helps steal every scene he's in. And Bach's St.John's Passion plays over the opening credits and an Adagio(?)at the end- I mean, this movie has everything! Did I mention this is the best gangster movie since the 1931 version of Public Enemy? Three hours is not enough but wadya gonna do?"
"ea701","6","4","6","22 April 2003"," Too much.
","Is Casino a poor movie? Of course it is not. After all, the constituent elements are there and one can almost foretell a delectable piece on the dark underbelly of Vegas told through a true master's aesthetics. If the same breakneck verve that abounded in 'Goodfellas' was applied to the already radiant Las Vegas, is it not logical to think that something truly stunning should ensue?<br/><br/>The opening title sequence is enough to make your mouth water as the significance and seriousness of the tale is immediately conveyed through the gracefully falling body of De Niro and a backdrop of Bach's fine choral piece. However, somewhere along the line the screws went undone and someone must have forgotten to carry the 2. Casino left me feeling like the proverbial s***. Though the violence cannot be deemed gratuitous, something about the film is so dark and depressing, the final product is little short of off-putting. The obvious fault is the length, but there is a myriad of other problems that force Casino to trudge along while Goodfellas flew by.<br/><br/>
All in all, definately not a waste of time, but have something cheerful lined up later."
"melisande55","1","21","50","6 January 2007"," It sucks
","I decided to give Scorsese one last chance (I'm now trying to erase the entire film from my mind, and Mr. Scorsese's name, as well). I understand he's supposed to be a great director and that the acting is supposed to be great (I just don't see it - and I tried *very* hard to see good things in this film. I paid to rent it, I wanted to like it. How can someone ruin a movie about my favorite themes - Vegas and the mob? I mean, I'll watch practically anything about this topic.<br/><br/>This movie's pacing is arbitrary and amateurish. Scorsese knows he has to provide some gruesome violence at some point - we were checking the time of this flick at 1 hour, wondering when it would *ever* be over. I figured then that the violence would be immediate, gratuitous and upcoming - merely because it had to be there, to keep anyone watching. So there it was. A TV-style shoot-out, followed by torture scene (don't worry, I'm not spoiling much) that's filmed with overly artsy and arbitrary camera angles. I've never seen a film that relied so heavily on narration. What was Scorsese thinking? That he'd get remembered for having the most over-narrated film in world history? There are TWO overly wordy narrators, but you can't make up for the lack of cinematic action and believability on the screen - unless you are watching this during a cocktail party or something. Or you really like movies that don't require a strong plot, and blast you occasionally with set decor or violence.<br/><br/>The sets are great - that's what kept me going through the movie, but set design and production design do not a great film make. He should have DeNiro be naked to provide interest, though. DeNiro does his obligatory pug-dog face, with the wrinkled forehead way too much, and that bobbing and swaying thing where he crosses his arms and looks intense way too much.<br/><br/>The side characters are overwrought and stupidly dressed (that huge bolo turquoise guy is an example). Once again, Scorsese is like a cartoonist that hates cartoons. He can't even put meaningful props around the set, they appear to be symbolic (but apparently are not) and he shows us all kinds of things that never come into play (that's just bad directing - very B movie, actually). I guess I can see how a movie like this one (cartoony) can be popular, though - I just can't handle the shifts in tone and pacing throughout the flick. There are too many scenes where the frame is tilted, comic book style, that have NO comic book content - and where in addition the acting and dialog are overshadowed by set decor or costume - and the dialog/events do not move the movie forward. Why do that? And why then force so much narration (in a boring tone, mostly from DeNiro) onto the audience? I love B movies, and was prepared to view this entry as Scorsese's attempt to make one, to forgive him all the other directorial excesses he's been guilty of. If he had done that - at all, I would have liked it. Or if we'd seen naked Sharon Stone (that's how bad this was - I was praying for Sharon to lose her panties in that one scene, or at least give DeNiro a blow job, but no - nothing).<br/><br/>The Italian mobsters and their food look fake and last minutey - as though someone composed those scenes on a Sunday morning, with a hangover, using the most obvious and basic film student style composition techniques and set pieces. Even the decor failed at many points - and it didn't have to.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, Martin, if you're reading (which I doubt - if I had made this film, I'd never read anything critical about it, I'd never want to remember I'd made it) - merely sticking old slot machines in little trios on the floor here and there to denote ""basement"" doesn't work. Neither does using geometric window patterns or Renaissance colors to provide visual distraction to make plot elements loom large when in fact, it's just standard stuff. Watch a Tarantino movie, will ya?"
"Figaro14","6","7","13","23 September 2005"," Grim and depressing
","While I realize this is based (inspired?) (adapted?) from a true story, nonetheless the main characters are truly disgusting people. I find absolutely nothing redeeming in any of them. This makes the film itself quite difficult to endure.<br/><br/>I think a documentary on the history of the Las Vegas casinos would be far more interesting than watching these people commit unspeakable acts of cruelty in the name of greed. I know there's suppose to be a social message in here somewhere, but its somehow lost in all the screaming and horrible beatings we have to witness along the way. The plot line of the unhealthy relationship between Sharon Stone's character and DeNiro's grows tiresome very quickly and I found myself wanting this film to be over with much much sooner. The one good thing I can say about it is that it makes me want to never visit Las Vegas again."
"michael_the_nermal","4","9","18","18 December 2008"," Too Much Expository Narration and ""F"" Bombs
","This movie could have been a very interesting drama about Las Vegas gangsters, but Martin Scorsese ruins it with the film-making technique he used in ""Goodfellas"": expository narration. It was annoying in ""Goodfellas,"" but is very heavily used here. Instead of letting the action guide the plot, he has characters give background narration for every single point of action in the damned film. You're TOLD rather than SHOWN what happened. If I wanted to be told something, I'd read a book. Movies a re more interesting when character dialogue and action move the plot. Narration slows the movie down to a grinding halt.<br/><br/>Oh, and there's ""Casino's"" claim to fame: the most uses of the ""F"" word in an English-language non-documentary film. Every other word is ""F"" this and ""F"" that. I know gangsters are tough, macho men who love to speak dirty, but this is way too much. Again, this is where action may have helped to convey the characterization of tough gangsters, rather than the ""F"" word every second. This film needed better dialogue. ""The Godfather"" has excellent dialogue, and though there are dirty words, it's balanced out by intelligent writing. ""Casino"" doesn't have going for it in terms of good writing, unless it's to show that the Vegas mob was run by a bunch of unintelligent morons who can't form a complete sentence without the ""F"" word.<br/><br/>The acting is extreme and over-the-top. Sharon Stone is less than spectacular as a drug-addled, high-strung moll. She's either laughing or screaming, and nothing more. She chews the scenery like a starving pit bull. De Niro does little but blend into the background. Joe Pesci seems like his SNL caricature, screaming and squeezing heads into vices.<br/><br/>Granted, I'm interested in the history of the Las Vegas mob, and this movie is based on a nonfiction book; but the writing was bad, and the narration device distracted from my enjoyment of the action. I didn't like ""Goodfellas,"" but it was leaps and bounds superior to this dreck. I do not recommend this, except maybe for a rental. Watch the DVD extras that feature an A&E documentary on the real Las Vegas mafia."
"gcd70","3","12","26","18 March 2008"," Goodfellas rehash
","Enough rehash already! Although not a remake in the traditional sense, ""Casino"" is a virtual re-presentation of Martin Scorcese's '91 smash ""Goodfellas"". Now that was a great gangster film. Graphically violent, self absorbed, bitingly funny, brooding and epically proportioned, it was a knockout. Not so ""Casino"".<br/><br/>This is a real exercise in excess, and one that completely backfires on Scorcese and his team. The film is terribly overlong at three hours, and many will struggle to pay attention the entire time, especially given the narrative which has leads De Niro, Pesci and others talking us through the whole show, another big miscalculation.<br/><br/>The movie is far too violent, being often hard to stomach rather than effectively portraying the characters and their personalities and motivations. It's just one long, drawn out gangster show set in Las Vegas that is spotted with bursts of gruesome violence. In short, Scorcese and co-writer Pileggi have used exactly the same formula that they employed in adapting the latter's first book ""Wise Guys"" (""Goodfellas"") to the screen, which made that film a sensation, and this one a mindless bore.<br/><br/>Performances are strong, especially Sharon Stone as the hopeless drug fiend Ginger whose love of money proves her undoing. She is well deserving of the Oscar nomination that has come her way. De Niro and Joe Pesci, though impressive, are really only reprising their original ""Goodfellas"" turns. De Niro's Jimmy 'the Gent' Conway is very similar to his Sam Rothstein, the Jewish gambling icon who ran ""The Tangiers"" for the mob. And Pesci's Nicky Santoro, the ultra-violent, crazy mob guy assigned to look after Rothstein, is a dead ringer for Tommy De Vito, his violent, paranoid persona from ""Goodfellas"". Other support players make the most of their limited roles.<br/><br/>Definitely under edited, tale could have been told in less than two hours, but Scorcese had to over indulge didn't he. Robert Richardson's camera work is impressive, though even he seems to be trying too hard. Perhaps that's just the whole feel of the movie. An over-rated, over the top, over inflated waste. Art and sets are incredibly lavish, while the costumes are wild but spot on. PS I bet Pileggi's book is great reading.<br/><br/>Sunday, March 24, 1996 - Knox District Centre"
"hall895","6","6","11","1 July 2005"," GoodFellas in Vegas...it was better in New York
","Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a GoodFellas rehash. Casino is not a bad film. But it pales in comparison to what has come before it. It would be much easier to applaud Casino if we could take it on its own merits. But the parallels to GoodFellas are so numerous and so obvious, Casino always leaves us wanting more. We've seen this all before and we've seen it done better.<br/><br/>Casino starts quite literally with a bang with a rather shocking car bombing before the opening titles have even rolled. It's a fascinating and highly intriguing opening but Casino never is able to sustain that energy. The film slogs along for three hours with the pace so slow that at times the movie seems to come to a dead stop. Scorsese has, even in his most brilliant successes, been criticized for the pacing (or lack thereof) in his films. Casino is a prime example of a Scorsese film that would have benefited greatly if the action could have been pushed along just a little bit faster. There's a terrific story here, top-notch acting performances and the typically brilliant Scorsese visual touches. What's missing is the energy a film like GoodFellas had. For all that Casino has going for it, in the end it's simply not entertaining enough.<br/><br/>After the shock of the opening sequence, Casino goes back in time ten years to tell the story of Ace Rothstein, as played by Robert De Niro. We see he is running, on behalf of Midwestern mob bosses, the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas. Through use of voice-over narration (a la Goodfellas) Rothstein, and later Joe Pesci's Nicky Santoro, explain how the money moves through the casino and into the hands of the mafia kingpins. As the story begins everybody's getting paid, everything's running smoothly, everybody's happy. When mafia tough guy Santoro, played wonderfully by Pesci who could do this type of thing in his sleep, takes up residence in Vegas things start to unravel. Santoro's a hothead, out to make a quick buck for himself. Where Rothstein had been free to operate his casino in peace, when Santoro starts stirring things up he brings unwanted attention from the authorities. Rothstein's wife, Ginger, is not helping matters by being constantly drunk, stoned or drunk and stoned. Sharon Stone plays Ginger and the character is such a train wreck it's hard to really evaluate Stone's performance. She's certainly convincing as a glamorous call girl early on, perhaps less convincing when she's forced to be hysterically screaming all the time.<br/><br/>Anyhow, Ace ends up having problems with the wife, problems with the authorities and problems with his onetime good friend Nicky. It's fascinating to see all the conflict swirl around him and De Niro is reliably brilliant in his performance as he deals with all the madness around him. Pesci is terrific and Stone is OK. Actors playing smaller roles also do noteworthy work. James Woods does well in a bit part as a man who is part of Ginger's past. Frank Vincent (GoodFellas parallel number 8,362 or thereabouts) settles into his mobster's role quite easily. And Don Rickles and Dick Smothers of all people have serious parts to play and each does a fine job. So, the acting certainly isn't the problem. The main characters, and some of the secondary ones, are wonderfully developed. Casino is beautifully photographed as you would expect from Scorsese. And the story is a good one, intriguing from beginning to end. It's in that long journey from beginning to end where Casino stumbles somewhat. It just takes too long to get where we're going and the film can't sustain the energy it opened with. A fascinating story, but in the end one that with a better pace could have been told in a much more entertaining way."

","Martin Scorsese's Casino is in my opinion one of the best movies of the 90s. Every character in this movie is believable because of the great performances of the actors. Especially Stone's performance as the con-artist trophy wife is truly memorable.<br/><br/>Scorsese never fails to amaze me. From Mean Streets to Goodfellas I loved every one of his movies. His movies are usually dark and gritty pieces but in Casino I experienced a new side of Scorsese. This movie has a big epic feeling to it unlike other of his movies. And it works so well. The film is very beautiful to watch because of the great cinematography and score. Scorsese seems to have an ability to make movies with very different kind of looks. And in this movie, I think he mixed his directing techniques of Age Of Innocence and Goodfellas. Like Age Of Innocence, it has a clean look, but the characters and dialog reminded me of Goodfellas (maybe also because of the topic of this movie).<br/><br/>Like all the Scorsese movies, this one is also a great character driven, sometimes dark and tragic, sometimes wild and brutal piece of cinema art. Each character of this movie is well developed and deep. The movie is 3 hours long, but it had me hooked from the (great) starting scene up till the very ending shot.<br/><br/>Must see movie"

You don't really know what happened to the main character's (Robert DeNero) wife and kid. I am not that huge of fan of Sharon Stone but besides that I really can't fathom why she was nominated for an Oscar for this. Joe Pesci pretty much plays the exact same short tempered jerk that he plays in Goodfellas. Only this time he is his own boss. It was so long too. I liked how The Simpsons parodied the scene in this movie where Robert DeNero has a guy's hand hit with a hammer. That scene isn't that great either. I also didn't care for the amount of cussing in this movie. It had 422 uses of the Fword. Which is a record. Almost every single line in this movie used the Fword. I know Goodfellas used the Fword but not nearly as much as this movie did. Overall this movie was boring and I didn't really like any of the characters."

"lllinggg","6","6","13","25 January 2004"," Worth Experiencing
","It is unfortunate that 'Casino' is usually perceived merely as a critique of the Mafia. Much more than a cliché condemnation of the criminal underworld, the film delivers a mordant 'j'accuse' against the degradation of the self-destructive socioeconomic system (including cops, government bureaucrats, politicians) that generated and institutionalized the Mafia's role in contemporary Americana.<br/><br/>Upon relocating to Las Vegas, childhood friends Sam Rothstein and Nicky Santoro (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) submit their gangster experience to the disposal of the local mob network, which controls the gambling industry. Rothstein rapidly excels as a Mafia-sanctioned casino manager luxuriating in a Roman lifestyle, while Santoro successfully commands the rougher, more violent aspects of the underworld business. Soon, however, their virulent lifestyles and incessant greed leads them to a downward spiral of confrontation and deceit, accentuated by their common lust for femme fatale Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone).<br/><br/>This fascinating Franco-American co-production ought to be commended for its caustic inquiry into the rotten economic foundations of the American dream. Moreover, it achieves this without seriously compromising its solid cinematic components (storytelling, cinematography and overall cohesion), while also giving prominence to Stone's extremely well-acted, visible female character, amid all the Mafiosi male chauvinism. <br/><br/>On the downside, the screenplay is often vaporous, and some of the inevitable violence is truly stomach churning. Yet these deficiencies should not discourage hardened fans from taking a look. Worth experiencing, 6.5 stars out of 10."
"Rimmer-10","6","6","13","30 November 1998"," Too violent and too long
","Well - Martin Scorsese likes to make very violent movies (Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Cape Fear, etc.) but does he need to do it for any purpose. Why can't he just cut out some of the violent scenes in Casino and reduce the movie to a 2 hour show. After all - I got the picture of a very violent environment after the tenth bullet in the head. I do not need to see every  killing (a lot) in the story - I do not need to see people getting tortured, burried alive and hit with baseball bats all the time. Even when characters of secondary importance to the story got wacked we saw it all.<br/><br/>And the language is very abusive. I don't think Joe Pesci's character spoke a sentence in the whole movie without saying the f-word. Does it have to be that way.<br/><br/>Not for me. I can tolerate violence and abusive language, but only if it is used to describe the environment or is important to the story. Martin Scorsese uses these two things in Casino only to amuse the audience.<br/><br/>Guess what - I'm not amused.<br/><br/>I rank this movie as 6 of 10. The reason for the high score is the - after all - exciting story and a very good performance by Robert de Niro."
"Cristi_Ciopron","4","7","16","14 September 2008"," Standard Scorsese rubbish
","The unsavory, trite,dull Mrs. Stone was the very wrong choice for her role; De Niro keeps telling about how she charmed everybody and was a sex goddessrubbish, she looks like a hag! Pesci makes a good role, and Woods too. The main objection against all these mafia dramas (Coppola, Leone ) is their premisethey tend to be characterdriven, which is wrong. They pretend that the mobs portrayed are interesting as peoplei.e., as drama characters. They're not. That is why Pesci and Woods are good, while De Niro flops once againthe first two have wellwritten roles. The directors behave as if the hoodlums they are filming are Kane or the Ambersons, and not some scumbags.<br/><br/>It has zero human content. For a thriller, a genuine one, it is lousy and pretentious and almost flaccid. Who invented Scorsese, anyway? CASINO is meant to be satirical and sometimes funny; but Scorsese is one of the least witty persons in the whole Hollywood. The characters are such that you can not relate to; and not a single stream of sympathy is allowed. It is addressed and meant for the most dubious audience. It's MTV style is banal and vulgar. I mean Scorsese would have been supposed to narrate intelligently about brutes; but the story itself is rubbish.<br/><br/>CASINO is a MTVstyle brutal extravaganza, mindless and remarkably empty, devoid of any emotion and idea, and of overwhelming, overbearing bad taste; Scorsese boasts in cinematographic tricks that at least at the age he was when he made CASINO should have seemed less appealing to him. Pesci's performance is the only good thing in it (Woods, as I said, is very good too, yet his scenes are too few). Like other Scorsese flicks, CASINO takes pride in a sort of mean, cold, empty, academic formalism ,very conventional and dull. That's why Scorsese (even less than Coppola or Palma) says nothing to many cinema buffs."

I found the aging and diminutive Joe Pesci a little hard to believe as a Mafia enforcer and his ""love"" scene with Sharon Stone is unintentionally comical.<br/><br/>Brutally violent, overly long, and with few laughs to break the monotony, I actually found myself looking at my watch halfway through. Non-stop narration is distracting and an odd choice for Scorcese."

","Martin Scorcese is a film legend. No matter what anyone might say about any of his films, his reputation is unimpeachable. Even his misfires have terrific scenes. ""Casino"" isn't a misfire - far from it - but only manages to be a good film weighed down by the ponderous style and overly didactic expressionism that is Scorcese at his worst.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" was a Scorcese classic. This isn't ""Goodfellas,"" but it sure feels like a mediocre extension of it. For what it is, ""Casino"" is enjoyable. Unfortunately, one of the hurdles that lesser Scorcese films face is that they bring to mind his better work. This is especially a problem when one of his films uses similar themes and even actors from his classics. Here, we have Joe Pesci from ""Goodfellas"" doing his angry mobster shtick again, and Deniro also reprising his standard wise-guy turn. Further, we have crude hoodlums increasingly turning on each other, having mundane personal problems that cross over into their ""work,"" and exhibiting increasingly bizarre behavior after starting out seemingly in complete control. Sound familiar? Well, it probably does if you've seen ""Goodfellas"" or many other, better Scorcese films.<br/><br/>Robert Deniro, who at times is brilliant and at times seems to be suppressing a smirk in his ""love"" scenes, overall is fine as a middle-level mob boss who mistakenly begins to believe he is the top dog. So, we have the age-old theme of the inevitable mistake of taking your actual bosses for granted. Throw in Joe Pesci as his old friend who reaches the same conclusion about himself, and watch events unfold. Anyone who's seen mob films stretching at least back to ""The Godfather Part II"" on down the line has to see this train racing down the tracks. No real surprises, standard decline-and-fall stuff relieved by the usual Scorcese flourishes which, alas, went over much better elsewhere.<br/><br/>Sharon Stone is the empty center of this film, despite the fact that it supposedly is about Deniro's character. As the antagonist out to smash Deniro's controlled world, she is set up as the biggest thing in Vegas. She has to be for her character to work. Unfortunately, but none of that comes across, at least it didn't to me. Not enough time was spent on her character to show why at first she was so popular (which is odd, considering how long this film goes on), so her inevitable decline doesn't strike the emotional chord it should. Reviewers like to say she deserved the Academy Award, but I don't see it. She does get numerous histrionic moments, but then leaves huge gaps in her devolution. Her character lacks continuity. Stone gives two performances, one as a reluctant bride (why?), and then one as an increasingly unhappy wife (again, why?). Admittedly, she does a good job of acting, but it all seems forced and like, well, acting. Her character didn't grab me.<br/><br/>The single most annoying aspect of this film is a self-indulgent Scorcese trademark that reached its nadir here and in ""Gangs of New York."" You may find it charming, or helpful, or entertaining, but to me it is downright distracting and needless. That is a banal historical (this is ""semi-fictional"" in the worst way) explanation and constant narration by the Deniro and Pesci characters which continues right to the end. A little of that works, but it gets way out of hand. The characters repetitiously ""explain"" things that don't need to be explained. For example, the narrator will say, ""And then she hit bottom and blew her money on drugs and pimps,"" and we see Stone stumbling down a hallway, doing her mighty best to show herself ""hitting bottom."" ""And when they found her body...."" and she immediately falls down in the hallway, right on cue. Nice acting, Sharon! The technique is patronizing. It is as if Scorcese is directing the film toward people who are complete blank slates, and know nothing about people, or history, or motivations. But, in reality, the audience is not stupid. It can be trusted to draw the appropriate conclusions, given a story rather than a monologue with accompanying moving pictures. I think Scorcese forgets himself sometimes. I think most viewers would find thinking things through themselves more enjoyable.<br/><br/>In other words, skip the quasi-documentary stuff, and this would be a far superior film.<br/><br/>Despite my major quibbles, I enjoyed the film because it does transport you to another time and place, Vegas in the early '70s, before, as Deniro the narrator so unnecessarily (but characteristically) explains, ""It became Disneyland."" The fashions (Deniro sporting a gold lamé suit is a riot) alone are worth the time. Just try not to compare this film to true classics."
"holsu","8","3","5","7 January 2010"," Very good movie
","I've just lately learned myself to dig Scorsese movies as much as I do. Casino is actually a very good example of what it's all about. A long movie (almost 3hours) with lots of characters, explicit violence, dark humour, beautiful cinematography and very good acting. Robert de Niro plays the jew Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein who's getting in charge of a casino in Las Vegas. After a good start things start messing up themselves. Rothstein falls in love with the wrong girl (Sharon Stone) and his gorilla (if you can call Joe Pesci gorilla) is getting way out of line. Casino turns out to a quite basic gangster movie. <br/><br/>Robert de Niro reaches one of his best performances ever as Rothstein. Sharon Stone is very good as Rothstein's girlfriend. I guess the Academy at this point understood her potential since she got nominated for Oscar. With Basic Instinct she should've gotten it. Joe Pesci is as good as he always is playing the same character. He really got his way of pronouncing the F-word. Also there are a lot of smaller roles with older actors who really gotten themselves looking like mafia bosses. <br/><br/>All in all a very good movie as long as you take the time to concentrate on it."

Sharon Stone was good too,was really beautiful though she looked like a stoned whore most of the time.Too much of vulgarity coming out from her mouth didn't look appeasing. But all the same , she still looked good, added to the theme of the movie certain sanguine elements or <br/><br/>though the storyline is a little complex to understand if you don't pay attention in the first 30 minutes,because that's when the action unfolds, us getting introduced to the world of money making in casinos.<br/><br/>top of the line vulgar dialogs,hard hitting acting by the lead actors,and the helpful narration in between times in the film,really enhance the film's value. sharp and nice dialogs.totally different stuff. they all actually send you into the movie. you get into it and get the feelings the movie spurts out. totally brute and clear. so very mesmerizing. an altogether another genre in totality. seriously, couldn't expect much more from the director. he's done it many times. he's just natural at it. so natural. i was actually left wondering after the 3hrs of the film - if i ever had watched another such engrossing entertaining thrilling hard hitting flick ever of that too - 3hrs! worth a watch,no more than that. again i say out loud and clear to De Niro's fans - see this if have seen him in taxi driver,the fan(so much crazier then Nicky in casino),etc...totally this guy is so versatile. so very adapting to the roles.<br/><br/>mind-blowing film. i give it 9/10. a great memorable experience. a must watch for all,for lovers of any genre."
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","3","5","20 February 2008"," One of Scorsese's best and most disturbing films ever...
","I just watched Casino again for the first time since around 1998. The thing that I remember most vividly from seeing it that last time is being thoroughly upset by the scene in the cornfield at the end of the film. Most of the rest of the movie was overshadowed by the memory of that one scene, so I wanted to watch it again because I love Scorsese's films so much that not knowing about Casino was just acceptable. So I watched it again and I loved it again and my respect and amazement at the quality of the movie and the acting and the story and everything else was renewed, and nothing was that bad during the whole movie, so when the cornfield scene was coming up I thought, come on, there's only maybe 8 minutes left in the movie, how bad could this scene really be? Still, my heart was pounding in my chest. It was bad, man. It was real bad.<br/><br/>Now, when I say it was bad, I should clarify that it wasn't bad film-making, it was brilliant film-making. But it was too brilliant. It was so brilliant that it affects me as though I was watching what took place in that scene before me eyes in real life. <br/><br/>Scorsese gets a lot of bad press about his films being too violent (from my mom, anyway), and Casino is no exception. In fact, it's probably the flagship of violent Scorsese films. I've been an avid horror fan for more than a decade now, so violence doesn't really bother me, but Scorsese's violence has a grittiness and realism that sets it apart from most other types of film violence. It is graphic and sudden and has a gravity and an on-screen affect that makes it look like a documentary depiction of it. Spielberg achieved this same effect in some of the murders in the not so well received Munich in 2004. <br/><br/>Now, as I watch the end of Casino, I wonder what it's like watching the dailies with Scorsese, as he sees for the first time what they've captured on film. Do he and the other cinematographers that work with him jump up and clap each other on the back and pump their fists and yell, ""YES!! We got it, that's the PERFECT shot!!"" Or does Scorsese turn his head from the screen in disgust and whisper, ""That's the one. Print it."" I'm guessing (hoping) it's some combination of the two.<br/><br/>(spoilers) Odd, by the way, that the cringe induced by the final scene should be caused by seeing what happens to Nicky (Joe Pesci), who is by far the film's most violent and out of control character. The brutality of his character is as thorough as can be, but Joe Pesci is just so COOL. He plays almost the same character as he was in Goodfellas (an infinitely more watchable and, in my opinion, even better film overall), and he just does it so well. Makes me wonder what he's really like in real life. He can't really be like that, but he can't be that different, you know what I mean? <br/><br/>Sadly, no matter how good this movie is, I just can't watch that cornfield scene. I learned this afternoon that I don't ever want to see it again, just like I don't ever want to see that cop get his ear cut off in Reservoir Dogs. I think those are the only two scenes in any film I've ever seen that I really don't ever want to see again. Brilliant film-making though. <br/><br/>I haven't said anything about the myriad of brilliant performances yet, so I'll just say that Sharon Stone plays your typical hysterical woman, always shrieking for her money, her drugs, and her jewelry, her jewelry, her jewelry, for crying out loud, and DeNiro is brilliant as well (and as always). But Pesci steals the show in every scene though, including that last one. Now I need to go watch Home Alone to get that image of him out of my head..."

","""Casino"" explodes onto the screen like Martin Scorsese doing an overblown riff of a Martin Scorsese film. All of his hallmarks are here in spades as he weaves his epic and vividly detailed saga of organized crime in Las Vegas. Much of the style here is over-the-top, and when you combine that with three brand-name movie stars (DeNiro almost hilariously subdued here, Sharon Stone at the pinnacle of her appeal and showing an amazing range here as DeNiro's gold digging drug addicted wife, and an insane Joe Pesci doing a gonzo take on an insane Joe Pesci) acting to within inches of their lives, you get a wildly entertaining albeit over long three hour ride. Toss in some scenery chewing from Don Rickles, James Woods, and that hilarious Italian grandmother (Scorsese's real life mother) in the butcher shop, and you can't lose. However, when the central conceit of the movie is to explore the criminal underbelly of a city that legally peddles crime and sleaze as entertainment, ""Casino"" ultimately seems a bit redundant."
"Sylviastel","10","3","5","8 February 2006"," It's like a roller coaster ride! It's addictive, fun, and entertaining!
","I love Casino especially if I watch it from the beginning. Robert DeNiro should have won an Academy AWard for this performance along with Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. The film is perfectly entertaining about casinos before it became Disneyland. There were other great performances by Don Rickles, Alan King, etc. The film is a Martin Scorsese film with two of his favorite actors--Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci giving Oscar performances. The script was fresh and entertaining. I also have to say that James Woods' performance as Ginger's pimp was worthy of being nominated for best supporting actor. THis film has several fabulous scenes and moments. By the end, you really don't want it to end because it's that good. I love how Ace and Nicky (Joe Pesci's character) narrate and explain the on-going activities between the Las Vegas Casino and it's connection to Kansas City, Missouri. I really enjoy watching the scenes of Ace being in control and the corruption that occurs. But it's that kind of film. You know what happens but you enjoy the ride anyway and I do enjoy this film. I always look forward to seeing it on the cable stations. Of course, Ace and Nicky's friendship is the crutch of this film."
"TOMASBBloodhound","9","3","5","27 December 2005"," Scorsese needs to get back to this kind of film.
","Casino was the last great film made by Martin Scorsese, who is certainly one of America's finest filmmakers. Despite the three hour running time, Scorsese tells us a powerful story filled with memorable characters. Although he seems to have moved on to big-budget extravaganzas like The Avator, and Gangs of New York, it's films like Casino and Goodfellas that properly showcase his incredible talent.<br/><br/>The plot centers around Robert DeNiro's character named Ace Rothstein who has been sent by the mafia back east to manage the Tangiers Casino in Vegas. Ace knows everything there is to know about gaming, and he makes the place rather profitable. A good chunk of change is sent back to the mafia bosses each month. Things seem to be going fine until two things happen. First, Ace falls in love with a shady woman (Sharon Stone) who hangs around the casino and extorts money from unsuspecting high rollers. She has a sleazy pimp-like character (James Woods) brooding over her who complicates things further. In addition to all that, the mafia bosses send some muscle (Joe Pesci) into town to presumably watch Ace's back. But this ends up backfiring as Pesci tears the town apart and draws every cop in the city's attention to the Tangiers. Things continually spiral downward for Ace and the gang until the typically violent climax wipes most people out. There are plenty of other details that you will have to experience for yourself.<br/><br/>The film introduces characters we care about, and the actors portraying them are exceptional. Stone, Pesci, and DeNiro are all terrific, and James Woods once again reminds us what a scene-stealer he can be. The film is very violent, but also funny at times. It uses many of the same production techniques that made Goodfellas such a wonderful experience. You also get a nice insider's view of how Vegas operated back before it became such a commercial city. The Vegas that Scorsese shows us is for adults, not families.<br/><br/>At three hours, the film is indeed too long. There is a little too much time spent on detailing what a bitch Sharon Stone's character is. After she started fooling around with Pesci, we got the point. Still, we are treated to too many arguments between her and DeNiro. I cannot help but think that if Casino had the two hour and twenty minute running time of Goodfellas, it wouldn't have lost a thing. You won't daydream all that much, but you will find yourself wondering when the next scene with Pesci is coming.<br/><br/>Casino was made on roughly a $50 million dollar budget. That's chicken feed compared to some of Scorsese's recent ventures. Though it didn't make that money back in theaters, it has since become profitable through the means of home-ownership. Most of the people I know seem to have the DVD in their collections, anyway.<br/><br/>It's time to put DiCapprio on the shelf, and start making some more like Casino, Mr. Scorsese! The Hound thinks Casino is worth 9 of 10 stars."

This movie, as few others, will assault your senses and make you numb by the time it's over.<br/><br/>Constant bickering, yelling, and Sharon Stone's out-of-control character the last hour will have you uttering a few expletives yourself after this Martin Scorcese sleaze-fest mercifully ends.<br/><br/>As bad a character as Stone plays, the all-time champion profaner is - no surprise - the one played by Joe Pecsi, who must use the f-word every other sentence. Robert De Niro comes across as a choir boy compared to these other two jokers.<br/><br/>The sad thing is, this could have been a decent movie, if Scorcese wasn't just so preoccupied with being so verbally degenerate (see ""Goodfellas,"" ""Raging Bull,"" etc). If the film had been cut down 45 minutes from 3 hours (too much of it dwells on the marital problems involving Stone) and cut back on the profanity, you might have had an interesting crime story with some very colorful cinematography and good narration. However, Scorcese can't seem to make a crime film without all the excess.<br/><br/>""Brutal"" might be a good word to describe this movie. It's too much for anyone above trailer trash morals to endure."

Well, here goes:<br/><br/>This film is bad.
This film is overrated.
This is Scorcese on steroids.

"adrian-43767","3","4","8","7 August 2017"," Scorcese repeats many ideas of GOODFELLAS... CASINO is a far cry!
","The only thing that kept me watching this movie was to learn what happened to the character played by de Niro, apparently blown up by a car bomb at the beginning.<br/><br/>As in GOOODFELLAS, there is voice-over narration, this time by de Niro and Pesci (Ray Liotta was the narrator in the former film), but it is nowhere near as effective, and often provides unnecessary, even distracting asides, that only further lengthen a film that could easily have done with 30 minutes less. <br/><br/>Curiously enough, GOODFELLAS also had de Niro and Pesci in the cast, led by a highly inspired Liotta, but the only performance in CASINO worthy of any mention is that of Sharon Stone, who portrays a truly repellent character (the incident where she binds up her daughter and confines her to a cupboard is a bolt from the blue and struck me as unconvincing, perhaps because nothing in her actions toward her child suggest anything so excessive). She is very convincing, however, in her descent into drugs and her relationship with her pimp, the ""real"" love in her life, as opposed to the source of wealth that de Niro represents to her.<br/><br/>Pesci reprises his exceedingly violent character of GOODFELLAS and kills people as routinely as one would flies. This time, however, he is less credible because he is reportedly clever enough to take over the running of murky business from other ruthless criminals, but then commits excesses so stupid as to make suspension of disbelief impossible. His affair with Stone is also difficult to swallow. I could accept a blow job or one-off sex because she is too drugged up to reason it out, but surely he knows that de Niro will not tolerate it, and he is just too flippant about it. Ultimately, his character is just not rounded enough to stand, and so wayward as to become confusing, annoying, and ultimately lose the viewer's interest.<br/><br/>The character played by de Niro is a very odd customer indeed, and the actor's talent is sadly wasted in a part much too ambiguous for me to enjoy. He wants to go clean but stupidly allows ultra-violent chum, Pesci, to join his casino and childishly believes Pesci's promises of good behavior and compliance with the ""legit"" nature of the casino operation. Even harder to swallow is that he should entrust the key to his fortune to Stone, even after he finds her cuddling her up to her pimp again. De Niro seems rather unsure about the role, too. I spent the whole movie waiting for the character to do something but ultimately he accepts everything like the Good Samaritan: he takes in dangerman Pesci, marries pimp Woods-infatuated Stone, has a distant relationship with his daughter that unexpectedly turns into something closer, loses half of his fortune without a whimper when he has seemed money-driven from the start, and is just too polite and quiet to convince me that I haven't wasted close on three hours watching purposeless characters going nowhere.<br/><br/>Photography is competent, somewhat reminiscent of GOODFELLAS but less inspired. <br/><br/>Direction is very disappointing, especially in light of the standards set by Scorcese in TAXI DRIVER and GOODFELLAS."

","Martin Scorsese does deliver a vivid, pulsating look at what goes on behind the scenes in the temples of gambling out west, but fails at the human drama. Robert De Niro stars as Sam Rothstein, a Midwestern bookie with mob connections who is sent to Vegas in the '70s to run the Tangiers Casino. Sam is a hard worker and keeps his bosses in Kansas City happy with regular deliveries of cash-filled suitcases. Things start to go awry when his childhood buddy Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) comes to town. Nicky is a psychotic gangster/lowlife whose strong-arm enforcement techniques eventually do him in. Sam has also fallen for blonde bombshell Ginger (Sharon Stone), a gold-digging hustler. For some unknown reason, Ginger can't seem to give up her former pimp, the slimeball Lester Diamond (James Woods). Maybe she's just attracted to his name. The jewelry collecting Ginger would certainly find ""Mrs. Diamond"" more her style than ""Mrs. Rothstein."" We unfortunately remain passive observers of the downward spiral that consumes these characters. As the third hour dragged on, I just got more and more impatient for the whole thing to be over. I want to be leaving Las Vegas. De Niro does De Niro as usual, but the character's emotional revelations are small potatoes. Pesci does a veritable reprise of his GOODFELLAS part. Funny at first, with his ""F""ing vocabulary, Nicky soon starts to grate on the nerves. Quick, bring out the baseball bats. Sharon Stone does a respectable job as Ginger, but a Golden Globe win over Susan Sarandon (not to mention the ignored Kathy Bates) is a bit tough to swallow. The non-stop soundtrack of 70's hits is distracting at times, but the costumes and set designs are just right. Frankie Avalon, Jayne Meadows, Steve Allen and Jerry Vale play themselves.

"CinemaClown","Null","2","3","20 September 2018"," A Tale Of Money, Power, Greed, Deception & Murder
","The last collaboration between director Martin Scorsese & actor Robert De Niro as of today, Casino is a tale of money, power, greed, deception & murder that takes its inspiration from real-life events to paint an interesting portrait of both the glamorous & grisly sides of Las Vegas and is expertly steered by stellar performances from its terrific cast.<br/><br/>The story of Casino follows a gambling handicapper who is sent to Las Vegas by the Mafia to oversee their casino operations. When his supervision doubles their profits, they send a mob enforcer who's also his childhood friend to look after him. The plot covers their friendship which turns sour over the years as they compete over a gambling empire.<br/><br/>Directed by Martin Scorsese (best known for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull & Goodfellas), the story opens with a bang and comes full circle over the course of its runtime but there is no proper narrative structure to it. We watch people going about their daily business and few people dying, and that's what goes on for 3 hours. But the interest isn't all lost, thanks to Scorsese's fine direction.<br/><br/>However, the repetitive nature of it does diminish the earlier excitement and after a while, the only thing that keeps it going and makes sure that the film steers past the finish line are its trio of excellent performances. The 1970s casino ambience comes alive in vivid detail but the story is at its most gripping when depicting the other side of Las Vegas that's violent, merciless & uncompromising.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the film reunites Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci yet again and while the two play their respective roles with comfort & confidence as expected, it's Sharon Stone who steals the show with her at times broken, other times volcanic rendition of the avaricious character. We may not like the characters this film has in store but there's no denying the performances from the cast is absolutely top-notch.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Casino is another fascinating crime epic from Martin Scorsese that recreates the 1970s casino scene in splendid detail and presents its cast at the top of their game but just like most of his other works with De Niro, it's a picture that I admire more than I love. A three-sided character study that takes its trio to the top, only to throw them off the summit, Casino isn't going to be a smooth ride if you can't handle lengthy narratives or don't have the stomach for strong, intense violence."

"alexarag","10","2","3","1 September 2016"," Often Extremely Underrated Due to Comparison and Excitement For Goodfellas
","Put simply, Casino is often completely underrated and discarded because people hold it right beside Goodfellas and compare it with Goodfellas. Most people love Goodfellas, and when they then move on to see Casino, get a bit disappointed that it didn't give them the same vibe or feeling as Goodfellas.<br/><br/>I should know, because that's how I felt the first time I saw Casino. I was fresh into a discovering Scorsese films and watched Goodfellas first, a day later, Casino. And after listening to all the hype about Goodfellas and being in that type of mood, I thought Casino fell short.<br/><br/>A few years later I watched Casino and loved it, absolutely loved it. It's a slower moving, riveting, slightly disturbing dive into the world of excess. Complete excess. As the characters dive deeper and deeper into their stories, we realize that the film is indeed NOT like Goodfellas in the sense that the characters are not clawing their way to the top with the audience sort of cheering them on and enjoying the cowboy show. No, in Casino the characters ARE at the top, and we have the uncomfortable experience of seeing how they deal with it. There are no REAL obstacles against these people, except for their own vices. What we are left with is a very disturbing and deep tale.<br/><br/>I encourage anyone watching this movie for the first time to CLEAR the expectations and hype setup by Goodfellas and Scorsese's reputation overall, and really give this film the time to deliver what it delivers in an amazing way.<br/><br/>I also encourage anyone watching this film again who is so decidedly against it (or definitely thinks that it is inferior to Goodfellas) to rethink their position and watch it again with a different mindset."
"DukeWolfenstein","8","2","3","10 October 2015"," Ultimately, a mafia film about mafia men's attempts to colonize an unfamiliar environment
","Casino is less of a film about casinos and gambling and more of a film about two mafia men's very different attempts to build a new life in Las Vegas or build a foothold mafia colony in Nevada.<br/><br/>The casino and the gambling industry is simply a backdrop to the story - the film could've been about any other industry with little changes to the main story, which is the two men, almost completely disconnected from the mafia bosses, who run things their own way in a bizarro-land.<br/><br/>It is a bizarro-land in that what's illegal is legal (gambling and bookies are legal), the businesses (casino houses) are very powerful and have their own muscle, there is no mafia presence (other than themselves), no street crime, no rival families or gangs, law enforcement is not as organized, a different kind of government/way of doing things/getting permits and licenses that they're used to, and how they adjust to this completely different environment.<br/><br/>If one were to group mafia films into categories: beginnings of an organized crime family, rise/decline of a family, rise/decline of an individual member/boss of the family, wars between established families, and so on, this would be its own category of mafiosos in a completely unfamiliar environment.<br/><br/>The film is long, but doesn't feel long. It's packed with story - the scenes are short, dialogue is to the point, it is filled with events. It is a long story condensed and cut down to almost 3 hours rather than a short story stretched with long panoramas, filler, story threads that go nowhere, mood scenes and such. There is no fat in the film and the story to footage ratio is almost 1:1 - you can't cut anything without affecting the story.<br/><br/>It's a great film, not just for its time, but for all time. It's not the most original film, but how original can a mafia film be nowadays? It's not high on originality, but it's high on quality."

"thediggens","8","2","3","4 June 2014"," Jealousy. Greed. Ego. Desire.
","Casino is currently the last film in the legendary De Niro-Scorsese pair-up, and has aged incredibly well, after being underrated and dismissed as a clone of Goodfellas upon release. Indeed, the film sometimes might seem a remake. De Niro is the coolheaded professional, Pesci is the crazed psychopath, as the audience are again taken on a trip into the criminal underworld that predictably falls from paradise to hell.<br/><br/>Yet, it would be more accurate to call Casino a comparison piece to Goodfellas, as they match well while going off in satisfying tangents. The first hour of both is essentially the same setup. A glamorous exposition of their current gangster high-life, setting up the game and the players. Its quintessential Scorsese, with tracking shots, voice over exposition and a brilliant, catchy soundtrack. But here they diverge, as Goodfellas, the much shorter film, continues to deal with the work and its consequences, while Casino really delves into its characters as they lose themselves. Casino is certainly a character driven narrative (one could argue Goodfellas is instead a plot driven narrative made perfect by its characters). Our leading trio, the aforementioned males and Sharon Stone in a masterful portrayal of an enigmatic, destructive hustler, all inflate their egos with a deluded conviction of the correctness of their respective visions. In part because of being the lead, and in part as the least destructive character, De Niro's 'Ace' comes off best to the audience, but all are afflicted by delusions of grandeur and greed.<br/><br/>The film juggles the character's conflicts and growths well within the three hour film, which is itself a gorgeous depiction of the 'classical' period of Vegas' history, lamented as a relic today. The design, the visuals, the mood feels a different time, and is arguably Scorsese's most well-realised world. The soundtrack adds further to that. And Scorsese's direction is on top form, as is expected, and one finds it difficult to forget Scorsese's masterful hand guiding the film.<br/><br/>In terms of the performances of the leads, while De Niro is undeniably excellent, he is really the base from which the other two launch. Joe Pesci is at his very best here, surpassing Raging Bull and Goodfellas, and while the role is essentially a retread of the latter, it's expanded, deeper, and thematically goes with the film; the character is still a wild-card, but not nearly as much as a black sheep. His ego, his desire, they fuel him. Sharon Stone rounds it off, deserving of her Academy Award nom, providing a physical manifestation of Vegas: the money, the excess, the greed, the lure of self-destruction. Her relationship with De Niro is the core of the film.<br/><br/>The film is certainly excellent. And one tries not to compare it too much to other Scorsese films, especially Goodfellas. Yet its unavoidable when considering their similarity in theme, style and even cast & crew. Casino basks in its own excesses more than necessary- the length particularly. And it does many things right, but nothing much new. It's Scorsese at his most derivative of self, with the possible exception of being one of the few of his notable films to portray a strong leading woman (who is an independent character of herself) alongside the many men. The film is almost lazy in its unoriginality. And unfortunately it never matches the memorability of, say, Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Scorsese is on top form, with a fantastic setting and cast, and worth a watch."
"blazesnakes9","10","2","3","12 April 2014"," ""Today, it looks like Disneyland.""
","Martin Scorsese have gained a lot of respect and power through his films. Ranging from Taxi Driver to Goodfellas, his career have spawned one magnificent movie after another. His films are powerful, violent, well-crafted, well-directed and well-written. You can also say that in a lot of his films, there's a sense of ambition. In the case with Casino, it qualifies as another great piece of film-making from him.<br/><br/>The story begins in 1973, where Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, (Robert De Niro), is sent to Las Vegas to run the teamsters-funded casino called The Tangiers. In the Tangiers, the mafia controls every aspect of activity. Sam becomes the boss of the casino, giving him full responsibility to run it. His best friend, Nicky, (Joe Pesci), is also involved with Sam's business of running the casino, giving Sam all the protection he needs. But, when a woman walks into Sam's life while playing on the craps table and also causing a disruption, he spots his eyes her. The girl's name is Ginger (Sharon Stone). Soon enough, Sam and Ginger get married. But, what Sam doesn't know is that Ginger is a prostitute and her unfaithful actions to him comes from her long-time pimp, Lester (James Woods). When Sam finds out about Lester, he takes matter into his own hands. As the film progresses, Sam's dreams are shattered when he starts to lose control of his casino empire and everything becomes too complicated to handle or bear.<br/><br/>The photography is very well done and it creates a sense of vibrant to the world of Las Vegas. Furthermore, Scorsese shows us how the casino operation works. There's one scene in the movie where Nicky narrates about what goes on in a specific room called the ""Count Room."" In the Count Room, casino managers count up all of the money that is collected from the players. It turns that the mob controls the casino and Rothstein is calling the shots. But, as the movie progresses, I felt that the film turn into a ""How to"" movie, where the viewer learns a thing or two about mob operations in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>There are other parts in Casino that I really like. Another criticism that I have is the relationship between Sam and his wife, Ginger. In this relationship, we see that Sam really love her, yet what he doesn't know is that Ginger doesn't love him. Sam, as a person wants to do right and set certain things right because he wants them to be this way. However, in the case of his relationship with Ginger, he is trying to help her get over her drug addiction. But, like the casino business, he can't seem to control her, and therefore, the result is very fatal and destructive.<br/><br/>Another thing that Sam can't control is his relationship with Nicky. Just like his wife and his casino managing, Nicky is a giant complication to Sam. He's out of control and throughout the entire movie, we see Nicky getting more and more arrogant about setting up his part in Las Vegas. That proves to be too much for Sam because he doesn't want Nicky get out of control. As a result, Nicky is becomes his own enemy toward the mob and that, his fate is ill-fated.<br/><br/>What Scorsese does in this movie and also with Goodfellas is that the mafia world is being used as a crutch and that the main character of both films set their standards toward the mob. Yet, even though his promises are convincing, they are really not what they seem to be. In other words, what one would warned to another, another does the impossible. In Goodfellas, Henry Hill is told by Jimmy Conway to never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut. In the end of Goodfellas, that promise is broken, yet there is a sense of resentment and regret. In Casino, the characters are all infatuated by what goes in Las Vegas. It's almost as if Scorsese change the location from New York to Las Vegas. <br/><br/>All the performances in Casino are astounding. Robert De Niro is excellent as Sam Rothstein, the man who wants everything done, but can never predict the problems that he has to face. Sharon Stone gives, I think, an Oscar-nominated performance as Ginger. This performance proves that Stone can act under so much pressure and destruction that creates her character to be convincing. Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for his performance in Goodfellas, is effective as Nicky. Some people would say that Pesci is playing in the same field as in Goodfellas. But, Pesci is playing a character here. A character would can snap if he is push too far. All three performances really hold the movie together and all three should be given a certain amount of respect to their characters.<br/><br/>Scorsese continues to make movies after Casino, with other future works like The Departed and Gangs of New York. But, Casino is his second boldest. I say that because his latest film, The Wolf of Wall Street, is probably his most boldest yet. With the evidence of Casino, he really scores high with this masterpiece. He captures the life and glamor of Las Vegas life, yet I have to say that this film and Leaving Las Vegas really brings us to the world of Sin City, where the bright and shining lights are covered behind a sense of toughness and crime. Another film that failed to live up to Casino or Leaving Las Vegas is Showgirls, which fails to capture the toughness of being in Las Vegas. Casino is bold, bloody and brilliant and its ambition takes us deep into the heart and crime of Sin City. ★★★★ 4 stars."
"unklechunkle","10","2","3","9 June 2012"," On a par with Goodfellas in my opinion
","I think it is fair to say that Casino is overshadowed by Goodfellas, which was an enormous success on release. Many see Casino as simply a continuation of Goodfellas, after all it is set in the decades succeeding the events of Goodfellas. However, I feel Casino stands out as an equal to Goodfellas as a crime drama and in some ways, it fell it may be superior.<br/><br/>Casino follows Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert DeNiro), a gambling handicapper, who takes control of the fictional Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. Along with friend and mob boss Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), Sam ensures the money keeps rolling in and makes sure the bosses 'back home' get a little extra by 'skimming' from the casino's profits. As the years go by, Sam marries working girl Ginger (Sharon Stone), thinking that he can ensure her trust. However, money, drugs and betrayal ultimately get the better of them...<br/><br/>I think what I really like about Casino is the destructive love triangle of Sam-Ginger-Nicky which dominates the second half of the movie. I think their is a greater sense of ambition and the individual than Goodfellas, which was mainly concerned with the family. I also sympathised more with Sam than Henry Hill, as Sam has to cope with Ginger, who is troubled by drugs, alcohol and former lover/pimp Lester (James Woods).<br/><br/>Whilst it may be difficult to live up to Goodfellas, I think Casino does a pretty good job."
"g-bodyl","9","2","3","20 July 2011"," A Scorcese Classic!
","Martin Scorcese really knows how to make movies. Every one of his movies are just well-done classics worth watching over and over again. Casino is no exception. I'm kind of surprised that no one seems to have seen this movie. I guess it's just overshadowed by other Scorcese's films with greater hype such as Goodfellas or Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>This movie is almost a sequel to Goodfellas. It goes much more in depth in the lives of the gangsters more than the fore-mentioned movie did. This is about how the mafia placed a guy in charge of running a casino. This guy wants no unnecessary problems, but unfortunately that happens in the way of his new wife.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Robert de Niro is one of the greatest actors of all time. Joe Pesci is great as the cursing, ugly slimeball. The only weak link is Sharon Stone. I'm not a big fan of hers.<br/><br/>The voice-over narration in the movie works. That kept me hooked throughout. Also this is one of the most violent movies ever and that is also good.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fine depiction of the mafia. Despite it's length, I would see it over and over again. I rate this film 9/10."
"davydteather","10","2","3","2 June 2011"," The town will never be the same. Today it looks like Disneyland.
","Casino is one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen. I like this film slightly better than Goodfellas but i like that film too. The thing I like about this movie is that it shows you how Las Vegas came to be and is no longer. This movie has an excellent cast of top-list actors including Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Robert De Niro did an outstanding job portraying the main character Sam 'Ace' Rothstein. He was based on a real person named Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal who was a sports handicapper and who also ran a casino in Las Vegas for the mob. Joe Pesci was just amazing as Nick 'Nicky' Santoro, Sam Rothsteins friend. I also liked Sharon Stones performance as Ginger, Sam Rothsteins wife. Although the film was nearly 3 hours long, I thought it was very well done, the cinematography was excellent, the acting was top notch, and it was very well paced. It is a must-see."
"ben-eastwood","Null","2","3","20 March 2011"," Buries other films alive
","Casino is definitely one of the best films of the nineties. And when you take the time to think about it, that is quite an accusation, when it is competing with films such as:<br/><br/>GoodFellas The Shawshank Redemption Forrest Gump Pulp Fiction American Beauty<br/><br/>It is brilliantly told and brilliantly acted. Although Stone and Pesci are impressive, De Niro once again steals the show for me. The scene when he drags Ginger out of the house is one of his best scenes to date. Pesci once again takes the roll as De Niro's best friend Psycho/Ladies man killer. He is excellent, although his performance in GoodFellas was his finest hour. Stone gives her best performance to date. You really hate the character, as Martin Scorsese intended. I do believe, that although it is similar to GoodFellas, it is different in its own way, as GoodFellas makes grit look glamorous, and Casino makes glamour look gritty. And so, I leave you with this. I think that Casino's story is actually better than GoodFellas. I'm not saying that it is a better film, but in my opinion, Casino has a better and more thought out story."
"kenjha","6","2","3","28 September 2010"," Narrated for the Blind
","Fueled by mob bosses, two long-time friends make it big in Las Vegas. Scorsese not only rehashes the themes he explored in ""Goodfellas,"" but is also much too long-winded about it. After the film starts with heavily narrated expository scenes, one would expect the main story to kick in, but it continues in the same vein. This must be the most heavily narrated film in history, defying the notion that film is mainly a visual medium. Adding to the busy soundtrack is a non-stop hit parade of 1970s songs. Of course there are numerous scenes showcasing Scorsese's obsession with repulsive violence. De Niro and Pesci essentially reprise their ""Goodfellas"" roles. Stone is alluring."
"StevePulaski","10","2","3","20 August 2010"," No Gamble Needed, Casino Wins the Bet of Favorite Scorsese Picture
","Every scene, a thrill. Every shot, a beauty. Every line, a breath-taker. Scorsese's films are masterpieces and Casino is too. I've called Casino a masterpiece since I was seven hard to believe because I saw about half of it when I was younger and loved the look and feel of it all. Now seeing the whole thing again seven years later I love it and call it my favorite Scorsese film. A lot of people choose Goodfellas over this, but Im the opposite, I think Goodfellas was a great mobster movie and a real life look at the 50s Mafia, but I just love Casino for everything it is.<br/><br/>The three main actors De Niro, Pesci, and Stone have all outdone themselves here. This is the best work for all three of them individually. They play their roles with power and serve a unique purpose. Without De Niro, the narrations wouldn't have the same effect and be less powerful. Without Pesci, there would be no Italian to swear as good as him. He swears with meaning and makes you fear him when he steps on screen. His cutthroat, no BS attitude is what stands out on screen. Just like the quote said by Robert Di Nero.<br/><br/>Having heard that I repeated it to myself numerous times to get the full effect. It was one of the most powerful quotes in movie history to me. Last, but far from least, is Sharron Stone's portrayal of Ginger McKenna Rothstein. She takes the role in full effect by strutting her gorgeous self in front of the camera with every shot of her being a slick one. Her attitude the whole movie really sticks with you and the fights her and De Niro have are very shocking, yet powerful at the same time. Its a feeling, I've only got from this film.<br/><br/>The plot is true and is about Sam ""Aces"" Rothstein (De Niro) working as a bookie at the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. He takes his job beyond seriously and is usually caught in the minx of everything. His goal is to double Casino profits which is then skimmed by the Mafia which is then reported to the tax agencies. Whatever he bets on, he wins, thats that. He has never made a bet he wasn't sure he was going to win. Hes a smart guy and has never done a bet wrong. He is constantly bothered and put at risk when his buddy Nicky Santoro (Pesci, character based on the real life Anthony Spilotro) is sent to Vegas to assist Same, but winds up antagonizing all the casino members and his brash language and overall personality gets his name in a Black Book which lead to him banned from every casino in Vegas.<br/><br/>Sam falls for the hooker and hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone) who he winds up having a child with and marrying. He gives Ginger his trust and puts her jewelry, and $2,000,000 cash money in a bank in which she can only access. Sam regrets it deeply when Ginger is still sneaking around with her ex con boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Their marriage soon crumbles, leading her to a strict and pervasive drug addiction with only Nicky to to.<br/><br/>I don't want to go in full detail because the movie does have various surprises including the end, which I saw when I was seven and has traumatized me since. Seeing it again didn't have the same effect, but still scared me for life. This time, I cant say it's just a movie. This honestly happened. The events in this movie really happened and thanks to Scorsese is taken in a serious approach with characters that are in depth and to the point. Nobody but Scorsese could have done this movie. It is a true beauty and shouldn't be taken for granted.<br/><br/>I play poker with my friend Mike using fake chips and having no real money involved. It something we do to pass the time. After seeing this movie it almost makes me not want to touch a card or chip again. Sure just playing slots, poker, Blackjack, Roulette, or any poker game wont put you in the position of Nicky, but it makes you think how much hot water these guys really sunk in. This is a job that depends on life or death and is not something I'd ever think to do. Money is one thing, risk is another.<br/><br/>The movie is often shown on networks like Bravo and much of it has to be cut out because the f word is said exactly 422 times in three hours. Also because of the drugs and violence about thirty minutes is trimmed out too. My opinion is if this isn't shown in the raw, it shouldn't be shown at all. Profanity is common in this movie, but it shows you how strict Italians got. Various racial terms toward Muslims and Jewish people were brought up. Without the feeling or tense and frustration inside these people the movie is bland. It needs to have profanity to be true to the story of mobsters and gamblers. As well as the violence. Its jam packed with violence, but it needs to be there to show the full aspect. Without it, its tame and false.<br/><br/>Casino is a genuine film that maybe overshadowed by Goodfellas and Raging Bull, but to me it's a one of a kind, gambling masterpiece with a four star cast, a four star plot, and a four star feeling after watching it. It has the rare effect of after watching it you feel like you lived it.

Don Rickles steals the movie. There is great tragedy on this comic's face. The Voice Over narration works well in this movie and I was interested in it all the way through. The songs also kept me interested. Where do they get all of these old songs? it was really great. The editing and pacing kept it moving very fast, but not so fast that you couldn't easily follow the story line.<br/><br/>It's violent, sou you would want to warn any youngsters before you watch it with them."

"lasttimeisaw","7","2","3","20 June 2007"," After movies - Casino
","A Martin Scorsese's film, casting with his longtime partner Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, like another ""Goodfellas"". This time the story is about Casino, but mobster is still an indispensable part of it.<br/><br/>The film began with a car bomb and then flashed back to how Sam carved out his way in the casino business, how he desperately kept the balance between business and his mobster background. At the same time, this film emphasized his unsuccessful relationship with his wife, Ginger. Which is quite unusual in a Scorsese film because most of his films female characters are just ornaments. But this time, Ginger (played by Sharon Stone) is indisputably the leading actress in Casino.<br/><br/>Violence is another important ingredient of this film, torture, beating, bombing and killing, all to bring forth the cruelty of the living world. If you're a typical Scorsese's fan, you will love it.<br/><br/>The accurate and realistic depiction of Casino business is also remarkable. The colorful world filled with gambling, cheating and hustling. But all gamblers are losers, the only winner is the casino itself. Business is business, making profit is the ultimate goal. When Sam had made great fortune by running the casino, he wanted to be a normal businessman and didn't want to be involved into mobsters anymore. But it was difficult to quit because he had already made the countless ties with them. When it concerns with benefits, it's not a thing one man can decide anymore.<br/><br/>Talking abut the actors, I have to admit that Sharon Stone is wonderful in this film, her only Oscar-nominated role by far. But there is something I must complain about, that is the role of Ginger, which is so stupidly written, she was just a mindless Blondie who only wanted to marry a rich man to enjoy a luxury life. We don't blame her for that, nevertheless how could she be so in love with James Wood's role is beyond redemption and totally unconvincing! Maybe the answer is either me or Martin Scorsese does not understand women at all. Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci's acting are some kind of continuing of their roles in ""Goodfellas"", good but far from excellent.<br/><br/>This film is not Scorsese's best work and Sharon Stone shines in her bitter and badly-written role."

That was the first time I had heard that combination of words used in a film, and was delivered with such venom that you knew right there there was no going back for them.<br/><br/>And another scene i liked was when the sheriff held up a magazine, that had a story on Ace in it, and says -<br/><br/>""Of course its true!

Things seem to be going his way until his childhood friend, the wacky and crazy Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci) turns up with his own very different agenda, of how he is going to run things for himself and thus the mob bosses in Vegas Gangster movies remain to be cool and I can watch them over and over again and I look for the next one to be a little more modern day to see how things have changed over the last 10 years. Casino is a well directed, acted and edited masterpiece, which does a great job telling the story of 2 friends that in the end don't quit see things eye to eye."
"Nick Beaudine","10","2","3","12 January 2006"," Gangster Tragedy
","In the 90's, Martin Scorsese directed two great rags to riches to rags again gangster movies. The first was 1990's ""Goodfellas"". The second was 1995's ""Casino"". Both movies are based on books by Nicolas Pileggi, and screenplays written both by Pileggi and Scorsese. The movie takes an excellent look inside the old Las Vegas when gangsters ran it. Robert De Niro is in top form as Ace, the main character that works his way up in Vegas. Joe Pesci is also excellent as Nicky, who seems to be a somewhat toned down version of his character Tommy from ""Goodfellas"". This is Pesci's best work to date. Sharon Stone, James Woods, Kevin Pollack, Alan King, Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, L.Q. Jones, and Dick Smothers round up the excellent support cast. The soundtrack to the movie is one of the best assembled. Robert Richardson, who did a majority of Oliver Stone films, does an excellent job at cinematography in his first Scorsese film. Scorsese regular Thelma Schoonmaker does another excellent job of film editing.<br/><br/>This film, along with ""Goodfellas"" and ""Blow"" deliver the time old theme of becoming powerful, and then losing it all. I've always believed these movies are excellent at showing this theme way better than some films, especially Brian De Palma's version of ""Scarface"" (even though Al Pacino is excellent). After you watch ""Goodfellas"" watch this film right away."

Casino is unique in that its probably the first gangster movie that focuses on gambling. Pesci was extremely funny, yet assertive in this, and Deniro was brilliant. I have watched this movie over 10 times and still cant get enough. Sharon Stone was also great in the role she was born to play. I gave this film a 10/10. Those who loved the films recommended above will definitely not be disappointed.

Casino takes you into the dark underworld of vegas while delivering a storyline that is based on real events. Martin scorese is the best thing since fresh air.

","Stylish, realistic, violent, perfectly written and directed, this movie has the power to attract and capture attention for almost 3 hours. The plot is just as good as in any other gangster movie, but excellent script and superb acting make the movie a masterpiece. Robert DeNiro and Joe Peschi do an excellent job portraying complicated characters, and creating a unique atmosphere of presence while watching the movie. The only considerable flaw is Sharon Stone, who's performance cannot keep up with the rest of the cast, but since she's just an average actress, this is a mistake of those who gave her a leading part in the movie.

","I have never been a Martin Scorcese fan. I did not like TAXI DRIVER. Even as much as I love mob films, I didn't care all that much for GOODFELLAS. Back in 1995, I wrote movie reviews for my college paper. One of the movies I had to see was CASINO. My first thought was, ""oh damn, I have to sit through a 3-hour Scorcese movie."" It is strange because I didn't like GOODFELLAS, but I love DeNiro and Pesci. In CASINO, DeNiro and Pesci made the movie as great as it was.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro is Ace Rothstein, who is an expert gambler. He is asked by the Midwest Mob to take control of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. He immediately cleans up the casino of crooks (in one scene, a man who is caught cheating has his hand beat with a hammer) and brings in a lot of money for the bosses. During this time, Ace meets Ginger (Sharon Stone), who is one of the most notorious hustlers in Vegas. He falls in love with her and they marry, even though she is still faithful to her ex-pimp Lester Diamond (James Woods.) Nicky Santoro (Pesci) is called in by the Mob to protect Ace and make sure no one messes with the casino. All is well for a while until Nicky begins causing trouble and that's when all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>This movie is almost three hours long, but the time flies right by. The supporting cast is top notch. If you are a fan of mob films, you can't miss CASINO.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10"

Long movies usually become boring, however this story is easy to follow.  It is directed well, and acted well.  I read the book, and the film follows it closely, a few events changed because of time considerations and where shorting.  The film had to be long for it to reasonbly follow the book.  This is a interesting story, and the movie follows it accurately, and the viewer goes along the journey as he was there. My opinion when you feel this the movie is very good one."

","Casino is nowhere near as enthralling as Goodfellas.  It has many high points though.  For example the acting all around was flawless.  Bobby was brilliant as ACE, Sharon stone deserved that golden globe and Joe Pesci as Tommy...oops I'm sorry I mean Nicky...he was very scary.  I felt in Goodfellas the characters reached a point where they had it all and then they went down but in Casino they kinda had it all at the beginning then went completely downhill from there. I've always enjoyed Scorsese's use of violence.  Sudden and brutal.  But the ""Head in a Vice"" and the beating with bats left a bad taste.  After you see them you say ""Why Oh Why didn't he just shoot 'em in the head."". However it is an entertaining epic, a credit to all involved."

","This is a very solid film, and I think that those who love Scorsese will get a lot of entertainment out of it. However, if you're a casual moviegoer and don't see that many flicks, know that there are a half dozen better Scorsese films out there for you to watch, and some of them even star the same people (""Goodfellas"", ""Raging Bull"").

","'Casino' is probably the last of the real epic mob dramas. Martin Scorsese's stylish tale of power, greed, and deception is based on real-life organized crime associate, Lefty Rosenthal. The screenplay is penned by Scorsese and his collaborator from 'Goodfellas', Nicholas Pileggi. The movie is three hours long, and it might feel like it drags on places, but the writing is perfect. And what fantastic performances by the actors. The main cast (Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, James Woods, Don Rickles, and Sharon Stone in one of her best roles) is supported by magnificent mob movie heavyweights like Vinny Vella and Frank Vincent. Nearly half of the movie is told through narrations that are quite descriptive, so it almost feels like you are watching (listening) visual audiobook. But the narrations are spot on and contains some of the best lines from the movie. Especially the ones from Joe Pesci whose narration is so smooth and calm compared to his hot-tempered character Nicky Santoro.<br/><br/>A pure, classic mob movie in the best Martin Scorsese style."

","In 1983, Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) leaves his casino and gets blown up in his car. Ten years earlier, he's running Tangiers with money from questionable sources. The money is getting skimmed and delivered to Kansas City for the mob bosses. Billy Sherbert (Don Rickles) is the manager. Andy Stone (Alan King) is the head of the teamsters and Phillip Green (Kevin Pollak) is the front man. Sam falls for con woman Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) who has a weak spot for her old pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is his violent childhood best friend who comes out to Vegas and causes problems pushing his weight around.<br/><br/>I'm not always good with narration. The constant narration could have thrown me off but it fits perfectly. This is simply Ace and Nicky teaching the audience the way of their world. De Niro and Pesci are terrific. Sharon Stone brings something different to this. The movie is stretched out a bit at 3 hours but it never loses the tension. Scorsese brings a real beauty to this Vegas landscape."
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","1","1","28 May 2015"," Scorsese makes fresh an old trick
","It would be easy to forget Martin Scorsese's Casino, or to dismiss it as derivative from his previous works like Goodfellas. But in my honest opinion as a moviegoer, that would be a horrendous mistake. I had more fun with Casino than I have had with every Scorsese movie except Taxi Driver. <br/><br/>Casino extends for almost three hours, but unlike Gangs of New York, it doesn't sprawl - every scene is necessary, interesting and well-done, from the first to the last. A great deal of Casino is exposition, but its good exposition - and enough interesting stuff happens during it that it is still a lot of fun to watch. <br/><br/>The most distinctive element about Casino is the casting of Sharon Stone. She is simply superb as Ginger, with a remarkable range displayed throughout the film. Her debut scene is cheeky and flirtatious, and I was as hooked on her as DeNiro was. Throughout the film, she convincingly descends into alcoholism and substance abuse, and she more than holds her own in her many screaming fights with DeNiro.<br/><br/>Casino reunites a lot of the elements of previous Scorsese films, as well as a lot of the elements, but it manages to bring a lot of fresh material to the table. The voice-over doesn't get distracting, and I loved in the final scene where Pesci's gets cut off just as Nicky's fate is revealed to the audience. Its almost as if the narration is coming from the future, and the future dies the second the hit men lay hands on him. The tracking shots, freeze frames and excessive violence are all here, but he uses them for a reason - because they're effective.<br/><br/>The interesting element of the DeNiro/Pesci/Scorsese partnership is that between this film, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, the combination is always shaken up. In Raging Bull, DeNiro is the dominant to Pesci's submissive. In Goodfellas, they were more equal. Here, Pesci completely runs over DeNiro. The two guys are capable of such great things and are convincing no matter what side of the partnership they are on. As I already said, Pesci is brilliantly belligerent, exuding power and arrogance far exceeding his performance in Goodfellas. There are subtle changes in their performances, but ones that bring a whole new dynamic to Casino. One of the most important things I felt was the total dominance he had over his lovers - he would kiss them once and then force them to perform oral sex. He is in charge.<br/><br/>DeNiro gives a very under-appreciated performance here as Ace, because its so refreshing to see DeNiro claw for his power and not be 100% in control at all times. I also really bought his love for Ginger - Scorsese wisely refrains from his protagonist's usual womanising ways in developing Ace, and as a result, it brings a lot to his personality. It made their love story so tragic. <br/><br/>Casino's screenplay really should have been nominated for an Oscar. It helps a 3 hour film remain thoroughly engaging. It is packed full of killer dialogue, wicked insults and eventful story archs. I loved every moment of the relationship between Ginger and Ace, and I loved the fights between Pesci and DeNiro. I loved the exposition about the FBI tracking Pesci. I loved the running of the casino scenes and the voice-over. My favourite line in the whole movie was the ""holes in the desert"" surrounding Vegas explanation. It was so well done, and I'd never thought of it before.<br/><br/>I loved Casino. I could easily watch it again and not get sick of it. DeNiro and Pesci and Scorsese work fresh takes into old moves, and Sharon Stone and the screenplay are simply amazing. Any Scorsese fan, put this on your to see list far far above his more famous The Aviator, Gangs of New York or The Departed."

","I'm usually not a fan of the way narrative films are. So this movie was a pleasant surprise. This is a true story (with names and places changed) depicting the life of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein and his friend Nicky. Sam is a great gambler, and works his way through the years, eventually landing a job running a casino in Las Vegas. He watches for cheaters and uses his friend Nicky (a man in the Mafia) to get rid of problems using violence. The Mafia protects Sam in return for scamming money from the casino. When Nicky starts to get careless with his tactics (even getting kicked out of Vegas' casinos and put on the infamous blacklist) and Sam's wife gets hooked on drugs and is cheating, things start falling apart. The FBI comes after the Mafia hard, and the Mafia in return starts to come down on everyone. As the story goes on things fall apart more and more. Sam and Nicky stop being so close, and violence gets worse and worse. This was a well put together movie. Excellent acting, great directing, and an amazing story come together perfectly.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: 8- Most of the time the music works for the movie, but there were a few moments where the music didn't fit in the film.<br/><br/>Script: 10- The writer knew how to write mobsters well.

It's great to see both tread familiar grounds, read exposition while the story continues and still assume different characters. James Woods was extremely subtle in his role, which works well for him as I did not recognise him in the beginning. Finally Sharon Stone's character is somewhat the emphasis of the entire movie, and she delivers that Oscar nominated performance so tight as the object of lust it's astounding. Funny enough is that I absolutely hate her in these kind of roles because she's so good at them, all in all making her the perfect choice.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Though the film is long, those who can sit through it are in for another great piece from Scorsese's filmography. 8/10."

Like Raging Bull and Goodfellas, Casino never veers into unwatchability, remaining inspired throughout, especially for those interested in the truth, whether it be about the Mafia or no. The real truth here is the heart of mankind, which is filled with evil. The perpetual lure of sex and violence, end of the world hypocrisy, the false faces that cover the insatiable lust and love of money. Man's inability to avoid corruption, the ease with which he walks and rides roughshod, to roll in destruction and without remorse. The real world extremes of what people are capable of. Of what seeds are planted in the soil of the human heart, and the flowers of evil that are nurtured and grown. Martin Scorsese is an end of the world prophet here, and this underrated masterpiece is one of the brightest sermons he ever delivered.

","Scorsese's brother film to Goodfellas, is a longer engrossing film with a few similarities. Deniro and Pesci, reteamed again, share the narration. Here's another true mafia related tale, about the corrupt vices behind a casino, where it's new boss, Sam Rothstein, (a more gentler soul to Deniro's semi frightening Jimmy Gent in Goodfellas) has a close call with death, via a car explosion, where too the Ace as he was known, survives many interrogations, and some terrifying moments of paranoia, not knowing if he was going to be the next body dropped in the desert. We see him take continual hounding by the FBI, but the Ace always managed to beat him. Of course, Deniro's faultless, his mate, mafia cowboy Nicky Santoro, (Joe Pesci, solid) bares some similarities to the incredibly frightening Tommy in Goodfellas, though I know who I'd pick, if I having to choose a room alone. Stone is at her shining moment, playing the junkie pro Ginger, who became Mrs Sam Rothstein, despite having to a constantly cling on to a scuzzy low life pimp, Lester, (Woods in one of his best performances) who maintained this sort of hold on her. Again there are violent moments that shock, one as excessively illustrated by the big boys upstairs, to players who rig games, another one involving insult, plus Pesci's foul mouthed antics, and womanizing, even doing Stone. Even more enjoyable than Goodfellas, it's running time had me worried, stretched out to nearly three hours. Casino, sort of has an excess feel to it, judging by some themes, that have us questioning if they were true, but again it's just another engrossing Scorsese hit.

","Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese collide in their eighth and final (to date) film in their partnership in this true story about gangster who get it all wrong. Based on the true story of Frank Rosenthal and Tony Spilotro this was bound to be good and by geez it delivered. Voiceovers, constant background music and also constant swearing (423 f-bombs!) result to make a very powerful film that is very well acted and also is told brilliantly. Scorsese uses a method which he also used in Raging Bull where he begins from near the end. The first voice-over really gets you interested, as soon as Robert De Niro's character says this you know the film is going to be good: 'When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, I believed, that's the kind of love I had'. This first line got me interested immediately and I am sure it will make most viewers want to watch for the whole three hour period. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci come together in a film for the third time and once again they click instantly, De Niro the successful guy who runs the casino, Pesci the man who stops anyone get in De Niro's way, it really is great stuff and you really start to believe that they are the characters and are not just acting. Sharon Stone showcased her talent like no one thought she could in this film and certainly deserved her Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast are also brilliant and get you into the film with such ease it seems like you can't see or hear all the carnage that is going down on screen. Music plays a huge part in the film and in fact there are 61 different songs used in this film, most of them actually being proper songs that are not soundtrack songs. The one criticism for the film is that sometimes the music was on at unnecessary times and you could occasionally not hear as well as you might. To compare this to other Robert De Niro-Martin Scorsese films would (in my opinion) put it third on the list and this was certainly an amazing film. Comparing it to other gangster films is a bit different but I would still say it it up there with such masterpieces as The Godfather, if not possibly better. Watch this if you are not disturbed by scenes of ultra-violence and world record swearing, it will be damn well worth it."

","This is a movie that I have watched 50 times. And all I want to do is watch it again.<br/><br/>Let me start of by saying, a lot of people keep saying 'This is not as good as GoodFellas'. Well that's simply not true. The movie is based on the real story of the upbringing of Las Vegas as we know it today and the main people behind it. This in itself is one the most fascinating mob stories of one of the most fascinating places on Earth and Martin Scorsese and all the actors have really brought this story on screen so incredibly well.<br/><br/>The movie will keep you glued to the screen and it's incredible detail,acting, voice overs and sets are nothing short of the work of a true genius of film making.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro plays the role of Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal and he portrays the character to perfection (seriously, it's inch perfect) along with Joe Pesci who scares the life out of you when you watch him in this movie. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci's character) is the real muscle of the mob gang at that time in Vegas, and boy we can see that through Joe Pesci's incredible portrayal of the real life character.<br/><br/>It is important to mention the incredible performance by Sharon Stone as well. She pushed herself to the limit with this role and this role really needed someone at the limit, so they way she carried herself through this role is incredible.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, your detail in this movie is out of this world. There is not a second of the 2 hours and 50 minutes that is off key. It is perfect to the dot.<br/><br/>Phenomenal movie. A must watch. One of the all time greats."

"The-Sarkologist","8","1","1","12 November 2011"," Another pretty decent film from the Scorsesee lot
","I have not had the pleasure of seeing many of Martin Scorsesee's films, and this might actually be the first. I have heard that he is a well known director with a unique style, but as I have not seen any of his films, I cannot comment on it; but if they are anything like Casino then so far I am impressed. I heard of Martin Scorsesee not from watching movies but from a Alternate band named King Missile (known for a song which they wrote about as certain part of the male anatomy that a person was able to remove, and then ended up losing, and finding it again and having to fork out $20 to buy it back - weird group). I will not go into the details of what their song was about and what they wanted to do to Martin Scorsesee even though they said that he made the best films.<br/><br/>Casino is a movie about people and about how that begin with everything and end with nothing. The movie is based around Sam (Robert DeNiro) who is made the director of a Casino by the mafia. His childhood friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) comes to Las Vegas to apply his business - thuggery - to the town almost untouched by thugs. It is set in a time when the gangs ruled Las Vegas and gambling was a game of skill, and enticing people out of their money was done by the way one arranges their poker machines. The conclusion shows us that those days are passed as now the corporations own Las Vegas and the casinos only exist if their theme is worth it.<br/><br/>As I said earlier the movie is about people, and to explore the movie we must explore the people and the relationships that they have with each other. There are three main characters and they are Sam, Nicky, and Ginger. Sam and Nicky do not change where as Ginger does. This is important because the Ginger and Nicky claim that Sam has changed, but this is differential to the nobility of his character. One might ask how can Sam be noble when there is no honour among thieves? Well, in this time there is honour and this honour his held at the point of the gun. There is a way that the mafia does things and if people don't do what the mafia tells you then you will find yourself buried in a hole in the middle of a corn field. Yet the problem with this honour is that it works on the assumption that might means right, meaning that once somebodies power exceeds your own then either you comply or suffer the consequences.<br/><br/>Sam's character is the central character. He is clean, an spends the whole movie clean. He is a man that does not take risks, he only takes certainties. As is said at the beginning of the movie, he is a man that when he makes a bet, the entire bookmaking industry changes. As such he is the perfect man for a casino because he knows how to make money. Now he has a record in illegal gambling so it is difficult to get him into a casino, but as long as you treat the authorities in Las Vegas okay, then they won't happen you - the minute you step over the line and upset somebody, then they can put the pressure upon you.<br/><br/>As I said before, Sam does not take chances. He is a man that runs everything his way. He is obsessed that everything runs smoothly. He does not pay people to think because their thoughts are not his thoughts and they don't know how to work the people and the floor. The example is the poker machines. He puts the big jackpot machines in plain view rather than hiding them. Hiding them keeps people away and as such they don't run the risk of hitting the big jackpot, but having them in plain view brings more people to them so that they waste more money trying to win the big jackpot. Of course his obsessiveness with things running his way is very much a flaw, as he wants to always know where his wife is, and this leads to distrust and finally to the breakdown in their marriage. It was not all his fault as he tried to marry a woman who was not meant to be married and it ended up destroying him and her. The blueberry muffin affair is another instance where is compulsiveness goes overboard.<br/><br/>Casino is about power and the question of who really rules. In one way we see that the mafia rules Vegas from the east, while on the other hand, the authorities are so corrupt that they let them, yet if you upset the authorities then they can and will tighten their fist. Or is it the king of the thugs - Nicky - who rules. It seems like he does, but in the end he only finds himself in a pit in a cornfield."
"fux138","10","1","1","22 March 2011"," Scorsese's most visually stunning film.
","Martin Scorsese has been hailed as one of the greatest modern directors ever to take on the Silver Screen and for good reason. With a unique style that involves strong themes of crime and redemption, virtuoso camera work, quick pacing, and violent imagery; Martin Scorsese has carved his name into the crime genre and the movie world as a whole.<br/><br/>Now, many know Scorsese for his gritty and violent crime films like Goodfellas, Mean Streets, and The Departed, but I think the Scorsese style (at least the visual style) shows through best in his Crime epic, Casino.<br/><br/>In Casino, Martin Scorsese uses some of his best camera work and his most stunning compositions to pantomime the feel and atmosphere of an actual casino. The quick movements, the flashing lights, the almost schizophrenic nature all comes together to form one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>IT doesn't just stop at the camera-work. The way the story is told also plays a big part in this subtle dance. The film almost seems like one gigantic vignette as Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci narrate for good chunks of the film as it lays out the story. It seamlessly glides between Vignettes, montages, and narrative story telling to almost make it like watching a novel.<br/><br/>If there were ever films to come so close to being like paintings it would be The Seventh Seal and this."

DeNiro on the other hand in my opinion should have earned a nomination as well as Sam Rothstein the casino owner. Quote: 'back home (east coast) they would have put me in jail, out here they give me awards'. a city awash in cash, proof of the adage 'a sucker is born every minute'.<br/><br/>I personally have never been to Vegas and have no intention of going. I have however been to Atlantic City and can understand how the glitter and jingle of the slots can be so mesmerizing, or more precisely saw just that happen numerous times. I never felt the tug, my suspicions confirmed one day at the local casino when I popped a token in a machine and lo, it came up 'bar' 'bar' 'off by one'. Confirmation that slots are PROGRAMMED to commit way more 'near misses' than statistical average would dictate. So I guess the 'hustle' has merely gone digital.<br/><br/>Very entertaining movie.

The way Scorsese has it a Ace's recollection of past happenings and has narration whilst the plot unravels is really clever and works so well. It kept my attention throughout and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Despite the fact that it is quite a long film, there wasn't ever a point when I thought it was slow or boring.<br/><br/>Some great acting from De Niro and, like in goodfellas, Joe Pesci plays the blood thirsty tough guy perfectly. Sharon Stone also plays a great part but makes herself very unlikeable (at least that's what i found).<br/><br/>Overall, it was a very enjoyable film with strong storyline, great acting, perfect directing and also made in the year I was born. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in Scorsese's films, and Mafia films, unless they dislike the use of swearing or violence."
"Jonathon_Natsis","9","1","1","1 February 2011"," Heard about it, but haven't seen it yet? Lose a man card.
","The first half of the 1990s was a glorious, competitive time for mob films. Okay, so we started off with the disappointing (but far from terrible) The Godfather: Part 3, but later that year Martin Scorsese released GoodFellas, which many people consider to be the definitive gangster film. In that same year came Miller's Crossing, and Quentin Tarantino added to the palette with both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. In 1995, Marty hit back with Casino, redefining the blockbuster genre in a way that wasn't emulated until some twelve years later, when Nolan got his hands on the Batman franchise.<br/><br/>Comprising of an all-star cast headed by the incomparable Robert De Niro, Casino tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, America's finest bookmaker in the 1970s and 80s, whose knowledge of the industry lures him to Las Vegas. At the behest of the Mafia, he becomes the executive manager of the fictional Tangiers casino. Childhood friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) comes along for the ride, and all seems to run smoothly until a desire for women, wealth and the very essence of Vegas sends the gambling empire into a tailspin. <br/><br/>Expect nothing less than utter professionalism in the direction department. Scorsese gives the audience an excellent look into the luxury, excess and emotion that defined Las Vegas for so long. The visuals are striking, displaying the bright lights of the city in external scenes, and giving the film a glossy undertone during internal scenes; a highly unconventional technique, but one that reflects the tone perfectly.<br/><br/>As with most of Marty's masterpieces, Casino is unique in the way that it dosen't follow a structured plot. Rather, the film is, for lack of a better phrase, a whole bunch of 'things' that happen, and how they impact on (or are caused by) the main characters. In fact, a positive aspect of the movie that isn't recognised by most is just how much influence the characters have on the story. <br/><br/>The first half of the film is concerned with how Ace and Nicky run the casino: turning over profits, keeping customers happy and dealing with cheaters. The second half deals solely with each character's personal issues, and how they destroyed something so valuable from the inside out. We see how Ace's hustling wife Ginger (Sharon Stone, in a career-best performance) turns two former friends against each other, while slowly killing herself as well. There is no doubt that the events of the second half are on a smaller scale to those of the first, but so much more emphasis is placed on the former because of the magnetism and excellent performance of each actor.<br/><br/>Drama is on high supply for the film's entire three-hour run time, but allows for some well- written comedy to complement the pace. For all the excellent younger actors Scorsese has worked with in the past decade, none of them convey the effortless on-screen chemistry of De Niro and Pesci, whether they are joking with each other, or wishing death upon one another. <br/><br/>At its simplest, this can be called the ultimate guy's movie. It features shooting, swearing, suits, money, fast cars and even faster women. Delve a little deeper, and you'll appreciate the practically flawless acting, indulgent cinematography and a cautionary tale just as critical of greed and the flaws of human beings as Wall Street or Scarface. I take issue with this film's tagline: 'You don't stay at the top forever', because it will take one hell of an effort to knock Casino off this movie-lover's list of top 20 films.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"

","Gripping story of a handicapper with Mob ties that tries to right himself to an extent as being legit for the first time, but can't be on his own with this as he is stymied by his long time babysitting pal Nicky. Nicky, played by Joe Pesci brings back the Tommy from Goodfellas in an even more sadistic but leadership kind of way. May not be the same wisdom as he had in Goodfellas, but much more of a brutal, ego filling mobster - at first protecting, but jeopardizing all the Mob influence had in Vegas which was the beginning of the end for them controlling casino's and their teamster ties. Scorsese masters the filmaking of these longtime actors, with Sharon Stone coming along for the ride, with truer feelings than in any other mob movie he has made. This was more, of a drama - soap opera than what can be called a mob movie. If you haven't seen it which is doubtful. You must see this movie which is probably the best casino movie of all time let alone, top 10 gangster movies of all time, with a comedic tone that never goes away.

"Brawl_666","8","1","1","18 October 2009"," Rousing
","I've only seen about half of Scorsese's body of work, but I don't believe I would be too wrong in sticking my neck out and saying that Casino is probably his most entertaining movie. 'Cape Fear' was pretty much a solid thriller as well, but that film was a little too tense and frightening. This is really his one film where you can safely switch off your brain, and just relax and watch Scorsese do his thing. The fantastic visuals, the humour, the incredible sets and of course the masterful editing all together contribute to what is finally a lavish and jaw-dropping feast of a film. The way Scorsese directs his actors and sets his scenes with such utter perfection - the whole thing just makes you giddy with delight and blows your senses. Also, this movie is going to make you love 70s' American music - I guarantee it ! All the actors are a pleasure to watch here. In particular, James Woods as the ""country club golf hustler"" is hilarious - strange, why doesn't Scorsese cast him more often ?? Sadly the film is unable to keep up the kinetic pace of the first two hours, and becomes somewhat dull and overlong near the end. BUT - this film very much falls into the category of must-sees."
"knucklebreather","8","1","1","25 August 2009"," More influential than its given credit for being
","""Casino"" is at its best when its essentially just a very stylish, masterfully done documentary on the history of Vegas and the back-room dealings with the mafia. The primary plot of the movie is good, but doesn't have the same kind of replay value and ultimately just above average.<br/><br/>The film's dramatic story is good stuff, but what's important about ""Casino"" is the overarching information it reveals about Vegas, and the amazingly sleek and fun way it does so. Nearly 15 years after Casino, the story depicted in this movie has become essentially the official version of the history of Vegas. It's assumed that something more or less like what's depicted in the movie is what really happened in Vegas from the 1960s and 1970s. Most people don't want any more information - Scorsese's version of history is good enough. And why not? Some of the fine details are wrong, but Scorsese basically used a feature film to unveil to the public for the first time a generally accurate history of organized crime in Las Vegas. In many ways this is what Coppola did with the Godfather - no, every fact isn't true in either film, but both create a narrative, the general gist of which the public accepts as the story they want to believe about a certain chapter in the history of crime.<br/><br/>The second reason ""Casino"" is so influential is purely stylistic. This movie is chock full of very indulgent, flashy scenes with very overt camera work, heavy narration, catchy music, busy scenes with dozens of characters at times, and generally a style that is very forceful and exciting. This sort of style seems to have become a mainstay of Hollywood films that were big-budget and looking for box office returns, but also wanted some respect from the critics. Some of the major films that fit that description over the next few years - Boogie Nights and Ocean's 11 pop to mind - hang their hat on scenes directed very much in the lavish, showy way Scorsese does so well in Casino.<br/><br/>Altogether, ""Casino"" stops just short of delivering on the promise of its stellar first hour. Perhaps Scorsese wanted to avoid reusing too many of the devices he used to wrap up ""Goodfellas"", but unfortunately, with Scorcese putting away the cinematic fireworks after intermission, I think people remember all of the excitement of the first half, and the second half is just a blur of the stars gradually heading downhill in the predictable ways. Still, with a first half like that, the full film can't help but be a classic, if an uneven one."

","When released in 1995, Casino was dismissed by many as Scorsese attempting to remake his own GoodFellas. But the movie, although quite similar to GoodFellas in many respects, stands on it's own. A most fast-paced 3 hour movie containing no unnecessary tedious scenes to slow it down, never failing at any opportunity to fascinate and entertain the viewer. <br/><br/>Enter Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a brilliant sports handicapper who takes his talents to Vegas. Ace's uncommon expertise and success with making the world of gambling pay off naturally attracts the wrong type of people in the likes of old hometown buddy now heavily connected with the Mob Nicky (Joe Pesci), and the romantic object of his affection Ginger (Sharon Stone). Sam unfortunately takes a gamble on these two and the results don't pay off as well as he would have liked. Neither Ace or Nicky are a match for Ginger, who gets in between them and ultimately plays them both for a couple of tricks.<br/><br/>One of the film's remarkable achievements is how expertly the story is told, and Scorsese's ability to cram so many rich details into such a short amount of screen time frequently throughout. An example of this is where DeNiro's character catches on to a couple of card players using a sophisticated cheating technique so they can communicate with one another morse code style to inform each other of their opponents' playing cards which they can see from opposing tables. The way Scorsese can illustrate such rich details during a brief montage showing how the players are able to incorporate this scam to the beat of the Jeff Beck Group's ""I Ain't Superstitious"" is like watching a master teaching a free class to show how it's done for other director-wannabes.<br/><br/>Casino also of course features fine performances from the cast - many of whom also actually happened to appear in GoodFellas. Watch for a clever nod to Frank Vincent's ""Billy Batts"" role in GoodFellas towards the film's conclusion.<br/><br/>A masterpiece in direction, film editing, and storytelling, Casino contains scenes which may be considered by some as excessively violent, and must also hold some sort of record for the amount of ""F"" words ever said in a film. Literally every line of dialog contains the word or variations on it. The easily offended may want to steer clear.<br/><br/>Certainly one of the great films in the Scorsese canon which makes for a fine companion piece for his groundbreaking classic GoodFellas. I hope Scorsese makes one final mobster film with DeNiro and Pesci. Casino proves that, as far these three are concerned, you can't get much better of a combination as far as movies go. Should my wish come true, hopefully Mr. Scorsese can find another classic rock song to put on the soundtrack to fit the mood of the story besides ""Gimme Shelter"" - also featured prominently in GoodFellas and The Departed."
"meg23","8","1","1","1 March 2009"," Interesting character study
","The obvious is obvious: gambling is not as great an evil as once thought, gangsters make for good entertainment, and Scorsese is a master of keeping a yarn from getting tangled. The real star of the movie is not Scorsese, not Joe Pesci's great turn as an out of control mob boss, not even Las Vegas herself, which is such a great focus of the film. The star of the film was De Niro's talent and sensitivity in portraying a man who is never sensitive himself. Rothstein is fascinating, and as a character should stand Hamlet's modern equivalent in complexity. This movie draws a lot on the noir classic ""Gilda,"" except without the indulgence of a good guy. Despite all of the action and violence, this is a very deep picture."

","Scorsese's follow-up to Goodfellas is a monstrously entertaining drama about a mafia run casino in Vegas. Robert De Niro plays the chain-smoking control freak Sam Rothstein, who is put in charge of the Tangiers casino by his mob buddies, most notably Nicky Santoro. Santoro is played by the one and only Joe Pesci, who may very well have topped his performance in Goodfellas. Nicky is a killer, thief, gambler, and muscle-man, who wants the world and is willing to go over the heads of his bosses to get it. Sharon Stone completes the trifecta of immorality as Ginger, a hustler who Sam convinces to marry him even though he knows she doesn't love him. Though the movie is largely the story of the mob embezzlement of Vegas, and the inner-workings, dynamics and politics of running a casino, the relationship between the three main characters is key to the plot.<br/><br/>The plot is told unconventionally, and as the story takes place over the span of ten years, many of its scenes feel like anecdotes. But each one adds something great to the whole story. Everything builds to something, there's not one wasted second in the entire 3 hours. It seems to go by very quickly because it is so entertaining. The three leads are absolutely flawless and the drama that unfolds is truly engrossing. All three change as the movie progresses. Ginger starts off as a happy, free-spirited woman, but when she marries Sam she starts a descent into darkness. Sam's controlling tendencies are largely to blame for her slide into drug abuse, greed and compulsive lying. She resents him controlling her, he doesn't trust her enough to give her any space. She spirals further by running away with their kid and Lester, then later tying the kid to the bed when she went out to drink. Sam is the kind of person who tries to do the right thing in all situations, but with Ginger he sometimes overreacts and escalates problems further. Their deteriorating relationship threatens to sink the whole casino scam.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Sam's over-protectiveness of his own casino lands him in hot water with the gaming commission, and Nicky's own actions make him a target for the FBI. Both are unable to let go of the monster that they created, Nicky refusing to leave town to let the heat on him cool down, and Sam unable to step out of the limelight of running the casino. The relationship between Nicky and Ginger is interesting because for once we see a human side of Nicky. She ends up sleeping with him, complicating things further. When the house of cards quite literally comes down, the bullets fly in classic Scorsese style. Only Sam is left unscathed, somehow coming full circle, hopefully a much wiser man.<br/><br/>Scorsese directs this movie at full-speed, tearing open the rotten underside of Vegas in the 1970s for all to see. From taking us into the inner workings of casinos, to mob shakedowns, husband and wife quarrels, political manoeuvring, and tying it all together, you're always involved. This is a must-see film and one of the best of the 90's."

","After the great Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese released Casino, a very similar movie with a few of the same actors, and I think I actually prefer this one to its predecessor, by a small margin. Casino is embellished with a lot of flashy overhead shots of nighttime Las Vegas, but underneath all that, you'll find a compelling and gritty drama full of great characters, a complex and winding plot that will have you stuck to your seat for the full three hours - not an easy feat, I might add - with multiple subplots that all remain interesting. They intertwine and twist into the great drama that is the individual man's life, and there are countless scenes here that will remain memorable: the introduction of each major character, Joe Pesci interacting with his young son, Sharon Stone interacting with her leeching ex-boyfriend, the scene where Robert DeNiro stands in the desert as the dust from Pesci's car kicks up around him, and the countless scenes of upper-class suburban Los Vegas juxtaposed with the chaotic, grimy personal lives of those who inhabit it.<br/><br/>This movie is pretty long, so if you are not the type who likes to sit down for three straight hours, then I wouldn't recommend this one to you, but for everyone else, feast away. Martin Scorsese's Casino is always realistic, stirring and memorable, so go see it if you haven't already. Superlative."
"AnandAtMicrosoft","10","1","1","6 August 2008"," Excellent
","Casino can be considered as one of the best entertaining movies ever made. Martin Scorcessee keeps you tied to the seat throughout the movie. Usually, I don't like Joe Pesci's work, but the role he played in this one can be considered as the performance of his life. No other actor has scared the sh*t out of me as Joe Pesci does here. In real life, I'd never like to come across someone like Nicky (Joe Pesci). Not to forget Sharon Stone. I am pretty sure that no other actress could have played Ginger. Again, this can be considered as the best performance by an actress. DeNiro is as usual at his best. As for Scorcesse, he's made one of the Hollywood's greatest movies of all time. I give 10/10. This should be listed in first 5 on the IMDb's list."
"rockycairns","10","1","1","20 July 2008"," One of my Absolute Favorites!!!
","Ranking along with my all time favourite films, Casino is based on the true story of Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal and Anthony ""The Ant"" Splitoro renamed Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein and Nicky Santoro for the film.<br/><br/>Playing Sam Rothstein is none other than Robert De Niro, supported by Sharon Stone as Ginger Rothstein, Sam's wife, and Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro, Sam's friend. There are many other familiar faces from Scorsese's film Goodfellas his prior mafia epic. Like Goodfellas this film is filled with the violence and seedy, yet classy environment of the underworld.<br/><br/>The basic plot is that Sam is a good handicapper who is given control of a new casino, the Tangiers, which is bankrolled by the Kansas City mafia. He moves out to Las Vegas to run the place, and he runs it very well, keeping out scam artists and cheaters. After a while, he becomes romantically involved with Ginger, a respected hustler who makes her rounds in Vegas, but has a troubled personality and history. He is later joined by his gangster pal Nicky Santoro, who moves out to Vegas with the intentions of conquering the city's criminal rackets.<br/><br/>Another good thing about the film is its soundtrack. Since the film takes place in the 1960s and 1970s, we are treated to all sorts of great music from classic artists. The soundtrack occupies two compact discs, giving you an idea of how much of a role the music plays in this movie.<br/><br/>This film also features what I consider one of the greatest opening credits sequences of all time. The camera rolls over waves of flashing lights, which represent the flashiness that Vegas is all about. The only complaint that I have about the beginning of the movie is the scene where a car explodes and a dummy is painfully visible in the front seat. Marty, how on earth could you have missed this?!<br/><br/>De Niro is fantastic (as usual) and really carries his role well. He plays a real tough guy, but at the same time we see how vulnerable he is. Despite his questionable background, he wants to play the casino straight and not get involved in any activities that could get him removed by the gaming board, easily one of his greatest roles.<br/><br/>This is also Sharon Stone's best performance, She plays the role of the drugged up wife very convincingly, with very real emotion. We watch with horror as she goes from being a classy hustler to a bored housewife with a severe drug problem with horrific consequences, Stone surprises in this film and was fully deserving of the Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>And of course there's Joe Pesci who gives out an amazing, hilarious yet completely disturbing performance as Nicky Santoro. At the beginning of the film, he is a lowly gangster, but by the end of the film he has created his own criminal empire and exhibits a lot of power in a scary way. His performance in this film is very similar to the one he gave in Goodfellas, with essentially the same explosive personality, although quite a bit darker, It's an incredible performance and ranks up there with his best.<br/><br/>The set locations are perfect for this film since all of the casino shots were taken inside of an actual Vegas casino. At the same time, the casino was convincingly reverted to the film's era, making us feel like we are in the early days of Vegas. It is definitely not the modern commercialized Las Vegas, but the older, frightening, yet classy Vegas where you don't try to rip off the casinos out of fear.<br/><br/>Scorsese uses a lot of shots with an interesting light effect, where bright light is shone brightly onto one or more actors in the shot. This creates a surreal appearance and makes the person look superior or even godlike. He also pulls some very interesting camera angles and uses special effects sparingly.<br/><br/>One of the things that Scorsese does really well is to explain everything to the viewer without ever making it boring. Right at the beginning of the movie, he explains who everyone is and how the casino was started. Throughout the movie, characters engage in narration to reveal their thoughts where we might otherwise be left guessing. I think this adds a nice touch and we feel as though we are inside the character's head as they give the narration.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of my favourite films of all time and definitely one of my favourite Scorsese films. It is a true shame that he did not win an Academy Award for this achievement, since he clearly deserved it. I regard it as a must-see film."

","Casino its my favorite casino movie,but my favorite casino online is www.s7vencasino.com Sharon Stone, what can I say? What a remarkable performance! She was very much robbed of her deserved Oscar. I was reading in my ""Rober DeNiro: A history of his films"" that Sharon over shined both Joe's and Robert's performance. In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has ""hired"" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace ""I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I'm not protecting you anymore!"", you get scarred and can't help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours. You hate her character so much, you want her to get what's coming to her, that's what makes a terrific performance. When you actually want to make sure that this character gets the justice he or she deserves. Sharon, I apologize, you deserved more praise as well."
"rossini1868","10","1","1","20 June 2008"," ""The Italian Trilogy""
","The third movie in what I call ""The Italian Trilogy"", 1)Raging Bull, 2)Goodfellas, 3)Casino. Every time it comes on Bravo or USA I find myself trapped in front of it (despite the bad dubbing). I used to think the movie was just Scorsese's manufactured form, but I believe now the movie is inspired from start to finish--from Deniro's silhouette floating in the fire during the opening credits and operatic music to him at the desk with the giant eyeglasses at the end saying ""And that's that."" Stone, Pesci and Deniro were all good enough to be nominated--too bad Sharon didn't win. Even James Woods was good as Sharon's old boyfriend. Its just one great scene after another for the whole three or four hours, peaking with their meeting in the desert (""...you're only out here because a ME!"") The movie works on every level, the acting, screenplay, directing and everything else in between."
"jpschapira","9","1","1","10 March 2008"," The Scorsese spell...
","During its first forty minutes, Martin Scorsese's ""Casino"" is pure narration, except for little spoken moments. It's a risky move, but then Marty has always been risky, and this movie may be the ultimate example to prove it. Closing in at three hours duration time, it takes its characters on a roller-coaster ride that not everyone might appreciate; from the advantages of recurrent fortune to the regular Scorsese tragedy.That's cutting it short, because there's a lot in the middle, but without telling you 'what' exactly goes on in ""Casino"", I'll tell you how you can approach it as a film. <br/><br/>When Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is put in charge of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, he sees it as the perfect chance to erase the obscure past we call carry with us. However, his best friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) is not fond of legitimacy; and when he settles in Vegas to protect him, it's not long until he starts doing some business of his own. <br/><br/>As Nicky himself puts it: ""The dollarÂ…Always the dollar"". But if we go back, Nicky also expresses at the beginning: ""It was perfect. Sam was the perfect guy to run the casino and he had me, his best friend, and Ginger, the woman he loved"". We see Ginger (a monumental Sharon Stone) at first as Sam sees her, a light in the middle of the room (there's one scene where this translates literally in images, with Robert Richardson's cinematography-that contains a wonderful use of light-putting the rest of the room in a mild darkness, while De Niro stands in awe as Stone walks and works the room accompanied by a constant light), but she is actually the most complex character of the film.<br/><br/>If you approach ""Casino"" as a movie to see the inside movement of the casino business and its ups and downs (a subject the film manages perfectly), you may not notice the complexity of Stone's character and her performance. But then, if you view the film as the study of the consequences of an arranged marriage and life, you might miss the best element of the film: Joe Pesci's creation of Nicky; something that's indeed better than his work in ""Goodfellas"".<br/><br/>Ultimately, you may choose to take ""Casino"" as the story of a long-time friendship and the betrayals that come with the years because people change and want different things from life. Again, this (as the marriage thing) is a subject that the film dominates. That's how brilliant Nicholas Pilleggi's-together with Scorsese-adaptation of his own book is; it covers everything with every detail. They did the same thing with ""Goodfellas"" and it was so rich that you could get lost in the 'mafia' universe. <br/><br/>Here, as in ""Goodfelas"" (both film share many similarities, more than anything in the ongoing decay of certain characters and images that seem obvious copies from the 1990 film and speak by themselves, about how great both movies are and that these similarities don't change that fact at all), you have to try to follow every plot line in order to witness every scene exactly as what it means in the movie. <br/><br/>It's the only way you'll enjoy the many conversations between Sam and Nick that lie between the best of the film and, besides showing that De Niro is the best when it comes to calming someone down and/or persuading him to make another decision; but Pesci is better because his stubbornness allows him to evade discussions and therefore cause the other more trouble (also that both know each other by heart so the work together is pure pleasure), are crucial to its development. <br/><br/>The narration comes and goes during the film, in present or past time, generating more confusion for the viewer. This is all after the first hour and a half, and if you're not hypnotized by the film's spell at that point, something must be wrong. Is the movie too long? Yes, if the spell didn't work on you; but if you're already connected with the characters and don't want to get out, it makes no difference if it lasts three or five hours."

","Perhaps proving the theory of cinema bringing to life the dark desires audience members dare not act out, the American film industry and audiences alike have always demonstrated a perverse fascination with the crime epic - films detailing the illustrious life of those prospering off a life of breaching conventional codes of ethics. Such is a theme that acclaimed director Martin Scorsese has returned to time and time again: demonstrating the pros and cons of a life lived on the other side of the law. And while Scorsese's mob classic Goodfellas charted the rise of a lowly hood through the ranks of the mob, Casino details the contrary: a life of luxury at the top of the mob, the consumption of man's soul by greed, betrayal and maddening violence, and the inevitable plummet which ensues. <br/><br/>Although comparisons to Goodfellas may prove inevitable, (given the similar subject matter, stylistic narrative and cinematic techniques, use of brutal violence and even the re-use of actors De Niro and Pesci) to fail to recognize the staggering accomplishment that is Casino, similarities or not, would be unforgivable. Ultimately the two are entirely different animals, as Casino, despite its glitzy exterior, demonstrates a distinctly darker storyline throughout, as its meticulously constructed, precariously balanced criminal organization begins to be torn apart from the foundations, with cataclysmic outcomes. The script, written by Nicholas Pileggi (working from his own source novel) and Scorsese himself is a fiercely memorable piece of work, punctuated with harshly realistic characters and scenarios, and a slew of maliciously well crafted lines. Although De Niro and Pesci's dual voiceovers can be slightly distracting, leading one to believe that the film might have benefited from the elimination of the Pesci voice-over all together, they do provide intriguing contrasting sides of the same story, and one can hardly fault the writers for experimenting. <br/><br/>The legendary Scorsese is operating at the top of his game here, bringing all of his trademark meticulous professionalism to play with devastatingly effective results. By moving his film along at a steady, blistering pace, yet still taking his time, allowing his characters to slowly unfold throughout and giving the audience plenty of time to drink in the seductive yet tainted luxury of the lifestyles of high profile casino officials, Scorsese uses his film's hefty duration to his advantage, immersing the audience within his story in a truly peerless fashion. With typically superb neo-noir style cinematography (with many lengthy sweeping shots, capturing the breadth of the casino in all of its hedonistic glory) and editing, and enormously well complimented by one of his patented soundtrack amalgamations, Scorsese's work similarly excels on a technical front, making for a supremely impressive piece of film-making. <br/><br/>As per usual, Scorsese extracts riveting intensity and realism from his cast, with captivating results. Robert De Niro inhabits the role of casino owner Sam 'Ace' Rothstein with a masterful conviction and charisma, dispelling all fears of him coasting by on such an admittably familiar role. Joe Pesci runs the risk of being forever typecast in a role only a shade away from his performance in Goodfellas, but fiercely proves his peerless status in inhabiting psychopathic loose-cannon mobsters. Sharon Stone delivers a surprisingly powerful performance as Rothstein's endlessly greedy drug-addict trophy wife, entirely believable as her character arcs from smoothly manipulative to dizzyingly cocaine-addled and truly pathetic. Don Rickles is a charming presence as Rothstein's right hand man in the casino, and Frank Vincent gives a strong performance as a suspicious fellow member of the mob. James Woods proves grotesquely memorable as Stone's past pimp boyfriend, and Woods shines in his few scenes, chewing the scenery with disconcerting aplomb. Kevin Pollack also impresses as a smooth talking ""front man"" for the more sinister undertones of the casino.<br/><br/>Brutally intense and endlessly fascinating, Scorsese's crime epic delivers a sufficiently flooring clout to easily merit distinction from Goodfellas' shadow. A masterclass of brilliant writing, blistering acting and disturbingly realistic thematic content, Casino proves another towering accomplishment from the incomparable Scorsese, one worth seeing by any in search of searingly powerful and impeccably crafted film-making. <br/><br/>-10/10"

","Casino is a film about the mob empire that secretly ran Las Vegas in the 1970's and early 80's. Casino follow's Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein(Robert Deniro), a professional gambler who is given the task by the Mafia to run a casino in Las Vegas. His good old neighborhood friend, Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci), is a wild, demonic gangster that is assigned to watch Ace's back. Ginger(Sharon Stone) is a hustler and ex-prostitute that Ace falls in love with. All three main characters have flaws. Some have minor flaws while others have major flaws. Each character's flaw leads them to their own demise. Casino is a film about money, power, and greed. This gripping tale show's how something good can go straight to hell.<br/><br/>The characters are well developed. Ace is a cool character. He is a pretty smart guy and is a perfectionist. He is the best at what he does and he knows it. And what he does is illegal, but he does it in a clean way. But Nicky on the other hand is not a clean guy. His business is roughing people up and stealing. He is the muscle of the Mafia in Vegas and his job is to make sure know one messes with Ace and that know one messes up the money making scheme. Both Ace and Nicky are street guys who have been given the chance to do something big with their lives. When they each moved to Vegas they both had their own small goals and then one main goal that they both shared and that was making money for the Bosses back home. Then Ace meets Ginger. And everything gets turned upside down. Ginger is a hustler with a rough past, but Ace is drawn to her. Her beauty and style mesmerizes Ace. There is something about her that makes Ace go wild. Ace falls for Ginger and they get married. But even before they get married the viewer sees some instability in Ginger. And when she finally is married all of her instability is put on display. Half of her instability comes from her continued relationship with her ex-pimp, Lester Diamond(James Woods). Lester is a true sleezeball. Lester continually uses Ginger for money. His actions and even the way he dresses completely sells him as a sleezeball. These four great characters intertwine through the film creating great drama.<br/><br/>Ace is the main protagonist. Ace has to push to get his gaming license in order to run his casino. Nicky creates a bad rap for Ace and the casino because of all his suspicions in crime. Nicky eventually ends up starting his own gang and begins robbing the locals of Las Vegas. Meanwhile Ace has a troubled marriage with Ginger. Ginger becomes more and more unstable. Ginger becomes an alcoholic and eventually a drug addict. She cheats on Ace with Lester and eventually with Nicky. Ace suspects that this is going. But he cannot stop loving Ginger. No matter how crazy she becomes he always gives in. Ace thought he could change Ginger by marrying her but all she wanted was his money. Ace himself becomes absorbed with the casino and his power. And Nicky is overwhelmed by greed. Nicky's goal is to take over the thrown in Vegas. In the end the Mob empire in Las Vegas collapses as do the lives of Ace, Ginger, and Nicky. <br/><br/>There is one criticism I have on this film. I would like to comment on the narration. The film is filled with narration. The first narrator is Ace and the other is Nicky. The first hour of the film is like a documentary of Las Vegas in the 1970's. There are brief pauses with actual dialog but they are only brief. The narration continues through the movie but lessens in the second half. But never goes away I might add. The narration did do a good job of filling in the gaps. Sort of like Goodfellas. I liked Ace's narration but I felt annoyed by Nicky's. I didn't think it was needed. Deniro's voice is smooth while Pesci's voice is kinda annoying. But who am I to criticize Martin Scorsese. If he wants two narrators then he can get two narrators. <br/><br/>ACTING<br/><br/>4. Joe Pesci plays the usual wacko gangster like in Goodfellas and he has it mastered. I have never met Joe Pesci and I'm sure he doesn't act like Nicky but he is so believable that you start to wonder if he acts like that in real life.<br/><br/>3. James Woods plays Lester so wonderfully. He is the definition for creepy and slimy. He does a great job of being a low-life looser.<br/><br/>2. Sharon Stone is the only woman who could play Ginger. I know a lot of people hate Sharon Stone and find her annoying, but in Casino you are supposed to hate her. And she does a good job of being the person you hate.<br/><br/>1. Robert Deniro was in my opinion the most impressive in the film. I think this is one of his best if not the best performance of his career. He plays Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein so well. I cannot say that I like Ace but he's pretty cool. Deniro is so smooth. Even when he gets angry he is smooth. Deniro's performance was the best.<br/><br/>OTHER ACTORS-- Don Rickels, Alan King, Kevin Pollack, and Frank Vincent also star in Casino and they do a great job with their more minor roles.<br/><br/>WARNING!!!!! Casino is a very dark, brutal film. Full of very Strong, graphic, and brutal violence. There is also very strong language that is said through out the whole three hours of film. <br/><br/>To finish I would like to say that Casino is a great film all around. With great acting, directing, and with a great story that is similar to a Shakespearean tragedy. Go watch it!!!"
"shortround8391","10","1","1","3 August 2007"," Wow....just wow....
","This movie has gotta be the most underrated film ever. I think the reason why people don't consider this a classic is because everyone has to constantly compare this movie to Goodfellas and because of this they say that Casino is somewhat of a rip off of Goodfellas, WHY? Because it has a similar cast? BIG DEAL. In my opinion I actually think Casino is better and more enjoyable and not to mention more realistic, in the movie pretty much all the gangsters are extremely violent which is what gangsters are in real life, this case, you've gotta point out the character Nicky (Pesci) for that since there's a scene where he actually stabs a tough guy with a pen and makes him begging for his life and another when he crushes a guys head in a vise. And Ace (DeNiro) when he caught two cheaters in his casino and had one of them get his hand smashed with a hammer.<br/><br/>The plot is very, very easy to get into. It explains how the Mafia controlled the casino in Las Vegas which created a sort of a multi-million dollar gambling empire and at the end the entire empire crumbled, just like that. It's a great story, I love it.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, Robert DeNiro is as good as ever, Joe Pesci always good at playing the violent psychotic gang member. And Sharon Stone should've won the Oscar that she was nominated for her flawless performance.<br/><br/>This film is without a doubt worth watching and is one of Scorsese's best."

","If nothing else, this film answers the question of what happened to the Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s that most of us experienced and loved. Ace makes the correct statement that now Vegas is the another DisneyWorld where you can take the whole family to be entertained. I remember when it was a little more adult entertainment - a great floor show, 99 cent T-bone dinners, and reasonably priced rooms - all subsidized by gambling. <br/><br/>But what about the movie itself?... While watching the movie, I was reminded of a Saturday Night Live skit called ""Low Class Italian Theater"" presumably based on the film Raging Bull. The skit satirized movies with Italian men using the f-- word and accusing each other of sleeping with each other's wives. While I think this is one of Martin Scorsese's best films with superb acting by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone, I can't help but feel it is a little flawed by the constant verbal assault which is not totally germane to the movie. In fact, I heard more anti-Semitic remarks in this one movie than in my entire life. Furthermore, while Sharon Stone's acting was nothing short of brilliant, I think the pace of the movie could have progressed faster and the movie shortened if they had cut out much of her neurotic screwed-up wife routine. I also feel there was an audio assault with the excessive soundtracks. The acting and story line really spoke for itself and did not need every song that was added for dramatic emphasis. Nevertheless, in spite of these alleged shortcomings, I loved the movie and felt I was actually looking at a newsreel from 1973; it seemed that realistic. As mentioned before, the acting was superb and I can't believe there were not more Oscars won here. The fact that it was based on a true story only adds to its aura of a great film. Watch it when you have three hours to spare!"

It is definitely not the modern commercialized Las Vegas, but the older, frightening, yet classy Vegas where you don't try to rip off the casinos out of fear.<br/><br/>Scorsese uses a lot of shots with an interesting light effect, where bright light is shone brightly onto one or more actors in the shot. This creates a surreal appearance and makes the person look superior or even godlike. He also pulls some very interesting camera angles and uses special effects sparingly.<br/><br/>One of the things that Scorsese does really well is to explain everything the viewer without making it boring. Right at the beginning of the movie, he explains who everyone is and how the casino was started. Throughout the movie, characters engage in narration to reveal their thoughts where we might otherwise be left guessing. I think this adds a nice touch and we feel as though we are inside the character's head as they give the narration.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of my favorite films of all time and definitely one of my favorite Scorsese films. It is a true shame that he did not win an Academy Award for this achievement, since he clearly deserved it. I regard it as a must-see film, valuing it has one of the ten best movies ever made."

","From another reviewer about Joe Pesci: ""He can act but he isn't all that good in the bad guy role. I dunno it just wasn't that good. It isn't worth the buy."" Huh? Are you OK? Pesci is the perfect bad guy, and the film borders on perfection in my book. I love Rickles cast as the manager, and his joke about the private jet problems, ""Hey, better down here than up there, you know what I mean"". Pescis' scene rousting the 2 hoods inside the Tangiers is just typical of his acumen as an actor. The final scene of Sharon Stones' demise backed by the over-echoed Animals song ""House of the Rising Sun"" is sheer brilliance. Solid 9/10."

","It's not an easy task making my list of ten best films ever. In fact, the list is rarely altered. Martin Scorsese now holds three of those spots. His 1995 film, ""Casino,"" is cinematic poetry and heart-wrenching tragedy rolled up into one. It is one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is a professional gambler, and one of the best of his time. The setting is 1973. Rothstein is connected with the Mafia, who wish to open a casino in Las Vegas. They realize Rothstein knows the business and they put him in charge. His boyhood friend, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) wants to give Vegas a try, and Rothstein has no objections. Eventually, the De Niro character falls in love with Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), who may or may not have the same feelings towards him. As time passes, Nicky starts taking over the town of Las Vegas through murder and extortion. He is labeled the local mob boss, and this begins to cause trouble for Rothstein. The public exposes him and the casino of being mob-lead, and this movie is about how something so glamorous, can be turned so ugly, simply by the actions one decides to partake in.<br/><br/>I don't think there's any question; Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors who ever lived. He manages to piece together perfection each time he makes a film. They are entertaining and magical, but remain harrowing and relevant. All film students should watch his technique carefully. No one, however, could impersonate his genius.<br/><br/>The acting here is beyond great. Robert De Niro is absolutely fantastic as Ace Rothstein. He is one of the best actors who ever breathed, and he gives another example as to why. Sharon Stone does a wonderful job as the emotionally disrupt and confused wife of Rothstein. Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro is superb. He is nothing short of brilliant in Scorsese pictures, and here, his streak continues. Great supporting performances from James Woods, Frank Vincent, and Kevin Pollak.<br/><br/>One of the greatest things about this movie is the story. It all started brilliantly, and then it all turned around, simply because these people choose to live their life as they do. They're in it for the money, but what's the point of money when you lose everything because of the life you chose? The story is all the more fascinating knowing it's based on fact.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese is without flaw, and the dialogue is stunning.<br/><br/>When you wrap everything together; the directing, the screenplay, the acting, and editing, you are reminded on the film's tag-line: ""No One Stays at the Top Forevor."" That may be, but this film might be at the top forever. Magnificent."
"classicalsteve","8","1","1","11 March 2007"," Money Cannot Buy Happiness Even at a Casino
","The characters of Casino have everything that money can buy: beautiful cars, beautiful clothes, beautiful houses, and yet it is still not enough. The people that win the most money at the casinos are not the people that get the jack-pots. The money ultimately goes to the owners of the casinos. As pointed in the film, even the jack-pot and Black Jack winners end up being losers eventually if they play long enough.<br/><br/>In the film ""Casino"" not even the people running the casinos win either in the end. They also eventually lose as if they had also played too long, which seems to be the message of Casino. Because no matter how much money is gained, the characters always want more, and they resort to acts of unspeakable cruelty to keep the money flowing, for themselves and their mob bosses back in Chicago who are financing the casino scheme.<br/><br/>This is possibly Scorcese's most disturbing and violent film. The characters are compelling but none are particularly sympathetic. Rothstein, perfectly suited to actor Robert De Niro, seems the only character to at least have some kind of sensible code. But even he is not above resorting to acts of violence if anyone is caught cheating at his casino, The Tangiers.<br/><br/>In addition to De Niro, the acting of the other cast members is equally first rate, with a tour-de-force performance by Sharon Stone as the most tragic character of the story. Her character, from the in-the-know casino hustler paying off the valets to the dependent drug-addict giving thousands of dollars to her old pimp and junkie, is completely believable from beginning to end. Pesci also turns in another fine performance very similar to the character he portrayed in Goodfellas as the ruthless jewel robber and murderer.<br/><br/>The film is somewhat hampered by voice-overs that last too long in some places. The beginning voice-over makes sense as De Niro describes the operations of the casino. But then other characters chime in and it gets over burdensome. Also, the violent is incredibly graphic, even for Scorcese. Definitely not for all tastes and certainly NOT for children.<br/><br/>Still, despite some misgivings, Casino is still a great film. Maybe neither an Oscar winner nor Scorcese's best but certainly the director's most ambitious project."

","An absolute classic.Giving Martin Scorsese Las Vegas to make a gangster movie is like giving Michealangelo the Cistine Chapel to paint in.There's not a scene in the whole thing that you can draw your eyes away from for a second,not a line in it that you can class as unnecessary. The acting from from a superb cast was marvellous,(James Woods must have scrubbed himself clean after the movie was finished because he really became Lester the sleaze-bag). This film has always been considered inferior to Goodfellas(loved it too by the way),but it's every bit as good.Where Goodellas dealt with the street level hoodlum,Casino took us into the boardroom.

","One thing that I love about Martin Scorsese's movies is their more-dimensional portrayal of characters. I often have both, feelings of sympathy and feelings of revulsion towards the people in his movies. The same feeling occurs towards Las Vegas and its casinos in ""Casino"". On the one hand Scorsese glorifies the old casinos. When Ace laments in the end, that today Las Vegas is nothing more than a gambling Disneyland, we suffer with him. It's a place run by emotionless businessman. On the other hand, however, Scorsese knows about the victims that the old system claimed, about the abyss behind the shiny surface. The film is acted very well by the ""Goodfellas""-duo Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, while the biggest surprise for me was Sharon Stone. For me Ginger is a victim of this system, although some people might argue that she herself is responsible for the situation she's in. In the end, she is not the only victim and many other problems will be solved in the desert surrounding Las Vegas."

","This movie is a classic, the music flow, the scenery is well done. But the characters are quite something.

","I must say I am a lover of gangsta films and casino is one of my favourites just behind goodfellas. In my opinion better than The Godfather. Casino is a mob story about a multi billion dollar casino operation that Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) owns. He is joined in Vegas by a mad mob boss; Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) to make sure no one messed with Ace. Both De Niro and Pesci give fine performances. Joe Pesci as usual plays the mad man absolutely brilliantly. Even though these two were on top form, Sharon Stone gives a unforgettable performance. Stone was robbed of an Oscar and this film also deserved an Oscar. If someone can tell me a better film in 1995 I'd like to know what it is because it would take something special to over shine this masterpiece. <br/><br/>This film, even though so brilliant and watchable was rated 18 for a good reason. There is about 400 f-words mostly used by Joe pesci and the c-word is used once by Robert De Niro. Also this film has some of the most disturbing violence I have ever seen. In one scene the mad Joe Pesci puts a guys head in a vice and squeezes it until the mans eye pops out. Thats just to name one violent scene, believe me there are many more.<br/><br/>Besides that the film is amazing . The acting is brilliant and the film is highly recommended to any gangsta movie fan, or even if you don't like gangsta movies you will enjoy it. Fantastic, but not for the young ones."
"Aditya_Gokhale","10","1","1","16 June 2006"," Criminally Under-acknowledged! Definitely one of Scorsese's best.
","""Casino"" is not even on the top 250. It's a pity, what with so many lame movies getting much higher ratings.<br/><br/>Wonderfully directed by Martin Scorsese, this epic tale (based on real life incidents) unfolds with the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) a mob-backed guy who is brought in to Las Vegas to operate the Tangiers Casino, owing to his expertise in the same. His boyhood pal, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) also moves to Vegas with criminal plans of his own. Sam does his job really well, exposing cheats, disposing of the weaker employees, making sure he isn't robbed of money, and ends up making big bucks for his mob bosses ""back home"". However, things change when Sam falls for Ginger (Sharon Stone), a hustler. She already has a no-good boyfriend Lester (James Woods, in a small albeit important role). Inspite of his knowledge about her manipulative nature, he marries her. She is an alcoholic, and all she ever wants is money and security. Meanwhile, Nicky continues his criminal activities.<br/><br/>""Casino"" is, without doubt one of the best films by Scorsese. The film runs for almost three hours and events take their time to unravel, and rightly so. <br/><br/>The performances: Robert De Niro is one of the finest actors to come out of Hollywood and that's a universal fact! In this movie, he delivers a performance that qualifies as one his best after 'Raging Bull'. He appears super-cool as the Casino operator and you cannot help but sympathize with him in some later parts of the movie when he is having a bad time because of various reasons. Trust him to play an all-in-one character: a mob-connected Casino guy, a friend and a loving father all at the same time! His powerful performance in this movie has to be seen to be believed. It is nothing short of mind-blowing!<br/><br/>Joe Pesci..what can one say about this guy! Delivering sharp dialogs and firing those F-words with a one-of-a-kind punch is something only he can do! He plays a wicked, wicked character who also cares for his boy-hood friend, Sam. Another brilliant performance after GoodFellas, he is the finest choice for his role.<br/><br/>Sharon Stone: Superb!! I never thought I would feel that about her performance, but indeed, she gets a hell of a chance to act here..and she does it exceedingly well! The drunk hustler who cannot find happiness is played to perfection by Sharon...I guess it is also kudos to the director for bringing out the actor in her.<br/><br/>Then there are some wonderful, but small supporting performances by James Woods as Lester Diamond, Frank Vincent as Frank Marino, Alan King as Andy Stone and Kevin Pollak (The Usual Suspects) as Phillip Green. Special mention here, of Pasquale Cajano, who is superb as the mob boss, Remo Gaggi.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is very much like that in GoodFellas. And much in the same manner, there is some playful rock'n'roll music playing in the background during any violent scene of crime!<br/><br/>The dialog is brilliant. Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing. The wonderful screenplay for the film is co-written by Nicolas Pileggi who is also the author of the book. <br/><br/>As mentioned before, the film runs for about 3 hours but there is not a single moment when you'd want to take your eyes off the screen.<br/><br/>An under-rated classic, this one deserves a rightful place up there along with Scorsese's other acclaimed classics."

There are hundreds of movies like that, but Casino is another movie is a very special one.<br/><br/>As usual in a Mr Scorsese picture the acting is great, the three main characters, De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pecci are outstanding, how they mix, how they make alliances and how they break it is just marvelous.<br/><br/>The story of the rise and fall of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein must be seen more than once to appreciate all the details of the story, from the dialogs to the costumes, everything fits in its place and is central to the story.<br/><br/>This is a great Martin Scorsese Picture, as good as he can be."

","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""Casino"" is a graphic, realistic, and hilarious examination of a city controlled by corruption, violence, and avarice. The performances by Robert DeNiro as the tycoon scapegoat Sam (Ace) Rothstein, Joe Pesci as the wiseguy, menacing ""big man on campus"" Nicky Santoro, and Sharon Stone, as the emotionally disturbed, afflicted, and ballistic Ginger, among others, lend way to perhaps the most amusing and engaging story ever captured on film. I felt a great deal for these characters: their successes, troubles, and demises, as ""no one stays on top forever"", and I received an indelible conception of the operation of the mob in my residence of Las Vegas in the early 1980s. The script is fantastic: hilarious at times (this humor especially driven by the brilliant Joe Pesci, who can perform the most grotesque, audacious acts and still come across as hilarious), yet also serious and interesting, in examining down to the bare core the details of the mob underworld and its operation of casino empires. The direction by Martin Scorcese is definitely Oscar-worthy: rich, sincere, and relentless in focusing on various themes chronicling the volatile story. I especially appreciated the music, correlating with the film's themes most befittingly: light, heavy, dark, comical, etc. This film, besides being an engaging, amusing, and captivating tale about the body of the mob, is an excellent, and almost impeccable, production, wherein everything, from the direction, the acting, the screenplay, the music, and the editing, compliments whatever theme a scene is trying to achieve. Not for everyone, especially for those who might be allergic to obscenity (as this is perhaps the most profane film I've ever seen). Yet if you enjoy hardcore, serious, and comical stories about success, greed, and personal destruction, ""Casino"" fits the bill perfectly. For me, this is the best ""mob"" film ever, and a genuine classic in style, story, and deliverance. **** out of ****"

","Superbly crafted often sickeningly violent mafia must-see. Directed by Scorsese, starring De Niro, Pesci and Sharon Stone in a stand out performance <br/><br/>The true story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro), a shrewd, Mafia-connected casino operator, whose assured, mannered existence is undone by his devotion to his flighty wife, Ginger and his boyhood friend Nicky (Pesci), a wild card who fancies his chances on Ace's patch. <br/><br/>De Niro and Pesci narrate the extended opening, detailing the mechanics of skimming money from the casino to pass onto the bosses back home. This sequence ends with the glorious introduction of Sharon Stone's showgirl hustler Ginger, all fur, jewels and blonde ambition, who casts gambling chips into the air. On a security monitor, De Niro watches her exuberant transgression, and falls in love. So begins his downfall, and the end of Mob rule in Vegas. <br/><br/>Where Goodfellas explored the allure of being a Brooklyn wise guy, with a hair-trigger comic sensibility, Casino emphasises the remorseless fear and grind of a mobster's life, all its attraction purged in two horrifically violent set-pieces. One, a torture scene with a vice, has been rightly condemned as gratuitous - but it is the closing beating that truly disturbs, two men brutally disfigured by repeated whacks with metallic bats that, as they are tipped into the grave, their featureless faces frozen in a contorted howl, it's almost as if a new species has emerged from the violence, only to be suddenly, cruelly, aborted. There is no romanticism in this view of the mafia. <br/><br/>Scorsese making a gangster film with Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro raised no eyebrows, and led some critics to accuse him of hitting a rut. All the same, with its ferocity and maturity, particularly in the responsibilities weighing upon the wise guys, Casino can be seen a closing chapter in the evolution of a gangster community, from its street heyday in Mean Streets to its adjustment to the new drug trade in Goodfellas to its final giving way to the power of the corporations in the Eighties. <br/><br/>Verdict The closing chapter in Scorsese's American Crime trilogy, Casino is superbly acted and quite astonishingly obsessive about detail, money, and the mob's decline."
"Manthorpe","10","1","1","17 June 2004"," There's a lot of holes in the desert...
","Simply one of the best gangster films out there with an excellent ""true"" story yet strangely underrated. Casino is a masterpiece of a mob film from Martin Scorsese, and in my opinion better than the well received Goodfellas...and I don't know if I could tell you why, that's just the way I feel. There are many obvious similarities since they're both created by Scorsese, both have DeNiro and Pesci, and in both the s*** hits the fan in the end. They are frequently compared in reviews so I'll say, for the record, that I enjoy Casino much more. I think most of the reason Goodfellas is rated higher is because it came out first and some people see Casino as a rehash. I do not care about that myself, they're both great films.<br/><br/>I've seen this film over a dozen times and it still has yet to get old. It's filmed beautifully and the music seems to fit the time periods and helps to establish the overall environment of it all, as it should. DeNiro and Pesci were conceived by God himself to play their parts in films like these and are always a joy to watch. Sharon Stone as Ginger is a definite standout. I honestly didn't know she could act until she was in this movie. She portrays the drug addicted ex-call girl turned wife of Sam Rothstein, the mob friendly casino boss. The film is quite violent and some denounce it for being gratuitous as if the mob goes by the same standard. It's just a movie and if you enjoy watching films in the same genre, then it shouldn't be too much to handle. The language is also fairly harsh, mostly from Nicky (Pesci), but it helps give it a gangster feel. Plus, it doesn't help that there's so much voice over in the film, which is were a lot of the profanity comes from. That's just how mob guys talk, come on now. Didn't you know? All of the wise guys that I know do the same. Even though many consider voice overs a cop-out in filmmaking, I honestly can't imagine the movie any other way. It definitely works and at least it's not Ray Liotta's voice.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned, the cinematography is beautiful, all that panning and sweeping...love it, and it works. I particularly enjoy the opening sequence in which the operations of the casino are explained.......also the intro to the meeting in the desert where the camera focuses on Sam's sunglasses as Nicky drives madly across in the reflection, stirring up a storm of sand. Simple, but great. <br/><br/>Even more interesting are the true parts of the story. I did some research and the film does mix and match some things around, but for the most part it is true. In actuality, the true story was much crazier and it involved the skimming of four casinos, not just one, one of which was the Stardust....all were ran by the real Sam Rothstein, Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal. And yes, the character that is supposed to be Nicky (Tony ""The Ant"") really did do what he did in the movie with a vise. The fact that it's based on a true story does make it a little more enjoyable to me, especially since it's pretty damn close.<br/><br/>What it all boils down to is one of my favorite films that I've seen, and one of the best mob movies ever...just like Goodfellas. I think most just don't give it a fair chance. Had Casino been released first, I think it very well could replace GF in the Top 250. Some will hate me for saying this, but when it comes to this category of films, Casino is only second to the Godfather films. Now watch my body turn up in a cornfield."
"somewhere22","Null","1","1","24 March 2004"," Exceptionally cast, shot, and told.
","Casino in no way should be compared to the film ""Heat"", as I've read in other reviews- with the exception that it uses two of the same well known actors. It's release date is irrelevant, however similar, since stories make up movies, not release dates.<br/><br/>With that said, Casino is a striking and glittering rise and fall epic depicting the mafias' crooked grip on an early Las Vegas. Based on a true story, it stars Robert Deniro as Sam ""Ace"" Rostien, a dead-on and almost obsessively methodical gambler used and highly appreciated by mob bosses to run an efficient money machine named The Tangiers Hotel and Casino- an establishment, like all others at that time, whose initial investments were OK'd by the mob. Joe Pesci stars as Nicki Santuro, who works under the same bosses to protect their golden child, while Sharon Stone plays Ginger, a high-end Casino hustler who sooner than later wins Ace's rare affection in one sparkling moment while in his Casino. James Woods reaches the pinnacle of genuine sleaziness as Lester Diamond, a childhood friend of Ginger's and bottom of the barrel moocher and hustler. The film, using voice over and gliding explanatory takes, encompasses a brutal and almost ""behind the scenes"" type story of what went on in the early years of sin city, before commercial giants put their foot down and legally out financed everyone else. Under the guidance of Martin Scorsese, rich characters are proudly lived out by Deniro, Stone, Pesci, and Woods even in his small role, who all fit their character to a T. Thanks to Robert Richardson as cinematographer (The Doors), Casino not only excels at being an exceptional tale of money and trust, but also arrests the viewers attention with whirring motion, glowing color, and beautifully composed framing and lighting. The ever popular Soprano's has nothing on this movie. Music, locations, and editing serve the story as well, making it one of Scorsese's most solid works to date."
"departed07","10","1","1","12 November 2003"," The Town Will Never Be The Same
","After films such as Cape Fear and The Age of Innocence, Martin Scorsese returns to his roots where this would be the final film of Scorsese's mob trilogy (his first two were Mean Streets and GoodFellas) before his prequel (Gangs of New York) in which we get to see Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent in their last collaboration with Martin Scorsese before adding DiCaprio to the mix. Life in Las Vegas will never be the same.<br/><br/>The film's prologue has Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (De Niro) going to his car where he narrates about sacrifices about love, than his car blows up leaving him flying in the air. After the credits have rolled with his body flying, we get to see Rothstein before his death smoking a cigarette where he narrates about how he ran things very successfully and that he was a bookie who changed the odds for everybody; also we are introduced to characters from Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) who is Ace's best friend watching his back and says they screwed up the whole plan to take over the casinos; Ace's wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) is shown as innocent until we get to know her later as a street hustler who robs men for their money and hangs out with her old pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods).<br/><br/>The film is very different from GoodFellas and Mean Streets were both films talked about the territory of the mafia life such as nobody dating anybody different than their races; murders becoming an exception; damaging things when somebody doesn't pay; etc. Casino is more of a document on how organized crime controls what goes on in Las Vegas. It shows people in the account room counting money; all of the managers, dealers and bosses watching one another to see if they are doing their job, rob the rich people, take care of the high officials in the city and make sure that nobody tries to cheat in the casinos.<br/><br/>The character of Rothstein is a genius in terms of trying to take people's money and helping others get money. After his character is in charge of The Tangiers, Nicky narrates on how Sam got information on what went on with sports; he find out if the quarterback got his wife knocked up, if they did cocaine, crooked referees, even the wind velocity for the field goals. Nicky says, ""The boys back home didn't care if he enjoyed himself because Sam was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money."" The character of Nicky Santoro is like Pesci's Tommy DeVito from ""GoodFellas"" where they are volatile when not doing things their way. We see that in Nicky's character when a patron is verbally abusing Sam when all Sam asked was if the pen next to him was his, Nicky stabs the guy in the neck until the patron starts wheezing. Sam explains, ""No matter how big somebody is, Nicky would take'em on."" His appearance in Las Vegas worries Sam because he was going to be taking care of Sam along with his partner, Frank Marino (Frank Vincent) for which they scare most of the people away from Las Vegas and play their own game.<br/><br/>Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) has been a call girl all her life for which she steals chips from her Iranian boyfriend while having a camera zooming in on her and is being watched by Rothstein. He goes to the craps table where he sees Ginger wanting more money from the boyfriend and than tosses the chips to the floor where Rothstein has fallen in love with the call girl. ""In Vegas,"" he says ""for a girl like Ginger, love costs money."" Indeed it does, as Ginger robs Rothstein like Peggy would rob Al on ""MarriedÂ…With Children"" where she would take his money, when telling him that she is going to play some slots; Ginger also gets most of the employees on their knees as she drugs Andy Stone (comedian Alan King), one of the people working with the mafia; and gets most of the casino workers to give her things as long as she covers them; from clothes and cars, she had everything except her old boyfriend Lester Diamond who was a hustler stealing people for cash.<br/><br/>In a movie full of serious actors, there are three comedians playing supporting characters in this crime drama; Alan King is Andy Stone has I had mentioned, he works for the mafia in which he has conversations with them about how they should control Vegas; Don Rickles plays Billy Sherbert, the Casino manager who doesn't do much except waddle around and gets hit by Nicky; Phillip Green is played by Kevin Pollock in which his character is more of the reticent for which he can't do anything or say anything just because the teamsters gave him 62,700,00 dollars, it didn't mean anything as long as he pretended to be somebody big.<br/><br/>As much as performances go, the spotlight belongs to Sharon Stone in a great performance. Sharon has often portrayed the lured of affection for which we see her take her clothes off or try to appeal in a sexual situation. In Casino, she plays the character very mature and most likely will be her only serious performance; she'll be herself once we stop watching this film. Another spotlight belongs to Joe Pesci who won his Oscar for GoodFellas, yet he steals the show as a main character instead of a supporting character for which he gets to tell the point of view.<br/><br/>Casino proves to be another hit in the Martin Scorsese collection with an awesome soundtrack as its own theme, performances that shine, and bad guys that people like to root for."

","Cruelly referred to as Goodfellas: Redux by some, Casino deserves (nay, demands) to be see in it's own right. It isn't as good as Goodfellas, however, mainly because it tries to outdo that wonderful movie with extra lashings of gore (some of the violence is unwatchable), foul language, sex and music, to no avail. It's also inhibited by a narrower scope, taking in only the 70s and the early 80s and by the end, the script dithers as much as Sharon Stone's druggy showgirl. However, Scorsese pulls several impressive tricks, De Niro is effective as a outwardly dull but inwardly seething Jewish gangster, and the dialogue is occasionally inspired. If you can stomach the length of it, this is high quality Scorsese, but only just."
"flicmaster","10","1","1","29 June 2003"," A great, great movie
","Casino is one of my all time favorite movies. The narration is great, the music is wonderful, everything is just great. The movie always gets back to the point. Goodfellas showed us that real gangsters weren't about ""whacking"" everyone; it's about making money. Casino shows us the same thing, all the lights, all the comps, it's all been arranged just for us to get YOUR money. Even much later in the movie Nicky remarks, ""The f*%ckn' bottom line here is, cash"". The music in the movie is so fantastically placed that the movie begins to resemble a musical in some points.<br/><br/>A few things I have always wondered: 1) Why oh why isn't this movie on the top 250 list??? 2) Why are the names changed form the book?<br/><br/>In goodfellas, the names are the same. Henry Hill is Henry Hill. In Casino (the book) Sam ""Ace"" is actually Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal (If I remember correctly).<br/><br/>This is such a great movie. The pace is so fast and the dialogue and narration are so tight that all 3 hours just roll by without notice.<br/><br/>Probably my favorite thing about this movie is that it has major replay value. It isn't a rental. I can watch this movie a few times a month or even in a week. Some movies get stale after one or a few viewings. I feel that all of M Knight's (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) movies fall into that category. They're great movies, but you just can't watch them over and over. Casino is one of those special few that you can pop on and enjoy, not just fall asleep to."

","Director Martin Scorsese, editor Thelma Schoonmaker and Oscar-winning actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci reunited for this three-hour epic tale of the rise, fall and resurrection of a casino proprietor.  Set in Las Vegas from 1973 to 1983, ""Casino"" tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro, in one of his most underdeveloped roles) who makes his mark as one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas.  He has money, notoriety, connections, everything...except that special woman.  Enter Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone in a knockout performance that earned her a Best Actress Oscar nomination), a flashy, high-maintenance, money-driven cocaine hustler/prostitute who eventually becomes Mrs. Sam Rothstein.  Nicky Santoro (Pesci) is Sam's hotheaded friend who become a major player on the gambling scene himself, until greed and distrust bring their glittery (albeit volatile) decadence to a monumental halt.  With all of the film's star power and energy, it still just takes a long time to get where it's going (wherever that is).  Whether it was Scorsese's handling of this particular material, or Nicholas Pileggi's inability to adapt his own novel to the screen, ""Casino"" is just a few notches short of achieving real meaning and depth.  However, the film certainly deserved more nominations than it received (its only one being for Stone's characterization of Ginger): Pesci's explosive supporting role, Robert Richardson's vivid, colorful cinematography, John Dunn and Rita Ryack's costumes and Jack G. Taylor Jr. and Rick Simpson's Art Direction/Set Decoration all went unnoticed by the Academy.  Artistically, ""Casino"" is a visually sumptuous masterpiece.  Storywise, the movie fails to deliver in certain areas.  An uneven mixture, but it IS a handsome production.  *** out of ****."

I loved the Sid Vicious ""My Way"" at the end of Goodfellas, but Sam Rothstein bemoaning how Las Vegas has become a faceless Disneyland built on junk bonds is touching (""now when a whale comes in with a suitcase packed with millions, some high school student wants to check his social security number...""), especially when he takes off his shades at the end, and gazes sadly into space, reminiscing."

"soranno","Null","1","1","9 November 2002"," Robert DeNiro Triumphs Again
","Robert DeNiro has yet another great role in this 1995 Universal release. He portrays Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a professional gambler who becomes the boss of a mob operated casino in Las Vegas during the 1970's. He gets married to a smart mouthed and money driven casino hustler named Ginger (Sharon Stone) and makes a longtime friend named Nicky (Joe Pesci) his business partner in casino operations and dealings. Nicky is very defensive of Sam and would do anything to help him make money and stay in business. He especially doesn't mind beating bloody pulps out of people who refuse to cooperate with their demands. Sam is a little more restrained and only really cares about making money so he disapproves of Nicky's highly volatile behavior on several occasions. Meanwhile, Ginger just can't seem to leave her days of greed behind and forms an alliance with Nicky and other high rollers in a quest to help her get a huge share of the casino business profits. It's a lengthy film with an abundance of graphic mob violence, drug use, sexual content and some rather colorful profanity but it still ranks as a very high point in recent cinema and a very fitting follow up to ""Goodfellas."" Director Martin Scorsese follows up on the ""Cape Fear"" and ""The Age Of Innocence"" fiascos with a film that finds him very much back in his signature element, the epic crime drama. Nicholas Pileggi, the man who wrote the novel ""Wiseguys"" that eventually became the film ""Goodfellas"" once again adapts his novelization stories into film form and just like ""Goodfellas"", this film is a dramatized and fictionalized account that's modeled after a true story."

The only things i see that are the same are that Casino is about organized crime and Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are in this movie.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is fantastic. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are great. Sharon Stone outshines them all. She is the best actress ever to perform in a Scorsese movie. She beats Juliette Lewis in Cape Fear which was kind of a hard thing to do but Sharon made it look easy.

","It's amazing how some shows tend to glamorize my adopted hometown of Las Vegas...How everyone who lives here has tons of money and the best of all indulgences under a sunny sky and neon nights. Well, ""Casino""  gives everyone a good primer on what NOT to do if you are a local.<br/><br/> I particularly liked Rothstein's narrative on how everything is choreographed and coordinated to separate the happy tourists from their money. A little cynical, but otherwise very accurate and enlightening. Anyway, the movie is an entertaining look at the way life was out here, back in the 70's. A lot of the old-timers (some of whom knew the actual players on which ""Casino"" is based) tell me that they miss the good old days when the town was cleaner, less crowded and safer to live in. It gives a slight thrill to see the glamour and excitement, but never fails to remind us that there is a gritty and seamy side to the town. Then again, almost every American town has a ""City Confidential"" of its own. Even the real people that these characters are based on had a lot of just day-in, day out routine. Anyway...DeNiro did a great job portraying Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, even though Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal was not a particularly exciting person in real life. Joe Pesci played a very convincing Nicky Santoro, but a little more over the top than what Tony ""The Ant"" Spilotro was supposed to be like. Sharon Stone was even more compelling in her role as Ginger McKenna, because she was very accurate in her portrayal of Geri Rosenthal, Frank's beautiful but troubled wife. The timeline is a jazzed-up and high-compression version of Vegas from '73 to '83, thanks to Scorsese's action-packed touch and all-star soundtrack. I thought it was a crowning touch that most of the filming was done at the Riviera, as it is one of the classic ""old Vegas"" joints and definitely was in the same league as the Dunes and the Sands once upon a time. All in all, a great movie that tells a great story...Just remember that you have to remember that for once, fiction is a little more entertaining than truth."

","SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Casino is the best ""family"" movie ever. The movie takes in Las Vegas,the gambling capital of the world. We follow the rise and fall of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein,played by a brilliant(as always) Robert de Niro. He becomes boss of one of the biggest casino's in town,the Tangiers. As an old master gambler he knows all the tricks of the business,so that in a short period of time the Tangiers becomes the biggest Casino in Vegas. But then the problems start: first of all he meets a girl,Ginger played by a beautiful Sharon Stone and then an old friend comes to town to help him with the casino,Nicki Santoro(Joe Pesci in one of his greatest performances!). Nicki brings Ace into a lot of problems because of his aggressive way of solving things,like molesting a guy with a pen and putting someone's head into a vice. In the meantime Ginger can't keep away from drugs and booze while she also still has a relationship with a pimp,Lester Diamond(funny performance by James Woods).Above that all,she also starts to screw Nicki. At the end Ginger dies of an overdose,Ace survives a car bomb and Nicki(who set the car bomb) gets viciously murdered in the desert, he gets beaten with baseball bats and is buried alive.<br/><br/>casino is a beautiful movie about love,money and deceit in a sinful town. We get to see a great view inside the Casino and look at things that we otherwise would never get to see. The shots of Las Vegas are especially nice to watch,just look at one of the first shots of the movie,a great view over Las Vegas in the middle of the night.Here you can really see what a small city it is and that it is surrounded by absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>The performances by the actors are without exception high-class,especially the leading players:De Niro,Stone and Pesci. Joe Pesci is my favorite in this movie because of his quick dialogues and his unstoppable swearing. The directing by Martin Scorsese is as always flawless. His movies with Robert de Niro are of an unreached high level,just look at other films like Goodfellas,Raging bull,Cape Fear and Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>Although the movie can be really brutal at times(the scene in which Joe Pesci gets killed is really sick) the humor in some scenes are absolutely ingenious.Watch closely at the scene in which de Niro is behind his desk in his underwear and the scene in the grocery store with the old lady who can't her son swearing all the time,hilarious!<br/><br/>Overall,Casino is one of my favorite Scorsese movies and it is a shame that it is so underrated,also in this database. 10/10"

","This film is brilliant, it really is.  It is underated and overshadowed by its predessesor 'Goodfellas'.  Martin Scorsese really is the master of gangster movies, no doubt about it, yet the novelist Nicholas Pileggi deserves kudos too.  People say this movie tries to hard to be like Goodfellas and I think thats a terrible description.  The reason for this I think is that Joe Pesci's Nicky is too much the same character as his Tommy in Goodfellas.  If they had of put someone else in that role, possibly Benicio DelToro or an Edward Norton with an Italian makeover, then Casino would have gotten more individual praise.  To me, this film is on equal par with Goodfellas.  Well done again Scorsese & Pileggi."

","Once again Martin Scorsese, Nicholas Pileggi, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci unite for another epic mob movie, based on a true story. Casino tells the story of Sam Rothstein, who is put in charge of a mob controlled casino. Joe Pesci plays his friend, Nicky Santoro, from back home years ago who comes out to A) Protect Sam and the casino and B) make some cash for himself. He does just that. Along the way, Sam begins a relationship with Ginger, a hustler at the casino played by Sharon Stone. It tells the story of how the mob controlled casinos, and how people like these helped mess it up. From the opening scenes, one can see that Scorsese is following the Goodfellas format of flashback/voiceover work, but this benefits the movie. DeNiro and Pesci are on top form again, as is Sharon Stone surprisingly. Over all, a very well written, acted and directed film, the only drawback being it's length. Word of warning, this film is very violent at times. You would have heard of the vice scene by now as it helped garner this film some notorority, but it isn't the only one. If you can handle the violence and language, then this is a very rewarding film experience.<br/><br/>Best scene: DeNiro busts some yokels trying to cheat at the casino, and proves that a hammer and a kind word work better than just a kind word."

Robert De Niro is at his personal best as he give a white hot performance that could melt the varnish right off you kitchen table. Never has a man delivered his lines with such power and personal angst as this man, he is truley one of the most gifted actors on the planet. But it is not De Niro himself he is also giving an amazing script by Nicholas Pileggi, the same man who brough us Goodfellas and one of Americans greatest directors of all time Martin Scorsese. Joe Pesci is also fantastic as a violent mobster who is like a walking time bomb. Sharen Stone and James Woods are also in top form as well. It is the three hour plus story of the owner of one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas. We go through his ups and downs of life and his business. This is by far one of the grestest movies ever made and I am shocked at how even though it is over three hours long it never becomes boring and in fact even blinking might make you miss to much of this amazing gritty and very powerful drama. I have also found that out of all the actors De Niro is one of the only people who actually make swearing sound cool and you better believe there is a never ending stream of it here. If you like Goodfellas this movie is not to be missed since it follows the same basic formal just on a much larger scale. Not to be missed at any cost"

","Casino, is an ambitious project from Scorsese, but the backbone to this story is reinforced by exemplary performances from De Niro, Pesci and Stone. He then glosses their inner-relationships with magical camera work, and a soundtrack which captures the essence, and emotion of the era. Although, essentially a mob-drama, this film is about the relationships of the main players, and their relationship with the mechanics of the mob. What people think about the mob is that they go around killing people indiscriminately. However, the intrinsic reason is the money, they want to continue seeing the kickbacks, the green. I think De Niro gives an honest portrayal of a Casino boss who just wants things to run smoothly; the casino, his marriage to Ginger, and most importantly the machinations of the mob.  He is outshone here though by both Stone and Pesci, who's captivating, repulsive characters, makes for a sympathetic viewpoint of De Niro's character. My only fault here is the ending, which in its entirety resolves the fates of the other characters, but with De Niro's it ends so matter-of-factly that it compromises the outcome of the film.<br/><br/>A veritable feast of film. 9/10  7/10 if you don't like swearing."

It's right up there with Goodfellas though with Casino there isn't the same level of irony and humor that you find with Goodfellas but it's entertaining nonetheless.  This is a tale of unchecked greed, out of control egos, excessive behavior, and ultimately self-destruction that occurs as a result of all the money, power, and obsession.  The violence is right on par with Goodfellas maybe even more so and the violence is VERY necessary (including all the head shots) because it is both crucial to the story and faithful to what actually happened in real life.  I love the two old guys in jogging suits running around killing everybody (they were Felix ""Milwaukee Phil"" Aldersio and Charles ""Chuckie"" Nicoletti who were credited with 36 killings).  This was a tremendous performance for Sharon Stone and I'm sure it was the best of her career.  She makes you loathe her, despise her, and hate her but she somehow manages to  make you feel sorry for her by the end. DeNiro is dead on as usual and Pesci puts on a show that almost rivals Tommy DeVito.  Casino may not have been as popular as Goodfellas but I believe the acting was just as good and the story was just as gripping. Scorsese must have been proud of himself and this was my favorite movie of 1995."

","What if you had all your wishes come true and then lost everything? Casino winds its way through a rags to riches to rags story better than any movie I have seen. It is a dream becoming a nightmare.<br/><br/>In some ways Casino is better than Goodfellas and in others it is similar. This similarity could be seen as a drawback but for me Casino is the sequel to Goodfellas. Both are based on true stories about the mob written by Nicholas Pileggi and are an achievement that can only be compared in quality to The Godfather 1 and 2.  <br/><br/>The magnificent opening of Casino shows Martin Scorsese using a more grand style. The wide open vistas of the desert are contrasted with the neon world of the gambler and the old neighborhood of the mob bosses. Robert De Niro is very effective in being the ""rational"" one who pleads that if everybody just follows the ""rules"" they would all be winners. His irrational equal (including in acting ability) is Sharon Stone who will not be tamed and helps to bring the whole house of cards down. In the Godfather films and in Goodfellas there are winners as well as losers. Casino is about losing it all.<br/><br/>I felt Pesci's limitations were shown in the ""romantic"" scenes between him and Stone. Still, I can't think of anyone else who can do a better job playing a ruthless thug. And this drawback was more than made up by the excellent James Woods as the slimy boyfriend. Great stuff.<br/><br/>
Casino juggles success, corruption, vicious violence and farce in a broad sweep that never fails to impress. It's tale of destruction in some ways leads to sympathy. For these characters are like children who can never learn. They can never see the cause of their downfall, themselves."

","Taken alone, this was an excellent movie, very watchable, if a bit long. However, a lot of this movie obviously plays very close to what some of the people involved in it have played before.  De Niro's character is eerily similar to Al Pacino's in ""The Godfather II"", and Joe Pesci could easily be playing himself in ""Goodfellas"".  This is another solid effort from Scorcese and crew, but it lacks originality.<br/><br/>There were some interesting points.  Sharon Stone was excellent, but once again, she seems to remind me of Talia Shire's Connie in ""The Godfather"". The same could be said of James Woods, who plays a Fredo-like scumbag (maybe Fredo wasn't that bad, but still....).  To top it all off, we've got De Niro AND Pesci doing Ray Liotta's over-voice shtick from ""Goodfellas"".<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this movie, but I'd also recommend you see the other movies I've mentioned here first.  The acting here is good, the plot isn't lacking, the only negative side is that it does get a little violent. All the same, if you're familiar with Scorcese's work, at times you feel like this movie is basically Henry Hill narrating the Corleone family history.  It's hard to see this group be so good without quite reaching the greatness they've achieved in the past."

I thought it was absolutely brilliant with some funny scenes and some great acting.<br/><br/>  The movie talks about, as it says in the title, a casino.  But it's not just a casino.

Plus he never bets unless he is sure to win.  But in Las Vegas, running a casino requires help.  So his bosses in Kansas City send down one f his best friends, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), to watch his back.  As usual, Pesci plays a rather crazy character who seems to be particularly fond of being a gangster. <br/><br/>  In Vegas, Ace marries Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and complicates his life by doing so.  Sharon Stone is incredibly brilliant in her Oscar-nominated role as the woman who begins the whole catastrophe and is as beautiful as ever.  However, things between Ace, Ginger and Nicky spice up and lead to disasters and multiple murders.<br/><br/>  ""Casino"" is one of the best Scorsese-De Niro movies.

Goodfellas, however, really impressed me, and Casino, following in the same tradition as Goodfellas, scores big time as well. Like Goodfellas, it knows how to tell an intriguing story, makes its characters complex, and does not establish any heroes within its cast. The actors work remarkably well as an ensemble, not letting either of the three be the star, and displaying reality and charisma to their roles without becoming campy.<br/><br/>Casino works in the same way as The Godfather did, telling a fascinating tale of the mob, murder, corruption, and power. It does not give us anything that we don't want, having spectacular camerawork in the traditional Scorsese fashion, but not removing anything from the actual story. Going against what some have stipulated, De Niro and Pesci do not reprise their parts from Goodfellas; these characters have their own meat and style to them. Casino reminded me of the reason why I love movies; hopefully Scorsese will continue in the same tradition as this in the future, and not jerk me around like he sometimes does.

The movie is certainly a drama, but there are also many comic components. I like the continuing interplay across several movies between Pesci and Frank Vincent. In Raging Bull, Pesci attacks Vincent. In Goodfellas, Pesci kills Vincent and buries him. In Casino, at the end, Vincent kills Pesci with a baseball bat and then ""ships"" and buries him.

DeNiro plays a well-meaning odds-maker who is placed in charge of a casino, while Pesci acts in a perfect role as DeNiro's protective but jealous keeper.  Sharon Stone turns in the role of a lifetime as the mentally-instable, paranoid, and jealous (ex-hooker) wife of Stone (DeNiro's character).  The movie comes to a head in a frenetic battle between DeNiro and Stone, and the results are delicious.  This movie, along with ""The Godfather"" and ""Casino"" must surely rank as the top three gangster movies of all time.  Which one is first depends on one's own tastes.

"JuguAbraham","8","1","1","17 December 2001"," Scorsese's America
","There are different levels to appreciate this work of Scorsese. Pileggi and Scorsese could be presenting an accurate social and political study on the manner in which casinos are run in USA. But it is also a study of how money buys power and success, and corrodes one's humility. It is written in the manner Greek tragedies were written showing the climb to power and the inevitable downfall of the powerful following the state of hubris (here the firing of an incompetent employee with the right connection}. Compare Ace (de Niro's character), thoughtful about mundane details such as alerting a stranger about a good pen that he could well lose at the bar and who winces at Nick's subsequent violent actions, to the later Ace, who is insensitive to violent actions he himself orchestrates. Compare Nick (Pesci), who seeks permission from Ace to live in Las Vegas, to the later Nick, who drunk with power refuses to acknowledge he once asked Ace's permission. In many ways 'Casino' is a director/screenplay writers film than an actors' film. Performances, though commendable, take a back seat. Is it a mere gangster film or is the film using the gangster and hustler backdrop to offer the audience another perspective of America beyond the obvious? The social commentary here is somewhat like Altman's films ""Nashville"" or ""A Wedding"".<br/><br/>The religious Christian motifs of redemption underlie much of Scorcese's work, unconsciously or consciously, and Casino offers a viewer several perspectives, if you choose to assess his films in that perspective. (Scorsese is an admirer of Terrence Mallick, whose film ""The thin red line"", which incidentally also was pregnant with religious motifs--e.g., tattoos of Biblical references).<br/><br/>One can also appreciate Casino as an example of good movie craftmanship. Take the sequence of Sharon Stone's introduction in the film, where she is obviously aware that Ace is staring at her. It is so well done that one notices Sharon Stone visage and actions, while the editing and direction are really top notch as well, which contribute to make the sequence superb. Sharon Stone gives a riveting performance, as do De Niro and Pesci. Kudos to Scorsese on the appropriate 70s music at various stages in the film's progress. <br/><br/>While I appreciate Scorcese's choice of Ace's voice over commentary, I was surprised at Nick's commentary intertwining the voice-over of Ace. This method does makes sense if both are alive at the end of the film; not otherwise."

The police tried to stop it, but it was their money which was bringing the city to life. De Niro is great, as usual, Pesci is a show-stealer, and Stone, a novelty in Scorsese's work (as Ray Liotta was in ""Godfellas""), has a much-earned oscar nomination in the role of an empty woman whose path leads to decay. Scorsese's direction is fantastic (I recommend this as an introduction to his work), flamboyant and lusty as it has always been, and this is to me one of his best works. See it and marvel at it."

He's basically the same in every single film he's ever been in, apart from a couple where he's been slightly more angry than normal. More importantly though how has it taken me all this time to realise this? He's like the most boring actor ever. You only need to see one De Niro film and you've basically seen them all. I've still got the film playing, but it's basically background noise. When I've finished on facebook I'm turning it off and going to bed. This film has done nothing but made me angry. <br/><br/>2.5/10"

When I watched part of this movie on cable I finally turned the sound all the way down and watched the ending then I canceled the station.

"Boba_Fett1138","7","4","9","4 February 2006"," Moments of greatness but overall a flawed gangster epic that is still great to watch though.
","""Casino"" is by no means a bad movie but it rather is a flawed one, which is mainly due to the story and its characters. The first two-thirds of the movie is certainly great but after that the movie takes some negative turns and it loses some of its credibility and I lost some of my interested.<br/><br/>No question in my mind that Martin Scorsese is a great director but he however does push it at times with this movie. People compare this movie to ""Goodfellas"" for a good reason. Just like ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Bringing Out the Dead"" were similar in many ways to ""Taxi Driver"", ""Casino"" is on many ways similar to ""Goodfellas"". It's a tough gangster epic with lots of graphic violence, lot's of cursing and backstabbing characters. The main storyline is especially parallel to ""Goodfellas"". Yes, you can truly describe this movie as ""Goodfellas"" set in a Las Vegas casino in the '80's. Unfortunately the casino world is not as interesting to follow as the gangster world as portrayed in ""Goodfellas"", at least that's my opinion of it. The movie is too often about 'nothing' really. Style over substance you may say.<br/><br/>But also when you judge the movie on its own good you have to come to the conclusion that there are flaws in it. Sharon Stone is great in this movie but her character is distracting from the movie at times, especially towards the ending when almost the entire movie evolves around her character. It gets tiresome at times after a while and the movie loses some of its credibility because of that. There also are way too many characters introduced in the movie, which makes it hard to follow at times. I also never really got in to the character, not even the main characters. I couldn't really care for any of them and it was hard to understand and follow them at time. The movie is also too violent and graphic, even for my taste. It's a bit too much and some scene's are unbearable. Scorsese really pushed it there and should had hold back a little.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with the style of the movie. It's fast paced and wonderfully looking, also mainly thanks to the director of photography Robert Richardson but also of course to Martin Scorsese's stylish and unique way of directing and storytelling. Yes, there are some memorable sequences present in this movie, which certainly helps to make this movie a better one than most of the others in the same genre.<br/><br/>Also of course the presence of some well known good actors make this movie a good one to watch. Robert De Niro is never disappointing in the main lead and Joe Pesci yet again plays a typically hot tempered Joe Pesci role in which he always is just great to watch. The movie unfortunately under-uses James Woods. They could had done some more and better things with that wonderful actor.<br/><br/>Great to watch for the fans of the gangster genre. Overall a good, yet flawed gangster-epic that is certainly worth watching but not worthy of the high rating.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","From Nicholas Pileggi's factual book about a mobster's immorality and downfall in Las Vegas, NV from 1973 to 1983. Despite sweeping cinematography and palpable evil at nearly every plot-turn, ""Casino"" seems a ""Goodfellas"" retread. Robert De Niro is predictably good in the lead, but Joe Pesci, as De Niro's surly back-up, does nothing new and Sharon Stone, as De Niro's wife, is just the 'token woman', trying to build a character without much genuine material to work with (she's satisfactory). Director Martin Scorsese seems more interested in his characters' actions than their motivations, causing some confusion in the story and leaving many questions unanswered by the end. The film is fast-paced and entertaining, but it doesn't leave a heady imprint behind, and some of the violence verges on self-parody. **1/2 from ****"
"Arconada","6","3","6","27 August 2017"," Looking back
","I saw this movie 20 years after its initial release. Yes, I know, that is late. But it gave me the opportunity to look at it from a perspective where movie styles have changed. Did it stand the test of time? It is safe to say that this movie more or less concluded the typical mafia movie era, movies with overactive swearing gangster-types, Italian lingo, violence, extortion, addiction. I must say, watching this film gave me the feeling that I had seen it all before. This is a template movie, a template for the style, a template for the characters, a template for the violence, templates for practically everything. As a result everybody is behaving one-dimensional, behaving as expected, no character development. Joe Pesci is really a caricature of himself, Robert De Niro is flat. Sharon Stone her part is at times interesting to watch. All in all, this movie gets 6 out of 10 from me, mainly because the pace is okay."

","The characters in Casino are greedy and seedy crooks with hardly any good in them whatsoever. But with that said, the story (which is almost 3 darn hours long) moves in such a brilliant pace that you can put up with them. As expected, the acting by Pesci, De Niro, Stone, & Woods is great, but unbelievably every minor character in the film is also on the ball. But, alas, this is a Scorcese film, and as usual it is done to perfection. The camera angles and the cinematography of old Vegas is awesome. This film captures a piece of American history albeit a grimy part of it. I am not a huge fan of mob films nor am I all that interested in Las Vegas, but I was drawn into this story. Rating 9 of 10 stars."
"bobwal2-1","3","6","16","10 February 2007"," Great Cure For Insomnia
","To me, a shocking misfire from great director Martin Scorsese. This movie could have been great, but it was really miscast. Robert De Niro is a great actor, but he was wrong for this movie. For one, he doesn't even bear a slight resemblance to the real Ace Rothstein. He is just sleepwalking through the entire movie, and his cigarettes seem to be more animated than he is. Sharon Stone is good in her role, but she is just so unlikable that you don't feel any sympathy for her. Same for Joe Pesci. He has none of the humor that he brought to his role in ""Goodfellas"", where he played another mob psycho.<br/><br/>That is why I hate this movie, because all three lead actors are so unlikable that you don't care what happens to any of them. Only the supporting cast, led by Don Rickles and Alan King breathe any life into this movie. James Woods is great in his limited role as well. Funny how you sympathize more with his scumbag role than you do with the other three. Woods could have been the lead in this movie. It just goes on FOREVER, and there are long stretches where you feel like nothing happens. A great cure for insomnia.<br/><br/>This was the last Scorsese/De Niro film, but hopefully not the last. Scorsese seems to have gotten his balls back with ""The Departed"", and it would be great if someone would write a good script for these two."
"ShFo10","3","9","28","20 August 2001"," A waste
","I think it has been said plenty of times before, we've all seen this film before.  It was called ""Goodfellas"" and it was better.  Actually,  saw this film before ""Goodfellas"" and I still hated it.  Three hours long!<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT The beginning, by all means, keeps you interested with all the work of the process of cisinos.  Looks like like a very rewarding business.  The voice overs of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are also well written eventhough we've been through this with Ray Liotta.  The direction starts out considerable. I thought the work was particularly good when De Niro is insulted with the subject of a penn and Pesci steps up by repeatedly stabbing the man out of line in the throat with his own penn.<br/><br/>Later, we get to meet Sharon Stone's character.  A prostitute who works for James Woods.  When De Niro lays his eyes on her making trouble for a mistake made at a crabbs table, he instantly sees something in her.  He convinces her to marry him and give up her job for the pimp.  He gives her a gift of millions of dollars worth in jewels.  What De Niro is not aware of, but becomes suspicious of, is that she is still secretely with the pimp with meetings and phone calls.  When they are caught at a restaurant, she msut plead for his life.<br/><br/>
Peci makes trouble in Vegas.  In one scene, he plays blackjack and throws vulgar remarks at the dealer while he throws the cards he recieves out.  In one scene they find a thief on the inside and spend days torturing him with with woodshop supplies untill they get names.  Eventually, Pesci works his way up to being band from Vegas completely.  The FBI eventually gets on to all of them.<br/><br/>
Sharon continues to be the perfect little wife, snorting coc and drinking away.  They have a daughter together who gets the luxuries of witnessing all of this right before her.  Eventually, she breaks out to find Woods, bringing their daughter with her.  While they're there, they make cash and get a good share of coc.  Eventually, De Niro tracks them to get their daughter back.  Saron, high and more out of it then ever sleams back when she breaks away from Woods.  While running an eran, she did the thoughtful thing of simply tighing their daughter up on her bed and leaving.  Sharon continually threatens to leave and the yerns for the jewels so that she can get money and dump De Niro.<br/><br/>
Rivalry starts up with De Niro and Pesci.  Pesci starts getting jobs on his own, still dodging the Feds who have gone as far as hring lip readers. Eventualy, Sharon finds her way into Pesci's arms and they have a short go for something.  Eventually, however, Sharon just schemes to get off cash and Pesci kicks the whore out.<br/><br/>
This film is based on a true story, yet seeses to be realistic.  There's a scene when a man at a blackjack table is caught counting cards.  He is brought out into a back room and they breack his hand with a hammar.  One very cardinal rule in any organization with publicity.  Always appeal.  To take a mafia tactic like that on an ordinary civilian, would be desastorous for business.  People would be disgusted.  Thaty doesn't seem to bother the story, however.  Even though it should.<br/><br/>
Pesci's sharacter couldn't be more exactly like his character Tommy from ""Goodfellas"".  Still cold blooded.  Still aggressive and unreasonable.  The most noble character in the film is De Niro.  I can't even get into how annoying Sharon Stone got, whether it was sincere or a good performance, it just got old, stupid, and aggravating.  Ya want De Niro to just simply draw his gun and blow her to bits, but he won't because after all thiss ""I love her.""  This after she bardged into his house to get the key to the bank where she can collect her wealth.<br/><br/>
Yes, the film is violent and gorey.  They should have spent much more time on that then all the other crap that is boring and annoying, not gripping. I'm glad to see that it didn't go on to any real success.  An osar nomination for Sharon and four stars from Roger Ebert who is simply in love with Scorsese.  That's all except for, I believe, a script nomination which I certainly don't appove of, other good review that may have come up, and, of course, the movie goers.  It's a shame so many of them likd this film. Plenty of other good or great mafia films out there.  ""Goodfellas"", ""Bugsy"", all three of ""The Godfathers"", and probably much more.  This is certainly a waste of time and it seems like a considerable deal of effort went into it. Too bad."

","All the talent is there. But aside from Stone, we've seen it all before (and usually better). I guess if it were about an hour shorter and the dialog didn't suffer from banality and the pacing weren't so slack, it might be just about OK, but nothing great. Ridiculously gory (think The Wild Bunch, but without the style). Obviously some loved this film, though I've never met anyone in person who did. The few I know who have seen it basically thought it was a waste of time, a disgusting waste at that."

","The rise (and fall) of casino boss Ace Rothstein in 1970's Las Vegas.  The film charts Ace's struggle in love with money hungry Ginger McKenna and his struggles to control his business with the violent influence of partner and friend Nicky Santoro.<br/><br/>This is very much a rerun of Goodfellas - the running time, the heavy style of Scorsese, the cast, the soundtrack, the violence.  However here the story is so thin that it is really stretched to breaking point.  The first half is mainly just action, heavily stylised scenes with De Niro's voice over giving it a vague direction.  The plot kicks in in the second half with Rothstein's empire crumbling in parallel with his relationship with Ginger.  The action is pretty good, but the lack of narrative is a big problem.<br/><br/>In Goodfellas, Scorsese's tricks seemed to be the icing on a very, very good cake.  Here they seem to be a end onto themselves.  Similarly Pesci's performance is very much a turned up version of his Tommy.  Scorsese's tricks, tracking shots and soundtrack all seem to be wasted here - as if he was looking for an excuse to do his visual stuff without needing a strong story.<br/><br/>Overall this is an unfortunate version of Goodfellas.  Visually it is great but without a strong story it feels very empty and shallow - After Raging Bull and Goodfellas I didn't think Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci could do a bad movie.  Unfortunately here it is."

","I don't consider Casino Scorsese's very best film(Goodfellas is my personal favourite), but it is a fantastic film and definitely one to see. It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.<br/><br/>Casino is brilliantly made too. I loved the setting, the cinematography and editing are outstanding and never take away from the atmosphere, and Martin Scorsese's direction is superb. The realism the film has is always absorbing, the subplots that form the story are intriguing and the characters are adeptly drawn.<br/><br/>The story for me has seldom a dull moment, not with the subplots as intriguing as they are, how well made it is, how good the characters and acting are. The characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with Goodfellas, making it perhaps a more even portrayal of unorganised crime, but the decision to do that paid off. The acting is equally impressive. Robert DeNiro the great actor he is is incredibly charismatic, Joe Pesci gives his best performance in one of his more meatier roles and Sharon Stone(who has never been this good or even sexy before) is a revelation in a very demanding role.<br/><br/>Overall, hugely compelling and underrated. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","You really have to be an unbridled fan of mobster movies to like this. I will admit I only watched the first 40 minutes because it was so bad. I decided to give it a shot because of all the glowing reviews here at IMDb. Big mistake. The people that wrote those reviews are probably the same sort of people who dress up in Jedi costumes and wait for days in front of theaters for the next opening. I admit I am not a fan of the genre, having watched 20 minutes of one of the Godfathers and less than that of The Sopranos. The characters are cardboard, overly romanticized, embarrassingly conforming to what someone thinks the stereotype is, and the dialogue is pitiful. Scorcese ought to try making a real movie instead of recycling this gangster swill. Mean Streets is the only thing of his I've sat through because it was gritty and real. Everything since - hogwash. You would be better off watching the old gangster movies with Bogart or Cagney or Edward G. Robinson. They were far more believable and at least you and they knew they were acting. Better plots and dialogue too."

This movie sucked, plain and simple.<br/><br/>I challenge anyone to find a De Niro role in which you can see him as anything but a hood, gangster, Italian or all three.

It has a great beginning, an interesting ending, but much of the middle is worthless. Out of 3 hours of movie, maybe 1 is watchable.<br/><br/>It can be compared to a practical joke that involves a piece of paper that says, ""How do you keep an idiot busy, turn over."" And on the other side it says ""How do you keep an idiot busy, turn over."" In terms of entertainment and development, it would as effective to make a 20 minute movie, and repeat that exact same 20 minute movie over and over again until near the end of the movie.

It's all about how terrible Italian gangsters are, but somehow they retain a chivalric nobility that makes them fundamentally noble.<br/><br/>Joe Pesce delivers his one-note role, the only thing he has ever played.

In another (better, shorter) Scorsese movie, ""Goodfellas,"" he would have been pretty good if he had been 30 years younger. But it was like watching my mother play Scarlett O'Hara.<br/><br/>Every single scene is an argument. That gets tedious after a while. Alan King and Don Rickles are miscast in dramatic roles. This was made when Robert DiNiro was already always playing a clichéd version of himself. Sharon Stone tries hard, but her role is not well written. Is she good? Is she evil?

I say that because honestly, there just aren't many films that are this well done, it's pretty rare to find a gem like this one. Now, some may not care for it simply because it's just not their cup of tea, but nonetheless it's still a great film. The writing is really perfect for the kind of film it is. A record of the most F bombs ever spoken in a film was set by Casino, before Wolf of Wall Street came along that is. I would probably say the 400+ F bombs used was overkill if it would have been a different kind of film, but it fit perfectly for this kind. The writing definitely fits the characters. The characters are wonderfully deep too, we learn so much about them and we get to see them played by such great actors. Pesci, De Niro, and Stone all turn in marvelous performances, especially Stone (this was her Academy Award nomination). The story is very interesting and you won't be bothered by the somewhat long runtime because of the good pacing and the level of interest. There is just so much happening with these interesting, very damaged characters that you won't wanna turn away, I sure didn't.

","Casino (1995) is , in my opinion , the best film of that year if not one of the best of the decade. Martin Scorsese's fascinating film ""Casino"" knows a lot about the Mafia's relationship with Las Vegas. It's based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi, who had full access to a man who once ran four casinos for the mob, and whose true story inspires the movie's plot. As IMDb rightly puts it it is a film of greed , money , power and most importantly deception. In terms of acting De Niro steals the show as 'Sam Rothstein' as well as Sharon Stone who also portrays a very convincing performance. I believe the explanation of how 'Rothstein' runs the Casino are the most intriguing scene's of the whole film (as in how it is shot and acted) with De Niro giving us an 'in absolute character' performance. My only dislike for the film is what most people have recognised when watching it and that is it's similarity to 'Goodfellas' ( characters and narrative) and the fact that Joe Pesci plays the same little angry Italian everytime but this pales in comparison to the positives. Ultimately , having of finally watched this film after years of wanting to i regard it as one of the best of that decade and recommend it highly."

","Casino (1995) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's epic look at Mafia crime in Las Vegas has Robert DeNiro playing 'Ace' Rothstein, a man placed in the sin city to run things but his love for a former prostitute (Sharon Stone) and the Mafia henchman (Joe Pesci) brought out to keep things running smoothly might have the entire operation fall apart.<br/><br/>Technically speaking this here is without question one of the greatest looking movies that you're ever going to see. How Scorsese told the story of the Mafia's involvement in Las Vegas makes for one of the most visually striking movies that you're ever going to see. I say that because the editing, the music selections and the cinematography really comes to life like very few films and it makes it possible for the director to tell this rather violent story unlike anything else he's ever done.<br/><br/>I will say that I don't think this is his greatest movie as I think there are several others that are better but that just speaks to how wonderful Scorsese was that he could make so many terrific movies. As I said, the visual style here is rather amazing and there's a lot of narration used, which had to be done because so much is covered here that without the narration you'd be looking at a six or seven hour movie. The narration is something that at one time bothered me but today it's just an added greatness because of how it basically reads you a story and keeps you up to date on everything that was going on.<br/><br/>The performances are another major plus as the director gets some of his strongest performers here. The laid back DeNiro that we get to see here is something the actor really nails. I loved the way DeNiro's rage is all the more powerful when it happens because he just slowly builds this anger towards the wife. Pesci is as powerful as ever. Some of complained that this is basically the same role he played in GOODFELLAS but who cares? Stone also delivers the strongest performance of her career as the deadbeat junkie who by the end of the film you will hate with a passion. We also get great support from Frank Vincent, Don Rickles, James Woods, Kevin Pollack and Alan King.<br/><br/>Clocking in just a couple minutes short of three hours, the film manages to pack quite a punch. As story-telling goes the director does a marvelous job at taking a look at Vegas from countless view points. He perfectly covers the main characters but we also get to see it from crooked politicians, the ""guys back home"" and of course even the FBI. CASINO has all sorts of great scenes and it's just amazing watching how Scorsese puts everything together and turns it into something magical."

","Many have said that this was Goodfellas on a grander scale, and in many ways they're correct, but this isn't detrimental to the movie. The story is a fascinating look at how one of the most iconic cities came to be and how the influence and money of the Mafia built the world famous Las Vegas strip, how the Mafia's empire in Vegas came to be and in the end how (and in some cases literally) it came crashing down. The use of narration is well done and the acting is simply brilliant, Robert De Niro is in top form as the flamboyant bookmaker turned casino manager Sam 'Ace' Rothstein whose tyrannical no nonsense management style would contribute to his downfall. Joe Pesci picks up from where he left off in Goodfellas playing psychotic enforcer Nicky Santorio brilliantly whose violent temper ends up bringing trouble to just about everyone he comes into contact with. L.Q. Jones turns in an underrated performance as the deceptive commissioner Pat Webb, whose easy going good ole boy exterior disguises his real power and influence. Likewise James Woods portrayal of the sleazy pimp Lester Diamond while brief was well done. Onto Frank Vincent and I couldn't help but think he got some satisfaction over getting his own back on Joe Pesci when near the end he does to him what Pesci did to his character in Goodfellas, I think its safe to say he enjoyed that. But the star of the show is Sharon Stone who turns in an outstanding performance as the prostitute turned hustler Ginger McKenna whose devotion to her former pimp boyfriend, her drinking and drug addictions and her reckless behaviour would end up leading to her ultimate demise, Stone put herself through the grinder for the movie, losing so much weight the production team were actually worried about her, changing her hair styles and the emotional outbursts which were done brilliantly, and Stone's performance as a result was Oscar worthy. The portrayal of the mob bosses was also very well done, particularly Pasquale Cajano as Remo Gaggi, who gave a convincing performance as a ruthless mob boss. The rest of the supporting cast were all solid, Kevin Pollak, Alan King, Don Rickles and Billy Allison all turned in fine performances. The movie has got some criticism for its level of violence and profanity but this is the world of organised crime which wasn't exactly known for its eloquence and for its gentleness when it came to 'taking care' of things, so a subtler approach wouldn't have been an accurate depiction of the people and the events the movie is based on. So for those fans of gangster movies and even for history lovers like me this movie is a must see."
"StoryCharts","5","2","4","19 July 2013"," Greed foils crime
","Casino is tough to analyze with Story Charts. The casino racket plot (along with all the other subplots) all start at their highs and tumble down to failures. The only Controlling Idea I can think of is that crime will always fail because of greed. The Story Chart for Casino is not very interesting, basically everything crumbles because of the characters are up to no good.<br/><br/>My main beef with the movie is two fold.<br/><br/>One is specific about this movie: why make a movie about crime that fails when no one in the movie does any good at all and there is no moral center to the film? Since everyone is up to no good, the only rational way to keep our attention is to up the ante on how bad the characters become and how cool they when they are being bad.So a film whose central idea is about the inevitable downfall of crime betrays its central idea by making the characters ""cool"" and full of ""attitude"" and glorifying them. Seriously why do we need a movie like this? It seems to just perpetuate all the negative stereotypes about movies glorifying violence and bad characters.<br/><br/>My second beef is in general about Martin Scorsese. I feel films like Casino and many of his other works are mostly show-and-tells rather than true storytelling by characters, conflict and consequence. This shows through most obviously through the abundant voice overs that tell us how ""cool"" the characters are and tells us the changes that are happening as opposed to showing us through action and consequence. I think voice overs are the nemesis of absorbing movie making and Casino spends about half its time with its characters voicing over stuff that happens on screen: its like a holiday slide-show from ""cool"" gangsters.<br/><br/>I think Casino tries to objectively document a period of Vegas excess driven by a few characters and their criminal ways. It's voice overs certainly make it documentary-like. But its glorification of how cool these guys subjectively tells us to sympathize with these criminals on their inevitable demise.<br/><br/>I don't get it, why make a movie that suggests crime doesn't pay but suggest it's cool to be a criminal? How does this make the world a better place? If it doesn't, why make movies at all?<br/><br/>My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca"
"jcbutthead86","10","2","4","9 May 2013"," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made And One Of The Greatest Gangster Films Ever Made. Another Scorsese Classic.
","Martin Scorsese's Casino is one of the greatest films ever made and one of the greatest Gangster films ever made that's filled with brilliant direction,excellent acting and a great Rock N' Roll soundtrack making this film another Scorsese classic,one of his best films and one of my all time favorite films.<br/><br/>Set in Las Vegas in the 1970s and 1980s and based on a true story,Casino tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein(Robert De Niro),an expert gambler connected to Gangsters and because of his success he is asked by the Mob to run the Tangiers,one of the biggest Casinos in Las Vegas and help steal money for the Mob. While in Vegas he marries hooker and hustler Ginger(Sharon Stone)and receives help from friend and gangster Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci). But as time goes on Ace,Ginger and Nicky discovers that their successes will lead to violence,death and betrayal and know that no one stay's on top forever.<br/><br/>Released in 1995,Casino surprising received a mixed reception among critics and one of the criticisms of Casino is that the film was too similar to Scorsese's earlier Gangster film Goodfellas. But,thanks to showings on Cable TV,Home Video and DVD sales Casino has now been regarded as as a classic and one of Scorsese's best films and it's rightfully deserved. If Goodfellas was about the rise and fall of a New York Gangster then Casino is about the rise and fall of a empire. With Casino,Scorsese gives viewers a big and violent epic gangster film and shows viewers a different side of Las Vegas that most people probably already knew about but not many have seen where the city of LV is being secretly controlled by the Mob and where money and violence rule the glitz and glamor of Las Vegas. Casino is in many ways a tragic film where the characters in the film have success and money but there are many things that happen in the film mess up their own empire and value because when you listen to most of the narration in the film you feel like the characters are looking back at their past with regret and wishing they would have done something different. The rise and fall in this film is almost like a Shakespere play. One of the things that I always loved about Casino is the cinematography because Scorsese and cinematographer Robert Richardson gives the film a beautiful and stylish look where the colors of the suits and production design just come off the screen and hit you in the eye. Scorsese cleverly tricks viewers with the beauty of the film and almost makes viewers forget about the violence and death that is in the air. The photography is one of the things that is different from Goodfellas because where Goodfellas seem more gritty and dirty,Casino is almost like Goodfellas glamorous and flamboyant little brother in comparison. The three main characters Ace,Ginger and Nicky,like in most of Scorsese films aren't always the most likable but have levels of depth and dimension that each characters shows throughout the film when things are happening around them whether it's buy their own doing with Aces' pride and ego,Ginger's troubled past and present,Nicky's violence or by someone else. You don't always like the main characters,but you don't hate them either. Although Casino is nearly three hours long the film moves at a quick pace and there isn't a wasted scene in the film. It's one of fastest near three hours you will ever watch. The violence in the film is bloody and deadly and Scorsese does not compromise or tone it down one bit showing what it's like when you're in the crime world. The violence in the film is so disgusting that you will never want to gamble or go to Las Vegas. Casino did for gambling and going to Las Vegas what Jaws did for swimming in the water. The ending of the film is great because it is a combination of violence,brutality and sadness which pretty much hangs over the course of the film and it is a classic Scorsese ending.<br/><br/>The whole cast does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein,with De Niro bringing depth and intensity to the performance. Sharon Stone earned an Oscar nod for her powerful,sexy and fiery performance as Ginger,a hooker Ace falls for. Stone has great scenes with both De Niro and Pesci. Joe Pesci is brilliant,funny and volatile as Nicky Santoro,with Pesci stealing every scene he's in. James Woods is great in his role as Ginger's pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Frank Marino,Nicky's right hand man. Pasguale Cajano is fantastic as Remi Gaggi,a top Mob boss. Alan King is great and memorable as Andy Stone,a head of the Teamsters. Kevin Pollock is Wonderful and smooth as Phillip Green. Don Rickles(Billy Sherbert),L.Q Jonesz(Pat Webb),John Bloom(Don Ward),Dick Smothers(Senator),Vinny Vella(Artie Piscano)and Phillip Suriano(Dominick Santoro)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Martin Scorsese is brilliant and masterful,with Scorsese giving a big,epic feel to the film with powerful atmosphere and is always moving the camera and using great angles. Great direction by Scorsese.<br/><br/>The film has an amazing soundtrack with songs by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Can you Hear Me Knocking,Heart Of Stone,(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,Sweet Virginia.),Devo(Whip It,(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction(Devo cover),The Moody Blues(Nights In White Satin),The Animals(House Of The Rising Sun),Fleetwood Mac(You Can Go Your Own Way),Rod Stewart(I Ain't Superstitious),B.B King(The Thrill Is Gone),Brenda Lee(I'M Sorry),Little Richard(Slippin' and Slidin'),Cream(Toad,Those Were The Days),Dean Martin(You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You) and more great songs. A great soundtrack.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas,Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci or Sharon Stone,I highly suggest you see Casino an unforgettable and powerful Gangster and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","OK, I get it, some people just don't like Scorseses style as much as I do, but why the hell is ""Goodfellas"" rated so high then? Not that Goodfellas doesn't deserve that rating, but Casino should be rated way higher. I mean, how can it not? This movie has pretty much everything. Or maybe this is the problem, maybe there is too much going on, so the average viewer is simply too stupid to understand it all. This is Scorseses best work, forget ""The Departed"" and forget ""Goodfellas"" and forget ""Raging Bull"".<br/><br/>This movie is on my TOP 10 and I argue that everyone should see it, so they can LEARN what a good movie is."
"deatman9","9","2","4","28 June 2011"," Scorsese you have done it again..
","Is it me or is it impossible for Scorsese to make anything but a great movie. This movie is no exception made by Martin and followed by his usual cast of gangsters Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro.<br/><br/>This movie follows Deniros character as he tries to leave his life as a mobster, go to vegas and open a casion to try to go straight.He finds out however that old ties to oraganized crime and old relationships will come back to haunt him. His Character meets a women (Sharon Stone) they fall in love and have a kid. As the movie progresses he finds out his wife was not who he thought she was. With a wife who doesn't care for him (Stone) and a old friend(Pesci) making his new life very difficult he has to find a way to to put his old life behind him and make a good life for his daughter.<br/><br/>This is another masterpiece by Scorsese, mind you it may not be as good as goodfellas it is still a very well made movie with a solid script and fantastic performances from all the actors involved. If you like Scorsese, Deniro or mafia movie this is a must see for you."
"playerazzi","5","2","4","13 March 2011"," All Talk, and a Few Bombs and Blows
","Ah, I was so looking forward to this one. It had all of the stars: De Niro, Pesci, Sharon Stone. Heck, it even had Don Rickles and Dick Smothers in dramatic roles (!) Not to mention Alan King (remember him?).<br/><br/>So, it was with anticipation that I got this one, and started to watch. It started out with a healthy dose of narration, reminding me of Goodfellas. But this time it was DeNiro doing most of the talking.<br/><br/>But then he didn't stop.<br/><br/>This is a three-hour movie, and about an hour of it, if not more (I didn't count the minutes) is Abe Rothstein (DeNiro), or sometimes Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), narrating the background. I mean, Ray Liotta did a good job in Goodfellas, but this is overboard, guys. Enough gabbing, and let's see the characters do what they do best, and let the story fold out through the scenes.<br/><br/>So, the story is about two gangsters, Abe Rothstein and Nicky Santoro, who are small-time bookies some place ""back home"" - in some non-descript town anywhere between Dallas and Cleveland, where gambling is definitely a no-no. The ""bosses"" there send Rothstein out to Vegas to manage a casino that they bankroll. Except for the source of the funds, Rothstein is now involved in a legitimate operation. And that's where the first conflict arrives: he's not used to being a law-abiding fellow. But he gets it real quick, and in no time at all, has a babe for a wife (who had warned him that she's not the marrying type), Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone).<br/><br/>Then his buddy Nicky comes out to Vegas, and wants to help. But Nicky is the bouncer. The violent guy, and he wants to do it his way. So, he gums things up with his beatings, and threats, and stabbings. And these things are still illegal in Nevada, folks.<br/><br/>So, the rest of the movie is how these conflicts pan out: Abe Rothstein trying to be legit (and it's not only his own demons, but there are some shenanigans going on in official Nevada as well), trying to be married to a former call girl of a wife (who just can't keep her finger out of the white stuff, and still has the hots for her former pimp), and Abe trying to get along with Nicky, who just can't keep his hands - and switchblades - to himself.<br/><br/>Sounds like a cool gangster movie, and the potential is there, folks. In fact, I think not only the potential is there, but the scenes are there, too. The acting is fine (although DeNiro has done better jobs elsewhere), but the killer here is the editing. There were just too many scenes that could have been cut out, and the movie pared down to 2 hours or so. It just went on and on and on.<br/><br/>So, if you want to see these guys on the screen, by all means watch this movie. But beware of the high price you pay in time invested."
"puttputtk","10","2","4","10 January 2011"," Scorsese, Deniro, and Pesci score again.
","Casino (1995) Though Casino is not my favorite Martin Scorsese film, it is still one of his best films and of the best films ever made. Casino is intriguing, entertaining, and brutal.<br/><br/>Casino is a somewhat long film but very easy to watch. It stays interesting the entire time and never really slows. It's a bit different than your average gangster film, concentrating somewhat more on the characters themselves than their business.<br/><br/>To pick a favorite part of the film is kind of hard. Martin Scorsese's directing, and both Robert Deniro and Joe Peschi's roles are all fantastic. Scorsese does great with this film, and even though he has done many similar movies, this one is still fresh and new. Deniro seemingly plays the same role he usually does but it's a much deeper role than most, one of his best performances ever. Peschi on the other hand is definitely at his best, he is so intense he almost steals the film.<br/><br/>Casino is a brutal and intense look at organized crime and Las Vegas, sometimes even hard to watch due to the violence in some scenes. It is one of the greatest films ever. Although some people know it best as the film that uses the ""F"" word more than any other, it should definitely be remembered for directing, acting, writing, etc, more than anything else. It is truly a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The film will most likely be loved by anyone who watches it, as long as they don't have a short attention span. Any fan of Scorsese, DeNiro, Pesci, or Stone must watch this film. A modern classic that isn't going anywhere.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I just watched Casino again. I forgot how long it was. The reason I watched it again is because I remembered that I liked Robert De Niro's wardrobe. No, just his shirt and tie ensemble. Different colors but with his rugged complextion he carried them off beautifully. And he was dressed impeccably. Sharon Stone was also dressed to the nines. And their spacious and sprawling home was to die for. Joe Pesci looked like he had a face lift. I wonder? But I love seeing movies about American gangsters and especially about ""the mob"" and this one lived up to it's theme. So far none can reach The Godfather level but it's always nice to see some try. Those shirts and tie combination. Wow!"

The story of this movie is beautiful and is portrayed by DeNiro and Pesci at there best. It could not have been any better then it was. The first time I seen this movie I was amazed at how good they captures the world of Vegas and the underworld of Vegas. It is told through the eyes of great performers to give you the great reality of the movie and a great feel to the concept of staying at the top and what people would do to keep that throne. I see this as another masterpiece and a classic that should go down in history as one of the greatest cinematic achievements yet. I give this movie a 9 out of 10."

The movie folds around De Niro running a casino, and having marriage problems with Stone and Problems with a lot of things you can say with Pesci. Robert De Niro delivers yet another Brilliant Performance. Joe Pesci's character Nicky is similar to Goodfellas Tommy. Once again Pesci delivers a Superb performance as the violent Nicky. Sharon Stone looks sexy as ever and surprisingly delivers a Good performance. Casino Entertains Big time thanks to De Niro and Pesci working together. If you look at Pesci in Goodfellas and Pesci in Casino, which one is mightier. Both characters are Violent and a little crazy you can say. Pesci's Casino Character is slightly rougher then Tommy. Anyway Casino is a Must see, if you haven't seen it."

","Prior to viewing this film I was not a Scorcese fan. Casino was a masterpiece! He created three hours of pure entertainment. Robert De Niro as always superb along with Joe Pesci and James Woods et al. I'm saying the film belonged to Sharon Stone. She was more than convincing as the meretricious demimonde. Her character began as a shooting star and deteriorated to a burnt out derelict. She should have won the Oscar for this awesome portrayal. Direction was meticulous with each shot and scene saying something pertinent to the plot. I did not appreciate the F word used so many times. it tends to cheapen the film. What did we do for sixty years before the F word was used?? I'm fortunate in viewing the film on TV where the filth was dubbed over. I remember seeing a film called ""Glen Gary, Glen Ross"" I had to leave the theatre due to the senseless filth in the language. I mean really stupid, unnecessary profanity. Later I saw the film on TV sans the filth. It was a very good film. I have nothing but praise for Casino and all connected with it. Kudos to Martin Scorcese."

","I worked for a Mississippi casino at the time this film hit the big screen. Obviously, there are tremendous differences between Las Vegas casinos of the 1970s and Biloxi casinos of the 1990s--but even so I was stunned by the accuracy with which Scorsese's CASINO nailed the industry and the personalities that inhabit it. From the slick hair and pin stripe suits to the endless profanity to the count room to the surveillance room, CASINO is uncomfortably close to the truth.<br/><br/>Based on the life of 'Lefty' Rosenthal, CASINO offers the story of Las Vegas' last gasp of mob domination before the big corporations began to move in. Robert De Niro is ""Ace"" Rothstein, a mob-connected gambler who rises to control of one the biggest mob-owned casinos in town--and then sees his control slips away through his misplaced love for beautiful and brazen Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and his association with gangster Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci.) And when their various activities begin to draw heat on the mob bosses, can murder be far behind? The cast is really top notch. De Niro and Pesci offer memorable performances, as does a superior supporting cast that includes James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, and Melissa Prophet, to name but a few--but the real laurels go to Sharon Stone, who plays out the rise and fall of the glamorous Ginger with surprising skill. But even so, and in spite of its memorable cast, dialogue, plot, and production values, CASINO has a slightly awkward feel to it. Part of the problem is the film's inconsistent reliance on voice-over narration that shifts uneasily between De Niro and Pesci; part of the problem is the film's uneasy shifting between love story and gangster movie. And in the final analysis the film seems overlong.<br/><br/>For all its flaws, CASINO is an extremely watchable, very memorable movie that stands up very well on its own in spite of inevitable comparisons to GOODFELLAS. In passing, I note the DVD package has few extras, and most viewers will be as happy with the VHS version as with the DVD. But be it DVD or VHS, the film is strongly recommended.<br/><br/>Gary F.

"tfrizzell","Null","2","4","30 September 2000"," Overlooked, But Equally Impressive Scorsese Masterpiece
","""Casino"" is a dominant film which is based on the true story of how Las Vegas was transformed from a simple gambling mecca into a place that has as much personality and color as Disney World.  Robert De Niro stars as a casino owner who is on the ground-level of the city's change.  He is a high-class crook who's able to turn profits with the help of the mafia and crooked gaming practices (a norm for all casinos).  Joe Pesci is on hand as the mob assassin with the short fuse who is De Niro's right-hand man. However, no one stays on top forever and De Niro's demise is partly due to his ex-prostitute wife (Sharon Stone, in her Oscar-nominated role).  Bad decision-making, shady dealings, and questionable alliances will also be key factors in his ultimate downfall.  Once again Martin Scorsese has created a film that is so multi-layered and smart that the viewer is completely engrossed for the entire 182 minutes.  ""Casino"" is a crime epic, in close contrast with ""The Godfather"" series of films.  Scorsese accomplishes what he did with ""Raging Bull"" and ""GoodFellas"".  Once again De Niro and Pesci shine with Scorsese's direction and the unrelenting screenplay.  Sharon Stone does the best work of her career.  She does not necessarily shine brighter than De Niro and Pesci, but she holds her own and never lets either of them steal her thunder and lightning.  Another great thing about ""Casino"" is the supporting cast.  Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, James Woods, and Joe Bob Briggs (!?) all add great elements of both comedy and drama to this outstanding winner which has been overlooked on Scorsese's list of credits, but is just as potent as his other five-star films.  5 stars out of 5."

","A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese's Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the ""blue collar"" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come."

","This is Robert De Niro's shining moment. Casino is more than a character study of someone running a Las Vegas casino. Casino captures the rise and fall of mob-controlled Vegas. It captures how lack of control, and later, overcontrol led the mob to destroy their golden goose. Casino, in short, is the story of Las Vegas becoming what we know it as today. The based-on-a-true-story format works well here. The action is believable and the times-of-the-era feel is well done."

","One thing I must warn you before going into this picture is that it is not a gangster picture, it is about the life of a man called Frank Rosenthal (Sam Rothstein) who is basically the owner of the casino. This film explores the life of running a casino and Joe Pesci steals the show every scene he is in, even if De Niro is the better actor.<br/><br/>Let me just start off my review by saying that if you go into this movie EXPECTING a ""gangster"" movie, you will be terribly disappointed, this story isn't about the mob, it's about what it's like to be the manager if a casino whilst having a friend INVOLVED in the mob. Robert De Niro gives (possibly) the greatest performance of the 90's, his character is so deeply interesting and his money-abusive wife Ginger Mckenna who has been with a pimp played by James Woods ever since she was 15. She asks for money and overuses it, De Niro decides to make her the only one accessible to his bank account and life savings.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci's character, Nicky Santoro, is part of the mob, and he asks Sam Rothstein if he could come to Las Vegas, it isn't long before he gets in the papers, the news articles write that if Nicky is ever seen in a casino, he will be taken to court, ""Even if someone tripped over a ******* banana peel, they'd bring me in for it."" Eventually, they end up having an argument in the desert about Sam telling Andy Stone that Nicky was bringing a lot of heat on him, being visible in his casinos and being known for whacking people.<br/><br/>The end result is that one of Nicky's best friends, Frank, ends up killing his brother, burying Nicky alive with wounds in his face from the strength of the bat.

"filipemanuelneto","10","0","0","16 April 2020"," Although the comparisons are natural, it is far more brutal and cynical than ""Goodfellas"" and deserves to be appreciated for what it is.
","I did not know, when I went to see this film, that there was a true story behind it. But that was something that struck me because of the way the film presents the plot. It became evident that there was something and that was a bonus, a film that, in itself, is already capable of proving itself excellent. Despite all the comparisons with ""Goodfellas"", (I couldn't help doing them myself), I don't think Scorcese tried to repeat the dose, although it is undeniable that he likes to make this kind of films, involving mafia or organized crime (""The Irishman"", very recently, and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", for example, not to mention the obvious ""Goodfellas"").<br/><br/>The script shows how two Chicago mobsters manage to control and run a casino in Las Vegas until marital problems, betrayal and mistrust, addictions, greed and brutality eventually led them to their fall. There are some sub-plots that are developing equally, but everything is brilliantly orchestrated and combined by Scorcese. The film has all his style and their three hours length pass quickly. The heavy atmosphere, the brutal and raw violence, the current use of slang and f-words, are all part of a style that Scorcese associated with his gangster films. The torture scene where that guy's head was smashed into a vise is worthy of anthology, and likewise some of the scenes where Pesci gets angry and starts brutally beating those in front.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is one of those actors who never, or almost never, fails. And he works beautifully with Scorcese, as does Pesci. The three collaborated wonderfully here, and the result is a harmonious combination between the work of the director and the two main actors. There is not a moment out of tone. Pesci's performance was really the best of his career, much more mature and profound than in Goodfellas. Sharon Stone, in turn, had to face a difficult character, in which beauty is associated with a certain spirit of survival and a vicious cycle, that ends up leading her character to self-destruction. She has a character that requires beauty, sensuality, but also a lot of psychological depth, and the actress achieved its combination brilliantly, being nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress that year and winning the Golden Globe in the same category. She, like Pesci, achieves in this film one of her best performances ever (or at least everything I have seen of her so far). In addition to them, the film has good additions such as James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, Pasquale Cajano and Vinny Vella, among others.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is impeccable. Filmed inside a real casino during daily closing hours, you couldn't demand a better or more detailed set. The cinematography and camera work were also meticulously done, and editing, mixing and post-production work are impeccable. The pace is good, with scenes so well linked that the whole story is crystal clear to the audience, despite the three hours length. Finally, a word for the soundtrack, which harmonizes perfectly with what the film shows, and the general environment.<br/><br/>This film is not just a follower in the path of ""Goodfellas"", although there are similarities in style, derived from the presence of the same director and main actors.

","""Casino"" is basically a spiritual sequel to ""Goodfellas"": Martin Scorsese reunites Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent to tell the tale of a mobster's violent rise and fall in 1970s America. ""Casino"" isn't quite as good as ""Goodfellas,"" but it's still a great movie in its own right. Scorsese, the master, avoids remaking ""Goodfellas"" by introducing new themes of doomed love and Catholic guilt that help to create a layered, engaging story. As he did before with New York City (and later with Boston) Scorsese uses the city of Las Vegas perfectly as a setting, portraying it as a sleepless town of bright lights and flashy cars ready to be taken advantage of by the American underworld. We experience the energy and excitement of the city's nightlife just as the characters do, and we understand why they'd want to escape to this lonely city in the desert where their dreams could come true - only for them to be dashed on the rocks of dirty money and broken relationships.<br/><br/>As always in a Scorsese picture the cast is excellent. Every actor is amazing in ""Casino"", especially Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. My favorite aspect of the movie is Robert Richardson's cinematography, which uses lighting and color to emphasize the film's dynamic setting and create a haunting atmosphere during the film's scenes of gangster violence. On nearly every level ""Casino"" is a great movie - except the pacing. This movie doesn't need to be three hours long; the third act in particular drags well past its sell-by date. And while Scorsese didn't replicate ""Goodfellas"" when he made ""Casino,"" he still tells a familiar story that had already been done better before. Between ""Casino"" and ""Goodfellas"" I easily prefer the latter, but that doesn't mean ""Casino"" isn't a great movie. 9/10."

","From the mesmerising Saul Bass opening credit sequence, being an abstract mosaic created from inter-cut close-ups of Vegas neon, to the re-run of the exploding car, this is one brash and beautiful beast all the way. Of course, longer than it really should be, with maybe too many shots of the counting room and cash being channelled noisily, but then everything here is appropriately excessive, not least the violence. The language is confrontational, the lighting and colour shrill but the seamless editing draws us along, in what is essentially a rather slim story, eager to indulge further in the gluttony on display and arrogant swagger, shamelessly celebrated. I'm not a great fan of De Niro but he does well here, his rather flat delivery providing excellent contrast to the performance of a lifetime from Sharon Stone. Despite the amazing skills of Scorsese in bringing off this amazing cinematic epic with such pizzazz, it would have been a lesser film without Stone. Much criticised, she is undeniably an actress who with the right incentive can, seemingly effortlessly, lift a movie way out of the norm. If not more important than Taxi Driver, this probably is the better film due to the exuberance and sheer love of cinematic movement on display, oh and awareness of the importance of a superlative soundtrack."

","Teaming Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in a gangster flick is pretty much a no-brainer, but I couldn't help thinking, especially in the latter hour of the movie, that the picture tried to be just a bit too ambitious for it's own good. At three hours, the picture loses some of it's edge, even with Pesci's manic and over the top characterization of Nicky Santoro, a mob hit man sent to Vegas to keep an eye on Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro) as the boss of the new Tangiers Hotel. The scene with Tony Dogs (Carl Ciarfalio) with his head in a vise will make you glad you live in a different universe from these guys.<br/><br/>The surprise role in this picture had to be that of Ginger McKenna, portrayed by Sharon Stone. If you never thought she had much range as an actress she'll probably change your mind here, especially by the time she's had it with Ace and goes into that trashing, hysterical fit before she gets thrown out of the house. I thought it was a nifty touch when the film makers threw in that Rolling Stones cover of 'Heart of Stone' in an early scene between Ace and Ginger. That was perfect.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad gangster flick, but if ever remade, I'd recommend eliminating most or all of the narration by the principals, and let the action speak for itself. That, and a critical eye for all that's unnecessary to pare the story down to it's essentials. Keep De Niro, Pesci and Stone though, they know how to turn up the heat when you need it most."
"personastar","7","0","0","3 February 2017"," Leaving Old Las Vegas Behind and Not Looking Back
","It's not cute or cloying and manages to avoid trade in many of the clichés we have come to recognize in films about Las Vegas. And for a film nearly three hours long it never drags. My first viewing of this movie, however, leaves me satisfied but not mesmerized, content, but not changed in any way. Still, I appreciate the contribution this film has made to our understanding of and perspective on the history of Las Vegas, even as the film failed to evoke in me a nostalgia for what was lost with the crumbling of the old casinos. <br/><br/>Sharon Stone's performance as Ginger has deservedly won praise. On the surface, Ginger is a classic character type -- the hustler seduced by the promise of a conventional, comfortable life. In the end, she is undone by her choice to trade in her joie de vivre for a chance to be arm candy to a casino boss. However, watching her come unglued is fascinating. She's as unpredictable and dangerous as any character in this movie. The moment when Ginger and Nicky lash out at each other, each like a feral, desperate animal, recalls the fathoms each character has traveled from a much more placid and controlled persona. As the Vegas hustler who catches Sam Rothstein's eye, Stone's Ginger goes from the apple of the film's eye to a dead junkie lying desperate and forgotten in a hotel hallway. Along the way, she invites our empathy as a forlorn and seemingly confused trophy wife, to convincingly portraying a conniving and cold-hearted woman intent to get what she can out of a marriage of convenience. <br/><br/>The film travels in its characters' hubris. Sam Rothstein, as played by Robert DeNiro, makes the fateful decision to fire an inept but politically-connected employee. Nicky Santoro, as played by Joe Pesci, displays a will to power that overtakes even ambition, engaging in a tryst with Ginger, whacking anyone who displeases him, and generally acting as if his run of luck in sin city will never come to an end. These three characters, Sam, Nicky, and Ginger, are bound, in different ways, by oaths and promises, by traditions and conventions, all of which come unwrapped as the Vegas outsiders find their welcome finally wearing thin with the local powers that be, and perhaps, with the laws of nature. As the system they have established starts to sputter, so does the friendship between Sam and Nicky, and the love, if one could ever have called it that, between Sam and Ginger, does not hold, indeed cannot hold. <br/><br/>Casino does not offer a morality tale. It does not warn us, at least not overtly. But the caution and road signs are there for those who would read them. What ultimately prevents this from being a great film, however, is a stronger sense of what it all means. Excess is on display: greed, will to power overtaking common sense, addiction, lust, and anything else you would care to name. And the relationships? Of course it is no surprise that they do not last. But the director, Martin Scorsese, fails to tell us what the unbinding of the old order really entails. At the end of the film the protagonist, Sam, intones over arching shots of exploding buildings and new Disney-like casinos. One close shot of the lion at the MGM Grand suggests that a new showmanship has replaced a grittier, earthier place that really meant something. We even see hordes of obese seniors storming the casinos. Scorsese hints, strongly, that something has been lost. <br/><br/>But certainly more has been lost than violence and organized crime? We might be willing to go down the road of regretting the loss of an older, more meaningful era if the director had set up a film that showed the consequences of vice overcoming the bonds of friendship. What if DeNiro really drove home for us how the vices of sin city prevented a marriage between Ginger and Sam from ever taking hold? But we never really get this. Instead, the film spends rather too much time on the mob bosses from out of town who always get their suitcases, and rather a lot of time on Nicky's propensity for violence. More could have been done to delve into Rothstein as a character. Was he always a narcissistic strongman with a need for control? Or, did this happen to him in Vegas? We never really find out. The film also never really explains the unraveling of the marriage between Sam and Ginger; we simply encounter it as a fait accompli. Ultimately, if this film wants us to mourn the old Las Vegas, it needs to give us more reason to think something existed worth saving in these characters and in their way of life. Their respective fates, Rothstein's unexpected survival, Ginger's slow fade, and Nicky's brutal murder, seem disconnected and anomalous. <br/><br/>A film that trades in so much nihilism shifts, unexpectedly, near its end, to sentimentality, asking us, with its tribute to the old casinos and revulsion at the new edifices of corporatism, to finally sentimentalize the characters and their milieu. But audiences may not be so quick to whitewash a corrupt and violent era, even with its sharp and colorful personalities. Corporate-backed casinos emerging on the ruins of a corrupt and violent era? Might seem like a small price to pay, after all."

","I liked this film a lot, it made me want to see all the rest of Scorsese's work. I had already seen Taxi Driver and Raging Bull when I saw Casino. Casino is only slightly inferior to Raging Bull, Taxi Driver being altogether the best, but Casino takes Scorsese back to his roots : the Mafia, although instead of having his native city New York as a setting, this time he chooses Las Vegas, with the casinos and (obviously) the cash. The story is roughly based on true authentic anecdotes from the 70s. It's about a master of gambling, Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert de Niro), hired by the Mafia to control a casino, the Tangiers. He meets and marries a respected prostitute, Ginger (Sharon Stone), and one of his old friends, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), comes into town. The actors are excellent, Robert de Niro is just perfect as usual, Joe Pesci plays his usual small, but completely out of control, violent gangster and Sharon Stone is as beautiful as ever, getting less and less when she starts to drink and take drugs...things start well for the couple, but ""no one stays at the top forever""...<br/><br/>A great film, with superb travelings and shoulder-held camera-work by the director. The film is violent. I saw it when I was 14 but that's just me, so if you've never seen an R-rated movie or an 18 (UK), don't start with this one."

","""Casino"" (1995) is director Martin Scorsese's analytical, if overly graphic, critique of mob rule and its loss of control over Las Vegas' gambling empire. It stars Robert DeNiro as Sam Rothstein, a hand-picked inside wise guy and front runner. Sam's put in charge of one of the biggest gaming palaces on the strip, The Tangiers. Initially he's assigned to clean up the penny corruption of local shady con artists. After all, the mob can't be the one's getting scammed. However, when Sam meets Ginger (Sharon Stone) the sexy and devil-may-care high rolling courtesan of the blackjack tables, he throws caution and the advice from his mob bosses to the wind in favor of a good time. This already volatile situation is further stimulated by the arrival of Nicky Santora (Joe Pesci), a thug in a fancy suit with a decided disregard for the niceties of gracious living. Nicky presents himself as Sam's indispensable appendage. But it isn't long before his uncontrollable behavior threatens to topple Sam from his roost. With the mob bosses getting very nervous over Nicky's rising body count and Sam's flamboyance in the work place, it isn't long before everything falls apart.<br/><br/>Scorsese populates his cinematic landscape with a veritable who's who of contemporary stellar and old time talent, including Don Rickles, Kevin Pollack, James Woods, Dick Smothers and Alan King. After some smart talking and fast shooting at the crap tables, Scorsese takes us on the real tour of Vegas  in its corrupt byways, brothels and hidden cemeteries out in the middle of an unassuming corn field.<br/><br/>The Anniversary Edition of ""Casino"" has been remastered for DVD. The anamorphic picture element is free of the dirt and debris that the prior bare bones release of this formidable film had. Colors are rich, vibrant. Contrast levels are bang on. There is a bit of color bleeding during some of the underexposed scenes, but perhaps this in keeping with the film's original texture. Blacks are deep and solid. Fine details are fully realized throughout. Only a hint of edge enhancement intrudes (and then, only briefly) on an otherwise impressive transfer. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a real punch and kick to the bass and rear speakers, particularly with its emphasis on vintage background music. <br/><br/>The brutalization of Nicky with a baseball bat is even more viscerally disturbing in this new sonic mix. You can actually hear subtle nuances in breathing as they bludgeon him to death. Extras include a bevy of making of featurettes, including interviews with many of the principle cast, some nice behind the scenes junkets, deleted scenes, and an extensive backstage look at the real life incidents that inspired the film. Bottom line is, this is the version of ""Casino"" fans have been waiting for."

","It usually takes a decade or more for people to wise up to to a Scorsese film, and notice how brilliant it really is...just witness all the sneering comments being made about Gangs and Aviator. When Casino came out, its only high profile defender was Ebert. Most of the other critics, and not just the usual suspects( such as a certain hack whose initials are M.M).thought it was just an knock off of Goodfellas. This is , to put it bluntly, absurd. This film is one of the three or four greatest organized crime epics.The texture, the rhythm, the pace, the color, and the horror of Las Vegas are captured with bold brush strokes.The costumes, the music, the editing, the cinematography..all are brilliant. I will comment on the acting... Robert De Niro portrays someone hes never portrayed before in a Scorsese film..a cool headed, calculating near genius.His Achilles heel is his pride in his intelligence. He cannot imagine that he can make a mistake, and it leads to his fall. Joe Pesci offers a better performance than in Goodfelllas, because his character has more screen time and is far more complex. Yes..he is a violent, destructive man. He also imagines himself to be extremely loyal, a good family man, etc. Note how reluctant he is to torture the guy using the vise..its just that he knows that if he doesn't, HIS head will be in the vise.Note the weird grace notes , like combing the hair of the woman he shoots. Finally, Sharon Stone.This is a woman who who is pitifully weak and confused, for all her outward bravado. James Woods (a stunning portrayal) plays her like a Stradivarius.). The last shot of Ms. Stone in the movie(I will not give it away)is terrifying-and pitiful. every performance in this movie,from the biggest star turn to the smallest cameo,is dazzling..the use of Stardust at the end is brilliant.

Romantic side-stories, such as the one in De Niro's HEAT, rely on uncompromising female counterparts to mangle the story, the hero's strength, and the overall enjoyment of the movie. Now, here we have Sharon Stone. Her character is so imbalanced, from the time she is introduced, to the end, that there really is no justification for it.

"DVR_Brale","10","2","5","4 August 2017"," Committed to details, incessantly told story and superb acting
","I find it strange how few people mentioned love and marriage when writing about this movie. I think mixing these two with criminals running the business is a combination which makes Casino what it is - a movie with unbelievably smoothly told story which covers many aspects of running the business but personal life as well. That is important since it's not sheer incompetence which brought this guys down; it's lust and dishonest in their personal sphere, especially Sam's unhappy marriage. That's why this is the very first line in the movie: ""When you love someone, you've gotta trust them."" That, and other few lines, immediately set the tone and give us the key for proper understanding of the movie.<br/><br/>On to the acting. De Niro performing Ace has now become my favorite performance. He's totally convincing in distancing himself from mob guys and positioning as someone how knows the ""know-how"". He isn't a street gangster but a handicapper given a casino to run. That's also important because Casino is, in contrast to Goodfellas, a movie about guys higher in mafia hierarchy. It's sad to see De Niro now starring in movies ""Dirty Grandpa"" alike. Joe Pesci in funny and intimidating, almost psychotic. Sharon Stone really did deliver once in a lifetime execution. Accompanied with other great cast members, Casino feels and runs like a quasi-documentary; it's convincing and realistic.<br/><br/>To make it short, Scorsese managed to re-tell a multiply layered story based on actual events and give a good insight on how Las Vegas works. I'd recommend you to check out real characters and actual events after you see the movie to broaden your scope and realize with what commitment to details was Casino made."
"afrodome","10","2","5","22 July 2017"," My All Time Favorite Movie.
","I don't know what it is about this movie, but it's one of those rare films where you can watch it a dozen times, and it's just as thrilling as it was the first time around. <br/><br/>Considering it preceded Martin's successful GoodFellas: a film regarded as a classic gangster film (and rightfully so), the format has a bit of the same style going, with a narrative to guide us through the story, and featuring powerhouse duo of Pesci & DiNero, but with this film, so as a result it gets overshadowed, but to me, it qualifies as a film on its own, MY favorite film mind you.<br/><br/>There's a certain feel that this movie carries and it's nothing short of perfect. 3 hours in length and not a single minute wasted, it's a masterpiece. Compared to GoodFellas, it's just felt more solid, more nuanced, detailed, technical shots better executed, sound, light, every actor giving 100 % to make you feel immersed in the story. <br/><br/>The violence is there too, and naturally it's a ruthless world, but instead the violence has more of a conscience. GoodFellas was hit after hit, sometimes leaving you feeling like you're watching a slasher, so it becomes ineffective. Throughout Casino, the violence is less common, but VERY real, sometimes comically shocking like Friedkin's Killer Joe, to bleak like what you see in American History X. <br/><br/>Sharon Stone who plays Ginger plays the alpha HBIC perfectly, and as we learn later on, downplays what chaos she is capable of.<br/><br/>DeNior, who plays Ace, is strictly business but he has a heart of gold. He's the narrator and the mediator, and more the more screen time he gets, the more you really like the guy. Comedia Kingpin Don Rickles is even in this movie! Just perfect! Capolavoro!"

Also, any time a film relies 90% on narration just annoys me. If I wanted that much narration, I'd get a book. You should be able to convey your story through images and character dialogue, not a constant narration with little clips of what they're talking about scattered throughout. I give it some credit for completely kicking it up six notches in the final third of the film, though. It became so much more engaging and entertaining, and Pesci and De Niro both fine tuned their performances. James Woods was also very fun to watch, but was criminally underused."

","1996 was a strong Oscar year  Nixon, Dead Man Walking, Braveheart, The Usual Suspects, Sense and Sensibility, Se7en  but Casino was bizarrely, and shamefully, snubbed that year, with Sharon Stone receiving the movie's only nomination.<br/><br/>Told almost exclusively through narration, the film follows the fortunes of Jimmy Conway, an essentially decent man who runs a casino for the mob, and how his loyalty to psycho made-man Nicky Santoro and love of upscale hustler Ginger McKenna leads him down a path of doomed tragedy.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie displays a host of talent playing at their peak. All the leads are magnificent; the writing sharp and funny; the direction confident and spellbinding in its aesthetic sensibility; the editing tight and witty; and the soundtrack, providing CONSTANT background atmosphere, is perfect. The whole thing looks beautiful, with a dazzling array of incredible interiors and costumes that perfectly capture the era, the story, and the characters inhabiting it.<br/><br/>Epic in scale, as all Scorsese tends to be, the movie plays out like a Greek tragedy, with every character on a trajectory that only leads down into spectacular, violent, drug addled oblivion. Fascinating, riveting, inventive, gaudy, and funny  a success on every level and one of the greatest films of the 90s.<br/><br/>NOTE: The head-in-vice scene is painful. I can watch all manner of exploitation/cannibal/grindhouse fare over dinner, but I still can't watch the head-in-vice scene."
"Hancock_the_Superb","9","2","5","26 September 2005"," May I Be So Bold As To Say: This Movie Is BETTER Than ""Goodfellas""?
","This movie has been criticized by many for being a reworking of sorts of Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi's previous true-crime classic film, ""Goodfellas"", and in many ways, that idea holds water: it uses many of the same actors, the same kind of sudden, spontaneous, unflinchingly brutal violence, the same SteadiCam direction, and of course the glitzy period soundtrack - not to mention the extreme use of the ""f"" word (422 times - and this time, not all of them are from Joe Pesci!). Yes, it has all that. But, in my opinion, ""Casino"" is actually BETTER than ""Goodfellas"" in many ways. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything (pretty much) just clicked.<br/><br/>Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro in one of his best performances) is a very skilled hustler and gambler who takes over (at the behest of the Mafia) the Tangiers Casino in 1970's Las Vegas. Soon, he's on the top of the world, with him and his cohorts making millions of dollars in an intricate money-making scam - not to mention a beautiful, sexy wife, Ginger (Sharon Stone). But things start to fall apart when Rothstein's childhood friend-cum-mob enforcer Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and his crew, representing ""the big bosses"" back east, arrive to make sure everything goes smoothly. Soon, Rothstein's empire falls apart, from an increasingly leaky scheme, sloppy playing by Santoro and crew, his wife's infidelities and drug use, and pressure from the Feds, state government, and the local county commissioner (L.Q. Jones). Finally, Rothstein watches as pretty much everyone around begins to tumble, and he finds he must watch his own back as well.<br/><br/>This movie is simply marvelous to behold. Scorsese's direction and Robert Richardson's direction are beautiful, taking Scorsese's wonderfully fluid directing style from the mean streets of New York to the glitzy neon jungle of Las Vegas. Scorsese and Pileggi do a wonderful of showing the glitz, glamor, corruption, and spectacle of old-time Las Vegas, through the utterly beautiful images, and the fantastic dialog. This movie's screenplay isn't laugh-out-loud funny like ""Goodfellas"", but it's just as memorable and well-put together. The violence, as in ""Goodfellas"", is bloody and unflinchingly graphic (particularly Pesci's interrogation of a rival mobster and the death of Pesci and his brother), while not at all glamorized.<br/><br/>The acting is solid all around, though that's to be expected. De Niro gives a truly outstanding performance as Ace, who comes across as a normal guy who happens to have had a multi-billion dollar cash cow fall in his lap. Sharon Stone, who I don't much care for, does an excellent job portraying Ginger's wild and crazy nature early on, and doing a fabulous job of showing her downward spiral. Pesci is solid as always, and his performance here (despite the abundance of ""f-cks"") is actually more subdued than in ""Goodfellas"", though just as good. The rest of the supporting cast - Don Rickles, Alan King, Kevin Pollack, L.Q. Jones, Dick Smothers, and Frank Vincent, among many others, all turn in wonderful performances, even in the smallish roles. The only flaw is James Woods, who, as Stone's loser ex-boyfriend, is perfectly cast and does what he can, but is more or less wasted. The period soundtrack is simply gorgeous, and truly helps to enhance the atmosphere. Unlike in ""Goodfellas"", where the music was mostly solid but did have a few out-of-place songs, all of the music clicks.<br/><br/>99 out of 100 movie buffs will tell you that ""Goodfellas"" is a classic, while ""Casino"" is merely a pale attempt to live up to that film by Scorsese. I can't speak for more than the minority - but I actually think that ""Casino"" is a more solid version of the package that ""Goodfellas"" delivered. Both films are classics that I'd recommend to anyone; it's just a matter of personal preference.<br/><br/>My score: 9/10"

He's to gambling what Scorsese is to directing... a natural... and the casino itself becomes an absorbing character: we feel pulse of the machines, and the men behind the scenes, keeping the moneymaking beast alive while protecting it from cheaters, con artists, and crooked politicians.<br/><br/>Enter Joe Pesci as Nicky, Rothstein's childhood friend: the muscle who is familiar and cocky, dangerous and ultimately undependable. And there's the flavor of the month, Sharon Stone, as Sam's trophy girlfriend turned wife, Ginger, who becomes the apple of his eye - and soon, for a man who seemed so infallible, nothing matters but trusting a woman who repeatedly warned him not to.<br/><br/>The movie hits a wall with this escalating-downhill relationship between Sam and Ginger, but it was faltering beforehand - De Niro, Pesci, and some of the other shady characters, although colorful and formidable, aren't interesting enough to really care about - unlike GOODFELLAS, RAGING BULL or TAXI DRIVER, they all seem more written than real.<br/><br/>The duel-narration here... while beautiful in GOODFELLAS between Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco... works here and it doesn't: De Niro's by-the-numbers account is fine in the beginning, giving us a firsthand account of how things run, but it becomes a rambling safety net for the lack of a streamlined plot: especially when his business luck turns sour.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Joe Pesci's counterpoint is completely unnecessary, sounding like a mafia goon's version of Bugs Bunny, filling us with details better left for the audience to figure on their own (and given his character's fate... is the narration recorded in Satan's private broadcasting station?)...<br/><br/>Then the last half runs itself completely ragged: juggling the dull doomed love story straight out of a nighttime soap, and Ace and Nicky's edgy friendship that meanders to a predictably violent conclusion (and they never seemed that tight to begin with for an unraveling to really matter).<br/><br/>If Scorsese and scriptwriter Nicholas Pillegi stuck closer to the Casino, perhaps CASINO, and its characters, might have had more purpose. What we're left with is too much style without substance.<br/><br/>(And has there ever been a character more deserving a bloody death than James Wood's pimp/hustler who not only repeatedly steals Stone from DeNiro, but kidnaps, and continually threatens, his daughter? While we witness the immense, overboard bloodshed of everyone else, James comes out with a few bruises. What the hell were they thinking?!)"

This film is good from a sociological point for those people who would like to catch a glimpse of the rise and fall of a powerful gambling boss."
"jackasstrange","4","3","11","22 January 2014"," One of the worst films by Martin Scorsese
","I am not the biggest fan of Martin Scorsese at all, in fact, I don't like him and I think he is a tad overrated, and this film is a proof of why I think that way about him. It's a bad film that no supposedly 'great' director would do. <br/><br/>It's a film moved by nothing. Seriously, there is no point to make that film. It looks like a worsened version of Goodfellas, that frankly also wasn't that great. There is the crazy Joe Pesci yelling and killing people and the quiet and conscious but also despicable Robert DeNiro. In fact, it can be considered a reprise of their roles. But unlike Goodfellas, that has an intelligent narration an is so over the top that you even laugh at some scenes, Casino has no redeem value or whats or ever. Is a mess. It's so predictable and so repetitive. Why should I spent three hours of my time to see things that were not only made before a lot of times, but made way better before, after all? It is not worthy watching at all. Not mentioning the fact that the film is ugly as hell, it has no art value and it looks like those low budget films made in the 70s. Total fiasco. <br/><br/>The music was great, oh yeah, some great stuff on it. But it was all over the place. I merely believe how bad the music was on this film. But if the music was that bad it was because of the editing. One of the worst that I've ever seen in a 'big' film. Seriously, who are the editors of this film? What a lazy work. What they are thinking? I mean, what they are thinking? And the art direction was so tasteless, it looks like *rap. Sorry for the swearing, but it is literally what I meant to say. I know that the intention of the sparkling colors in the ambient was to make the bandits looks even more extravagant and repugnant than they already were, but it couldn't have been done in a better way? Well, I totally think so. I'm not even bothered by the horrible and senseless script, since that there is things much worse than that in the film. Anyway, it succeeds in passing the intended message, that is to show how dirty and how works the casino's world, but the rest, is a mess. The only good thing about it was Sharon Stone, that was by far the best actress in the film. 4.5/10"

"Jared_Andrews","7","1","2","27 July 2018"," Overlooked Scorsese Crime Drama
","Martin Scorsese certainly has shown an interest in crime stories. He explores the gritty details of the worlds and the players involved in the games. This particular story focuses on a particular gaming world-the one found in the gambling mecca of the United States, Vegas. <br/><br/>Appropriately, the movie is called 'Casino.' Throughout its three-hour runtime, it unpacks a great deal. The first 45 minutes or so lay the foundation. We're exposed to thorough details of how the gaming world in Vegas operates and what it takes to succeed in the business. It's fascinating. For a while. <br/><br/>My philosophy is if a movie is three hours long, it better have great reasons for being three hours long. This one felt like it could have been trimmed in a few places, but that didn't happen. Scorsese likes to make long films, so we're left with this monstrously long creation. <br/><br/>He takes his time, cuing up one Rolling Stones song after another, letting events play out at a leisurely pace. It's all interesting and well-crafted (because its Scorsese), but it takes nearly two full hours before the pivotal conflict arises. Before then, the characters' lives are bit too peachy, too easy. <br/><br/>Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci play childhood friends who take different business avenues in life, each finding success and power that they find appealing. De Niro wants to play it straight and run a legitimate casino, and he should-he's great at it. Pesci seeks the illegal angle, becoming one of the most infamous mobsters in the world of Vegas. <br/><br/>As I said, their lives run smoothly (for the most part) for too much of the story. Everything goes downhill when Pesci steps on one of the wrong gangster's toes, De Niro deals with legal issues over a gambling license, and the biggest doozy of all-De Niro's wife loses her mind. <br/><br/>In a force of nature performance from Sharon Stone, De Niro's screen wife Ginger becomes the most compelling and despicable character over the film's final hour-this is when Stone really starts to go for it. No spoilers here, so I'll just say that her reputation as one of the worst movie wives of all time is well-deserved. <br/><br/>As circumstances spiral out of control, Scorsese blasts a couple more Rolling Stones songs and opens up his bag of mesmerizing camera tricks. His catalog of film techniques can fill an entire book shelf on its own. His application choices don't always appear to make sense, but they certainly catch the eye, which may be the primary intention. <br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Marty's work, so I'll see anything he has made. While this isn't his best, it's still an entertaining and worthwhile film."

""Casino"" has a lot of great performances in great scenes with great dialogue, but it doesn't really hold together as a great narrative. I get the feeling while watching it that I could re- order most of the scenes and it would play just as well. I think it's because the subject matter here is a lot bigger, and the sprawling 3 hour film still feels like it's leaving out a lot as it crams a ton of dense detail into it's narration.

","I adore Martin Scorsese he's an amazing director and has ultimately mastered the mob movie with films like Goodfellas which I love, but I often hear people talk about this movie as if it is on par with it but I have to disagree with that I find this movie a bit overrated but far from terrible. I also like to start reviews of positively so I will say that I loved the world that was set up in this film, the whole mobster world hidden behind the guise of casinos in Las Vegas was a very entertaining aspect to this movie. Robert DeNiro is really good in this film I loved the scenes he had with Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone he was very imposing and did a great job in this film. Joe Pesci was good but it definitely felt like we've seen things like this from him before. But by far the best performance in this movie was Sharon Stone she was amazing in this movie she was perfect at conveying a damaged and sick woman with no way out and her break down scenes are just amazing to watch. This movie is extremely violent but I loved that about this movie, the violence was effective it showed the brutality of this system and made it feel all the more realistic. However I think this movie has some very big flaws that people has ignored. For one the first 30-45 minutes of this movie are nothing but exposition through narration your given all the inner workings of this world and everyone in it but it just doesn't work because it's given to you all at once and your struggling to catch up and should have been given slower and more gradually across the movie. Another massive issue that has been addressed with this movie is how many similarities it has to Goodfellas but it never comes close to matching that films greatness. Since its structured and layed out so similarly to Goodfellas the film feels like it has the massive hole in it, since the characters that DeNiro and Pesci are playing in this film are so similar to their characters in that movie you feel as if there should be another character in it to fill the place of a Henry Hill but there isn't and the film never recovers from that. This film is also very long and makes for a lot of moments to drag on and I wasn't really satisfied with how they wrapped up Sharon Stones character arc. <br/><br/>Casino is a flawed movie it's got some really good performances, it's very well directed and has a great world to it, but the simple fact is that we've seen movies like this from Scorsese before and it's has far to much narration given out over to long a time.

For example, it was on TV the other night and I thought to myself 'I'll watch this for thirty minutes before I go to bed', but it's hypnotic cinematography and soundtrack made me stay until the end.<br/><br/>De Niro is wonderful as usual, channelling a little of Jimmy Conway's attitude, but this time, Sam is a little more of a coward than before, and although he has good intentions for everyone, where money is involved, you can't please or trust anyone.<br/><br/>Pesci surprisingly is the weak link in the film. I'm not saying he's no good, the man is a phenomenal actor, but here, he's literally doing his Tommy Devito character, and when you channel a character as memorable as that one, it's going to get noticed.........much like his face being pinned back to make his look younger.<br/><br/>Stone gives the performance of her life as the insufferable Ginger, when an actress can give a performance where the audience has not an ounce of sympathy, or empathy for the character she's portraying, that's a job done blooming well.

"rbrooksie12","10","1","2","21 February 2014"," Brooks---Casino Review
","Casino is one of the best films made by Martin Scorsese. Casino reunited Scorsese with Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent. Casino tells the tale of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (DeNiro) a New York bookie and his pal, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) who move out to Las Vegas and create an empire. However ones money hungry wife (Stone) helps to bring it down.<br/><br/>The first third of this film features almost constant narrations from Ace and Nicky. These narrations play a great role in the film because it takes you far in depth to Ace and Nicky's Las Vegas operation.<br/><br/>To those of you who really enjoyed Scorsese's 1990 film ""GoodFellas"" there is no doubt in my mind that you will enjoy this film. It features Joe Pesci playing almost the same character he played in ""GoodFellas"". This film also features Sharon Stone, who was nominated for an academy award as hooker Ginger McKenna. The film also features Frank Vincent as Frank Marino, Kevin Pollak as Phillip Green, James Woods as Lester Diamond, and Don Rickles as casino manager Billy Sherbert. If you are a big fan of Scorsese, DeNiro, or Pesci you will no doubt enjoy this film. This film deserves a 10/10 rating and is a must watch for any DeNiro, Pesci, Scorsese, or mob movie fan who has never seen this movie."
"Red-Barracuda","9","1","2","7 February 2014"," Entertainingly intense crime drama from Scorsese
","When Casino came out it wasn't too well received from what I can remember. It reunited director Martin Scorsese, writer Nicholas Pileggi and actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci from Goodfellas. The obvious similarities between the films were used negatively against it. It was essentially seen as a lesser re-run of that earlier film. Well, I guess critics need to say things like this to indicate they know what they're talking about but for the rest of us such details are sort of irrelevant and we are only really interested in whether Casino was any good on its own right. And the answer is that it sure is. Maybe not of the standard of Goodfellas but it sure is in a similar ball-park. Like that earlier film it's based on real events, although in this case even more characters have been re-named, probably for legal reasons. It's a rise and fall crime film about the workings of a 70's Las Vegas casino, in which the Mafia skimmed millions of dollars.<br/><br/>From the great opening credit sequence from the legendary Saul Bass, this is a tour de force of technical excellence. It' visually very impressive with great period detail. Scorsese is a master at this kind of narrative and commands our attention with his customary dynamic direction. The story is propelled by a fair bit of narration from De Niro and Pesci, who respectively play the man who runs the casino and the Mob enforcer. Both actors are on the top of their game and are impressively supported by a career best turn from Sharon Stone as a high-class hooker who gets involved with De Niro's character in a loveless marriage. None of the principle characters are especially likable or sympathetic but the top class acting from them ensures they are always compelling. Scorsese certainly has a knack of presenting damaged people on screen in convincing and enthralling ways. Like others there is a focus on harsh domestic relationships and the De Niro/Stone coupling does make for intense viewing at times. Pesci, on the other hand, is absolutely full-on and authentic as a very bad guy. In fact, Casino tops any other Scorsese film in the grim violence stakes. This is a film not exactly for the faint hearted at times. It also showcases another facet of the director's with a soundtrack of pop and rock tracks from the period, except this is his most extreme utilisation of this scene setting musical approach with song after song strung together relentlessly, underpinning events with very few gaps of silence in between. If I had to level any negativity against the movie at most I would say maybe it's a little bit overlong but even then it does have a cracking pace and keeps the attention regardless.<br/><br/>It does seem that over the years Casino has garnered a better reputation and is now looked upon as another excellent Scorsese picture and this is the way it should be."
"pisanzz","9","1","2","29 November 2013"," Fantastic
","Martin Scorsese is and always will be a legend. With Casino, Scorsese shows us his ability to keep producing masterpiece's. His specialty is with mob-based films and with his resume including Goodfellas and Gangs of New York, Casino is right on the dot. Its a masterpiece of friendship, destruction, and betrayal. Casino takes many chances with the plot but it is wonderfully voiced-over by Ace and Nicky Santoro (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci). I believe the voice-overs makes Casino interesting because it feels as if we are eavesdropping in a secret place. We hear voice-overs at the mob bosses dinners, at Ace and Ginger's (Sharon Stone) wedding, during Santoro's burglaries and multiple other occasions. This film is a must see and i definitely recommend it."
"punishmentpark","7","1","2","26 November 2013"," Wise Guys², except not as good.
","'Casino' feels somewhat like 'Wise guys' all over again, but grander and longer, and with extensive drama and bloodshed. Still, this one is also very much worth the while. I most prefer the parts where the actors (De Niro, Stone and Pesci in particular) interact in the more elaborate, dialogue-driven scenes. There's quite a few 'quick updates' (with voice-over) here and there to keep the story going, but I felt that, even though they may be necessary to understand the whole plot, there is just too much of that getting in the way of the story - or at least in the way of the dramatic build-up. I suppose it's not an easy story to tell. The idea of giving Pesci's character a voice-over as well, worked out pretty good, though, and quite a few shots were simply cinematic magic.<br/><br/>A fine film once again by Martin Scorses, all in all. A big 7 out of 10."
"ShelbyTMItchell","8","1","2","20 October 2013"," A lot of Curse Words!
","Martin Scorsese has done it again. As he did with his ""Goodfellas"" movie six years earlier. As he reunites with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. As both are really great playing off one another. Like in the movie mentioned and also ""Raging Bull!""<br/><br/>Robert and Joe play corrupt casino sharks. Bent on ruling the Vegas strip. But a lot comes into play. Robert falls in love with violate call girl played by Sharon Stone in a Oscar nominated performance. And Joe's character goes into drugs and violence. That really has caused a strain between the two men. Plus get's Joe's character banned from the casinos over it.<br/><br/>Beware of 300 sayings of the F word here. If you can't stand language. Still though, it is typical mob movie. How the mob get taken down and the FBI coming down on them over it. <br/><br/>Scorsese you cant do wrong at all.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","2","10 August 2012"," Very similar to ""GoodFellas"" but is that such a bad thing?
","Martin Scorsese's ""Casino"" found him treading very similar ground to his film of five years earlier, ""GoodFellas"". From script to actors to storyline to narrative devices, the two films share several common elements. While that makes for a somewhat unoriginal movie, there are certainly worse templates to go by than ""GoodFellas"".<br/><br/>The story is once again based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi. This time, we're treated to a fictionalized account of the rise and fall of Las Vegas casino boss Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (modelled after Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal). Some liberties are taken with the facts but the movie is generally true to life. Like in ""GoodFellas"", voice-over narration is employed throughout the film.<br/><br/>Returning from the cast of ""GoodFellas"" were Robert De Niro & Joe Pesci. De Niro was more in the spotlight this time and delivered a characteristically excellent performance. Pesci's performance is also good but could certainly be seen as a rehashing of his previous, Oscar-winning role. Sharon Stone rounded out the stars and she delivered the best performance of her career; one that resulted in a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nomination. Besides these there are several other notables in supporting roles including Frank Vincent (another ""GoodFellas"" cast member), James Woods & Don Rickles, to mention just a few.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is exceptional. Robert Richardson's cinematography was worthy of an Oscar nomination and Scorsese's direction is great as always. Like ""GoodFellas"", Scorsese also made excellent use of music (mostly popular) throughout the entire film. The sets & costumes also show remarkable style and attention to detail.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Casino"" won't win any awards for originality but it's hard to fault the film when many of its strengths are shared with ""GoodFellas"". The movie might be a bit too long for it's own good but, other than that, I think it compares quite favourably with the vast majority of crime dramas."

","First of all i want to make clear that in my opinion casino is a high- standard movie as every Scorsese's film.BUT....it is the same thing all way back.To make myself clearer i am saying that if i didn't know the director i would easily understood who it would be.Scorcese is a master but he never changes his style even a bit.From the very beginning someone can assume the 'floating' of the movie.<br/><br/>I also have to say that i didn't feel sorry or something about the characters because the movie never let you think something away from the unstoppable narration so it is getting a bit confusing.In the end ,after the ''3 HOUR MESS'' i felt confused and i don't think that i enjoyed it so much.<br/><br/>From the other hand maybe that was the movie's goal, to confuse you by explaining how the things are going into the casinos and for what reason the 'holes' in the desert are created. Maybe Scorsese wanted to show us good fellas ,as always,that in crime there is no room for emotion."
"pierre1-281-682641","5","1","2","2 February 2012"," Decent film!
","I haven't seen too many Scorsese films. I've seen The Departed, The Aviator, and 'most' of GoodFellas. I just watched Casino last night and I think I can say it is one of the best, most involving and well-directed films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is great, De Niro and Pesci giving wonderful performances of 'Ace' and Nicky, respectively. I haven't seen Sharon Stone in any film before, but she also gave a great performance as Ace's wife Ginger.<br/><br/>In a way, Casino is a companion piece to GoodFellas. However, it needs to be judged as a film in it's own right. GoodFellas is a great movie, one that almost anyone can enjoy. But Casino, to me, is more in depth and gives a much more detailed look into the 'big' mobs, the ones that ran Vegas.<br/><br/>The photography is great, especially the camera movement. The voice-over narration may be more than you heard in GoodFellas, but in a way it's necessary to get into the minds of Nicky and Ace. It's like a documentary and these guys are just giving us the facts. Not using a traditional film score also helps to make it feel more 'natural', the pop music selected to give exactly the right mood to its respective seen. Particularly the 'House of the Rising Sun' played towards the end over a sort of 'epilogue'. It not only fit's the scene, but the film as a whole.<br/><br/>I think it's hard to actually say or write what this film is about, like any great film. All you can do is watch it and find out for yourself."
"Steffi_P","7","1","2","1 February 2012"," ""He'll keep coming back until one of you is dead""
","Repetition occurs in cinema at every level. If something is successful, highbrow or lowbrow, there is a good chance that those responsible will simply rerun the formula to get the same result. In 1990 iconic gangster movie and filmmaker's favourite Goodfellas was directed by Martin Scorsese from a script by Nicholas Pileggi, and starred Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. In 1995 gangster movie Casino was directed by Martin Scorsese from a script by You get the idea.<br/><br/>Admittedly Scorsese and Pileggi did work well together, the director illustrating the writer's every word with a well-placed pan or close-up. It's a bit dizzying and the constant musical switching gets a bit tiresome, but you still have to admire the craftsmanship that goes into a picture like this, especially in Scorsese's meticulously planned tracking shots. There's one near the beginning where we follow the skimmer into the casino, and the camera eagerly overtakes him as he heads towards the counting room, really engaging us in what's going on. Or there's the tracking shot at the wedding, where Sharon Stone's flick of her head seems to propel the camera on to the next table. It's a very artificial, obtrusive way of making a movie, but it is nevertheless carefully designed to involve us in the story's world.<br/><br/>This was the eighth, and to date, the final time Robert De Niro has starred in a Scorsese movie, and this is predictably familiar ground for him. Sam Rothstein is really just a slightly more relaxed version of the De Niro character in Goodfellas. De Niro can at least do menacing without using his fists, and of note is his articulation of the word ""dead"" when he threatens his wife. Joe Pesci's role here is nigh-on identical to the one that earned him an Oscar in Goodfellas. He's good at it though. Look at how he stabs up the man with the pen; he really gives the impression of a little guy who's had to get the kicks in quick to survive. But reliable as these two are there is very much a sense with De Niro and Pesci that they are going through the old familiar motions. The real standout in the movie is Sharon Stone. For this part she has to be angry, tearful and drugged-up, as do a lot of actresses, but to do so for such a large chunk of the movie and remain believable throughout, never slipping into over-the-top hysterics, is admirable.<br/><br/>Being a repetition of Goodfellas doesn't necessarily make Casino a weaker movie. It has almost all the same merits and flaws as its predecessor. It is perhaps a little more lacking in true drama and comes closer to a documentary, at times being little more than a list of anecdotes, which makes the nearly three hour runtime a little wearing. One area which, for me, made Casino stand-out was its costume design. Garish as they are, there's a mad kind of co-ordination in Rothstein's suits. There are plenty of other tawdry yet outstanding outfits throughout the movie, such as an Ace of Hearts dress worn by a bit player. Sharon Stone's leather suit in her climactic scenes is memorably striking, and as such helps to highlight the fact that she's been in the same clothes for several days. For me, it's the clothes more than anything else which evoke the misguided glamour of Casino and its denizens. Unfortunately, this isn't what people tend to consider in the gangster movie, so it seems to have gone largely unnoticed"
"Kubris","9","1","2","14 June 2011"," Goodfellas Pt.II, in all the right ways
","The simply titled ""Casino"", one of many Scorsese/ De Niro collaborations, tells the fact-based story of Las Vegas, 1970. Many themes are present, most notably the power of money and greed. The usual suspects are here, and both De Niro and Joe Pesci fit their roles very well; De Niro the suave, level-headed thinker, and Pesci the volatile buttonman.<br/><br/>Five minutes in, and an appropriate title popped into my head: Goodfellas Part II. All the signature aspects of that bar-setting film are present in Casino: smart-talking, wiseguy narrators, constant music in the background, constant action and furious dialogue, swearing (you won't BELIEVE some of Pesci's rants), and dripping mafia style. One thing that isn't the same though is setting: Las Vegas.<br/><br/>The stakes here are higher, so lots about the movie has been scaled up as well. The plot is rich, with many angles. Goodfellas had a more contained story with less to explain, or it was just explained better. The first 20 minutes of Casino tell you all kinds of Vegas info very quickly. I hope you know your gambling. I don't want to say it's a fault, because it's very necessary, but it seems almost rushed. But it's not like it would affect the runtime, the film is almost 3 full hours. I'm a fan of that though, this is a bog movie with lots to tell. And because of great pacing and exciting moments, it's a 3 hour treat.<br/><br/>The content has been elevated too. Violent and vulgar, this is not a film for kids. But it's all important. Pesci's character Nicky does most of the swearing, probably 300 or so f words from him alone, because he's always in a foul mood, which makes him unpredictable. Then there's the violence. Starting with a scene involving a pen, this is super-duper violent, showing just what people do to get what they want, or because they're crazy Nicky.<br/><br/>If you told someone this was a Scorsese/Tarantino collaboration, they'd probably believe you. Scenes with the vice, hammer and bat are right out of the Tarantino killbook, or out of Dead Rising. They keep you on edge and are brutal.<br/><br/>Casino takes everything about Goodfellas, minus Ray Liotta, and puts it in Vegas. Except for a confusing start that can't really be dealt with, the only reason Casino didn't enjoy the success of Goodfellas is its bland name and being released 5 years later. See Goodfellas, then see this. 8.9/10"
"Fillfillbust","9","1","2","11 June 2011"," Scorsese, DeNiro, Pesci, gangsters. Enough said.
","A near flawless film. Many probably don't agree, but I do place this one, 1 notch above Goodfellas. Don't get me wrong, Goodfellas is a great film in it's own right, but for me Casino takes the cake. For a 3 hour film it passes quickly and is wholly entertaining. One of my favorite aspects is the performances. I am not a huge Sharon Stone fan, but Martin manages to get a full out dramatic performance out of her, definitely her best role in her entire film career to date. I can watch this film once a year and never get bored and I always watch from beginning to end.

"ElMaruecan82","8","1","2","22 May 2011"," Prospects of enjoying ""Casino"" : 80 out of 100 ....
","As an exhilarating immersion in the titular business, the first act is probably the greatest from any Scorsese's film. Marty plunges us into Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein's universe through a hypnotic flamboyance, working like a reminiscence of another Gangster classic, ""Scarface""; and Robert De Niro is as charismatic and respectable as ever. I wanted to be this ""Ace"", this manager whose infallible competence in gambling, betting and defining odds made it sound like an exact science. The opening is about a competence, and boy, how refreshing it was to see in a Marty's film, a man who loves his profession, and who's not a gangster. This part is the reason why I like and respect ""Casino"" as a cinematic achievement. And Marty's direction deserved an Oscar nod, if only for this moment where Ace tries to find out how some customers cheat.<br/><br/>This part absorbs me so much I always wish it would never end. But you can't expect from a Scorsese film to avoid the cherished theme of guilt, and no guilt without a mistake. So, we wait for it to come, remembering the very first lines wondering how this could have gone wrong? ""Ace"" was the Tangiers' undisputed boss, protected by the mob 'back home', who controlled the casino through the notoriously corrupted (at least in mafia films) teamsters' union. Plus, ""Ace"" had a feared bodyguard, the psychopathic Nicky Santoro, Joe Pesci in a performance that would have been more impacting if it hadn't been preceded by Tommy De Vito. In fact, the whole movie has a deja-vu feeling due to its plot's similarity with ""Goodfellas"" but this wasn't a problem for me.<br/><br/>The problem was the hypocrisy of the whole ""how things could have gone wrong"". You expect the movie to introduce it smoothly while in fact, as soon as it starts going wrong, the whole narrative, is structured by a series of mistakes. Nicky was at least honest and explicit about his intentions in Las Vegas. He wanted to squeeze the town until the last drop. He wanted the big thing, and no one to step him over, he didn't care about warnings, about his bosses' instructions, he was in a gangster's oasis in the middle of nowhere, and Ace trying to reason him was as laughable as his attempt to conquer Ginger's heart. Nicky's 'pen in the neck' was a premonition of him being the pain in the ass. But still, he was the guy whose friendship prevented Sam to act against him, like Charlie and Johnny Boy in ""Mean Streets"". One weakness, I could have handled; but another was one too much, and I'm talking of Ginger, Sharon Stone in her Oscar nominated role.<br/><br/>In fact, even Ginger's entrance bothered me, because Marty and Bobby portrayed Sam as a meticulous man who means business and tolerates absolutely no imperfection. So, I didn't buy that he would let a woman throw the chips in the air like this, even for a 'love at first sight' moment, I thought the movie immediately lost its gripping realism, and it's one of the few weaknesses I noticed, after the dummy in the car's explosion and before Anna Scott's strangely blood-less murder. I couldn't believe the guy who told the croupier to perfectly align the chips, or the cook to keep the same quantity of blueberries in the muffins would let this happen. Well, let's concede that it was love, and Bobby played perfectly the part of a man who wants a desirable blonde so much (indeed, she was beautiful) that he didn't care about being loved. And we understand this would be his downfall. But it just started the very day of their marriage, when she was calling her ex-pimp, James Woods as a believable scumbag named Lester. Couldn't ""Ace"" get the point? <br/><br/>That's ""Casino""'s problem: problems come too early, we know it will be an infernal spiral until a bloody climax would purge out the bad blood, it's just a matter of time before it'll explode, before Sam beats the hell out of Ginger, before Nicky gets his comeuppance etc. Basically, ""Casino"" is about people wondering how they screwed up, while they had it coming from the start. It's about a situation with people being their own liabilities and the icing on the cake was the disturbing sex moment between Nicky and Ginger. I wouldn't care if ""Casino"" was at least a half-hour shorter, but it spans too much time on the 'problems' sequence, it gets redundant and annoying, too much shouting, arguing and of course narrating. Hell, at one point even Nicky's sidekick, Frank Vincent as the namesake Marino, started doing voice-over. The movie reached an extraordinary level of noisiness where even the soundtrack got in my nerves, the part with Ginger and Lester and the ""Can't Live if Living is Without You"" song was annoyance at its peak before Marty finally redeemed the film.<br/><br/>At the end, ""Casino"" finally reconciles with the idea that we're watching a Gangster film, and that all this mess must come to an end now, and all the protagonists of this tragicomedy must meet their maker, in the most gruesome way if possible. And I can't go on without mentioning that particularly gruesome and disturbing scene, where Nicky witnesses the death of his brother Dominick before receiving the same batting treatment from Marino and the gang. ""Billy Batts' revenge"" broke both Nicky's bones and my heart, and his crying followed by a bloody face half-breathing before covered by sand, will haunt me forever.<br/><br/>""Casino"" starts and ends with intensity, but in-between  well, it's like starting a Texas Holdem game, with a pair in your hands, expecting to win with two pairs, or a three of a kind, but at the end, you just win because all the players folded. Shorter would have been better with less style and more substance.<br/><br/>And that's that."

","To watch 'Casino' today is to be reminded of a time when Martin Scorcese made good films starring Robert de Niro instead of bad ones featuring Leonardo di Caprio. Casiso is a rollicking, rock and roll ride through the world of Las Vegas, brilliantly set against the sounds and colours of two decades. The effortless way Scorcese pulls this off (he uses a 1930s-style font for captions, and at times the strip appears as if drawn in pastels) is perhaps his last great cinematic achievement. But it's not quite a great film, too long for its length, too similar to his earlier 'Goodfellas', and, for all its horrific violence, just a little too smooth. The audience of 'Raging Bull' was allowed to feel what it was like to be Jake La Motta, at least as Scorcese imagined it. The audience of 'Casino' is merely told, the double-headed voice-over steering us through a story we are shown, but never allowed wholly inside of. Still, the abruptly unsentimental ending reminds us of the ruthless that all great directors must possess; and sadly, it's not a edge Scorcese seems to possess any more."

","Get Ready To Gamble with 'Casino', the 1995 Martin Scorsese directed classic. Scorsese brings a flick where his characters are cruel, intelligent, conniving & brutally violent. It's a roller-coaster ride, but it surely doesn't belong to the faint-hearted.<br/><br/>'Casino' is loosely based on Frank Rosenthal's life. Rostenthal was a professional sports bettor, former Las Vegas casino executive and organized crime associate, back in the 1970's. It's his devious, violent & mind-numbing journey that unfolds here.<br/><br/>'Casino' works because Scorsese doesn't fumble in any step. Sure, the length could've been trimmed, but the handling of the subject otherwise is top-notch. Scorsese is a limitless talent who has proved himself time and again. Scorsese goes down as a legend in films, for being, probably, the least conscious storyteller of his time!<br/><br/>Robert Richardson's Cinematography is stunning and captures all the moments with precision. Performance-Wise: Robert De Niro as Rostenthal, is Outstanding! Joe Pesci is bombastic, while James Woods has been wasted. But the person who steals the show and quite frankly is stunning, is Sharon Stone. As Mrs Rostenthal, she delivers a sensational performance that deserves the highest praises.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Casino' is not meant for the faint-hearted, At All. But those who can stomach such gore and abuse, I suggest, you check this one out soon! Two Thumbs Up!"

","This is a nice movie, and I think it is quite amazing that they made it from a non-fiction novel. De Niros acting is as always very good, and he interprets Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal very well as Sam Rothstein. The movie might be quite violent, but I feel this gives the movie a very realistic approach to the novel - and sadly the reality. It seems to have very little to do with http://www.bettingexpert.com/dk/casino - but even though Casino is a movie that affect you, it 's a feeling - the same way as you got a special feeling when entering a Casino. The movie is shot at Riviera Casino, Vegas - and gives a perfect setting for ""Tangiers"". Great movie and the soundtrack is wonderful, house of the rising sun always gives me the chills."

","Gargantuan epic(some critics and Scorsese fans considered it his ""failed epic"")about mob-run Las Vegas focusing on casino ""boss"" De Niro, his flashy junkie wife Sharon Stone, and volatile ""muscle"", Joe Pesci, how they had it all and squandered it due to their own faults and frailties. De Niro, without a legal license to run a casino, was able to run operations of a specific casino successfully with help from city commissioners, and, most importantly, major Midwest mobsters who skimmed from the ""counting room"" in order to allow him his opportunity to earn lots of money and live a life of luxury. Pesci was the mob's go-to-guy when they needed people whacked or kept in line, anyone who threatened to take from the mobsters what they considered theirs. Pesci is feared, but unstable and ill-tempered, and soon his presence in Las Vegas wasn't wanted, his criminal activities catching the attention of the police and FBI out to put him behind bars. Sharon Stone is alluring and attractive to De Niro, but she's involved with a lowlife pimp(played by James Woods)and unable to let him go. Stone has the looks and personality that benefits De Niro, helping him bring in the right kind of people to profit from in his casino. But her drug habits and alcoholism(not to mention, her inability to relinquish her love for Woods who is manipulating her to give him money behind De Niro's back)slowly over time ruin the marriage and this deterioration places her in the arms of Pesci! Scorsese's film is, as you'd expect, very detailed and the screenplay quite elaborate in the inner-working of the criminal enterprise ran by the mob who used wiseguys as their eyes and ears in Las Vegas. We see how De Niro and Pesci's personalities bring about their downfall, and Stone's addictions lead to a tragic conclusion. With all the money, clothes, and jewelry, Stone couldn't find happiness, agonizing in a joyless marriage to a man she never loved to start with. De Niro, as much as he was skilled at making money for his mobsters, couldn't help himself when it came to Stone and running such an efficient casino that he couldn't appease the city commissioner to allow his dumb-as-dirt brother-in-law(Joe Bob Briggs, inspired casting)a small position. Pesci's explosive, corrosive temperament, and unwillingness to play by the rules when it come to behaving in casinos, meant that he was doomed to eventually be discarded by his superiors. As was the case in GOODFELLAS, CASINO has startling scenes of brutal violence as the FBI get the pinch on a stupid mobster goon who gave up the names and subject matter of his people with the old-time gangsters setting in motion the executions of anyone who might rat them out. Watching the glamorous Stone unravel by film's end is disheartening and rather pitiable, going from elegant and stunning to washed-out and browbeaten, the drugs and booze turning her into a hobbling, malevolent, blabbering misfit. We see Pesci stab a man with a pen for cursing De Niro, shoot a woman while eating her supper, and bash poor Don Rickles across the face and skull with a telephone..it's not surprising what his character's outcome is. De Niro, though, because he's such a money-making machine, might escape a grim fate, although Scorsese opens the film with him in a car that blows up. Scorsese leans heavily on voice over narration from both De Niro and Pesci who explain the ways things were run in Las Vegas before the corporations took over. Clocking in at 3 hours, CASINO is certainly long-winded, and I'm not sure these are the kind of characters one wants to spend this amount of time with, but I found the story Scorsese brings to light compelling enough to withstand the entire journey."

","As a modern tragedy, 'Casino' is downright intoxicating. Every Martin Scorsese film is a wonderful gift, even the ever-so-slightly disappointing 'Shutter Island'.<br/><br/>'Casino' charts the rise and fall of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) who is assigned the task of running a Las Vegas casino. Things go decidedly pear-shaped when his friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) decides to join him in the gambling capital of the world. A real firebrand with a very short fuse, Nicky is violent and erratic and attracts too much negative attention. Soon things are spiralling dangerously out of control.<br/><br/>Sam courts and marries a beautiful hustler named Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone, in the performance of her career). But her surreptitious ongoing relationship with sleazy ex-boyfriend Lester Diamond (a wonderfully oleaginous performance by charismatic character actor James Woods) pushes Sam to the outer limits of his endurance.<br/><br/>Like 'Goodfellas', 'Casino' is based on the book by Nicholas Pileggi. And while 'Casino' does not reach the dizzying heights that 'Goodfellas' did, it is still well worth your time. Sharon Stone steals every scene she is in; casting her was a big risk - she was perceived as more of a sex symbol than a serious actress - and it paid huge dividends. She delivers a bravura performance and is a genuine pleasure to watch. As Nicky, Joe Pesci simmers with that deadly rage which made his character of Tommy DeVito in 'Goodfellas' so frightening and so electric to watch. And in a straight role, Don Rickles is very good as Billy Sherbert.<br/><br/>Clocking in at just under three hours in length, 'Casino' never feels overlong. And, once again, Scorsese fills the film with wonderful songs by artists such as Fleetwood Mac ('Go Your Own Way'), The Moody Blues ('Nights in White Satin'), and - of course - The Rolling Stones ('Long Long While' and 'Can't You Hear Me Knocking' (which opened the film 'Blow'). Lavish, violent, and almost operatic in its dramatic scope, 'Casino' is highly recommended."
"gavin6942","8","1","2","29 November 2010"," A Modern Gangster Film Brought to Epic Proportions
","In short, what happens when you get Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci together in a gangster film told by Martin Scorsese, and stretch it to three hours in length? Pretty much the greatest crime movie of all time. It has the look and feel of ""Goodfellas"", but focuses less on the mafia and more on one man's drive to get to the top and avoid the Feds (who at one point actually land in his yard when their spying helicopter runs out of gas).<br/><br/>The casting of Sharon Stone is a bit questionable. Not to say she did a bad job, but when you see who else all auditioned, it is odd that she pulled ahead. Stone is now more or less a relic of the 1990s. I would like to have seen Traci Lords or Melanie Griffith take the role of Ginger.<br/><br/>Scorsese pretty much never fails, and his track record with DeNiro is strong... this ranks as one of their best films together, no doubt."
"Polaris_DiB","6","1","2","27 August 2010"," Overstimulating Strip
","Scorsese follows up GoodFellas with a sort of variation on the theme, creating a similar structure but with different characterization and mood. Both GoodFellas and Casino tell a true story of mob activity in two parts, the rise to power and the inevitable downfall, featuring interwoven voice-over narration, pop music, and, well, Joe Pesci as short fuse to a bomb gone out of anybody's control. They contain different enough elements however that comparing them too closely can misconstrue the point of both; nevertheless, the similarities are there.<br/><br/>Casino immediately appeals with its Saul Bass opening titles, and then quickly keeps up the momentum with sharp cinematography glorying in the light and spectacle of the Las Vegas Strip. The Strip is a popular place for filmmakers to play with the light and imagery, and Scorsese is all over it with some amazingly striking and glorious compositions. On a purely visual level, this movie is more than worth the time to check out, and on that note may be better watched silently.<br/><br/>Because, the thing is, it's also very noisy. With almost never-ending voice over, constant music, and Sharon Stones superb but still harrowing performance of an overwrought junky falling into sheer hysterics, the very few and all too short moments of silence in this movie stand out for their sheer contrast, and end up being the high notes. It's a shame, too, because technically this is DeNiro's finest performance along the ""detached, cool, but cares"" mode, and he plays a genuinely likable character who wants to play it as straight as possible and knows how to make everyone happy--provided they actually listen to him, which of course they don't, and provided that nothing goes wrong, which of course they do.<br/><br/>There's so much to like individually about the film that it is hard to criticize it as a whole. Each individual scene works on its own level, most of them involving DeNiro and Stone as they work through their relationship (one of the most heartwarming moments when he proposes to her, and one of the most heartbreaking moments when he discovers their daughter tied up), the storytelling is sharp, and the visuals straight up eyecandy, but Scorsese still overdoes it in all marks, creating an overwhelming and mostly overstimulating project out of the whole. Form following function? Technically the Strip is one of the world's most famous realms of fully immersive virtual reality, along with New York Times Square, the Mall of the Emiratis in Dubai, and too many places in Tokyo to name. However, that not being a thematic point of Scorsese's movie at all, it doesn't really help the fact that he could have used a little reserve letting the individual pieces work on their own without distracting them from one another by layering them over each other.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","Goodfellas and Casino are amongst my top 10 films of all time. Set in decadent yet trashy Las Vegas, Robert De Niro manages a casino and falls in love with Sharon Stone. Life is good, but the past soon catches up with you and endings aren't always happy. De Niro plays an outstanding performance, as does Pesci, these two really work well together and Sharon Stone also holds her own. The film successfully pulls you right into their world and you will be immersed in it. Scorcese is the master of this genre, and rightly so. Excellent story-line and a superb cast, directed by the Godfather of mob films - it simply ticks every box. I've watched it many times and NEVER tire of it. A must see."
"tbills2","10","1","2","21 June 2010"," How can you watch this film and not think it's brilliant?
","Casino is an absolute masterpiece. It is easily one of the very best movies ever, but ya it is no Goodfellas, so i guess it stinks. If Casino was titled Goodfellas 2, then I could understand the critiques, but it is a totally different movie, err. None of them make any sense. Every reason I have read that supposedly makes this movie bad is something that doesn't even factor in to whether a movie is good or not. Too much violence - first off, Casino is not excessively violent. The things that happen are but it's obviously not so severe that it's too repulsive to bare or anything close (same goes for Goodfellas). That's nonsense, just like all the other excuses. I am still waiting for one reason to why Casino is not a 4-star, all-time classic movie. I can understand how some can watch it and perceive that it's boring, but you have to listen...there's so much going on. So much depth to the characters. And Scorsese is a genius with editing and directing a film. Casino is an unstoppable movie. It's easily cemented into my top 10. It is one of the most underrated movies with a 3 out of 4 star rating; that is an insult to this masterful film. What are you guys seeing? Nothing is wrong with it. Every scene is powerful. Way to go Scorcese. You give us another cinema classic, and get no love. This movie should be top 20 in the Top250 list, a perfect 10 outta 10.<br/><br/>Brilliant depth in the acting and writing, great pace, great soundtrack, great storytelling, a superb attention to detail, natural dialogue, and top-notch directing."
"nixskits","9","1","2","6 December 2009"," How the West was lost
","It really annoys me that this great film can never get it's own identity in the popular mind. Too many simplistic comparisons to ""Goodfellas"", probably made by boneheads who think imitating Joe Pesci's, ""How am I funny?"" line is amusing, when the only person who should ever say that again is Mr. Pesci himself. ""Casino"" is a very different film in it's gut than it's country cousin from the East coast. And it's also based on another awesome book by Nicholas Pileggi.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese lights another bunch of movie dynamite with this shotgun blast to the face of a flick. My minor issue is with who's playing Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (based on Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal). Don't get me wrong, I think Robert De Niro is fabulous in the part. But if I were casting this, I would have selected Gary Sinise for the role. Anyway, De Niro is at the top of his game again, this odds making genius a drastic departure from his Jimmy in ""Goodfellas"", who was a homicidal thief and nowhere near as brilliant as this figure who mastered the art of staying out of trouble, until his wife and best friend ruin it all.<br/><br/>Nicky, the thug Pesci plays here (based on Tony ""the Ant"" Spilotro), is different from Tommy, which earned him an Oscar (and Mr. P gave a short and sweet, ""It's my privilege, thank you!"" speech, letting us see not all prize winning performers have to spend an eternity on stage, thanking the whole world!). Tommy was ashamed his brother testified against certain people you don't rat on if you want to live in Brooklyn much longer. That inspired the spark plug of ""Goodfellas"" to be the craziest, most vicious killer of the whole bunch. His role in ""Casino"" is slightly more subtle and for much different reasons. Tommy never would sleep with his friend's wife, like the Vegas bound troublemaker from Chicago that he plays here does.<br/><br/>A very insidious kind of betrayal takes place with Ace's future wife, Ginger, Sharon Stone's relentless hustler. This woman lets us see the hollow shell her character really is. After taking all she can from anybody she can, this creature runs off to her scumbag pimp Lester, played by the great James Woods, giving him her money and love, not realizing or being lucid enough to care he's the ultimate parasite. Sam can brush off Lester easily. His protector from the windy city who comes to the desert and screws up what should have been their paradise is another matter.<br/><br/>Pesci shows this wise guy Nicky is his own worst enemy and everything he touches turns to hell. Tommy would have kept a modicum of common sense and loyalty to his buddy, not wanting all that money, power and success to blow away like so much dust in the Nevada wind."
"dking1583","8","1","2","18 August 2009"," Movie Review: Casino (1995)
","Martin Scorsese's Casino isn't as polished as his previous mafia masterpiece Goodfellas, but it is, nevertheless, another extraordinary entry into the director's astonishing body of work. Relying heavily on voice-over narration from both of its stars, the movie is a little sluggish in spots, making its running time of 178 minutes its most glaring flaw. However, the captivating performances of the three lead performers and the unrelenting violence overshadow enough of the film's minor flaws to make for a gritty, realistic experience of life in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Scorsese regular Robert De Niro stars as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a gambling perfectionist who is hired by the Chicago Mob to run the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. Joe Pesci, in another psychopathic performance, co-stars as Rothstein's longtime friend Nicky Santoro, who is also sent to Vegas by the Chicago boys to keep the peace. After a very successful start in Vegas, Rothstein meets, and eventually marries, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone).<br/><br/>Ace starts his inevitable decline just about the time he convinces Ginger to marry him. Ginger isn't totally committed, and is in fact still seeing an old pimp (James Woods), while Ace is forced to trust Ginger with his life. This turns out to be his critical mistake as Ginger spends his money about as quickly as Ace steals the cash.<br/><br/>While dealing with the Ginger fiasco, Ace also has to deal with his hot- head friend Nicky. By consistently cheating in the casino, Nicky puts himself in danger of not only being black booked, but also of tarnishing Ace's name. The friendship of the two men eventually decline over time as the power of greed effortlessly stars to control their lives.<br/><br/>I cannot say enough about these three lead performances. Pesci gives a performance that is on par, if not better, than his Oscar-winning turn in Goodfellas. De Niro gives another controlled, almost mechanical performance. Even though it seems so effortless for him, the audience is still captivated. And then there is Sharon Stone playing the former call girl, drug-addict wife of a crooked casino manager. It a loaded character, and a loaded performance, but they come together perfectly.<br/><br/>So much of the movie is built on the scenes of confrontation between the main characters, and they are done to perfection. The movie is about greed, lying, deceit, and double-crossing the people you are closest to. There are bound to be multiple scenes of altercation, and if they weren't done right, the movie would've lost a lot of steam. One scene in particular comes to mind of an argument between Ace and Nicky. The scene I'm thinking of features Pesci in a polished suit and De Niro in a striped robe (his wardrobe is unbelievable in the film – in a good way), and I was in disbelief while watching the quarrel. The scene had to go on for about five minutes, and I'm sure a lot of the dialogue was improvised. The two actors, reminiscent of their roles in Goodfellas, are so perfectly cast that this brilliant scene seems so natural.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with moments that remind us how polished of a filmmaker Scorsese is, and how polished his lead actors are. Some might argue that the main flaw of this movie is that it is almost a recreation of GoodfellasWell, there is some truth to that, but that doesn't mean that after I finished this film I wasn't wishing for more of the same."
"DylansFearFiles","10","1","2","9 August 2009"," Another Triumph of Martin Scorsese
","I have always been fascinated by the Mafia underworld and I have admired Martin Scorsese's work since a young age. Scorsese has brought us several good gangland films, like Goodfellas in 1990 and The Departed in 2006. In between the two, he brought us Casino in 1995.<br/><br/>Casino tells the story of Frank Rosenthal (Portayed by Robert De Niro under the name ""Sam Rothstein"") and Anthony Spilotro (Portrayed by Joe Pesci under the name of ""Nicky Santoro). The film's subject is the 1970s casino skimming the mid-western Mafia families built an empire on. The movie is basically about two hoods from Chicago who get to the top of the world, only to be dragged back to the ground.<br/><br/>The film is a first person narrative, much like Goodfellas. It is told from Nicky Santoro and Sam Rothstein's perspectives. One of the many attracting factors is that the film is Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote the novel of Casino and the novel of Goodfellas as well as being involved with both screenplays and Martin Scorsese, who directed, also wrote. The result of these two geniuses in their fields working together was a great script.<br/><br/>The performances were also great. I believe Sharon Stone was nominating for an Oscar for her portrayal of Ginger McKenna (based on Geri McGee-Rosenthal), Sam's greedy wife. Joe Pesci, playing a similar role to what he did in Goodfellas, comes back with a vengeance as a brutal Mafia hit-man. And of course, Robert De Niro is great lead (as always), as the smart and cool Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein. The film also has a great supporting cast, including Don Rickles and Frank Vincent.<br/><br/>All in all, Casino is a great movie. The movie is not as good as Goodfellas, but almost reaches the point to being just as good. I enjoyed both of them.<br/><br/>10/10"

","In 1990, Martin Scorsese unleashed Nicholas Pileggi's hard boiled docu book to the cinema. After viewing it for the first time, I knew than and I am still confident today in 2009, Goodfellas is one of the finest motion pictures that will ever be made, let alone the best gangster movie of them all.<br/><br/>Having read the Pileggi book prior to seeing the film, I was surprised how well the writer and director translated the source material. Casino is probably the best Vegas movie you'll see. I'd call Fear and Loathing a close second. Leaving Las Vegas, to me, was well acted, but boring and overly ""arty.""<br/><br/>So yeah Casino is a slick piece of craft. Slick cinematography, slick design, slick acting. But the heart and soul we'd find in Goodfellas is clearly missing from this take. The mechanisms of greed, the procedures of skimming are fascinatingly and warmly documented here, but the people are just not very interesting. There is a good 45 minutes of human drama about humans we don't give a shi*t about.<br/><br/>But the good in Casino is so good, we forget about the thin characterizations. We forget its too long, we forget, at least a little, Sharon Stone is the only miscast part. Sure its got a few spots, but this one is still pretty bright to watch, even nearly 15 years on. <br/><br/>You have to hand it to Scorsese. Even his crappy movies are damned good."

I like the part where the crew tortures one of the cheaters with the ball peen hammer to his hand. Joe Pesci is always at his best at playing a hot-headed ruffian. He seems to be the kind of person who don't tolerate disrespect. He takes out anyone, at anytime, anywhere. He's the problem solver so to say. Both DeNiro and Pesci are back as a team again since ""Goodfellas"", only this time it's mob free. However, Pesci's character is a lot shadier. So when he gets cut off, he goes berserk and tries to off him. He had to learn the hard way, on who his ""friends"" were when he and his brother were taken out in the cornfield and was whacked.

","Scorsese's phenomenal 'Casino' follows the same type of storytelling as his 'Goodfellas'. The director has the reputation of having his unique style and paying attention to every detail of film-making. 'Casino' sort of follows a documentary style voiced over by De Niro's Sam and Pesci's Nicky. Based on true events, the film mainly focuses on bookie Rothstein, his marriage with the gorgeous crackwhore/con-artist Ginger and his friendship with unstable nutjob Nicky.<br/><br/>The movie follows a smooth pace with excellent cinematography, effective visuals, slick editing and a fantastic soundtrack where the songs contribute to the storytelling. The film is longer than the usual two hour length general viewers are used to but I was hooked to the screen from start to finish. There was something so captivating about the glamorous, seductive and deadly world that Scorsese creates on screen.<br/><br/>Scorsese's regulars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are in top form. Sharon Stone perhaps delivers her career best in one of the most complex roles in a Scorese film. The supporting cast is solid.<br/><br/>'Casino' is no doubt one of Martin Scorsese's best and my favourite Scorsese film. I don't remember how many times I have watched it but recently I revisited it after about 10 years and it still seems to have the same effect on me as it did during first viewing."
"Lucabrasisleeps","9","1","2","1 January 2009"," Fascinating movie yet a bit too long
","So I have to admit Martin Scorcese hasn't disappointed me yet. After having seen Taxi driver, Raging Bull(two of my favourites) and Goodfellas, I began to watch Casino expecting to be disappointed(because it can't surely be as good as the three I mentioned!). But it is quite impressive. <br/><br/>The basic plot line is about a man named Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein(Robert de niro) who is put in charge of managing a profitable casino, one of the biggest in Las Vegas.Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci) is sent along with him to Las Vegas in order to protect him. Sharon Stone also stars as a woman named Ginger whom Sam later marries. The movie first details the intricacies of the casino business and the fake unlikeable nature of the people there. It then details the fall of Ace Rothstein and his buddies. I was quite surprised with the detailed description of the casino business. This is something that I had not expected(I had expected a straight forward gangster story and instead I get a fascinating portrayal of the casino business. I was enthralled by the working of the casinos(maybe sometime I have to travel to Las Vegas!). Any person interested in the gambling business and the crime network in US should watch this movie. It is interesting to watch the way these casino owners ""skim the top of the profits"" and masquerade it under the legitimate business banner. Another aspect that I liked about this movie is the totally unlikeable characters. Only Raging Bull(of scorcese movies) has this kind of a unlikeability and most people are likely to be turned off by that. I do agree it has shades of Goodfellas but I don't agree that it imitates that movie. There are many differences in the characters themselves. For example, the character of Nicky Santoro is quite different from Tommy of Goodfellas. Nicky is a cold, calculated person who doesn't mind doing the dirty work. But he isn't exactly egoistic or impulsive. He is mostly level headed. Sure he resorts to violence in the same way as Tommy but Tommy had different motives. Nicky is quite clever and not impulsive. <br/><br/>The performances are quite noteworthy. I was most impressed by Sharon stone's portrayal of the gold digger Ginger. It was a multifaceted performance that showed the different sides to Ginger in this movie(It is weird we don't see much of Sharon stone nowadays, she had so much promise). Ginger is not just greedy, she has a sensitive side, she has weaknesses, she is just human. She is not portrayed as any worse than the rest of the cast. Most of the time we don't sympathize with the main characters because they are so unlikeable. Robert De Niro's performance as Sam Rothstein is quite good and he excels in the scenes where he is totally clueless and exasperated as to how to handle his wife. His contrast to the cool and calm type of character in the first half of the movie is noticeable and that adds to the excellence of his performance. Joe Pesci(he is fast becoming one of my favourite actors) is quite exceptional in this. The scene where he confronts Ace is an example. <br/><br/>One of the things that may trouble viewers a bit is the complexity of the plot. There are many characters and incidents and sometimes people may not be able to keep track. But I loved the complexity aspect and it just reflects the amount of hard work put in by Martin scorcese and the crew. <br/><br/>So what is the negative aspect? It might be the length. It is too long(even for a Scorcese epic) and it might be a bit too much for some people who are not used to such long movies. I don't mind long movies but I feel the length could have been shortened. But I don't understand which can be removed as almost all scenes are central to the character development. <br/><br/>My rating 9/10(the length is somewhat of a problem)"

","once again ""great martin Scorsese"" is teaming up with Robert DE niro and Joe pesci to undertake another gangster movie which is superb considering its acting, screenplay and especially the choices of clothes for de niro as the manager of a casino which is particularly dazzling and makes you wonder throughout the film. the story is quoted by its protagonist (de niro)about ups and downs of running a casino and issues happening in and around it, his friendships and relationships with behind-the-scenes heads of las Vegas along with his private and so called romantic life with his insatiable wife (sharon stone)and her thirst for more wealth and fame. the movie is mostly shot indoors and gives you some real good ideas of how las Vegas is actually run."
"shadowman123","8","1","2","22 January 2008"," An amazing film!
","I had bought my-self a copy of Casino a while back ago but never did get round to watching it, however on Sunday I did as I thought I would keep up with my gangster movie phase I am going through, however unfortunately whilst watching it , my disc messed up and I got annoyed as anything (never purchase second hand DVD's). However the very next morning I got up and went to my local rental shop and watched it. All I can say is - WOW!, I mean I thought Goodfella's once probably Scorces's best work but I can probably say he has topped that with this beaut! No one is truly a fan of the gangster genre without paying homage to this. This movie had all the ingredients to keep to make a recipe for disaster and Scorecse just brighten's it up for us which keeps us hooked. The most funny I found about this movie was that Robert De Niro reminds me of my own ex-boss, his constant nagging and micro-management of everything might seem good to others , but then to the rest of us he just seemed like a control freak and all round ass hole. But I guess thats what keeps you in tune with the character because no matter how much we hate it ranting and raving we all know the stuff he is saying is true and oddly enough I thought to my-self thats what really matters in the movie. Joe Pesci was just nothing short of brilliant, I felt that this time he was let of the leash big time and he did provide a lot of the entertainment especially with his 21 F-U rant in just 2 mins! Sharon Stone was brilliant , normally in gangster movies I have noted that the women are either there for eye candy or their presence in the movie is not of a an big or major significance but I was glad to think that it did not happen over here as her performance is note worthy! Scorcese's makes Casino a pseudo-documentary with his clever use of commentary telling us what we all ready know about Vegas but with its use of colours, lights , music and glitz and glamour one is taken in by its hedonism and it because easy to understand how someone got taken into this world of lust,power and deception and greed. Nearly everything I have covered is probably covered in all the other the comments that people have posted on here...but the reason behind is that it is all true . To conclude Casino should be on every film geeks '100 movies to watch before I die list'. The only problem I had was that a few moments in it were a little bit long which made it drag and it is a long movie so do have a clear mind when you watch it.<br/><br/>CASINO - 8.8 OUT OF 10 <br/><br/>You Don't Stay At The Top Forever..."
"jintrieri","10","1","2","19 January 2008"," My Favorite Movie
","Casino is my favorite movie of all time. It captures the glamor of Las Vegas and its films like these that I yearn to go. The film is about how the mob controlled Las Vegas and how at the end it brought them down at the end. This movie is in a way like Goodfellas in that is was directed by Martin Scorsese, based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi who also wrote the screenplay, has Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent and is about rise and fall in the mob. I think its better than Goodfellas even though Goodfellas is also amazing and would be my 2nd favorite film. Casino is so great. It has a colorful feel to it and shows the wealth in it. The performances are unbelievable. Robert De Niro is great as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein the head of the casino. Joe Pesci is absolutely amazing as Nicky Santoro the psychopath who is sent to protect Sam. Sharon Stone is in a career best performance as Rothsteins wife. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and Scorsese's best. Casino is my favorite movie and Scorese's best."
"Andyeightyseven","10","1","2","9 January 2008"," Best Scorsese Film?
","In typical gangster films what is the common theme and emotion that you get from them? the answer is you tend to not feel to much emotion towards the gangsters actions however Casino is much different I Felt so angry, upset and so sorry for Bob Deniro in this as his role played to perfection as always. Did anyone else wanna go into the film and beat the s*** out of Sharon Stone ha ha. Thats exactly what i am trying to get at. The acting is on another level, so amazing that These emotions were brought out by the audience watching! Sharon Stone's Excellent performance as Ginger i thought stole the show. A straight up lovable hustler turned drug addict. Stone not only en captivates the role and fits the image, she also nails what i think, is the best performance of her career.<br/><br/>Robert Deniro as Sam Rothstein once again consistency is the true mark of a great actor and Deniro nails this role to a tee as always. I see Sam as the Good guy of the movie! A good man who just wants a quiet life we as the audience feel compassion towards him throughout and i sense of sorriness as he loses all of his riches Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro amazing as always in this film i see him as the Lovable character, the moments of comedy, the vicious streak all together make such a great personality This film could be Scorsese's best however many opinions will fly around and at the end of the day it becomes hard to say which is his best Casino 10/10"

","This film is yet another one of Martin Scorsese's gangster masterpieces that went platinum. The delivered performance by the actors, the perfect shooting locations and the wonderful directing by Scorsese makes it a true Oscar dramatic film. Robert De Niro portrays Sam ""Ace"" Rosthein, a powerful casino owner determined to run his Tangiers casino as smoothly as possible. He meets Ginger McKenna, a passionate high roller whom he gets infatuated with at first sight and is also faced with a threat; Nicky Santoro, his childhood friend and a violent man.

Slowly, bit by bit, the mob starts to fall apart and the FBI gets aware of everything that goes on. A brilliant film based on a true story. Sharon Stone won a Golden Globe for best actress.

"Uncreative_Fame","Null","1","2","12 November 2007"," The best movie ever made by Martin Scorcese in the mid-1990's about Las Vegas
","That is an undeniable fact. Unless he made some other movie about Las Vegas around the same time that his name wasn't attached to. Like Leaving Las Vegas, or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, or Vegas Vacation. Even some dull video for the city to attract tourists would have been an improvement.<br/><br/>Imagine Goodfellas without Ray Liotta and his oddly charming narration. You'll end up with something like this. Basically a remake minus the only interesting character. It'd be like making Pirates with just Orlando Bloom and that anorexic girl and her freakishly long neck. EAT SOMETHING! Wear shoulder pads too. Every time I see the end of that movie where she's standing way up over the rocks it looks like her head is going to fall right off that skinny neck of hers. I just can't watch it. And I can't watch this either, but that's not her fault. It's just two guys doing the same thing they've done a million times before sleepwalking for 3 hours so they can pick up an easy paycheck while that guy with the big eyebrows sits back and tells them to hurry up and get it over with so he can ditch them and start a new life with Leonardo DiCaprio. And who can blame him. Leo is younger and much more handsome."
"sc-100","9","1","2","17 October 2007"," Review
","I recently won a copy of this movie from www.getminted.com - I had seen it years ago at the movies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Casino will inevitably bear comparison with Goodfellas, so it only makes nine stars in my humble opinion. The reason this is especially true when De Niro and Pesci are ideally placed for comparison between both movies and they were better in Goodfellas.<br/><br/>With this in mind, the acting is generally excellent even though the characters are pretty unlovable ones.<br/><br/>No one in the entire story has any good qualities to speak of, which tends to distance the audience from them.<br/><br/>The story itself is weak and a tad extended, stretching (as it does) a 2-hour story into a 3-hour epic."
"kt3234-1","9","1","2","13 February 2007"," Excellent. A brilliant force of words, music and feelings
","Scorsese knows how to make an interesting movie. What's great about Casino is how real the violence and emotions of the characters are. First is the acting. Sharon Stone gives a terrific performance and Ginger, the out of control don't-you-know-she'll-be-trouble-girl. Robert DeNiro as Ace is also a very wise choice, because DeNiro can play the complete opposite of his character in Goodfellas. Jimmy in Goodfellas was a strong and intimidating man, while Ace is always hiding behind Nicky. Speaking of Nicky, Joe Pesci gives, I think, an even better performance than in Goodfellas. His character doesn't look like much, but his acting makes him so much bigger. Also, the chemistry between the three is outstanding. For example, when Ace confronts Ginger after they leave the restaurant. You see Ace's absolute disgust of Ginger. And, when Nicky and Ace meet. Joe Pesci doesn't give 'forced anger' like so many other actors. The viewer feels like they are watching their conversation.<br/><br/>Next, the story. Pileggi and Scorsese really tap into life in the Mafia. We see what really happened during those times, and how corrupt the whole system was. We also see how the mob dealt with its problems. Through violence.<br/><br/>Next, the violence. Scorsese shows us the twisted way the mob dealt with its problems. The torture scene is incredible. I found myself disgusted with it, but at the same time, I couldn't look away. Scorsese knows how to draw the viewer in. We may not like what we see, but we are attracted to it anyway.<br/><br/>And finally, the music. The music really fits with the mood of the scene. The 'I can't get no satisfaction' song goes perfect with the confrontation between Ace and Ginger after they leave the restaurant. The music is basically telling the story for us. Ace 'can't get no satisfaction.'<br/><br/>Truly a wonderful film. Scorsese creates another visual masterpiece for the ages. 9/10"

","What can you expect when Rob Deniro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone, James Woods and Martin Scorsese put their heads together to make something for the viewers? Right, a masterpiece. Flawless, beautiful, bad ... brilliant is what Casino is. Las Vegas, the late Seventies, early Eighties, a place in the middle of nowhere set up only to make money for the big bosses and the fast hustlers. Just like Deniro puts it: the players don't stand a chance. Of course with lots of money comes lots of trouble ... and lots of killing. Joe Pesci is Nicky Santorro, a rough-and-ready but nevertheless smart bully with his own gang ready to hit the jackpot in Vegas by robbing from every booky he can get his hands on and stealing jewelery from the rich gamblers. Paragraphs of words that you wouldn't say in the presence of your parents come and go like little children in a candy store. It's the dialogues and the way they are thrown in your face that makes this movie so impressive, really. If you you like strong dialogues, genius and hysterical acting and are totally in for the maffia way of life on screen then you should get a hold of this one because you will be blown away, I guarantee you. Goodfellas was fantastic, but in my opinion this one is even better."
"bigr4prez","10","1","2","27 December 2006"," This is Vegas when Vegas was still Vegas
","This movie portrays Vegas the way it was back in the day. Great acting job by the whole cast, being born and raised in Vegas and having a dad on the police force who has told me stories of the way Vegas was really ran I know this story is as close to reality as you can get. Granted the Tangier's casino in the movie was actually the stardust that still stands to this day right next to the frontier hotel and casino, which is now considered a slow part of the las Vegas strip. If you love mafia movies at all or are just interested in what made Las Vegas more than just a desert I suggest you watch this movie because it is based upon an era that may no longer exist. I also suggest people who may want to come to Vegas just to gamble, watch this movie because Deniro say's it best when I quote ""we always find a way to get it back"" end quote."
"johnnyboyz","7","1","2","15 November 2006"," Although it shouldn't take 2 hours and 51 minutes to tell a good story, Scorsese manages to draw us in.
","By 1995, Martin Scorsese had well and truly etched his name into the film making book and Casino is really just a cherry on the icing which was already on the cake; this means it's not a bad thing but just feels unnecessary. Whilst this film took me two sittings to get through (I had to cut it off with about 40 minutes remaining the first time I sat down to watch it), I can still see why it's gained a somewhat cult status amongst the masses.<br/><br/>What's good about 'Casino' is its energy and vibrancy. The film is very colourful and attractive and it sucks the viewer into its world with several brilliant voice-overs that are informative and dark yet often funny. This is twinned with some brilliant use of colour giving us stone wall proof that cars don't just have to be metallic dark green or blue; jackets don't have to be grey Armani's or pinstripe suits  (they can be pale red!?) and that walls and buildings can be splashed with every colour of the rainbow and still look moderately average. Everybody has a favourite colour and so, when the viewer is drawn into the world giving the feeling you're actually there, sitting in the bars opposite the characters, walking and talking with the croupiers and gambling with the rest of them; it feels like there is something there for you  everyone, in fact and the colours act as a focal point as you map onto various items, objects, props and costume that bear your familiar favourite shade, making things easy on the gaze. This is how Casino's early attempt at drawing you in works.<br/><br/>Although the film stays in the exact same gear for at least thirty minutes and the voice-overs (which you think will depart once the scene is set) remain, you can ignore it in a certain sense. There is that nagging sensation, however, that the whole opening is just a watered down back-story  explaining what happened in the first film, making 'Casino' actually feel like a sequel rather than a new, fresh film in itself.<br/><br/>What's also odd is the fact that a lot of scenes just feel unnecessary. Pesci's character's dialogue scenes and twitchiness can only feel genuine and spookily evil for so many times and the results from his mounting relationship with a female character can be seen coming from quite a mile away. Although they feel out of place, the scenes are still entertaining enough  especially for the viewer who wants to see Pesci pile on his evil, bad-guy, 'wise-guy' caricature that he's been made famous for over the years. It's these things that bulk up the running time, frustratingly.<br/><br/>What really grabbed the film by the scruff was the whole plot point that catapulted it into its final third. Without giving anything away, I'll mention one word: 'corruption' that involves (in some crazy way) absolutely everyone. And, as the final third reaches its, and the films, climax; there seem to be several twists and flips of the coin that involve characters floating here and then to there and then back again and then to where they were two stages ago..and so on. This was very annoying and was a disappointing, messy way to finish the film. It concludes, then re-opens and then concludes again before partly opening it back up before finally allowing the equilibrium to catch up with itself.<br/><br/>Although brave, bold and energetic; 'Casino' ultimately felt like an excuse to pool together a couple of big name Hollywood actors, actresses and a director just to make another gangster film that everybody will probably love. If you want a film like this one but better, try Wayne Kramer's 2003 film 'The Cooler'. At least that's not as ridiculously long."

","I like casino, even though I am not a great fan of any of its principal players (De Niro, Pesci or Stone). The film is good in places, drawn out in others and sometimes just takes my breath away.<br/><br/>However, my lasting memory is the killing of Nick and Frankie by the mob, to the tune of The Animals' House of the rising sun still stuns and shocks me. Even though you see it coming, the end result is graphic, simple and well acted, even to the point where the hoods get exhausted from the beatings they administer.<br/><br/>I sit there, watching this scene and I wonder what, apart from the baseball bats, would be going through their minds, especially Nick knowing that his brother is going to be killed and he will soon join him.

"JaysonT","9","1","2","18 October 2006"," An epic vision from Scorsese
","""Casino"" is a three hour look into 1970s Las Vegas, and how the Mob once held vicious control over how it operated. Robert De Niro, in one of his finest performances, plays a well-to-do perfectionist whose obligation is to get things done right. A superman for running his Casino, his kryptonite is Sharon Stone. She's a sultry casino hustler who makes her way in big bills by making sure all the ""insiders"" are taken care of. De Niro is in love, but she warns him she doesn't love him, but still agrees to marry him. There's also Joe Pesci, playing a loud-mouthed, violent buddy of De Niro's, who will jump on anyone who makes him feel threatened.<br/><br/>All in all ""Casino"" is a terrific ride, and also very long. One is of course, reminded of ""GoodFellas"", because Pesci plays basically the same role he played there. And of course there's all the violence and destruction, but we like this. For three hours, I was never bored. I was aware how long I had been sitting, but I never found myself tapping my fingers. Scorsese knows how to keep his audience intrigued, and this is a good thing at 180 minutes.<br/><br/>Then there is Sharon Stone. I must say I was very surprised with her performance. She is over-the-top in many scenes, but her character is initially an annoying child. So this is how she is supposed to play it. Trust me if you don't think Stone can play it cool, watch ""Basic Instinct"" again. Although she never has had a very impressive career, she has had her share of good roles (Along with ""Casino"" and ""Basic Instinct"", watch her in ""Total Recall"", ""Last Dance"" and ""Gloria""). She earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, and deservedly so. I think her performance is astonishing, and definitely puts ""Casino"" into a higher league then it would have been had it not had her in it."

","Casino is one of the greatest movies in film history and a genuine modern work of art. I don't say that lightly, as there are a lot of great movies and mankind has done a lot of amazing things for us in the past 100 years, but Casino really is one of those movies that you would like to think every other movie since its release should try and live up to in terms of quality. The performance out of Sharon Stone is just amazing, Scorsese uses her to her best and you really feel that any other movie Sharon Stone has done just might have been wasting her true talents. Of course Scorsese is the real talent here and Casino is way up there with Goodfellas (although not as good as Goodfellas, but the fact that Casino is still one of the great movies of our time is just a testament to Scorsese's skills.<br/><br/>Of course this is an R rated movie, it has liberal use of violence, language and drug use, so it is not one for your kids. But even though it has a lot of violence and such, not once did I feel I was offended, only that I was experiencing the movie exactly as Scorsese intended it. And I think it's safe to say that he intended it to be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>You could point out a billion technical faults with Casino, but I would never see anything wrong with it. Although I don't feel it does it justice, as it seems many critics are happy to give full marks to any old movie, I give Casino an honest 10 out of 10, five stars and a highly recommended tag."

","A look at how Las Vegas went from and Eden for organized crime syndicates to a family orientated attraction as it is now. All seen through the eyes of casino manager Ace Rothstein and his closest associates.<br/><br/>Scorsese's previous mob world film ""Goodfellas"" was about small time gangsters, but this film is about the big fish. The top of the criminal underworld food chain. That even makes this film even more fascinating to see how Mob operations are run, where they get their dough, and just how ruthless and self-serving people can be. Martin Scorsese and Co, with this film, deliver an epic crime tale of deceit, corruption, betrayal, told with a great attention to detail of the story and characters involved.<br/><br/>The only downside is that it might feel like a little bit of a re-run from ""Goodfellas"" since the key players are not only the same actors, but playing similar characters. However, overall this is a great film its own right and one of the best crime dramas ever made. 9/10<br/><br/>Rated R: strong violence, brutality, and strong profanity"

But i just think this a classic , truthful tale of power and greed and i don't think it is like Goodfellas, despite what people think. Every movie with gangsters in it will have the same kind of characters because that is the characters the mob is filled with, smart ones, raging bulls, good earners etc. There is a Nickey character in every mob, a hard raging machine that you just don't mess with because he will fly off the handle, their is someone like his boss Remo who seems calm and cool but was the most important man in the mob and he just needs to push a button and thats it lights out, then there are good earners like Ace who may not be Italian and cant be made, but they are around because they are useful and smart and great at making money for them.

","when i was 15 years old my aunt Lisa had a garage sale and gave me this when no one bought it from her collection. along with a new reclining bed. at first i only put this movie in out of boredom because i rarely have ever seen a movie that accurately portrays the realism that a mob film demands. so there i was on a Saturday night and i put this movie in and started watching it. the opening scene where ace walks out of the casino and heads to his car, and suddenly as his words ring out ""when you love someone, you've gotta trust them there's no other way. you've got to give them the key to everything thats yours. otherwise whats the point...and for a while...thats the kind of love i thought i had."" then his car explodes as he turns the ignition. then as he falls in a bottomless pit and a dramatic opening scene hooks you with a yearning to see more i was hooked in the first five minutes to see more. <br/><br/>i sat and watched as the film unveiled itself. to say the least this film like a fellow commentator of this film said should be in the top 250 films of all time. in fact I'm amazed this film isn't in the top ten. it wasn't the unedited brutal violence that made this film, it wasn't the accurate facts and great visual affects alone. it was the skill of its leading offensive line of Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone. to say the least without them this film would have never gotten the credit it so dramatically deserves. <br/><br/>the character of Robert De Niro, Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein although a somewhat flamboyant character made you want to be him. a man of skill, intelligence, a boss of an ever growing casino, and a wealthy ladies man. this character in my opinion would have been a complete disgrace without the unchallenged skills of the lead man who so brilliantly portrayed him. Ace was a hell of a fun character to see. as the film evolves you see a lot of drama in the world of ace and it goes from great to good to bad to worse and Robert De Niro rolls with the punches and fights fire with fire like no other actor i know of could have done. not since The Deer hunter has De Niro starred in a film that captured my emotion on such a scale. an absolutely brilliant character played by an absolutely brilliant actor. <br/><br/>the character of Nicky Santoro being a quite versatile role required someone who could be sensitive, funny, bold, brilliant, scary, intimidating, and admired in the same character. well they cast the best choice for my money when they cast Joe Pesci. aside from the brutal heartless side of him that comes out when someone interferes with him or his job he was an admirable character. someone who could do what it takes to get the job done while at the same time being a good friend to Ace and also having a wife and a son. its not easy being such a serious character I'm sure but only Joe Pearce would know how challenging it was to tackle this role. when someone told his friend to stick a pen up his A**, well let me tell you he didn't have one shred of decency in his character. he took the pen and stabbed the man at least three dozen times. such a moving character, who has a popular restaurant of his own where he was in some eyes more famous than the famous people there had so many traits that were evolved in this film. hands down this role was handled beautifully and masterfully by the skills of Joe Pesci who in my opinion is the best choice for such a serious mob role. <br/><br/>Sharon stone takes her role as the money obsessed, drug addicted, alcoholic, whore Ginger. she only cared about money and a boyfriend who took it from her. for some reason even when Ace proposed she was still tied to that loser lowlife pimp who ran her life. in the film she even tries to finance his bullshit by taking Aces money. when Ace finds out you almost wish he had killed both of them. because when the good pl' boys beat him down and leave him in a mess in his car ginger cries and sobs like he didn't deserve what came to him. tell me honestly do you think you would deserve getting beaten by three men at once for sneaking around with the wife of a casino boss with mob ties, then trying to take 25,000 dollars of his money. well you decide for yourself. <br/><br/>each character gives you a reason to like or hate them. but only good actors can assure that you will feel both throughout the film. if you haven't seen this film i highly recommend it. if you have like mob movies you will love this film. And even if you don't love mafia movies but enjoy a movie with good acting, good storyline, good accuracy, or any one of the above and more you will find this movie quite to your liking. without doubt a two thumbs up."

I didn't really like the way De Niro and Pesci just kinda told the story. It would have been better if they left all that out. But other than that this was a really good movie. I think everyone should go see it, it's a great acting job by De Niro, Pesci, and Sharon Stone (she is absolutely NUTS in the movie by the way and plays it perfectly).

With great attention to detail, great historical accuracy, and graphic realism that will make all but the most hardened movie- goers cringe, Scorcese delivers a full- throttle look at the mafia in Sin City before their fall in the mid- 80s. Definitely worth your time, if you can handle brutally realistic violence and non- stop profanity. The only thing that prevents this from getting a 10 out of 10 in my books is the fact that I personally found the character of Ginger, Rothstein's wife, to be slightly too prevalent, and to have received too much screen time.

"simonk_h","10","1","2","17 July 2006"," The usual comparison with GoodFellas
","First up, you definitely need to be in the mood to see this movie. I can watch a three hour movie no problem but with this movie It can really feel like three hours if you are just watching it for the sake of something to watch. Comparison with GoodFellas is inevitable and personally, I think that both movies are just as good as each other. Casino has certain qualities that GoodFellas lacks and GoodFellas has certain qualities that Casino lacks. Casino doesn't quite have the density of secondary characters that enriched the world of GoodFellas. It really felt like a community but then, that was the point of GoodFellas; that Henry Hill was being invited into a big family of sorts and that he would witness it's love and appeal but also it's horror and debauchery. Casino is more centred around 'Ace' Rothstein and Nicky Santoro. The secondary characters are there to provide their cog in the story and then go home. However, Casino has more grit and really conveys the pomp and greed surrounding the so-called ""high"" society of Vegas, not just the pathetic punters. It is also a benefit to hear of how the casinos work under the gaze of the Mob through the heavy use of voice-oveR. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are a fantastic double act and one cannot hide a certain envy towards Scorsese that he is able to wield the acting might of these two in his movies. Just seeing them having an argument is an acting tour de force (whatever that means, but I know it's positive). It's amazing that, like Temeura Morrison in 'Once Were Warriors', in that little scene with his son, Joe Pesci can make Nicky Santoro seem sympathetic. This must surely be the hallmark of a great actor. These are two actors at the top of their game under one of the greatest directors of all time, not just today. Enjoy. That said, Sharon Stone is as good as the madonna-cum-whore, Ginger, who starts the movie as a real figure in the world of gambling but ends up as a spiteful junkie, not even caring towards her child. I have not seen many of her films but I am sure that, just like Bruce Willis, if given the right roles or right director, she can act as good as the best of them. The supporting players such as; Don Rickles, James Woods, Kevin Pollack and L.Q. Jones manage to make their characters fresh and interesting in the time space given to them. The violence is one thing that people always comment on when it comes to this film. There is no doubt that it is pretty strong violence but what gets me is that the scene where Nicky stabs that man with the pen never gets a mention whereas the 'head-in-a-vice' scene always does. I see the pen scene as being a whole lot more graphic and shocking than the vice scene. This is because, with the vice scene, you get a couple of big warnings before hand so you know what will happen (also, the violence is more suggested, even though you can see what is happening to the victim, you do not see the gory details). With the pen scene, however, it takes you totally off guard. The close up of the pen entering the neck is more akin to Hostel than GoodFellas. It certainly took me off guard. What I want to talk about, finally, is the climax. Is it a climax? If so, it is a very played out climax. Maybe because it concerns the fates of several characters in the movie as opposed to just one big bad guy. Certainly Nicky's fate is drawn and bloody and the re-invention of Vegas is a part of that climax. It is a frank and final ending to the film and probably very fitting, as it shows us that crime doesn't pay for some people. In conclusion, I think that Casino is a definite Scorsese classic and one that should gain as much praise as his more lauded works. Despite some minor quibbles, it is up there with the better of Hollywood movies and hopefully will mature as time goes on rather than being regarded as the naughty younger brother of GoodFellas"
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","21 June 2006"," A stand-alone classic (spoilers)
","Casino is often regarded as a second-rate Goodfellas. It's seen as a bloated sequel to Scorsese's gangster masterpiece. But personally, I think it's just as good as its predecessor. It's an amazing film.<br/><br/>However, I can kind of see where people are coming from when they criticise it. Yes, it's excessively violent. Yes, it's bloated. Yes, Pesci plays a character similar to the one he played in Goodfellas. And looking at individual scenes you can make comparisons between the two films: Sam (De Niro) falling for Ginger (Stone) is remarkably similar to the scene where Henry Hill falls in love with Karen after she screams at him at the cab stand, Nicky (Pesci) beating a man with a pen can be linked back to Tommy beating Billy Batts, and the final half an hour where Sam is battling with his wife is filmed in the same frenzy as the day of Henry Hill's arrest. But rather than hurt the film, the familiarity works in its favour. After all, the films both deal with the same world. Therefore, if you've seen Goodfellas, you can plug straight into Casino. But while Goodfellas was about the street level Mafioso, Casino goes one step higher. It's about a more powerful branch of the Mafia. And because the film is dealing with Las Vegas, a city that is loud, brash and devoted entirely to money, it's appropriate that the film is bloated and over the top. Vegas is no place for restraint.<br/><br/>The film starts with Sam being blown up. Then the titles kick in and Sam spirals through a neon hell. But rather than see Las Vegas as an ugly, unnatural city, the city is described as paradise on Earth. And really for someone that loves money, someone that is devoted entirely to the accumulation of wealth, it is indeed paradise. And there's a fantastic shot at the beginning where you see Vegas at night through the clouds. As far as Sam's concerned he's looking down on an Earthly heaven. In this place anything is possible. And continuing the operatic theme of the film, the gangsters in Chicago, the guys who have entrusted Sam with the Tangiers casino, are described as gods  and with the way the sequence is filmed they could be looking down from Mount Olympus.<br/><br/>But although the film starts as a dream it eventually becomes a nightmare. And of course, money, sex and drugs are the corrupting influences. But as grim and violent as the film is, it's also very funny. I mean, Pesci as Nicky, whether intended or not, is a laugh riot. I could just listen to the helium-powered Lilliputian actor rant and rave all day. One of my favourite scenes has to be when he confronts Sam in the desert. It's beautifully built up as a dangerous showdown  Sam looks for holes in the desert and then Nicky drives through the dust (there's a wonderful shot of Nicky's dust trail reflected in Sam's sunglasses)  but once Pesci begins mouthing off, I can only smile. ""You Jew mother******, you!"" Another great Pesci scene is when he puts someone's head in a vice. Again the content is less than savoury, and Pesci is entirely convincing as a psychopath (""Don't make me be a bad guy,"" he says with a wonderful sense of the absurd), but Pesci's screaming fills me with joy. ""Charlie M? You made me pop your f****** eye out of your head to protect that piece of s***? Charlie M? You dumb mother******!"" And then there's the scene where Nicky is talking to some showgirl. He's talking about food (pounding pink veal, no less) and then once he's led her into his car, he applies pressure to back of the woman's cranium and lies back in the time-honoured way that men do when they receive blow-jobs in movies (there's a similar moment later with Pesci and Stone, which also has me laughing, such is the way the scene begins with the characters bitching about Sam and then descends into rampant horniness). But Pesci has even more great moments: the bit where he insults the dealer, the way he intimidates a banker, the stabbing with a pen and the line ""Peek-a-boo, you f***s, you"". Oh, and there's also the bit where he murders one of the casino's business partners. What I love about the scene is the way that Pesci laughs as he narrates the killing ""the boys decided to settle out of court."" It really shouldn't be funny, it shouldn't amuse you to see someone treat life so casually, but that's one of the strengths of the film: the way it refuses to take a moral stance; Pesci's character gets a kick out of the killing, so that's the way it's portrayed.<br/><br/>But of course, a scene that isn't funny is Nicky's killing. Although having said that, I do get a chuckle out of the way that Nicky's narration is interrupted when Frank Vincent hits him. But the beating is incredibly brutal and actually does something rather extraordinary and makes you feel a small measure of sympathy for Pesci's character, especially when he's imploring his friends to stop beating his brother.<br/><br/>And it's also quite extraordinary that the film makes you feel a little something for Ginger (Stone is excellent). After all, by the end she's a completely repugnant character  she even does coke in front of her daughter. But rather than being just a bad person, she's portrayed as someone who has been messed up by Las Vegas and her relationships. Therefore, although it's easy to hate her actions, it's harder to hate her as a person.<br/><br/>And it's the relationship between Sam and Ginger that gives the film its heart. Sure Pesci's antics are the most entertaining, but buried beneath the violence and the squeaky cursing, you have a perverse love story, and a very affecting one at that."
"judylugg","Null","1","2","29 May 2006"," Casino
","One of the best directed and acted films I have ever seen. The direction is totally atmospheric and the cast actually do not seem to be acting - they all appear to be actually who they are portraying - this seems to me to be the number one criterion for a fantastic, knowledgeable, informative film.<br/><br/>I have to say that there is much violence and profanity in it, but, this is necessary to portray the story correctly. The portrayal of the main characters by Stone, Pesci and di Nero are the best I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This film deserves to be listed among the top ten ever made.<br/><br/>Goodfellas is another film in this genre and the above comments about Casino fit here as well."

","Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent. Robert Deniro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joes Pesci is chilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is the only one of the three that doesn't come through for me. I do find it funny though that so many of these guys end up in the same gangster movies, do they even have to read the script anymore. Even with that said I do enjoy these films a lot and I hope they keep making them. I would like to see a new mob movie come out. The Sapronos is a good guide but even still I don't know how Deniro would deal with somebody like Tony Saprano. I would like to see a Casino 2, maybe Deniro's character wants to get back into the business, and I am not talking about the sports betting side of the coin."

","This film is one of the best films i have ever seen. All the movie- script- and actor- performances are outstanding. I give this film 12 of 10 . ;-) I think that Martin Scorsese is one of the best director's and I hope that he get a Oscar for one of his next movies. The most interesting roll in that movie are the roll of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, Ginger McKenna/Rothstein, Nicky Santoro, Lester Diamond, Billy Sherbert ,Andy Stone, Phillip Green, Pat Webb, Senator and Frank Marino. The light in the film is very much excellent. And the camera has fine attitudes. The movie is a big masterpiece. It's really a super film experience.

"pierrefonds_athlete101","9","1","2","9 October 2005"," Pesci, De Niro, and Scorsese again?
","It's like all the time when De Niro and Pesci work together, Martin Scorsese is the one who is always there. This time they work in what I think is the most detailed film of the mafia. Based on a true story.<br/><br/>De Niro stars as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, a former gambler who has been given the job as head of the casino by the mafia back in New York. Sharon Stone is Ginger, a casino hustler who basically uses Sam for his money so she can give money to her poor low life friend named Lester Diamond (James Woods). Joe Pesci is Sam's right hand man Nicky Santoro, who basically did not want to help Sam operate but make money by cheating with Sam knowing. Sam did not mind but one day Nicky got caught cheating and he is not allowed into any of the casinos. After that he starts working with the mob and starts to become one of the heads. Sam later has scandals going on with publicity that now he cannot control the casino no more. Ever since then, he has now been having trouble with Ginger and Nicky.<br/><br/>Very heavy movie indeed. Sharon Stone has indeed done the best performance of her career. I would have given her the Oscar that year instead of Susan Sarandon's ""Dead Man Walking"". Pesci does in a way resemble his same Oscar winning character in ""Goodfellas"". Pesci is one of the biggest villains around in this movie. The violence, the swearing, and the drugs is a little too much in this one. That's its only problem. A very little bit less would give it the shot. I'd give it a 9.4/10."
"moviemanMA","7","1","2","29 July 2005"," Goodfellas in Las Vegas
","When a director makes a fantastic movie, sometimes there will be a follow up movie that has a similar idea and story. This isn't a sequel, but it is pretty much the same movie with a different location and list of characters. This can be done by the same director or a different one. In this case, Martin Scorsese made Goodfellas in 1990, creating one of the greatest movies of all time. In 1995, he came back with another movie of the same caliber as Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Casino is the story of the rise and fall of a casino in Las Vegas called the Tangiers during the 1970's and 80's. Casino operator Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and his friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) try to make this casino the best there is while making a huge amount of money for themselves, their wives, and for the ""bosses"" back home. They use some interesting methods of persuasion for cheaters in the casino so they never come back, and of course there are payoffs to police, security, politicians, and anyone else who needs to be ""taken care of"". With so much corruption in this town, they fit right in.<br/><br/>Sam's wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) is the woman of his dreams, or at least that's what he thinks. Together, the two of them go on a roller coaster ride through everything. Just when things are looking great, the whole operation falls apart. The Tangiers is running smoothly, no one is ratted out, and they are becoming kings of the Las Vegas strip. Little by little things crumble down into oblivion. Snitches, FBI agents, and all sorts of trouble rain down on this paradise in the desert. <br/><br/>Scorsese does a nice job of illustrating the rise and fall of this casino. It is very reminiscent of Goodfellas, the story being the rise and fall of the crime family. Casino the same idea with a different story. The good thing is that there isn't a problem with that because the movie itself makes up for it. Scorsese brings back De Niro and Pesci from previous movies like Raging Bull and Goodfellas to make this movie worth watching. The addition of Sharon Stone, who received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her performance as Ginger, gives the movie more of a reason to watch.<br/><br/>The only problem with this movie is that is really long, running just short of three hours. Some parts seem to drag on, but with the changing storyline, it's always something new. Scorsese does what he does best and that is tell a great story. His use of narration throughout the whole movie by De Niro and Pesci is very well done. The transition from the 70's to the 80's is noticeable in the equipment used in the casino, the clothing, the music, and the lifestyles they pursue. Whether it's watching the casino floor or taking some guys out back to ""talk"" with, there is a lot to watch and be entertained by. The hard work put into running a casino and all of the in's and out's are exposed. It's a hard life out there, but when a problem arises, all they have to to is dig a hole in the desert and let the pistol do the talking. Casino is a great story that is definitely worth a viewing at least once. As the saying goes, ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas..."". Thankfully this movie got out for us to see."
"Hector_The_Toad","10","1","2","1 June 2005"," Scorcese's Post 1990s work is grossly underrated
","Martin Scorcese - the film's director - is known for directing some excellent movies. MEAN STREETS, TAXI DRIVER and RAGING BULL have been great successes and Scorcese's start into the organized crime genre commenced with a loud bang with the box office success GOODFELLAS (1990). However, I believe it is Scorcese's post-Goodfella's work that he should be commended for - excellent movies such as CAPE FEAR (1991), CASINO (1995) and GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002) have gone wholly unnoticed. While receiving 10 Academy Award nominations, GANGS OF NEW YORK didn't receive one and CAPE FEAR and CASINO were blatantly disregarded by the Academy - a gross oversight and disappointment to all Scorcese fans. IMDb users have also chosen not to put CASINO on its top 250 list - another blow to this wonderful film.<br/><br/>CASINO revolves around an ex-criminal Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro). Rothstein is the successful - albeit corrupt - owner of an illegally run casino in Las Vegas. Rothstein is running the casino successfully and without many hitches.<br/><br/>Enter two big obstacles in the form of call girl Ginger (Sharon Stone)and psychotic friend (sort of like Tommy DeVito in GOODFELLAS) Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Rothstein marry's the irresistible Ginger and Nicky starts up a brutal mafia racket in Las Vegas, leading to the slow destruction of Rothstein and his empire.<br/><br/>CASINO was brilliant. Supported by excellent acting and masterful direction, this film is one which must not be missed. Scorcese's Vegas is violent, sexy and, in parts, appealing and this three hour epic portrays this very well. CASINO is a not-to-be-missed gangster film that you cannot fully grasp without seeing it twice. However, I ask this of all IMDb users who love this film: GET IT UP TO THE TOP 250!!!"
"dissidenz","7","1","2","21 May 2005"," shut up, Bobby
","I know I'm not alone in my fascination of Las Vegas casino ""culture."" I've only been there once, but I was completely awestruck by the delicious, glowing obscenity of it all (mind you I'm a jaded New Yorker, not some babe in the woods). ""Casino"" only adds to the fantasy. The irony is that while Vegas is seen as a separate universe where vice is as commonplace as streetlights, it's probably the only HONEST city in the world. Every other city is as full of vice and corruption, but Vegas is the only place that admits that these things are at the core of our lovely civilization. Scorsese has many tools at his disposal; here he uses his scalpel and Bedazzler above all else. The one thing that really bugged me (other than the usual Italian-American stereotypes, but what are you gonna do) is the OVER-use of voice-over. Voice-over is pretty annoying to begin with, but here it's just way too much. It almost sucks the life out of the movie (especially when coupled with Scorsese's snappy montage style). Visually it's quite breathtaking, and the performances are top-notch, especially from Sharon Stone, who emits a raw energy not common among today's leading ladies."

","A more realistic gangster film, more subdued than other greats, but this is also what makes it a great film. And excellent use of voice-over narration by the different characters. When you add in the fact that, in addition to being great film-making / storytelling, that this film also serves as an engaging reference to the historical and contemporary phenomenon that is Las Vegas, the ultimate metaphorical caricature of the United States, how can this film not be a 10? And the performances? How about the killer soundtrack?? As unintelligent as it may sound, the only knock I can imagine on this film from the aficionados would have to be the lack of violence when compared to say, Pulp Fiction, but I definitely think that there is ample blood and guts, but the gratuitous violence is actually (and this is rare) overshadowed by the depth of the art going on here, and this is the mark of greatness within this genre. Also, the editorial-stype commentary in the last 3 minutes was a bit heavy-handed, but nothing that would detract from a deserved 10/10 rating. Thoughts??"

"policy134","7","1","2","28 March 2005"," Slow at times, but definitely worth watching.
","The opening narration of this epic tale pretty much sums it up. Ace Rothstein (based on real life casino owner Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal) was a very gifted individual and the way the inner workings of a casino is described is fascinating to watch. However, the more the story unfolds we are banged over the head with numerous names, situations and too much narration that really isn't necessary to follow the story.<br/><br/>There are other problems, especially regarding the Nicky Santoro character, played by Joe Pesci. There are conflicting information about him all through the movie. Was he a major figure in organized crime or was he simply a two-bit hood. It is never quite made clear but he must have had some connection since he gets in any casino before he is banned. The friendship between him and Ace is never really fully explored either. A background sequence could have saved the viewer a lot of confusion. As they are portrayed in this movie they don't even seem to be of the same species. The way Rothstein tries to cover up where he comes from is essential to the plot but that he behaves a lot more like a socialite than a gambler is too polished to be believable.<br/><br/>The Sharon Stone character Ginger is the most fully developed person in the movie. Her character is pretty much revealed in the first two minutes she's on screen and the way she transforms during the movie is also believable. Even though her pimp, Lester (played by James Woods) doesn't have a lot of screen time, we can guess what purpose he had in her life. Therefore, it must have been hard to cast the Ginger role as her's requires a great deal of acting skill.<br/><br/>Like so many actors Scorsese has worked with before, De Niro, Pesci and Frank Vincent does pretty much what we expect. They are all terrific but the real surprise is Alan King, who is a comedian. Even though his character is also a little sketchy, he brings the right kind of authority to his role. He is also the one character who gives the most information as to how things operate in Vegas.<br/><br/>The bosses of Las Vegas are mostly decorative. They are never fully explored and are therefore mostly played as fat men in suits. The only boss who seems to have any say in what goes on is the character, Remo Gaggi, and even he seems to be clueless most of the time.<br/><br/>There are a lot more to mention but the bottom line is that even though it is very clear that Scorsese has put a lot of effort into the accuracy of the action, it is a bit confusing and I think he should have left out a great deal of the narration that doesn't really explain a lot anyway. So an 'A' for the effort but only a 'B+' for the artistry which is what I think he is trying to aspire to."

"Pedro_H","8","1","2","15 April 2003"," Rise and fall of Las Vegas gambling - Scorsesse style
","The real life story of how the Mafia - through dubious front men - won and lost casino gambling in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Hard to see how director Martin Scorsesse could really go wrong with a script and subject like this. Totally down his street. This is almost Goodfellers Part II and to make this more obvious they even have some of the same cast - including Robert De Niro as Sam Rothstien the mob front man taking heat from the overworld AND the underworld.<br/><br/>If this film had have been made before Goodfellers (probably the best organised crime picture ever made) then it would have been better received. This is not as good and requires too much setting up (almost documentary style) and we don't really care quite as much. It also has a nasty underbelly.<br/><br/>The message is that gambling is for idiots and in this world nobody trusts anybody else. This is not a point that you have to go searching for, because it is pushed down your throat through voice-over and then underlined through action. People here are cold and in it for themselves; although this may be true-to-life.<br/><br/>I love the little scenes that are truthful. The smiling receptionist setting up the robbery of the guest. People being lured in to debt for the fun of handing out punishment. Casino cheats being dealt with on the spot. It presents a view of 1970's Las Vegas almost as if it were a middle eastern country where thieves have their hands removed. <br/><br/>The real thrust of this film is the feeling of being at the cross-roads. Where legitimate business and organised crime meet. De Niro has to play both sides and this is not without danger; as the opening and closing scenes demonstrate. <br/><br/>Joe Pesci represents the old school rob 'em/shoot 'em world of the mob. A thuggish money earner while de Niro is a rob'em through a fountain pen type. Uniquely, in my own viewing experience, they share voice-overs giving different spins on the same events.<br/><br/>Despite being a thug I prefer Pesci because he is walking the only path that he knows. He is a good thief because he is brave and immoral. ""It is all about the dollars."" He says. De Niro (Rothstien) had choices and made bad ones.<br/><br/>Despite being garlanded Sharon Stone does nothing with her ""love interest"" role apart from looking good and doing some shrieking. Like everyone else she is selfish and me-first, a Las Vegas hustler who lives as a parasite. While interesting, in that it gives the story some variety, the fact that she hooks up with the De Niro (who has his doubts - even in voice over) shows that no one is quite as smart as they like to think.<br/><br/>Scorsesse is good at the making people human with little subplots or humour, but he loses the film in some of the violence. It goes on too long and merely drags us through the gutter with the characters. It also cuts against the grain and timing of what goes before. <br/><br/>Casino isn't a great film because it doesn't hang together well and we don't care about the main three characters.

","I honestly cannot believe that Goodfellas is seen as Scorcese's best film, Yes of course it is a classic, that I am not disputing but surely Casino should be heralded higher than Goodfellas.Firstly, Casino is a far more ambitious and therefore more difficult movie to pull off than Goodfellas.Yes Goodfellas is ambitious, it follows the entire true  life story of a Gangster, but Casino tries to analyse in detail the entire inner most workings of a money spinning empire and its downfall during the early 1970s. Secondly,the plot is more complex as a result. It interweaves the lifes of gangsters, professional gamblers, pimps into the corrupt day to day workings of a las vegas casino and thirdly the ending has far more conclusion to it than goodfellas.Yes Goodfellas has a better Soundtrack but casino has epic classical music which symbolises this idea of extreme power, the casino being a form of heaven and the casino manager(Robert Deniro)playing a metaphorical god.It is certainly underrated and certainly should be placed higher up in a pedastool.Believe me this film is stunning, this film is a classic and this film is the best of all gangster films.

","A fascinating look at the mob-operated Las Vegas casino industry, Casino is a success on every level.  Despite being three hours long, it never gets boring  it's driven by brilliant direction, superb acting, and an interesting screenplay.  Covers familiar ground but never really feels like a retread of Goodfellas, although some make that claim.  The only real similarity is Joe Pesci's character  while he delivers a fine performance, I can't help but feel that his presence is largely their because of his success in Goodfellas.  Regardless, it can hardly be considered a flaw in the film, and it works very well.  An excellent addition to Scorsese's already impressive body of work."

","After seeing this and Goodfellas i have come to a theory: All movies should star Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. These two geniuses can turn any movie into a masterpiece. They can make you laugh and cry pretty much at the same time. The film follows Ace Rothstien (De Niro) when he gets the biggest prize a gambler can get: his own casino. Of course he has to pay the mobsters who gave it to them. He also has to deal with the violent and costly exploits of his friend Nicky (Pesci). Joe Pesci again perfects the loud mouth loose cannon character as he did in Goodfellas, but i think here he was given a more important part. Robert De Niro can not fail. You can see the stress and anger in his eyes in this film. Martin Scorsese is the world's greatest director. Screw the Academy. He should have won the best director Oscar several times by now. I would love to see him do more work with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. This is a classic gangster picture that is always compared to Goodfellas. I think they are two different stories and two excellent films. 9/10"

But last night I sat through the first two hours, and although I wasn't bored, I was reviewing what I had seen in my mind, and frankly it didn't add up to much, really.  It was almost the same rags-to-whacking-people-to-riches-to-whacking-each-other-to-rags story of Goodfellas, without the sense of humour.<br/><br/>More seriously, for Scorsese as a filmmaker, was the absence of any real involvement in the relationships between the characters.  Why Ace and Nicky are best friends is never really explored - all we really see between them is animosity.  Sharon Stone is a beautiful woman, but I was hoping to see something more to indicate exactly why it was Rothstein fell in love with Ginger, other than him telling us so.  The line about trust at the very start of the film is important, but never really seems to be followed up, as it is clear that not only did Rothstein not trust his wife from day one, he was never given the remotest reason to.  Ginger's obsession with riches and jewellry is demonstrated, but never explored, other than perhaps to indicate that she had no taste in jewellry!<br/><br/>I could see absolutely no reason for this movie to be as long as it was, except that it included a lot of scenes that, made by a different director, would have ended up on the cutting room floor.  The whole sequence about the bosses getting annoyed about being skimmed from their skim, to the KC operator moaning about his expenses, to his mouthing off to his parents in the Kansas store, was an utter waste of time (and the faux-reality acting of the mother complaining about his swearing, was a major change in style which only served to jerk you out of the movie you were watching.)<br/><br/>Scorsese made his name by handling different films with different styles, but still making them inimitably his own: Mean Streets is different from Taxi Driver, is different from Raging Bull, is different from The Color Of Money, is different from Goodfellas.  Not many directors have sustained such diversity and originality over 20 years.  But Casino lacks the originality of its predecessors, and it lacks the emotional heart which is essential to any good film."

Just about the only thing there to remind you that this is a 3-hour film is the fact you have to get up and change video cassettes 2/3's of the way in.  While the film is not as great as Scorsese's other mafia epic ""Goodfellas"", it is told in the same narrative style and lets you view the other side of the mob in Las Vegas. DeNiro is once again dynamic in his role as a Casino operator and Joe Pesci (one of the most underrated film actors of his generation, save for the Oscar he got for ""Goodfellas"") gives one of his patented high energy, ruthless and funny performances as the Mafia enforcer from New York who is sent to Vegas by the mob to keep things in line in Vegas.  Sharon Stone also does a surprisingly good job in her role as a strung out gambler and former call-girl that becomes the apple in DeNiro's eye, easily the best performance of her career.  But the film is not about individual performances, per-se, like ""Goodfellas"", the film is an exercise in brilliant story telling, style and superb filmmaking skill.  The visuals, colors and images in this film are among the most mesmerizing of any Scorsese film since ""Taxi Driver"" and as many IMDB users have noted, the soundtrack of the film is among the best in film history and is used perfectly along the way and plays an important part in the storytelling. This is among an elite class of mob movies and an excellent film on its own rites.

The first part was Mean Streets (1973), the second GoodFellas. I liked Casino because of the story and the fabulous music. Besides, Casino is based on a true story. For the first time in her life, Sharon Stone shows that she is a good actress. Pesci and De Niro are excellent(as usual). It is really a shame that Casino didn't get an Oscar for Best Picture.

The expulsion of the Mob from Las Vegas also serves to reinforce Scorsese's recurring themes of redemption and ascension; here both are mutually exclusive and to be redeemed and delivered from hell means an existence in purgatory. (Heaven, meanwhile, is reserved for the blue-haired innocents who have become the guests of the corporations that have purged Vegas from sin.) By the time it's over, Scorsese seems exhausted; he doesn't have anything left to say on the subject and it looks doubtful he ever will. Still, if he never makes another masterpiece, this will be a fitting coda on a remarkable subject."

","1995's Casino saw Martin Scorcese continue his masterful exploration of the American underworld, calling on the talents of Messrs De Niro and Pesci to portray the corrupt background of Las Vegas in the seventies.<br/><br/>De Niro and Scorcese, when working together, always come up with the goods (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy), although their previous collaboration, Cape Fear, was a slight dissapointment in comparison.<br/><br/>
Casino tells the story of the  rise of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (De Niro) to the top of the gaming community in Las Vegas, albeit with the help of the Mob and resident psychopath/long-time friend Nicky Santoro (Pesci), as well as concentrating on his rocky relationship with Vegas hustler Ginger (Sharon Stone). Between the heists, the stunning cinematography, seamless editing and sumptuously glamorous visuals, Casino is seriously compulsive filmmaking. De Niro and company are all on peak form, creating believable and fascinating three-dimensional characters. Scorsese's direction is smooth, confident and incisive, using a terrific array of shots and technical tricks to take us through the real deceptive nature of Vegas. The film is often hilarious due to the animated trauma of the characters (see Santoro's furious reaction to Tony Doggs spilling the beans about his boss) as they try to deal with the trials and tribulations of being first-rate gangsters.<br/><br/>The critics were shockingly unkind to Casino, saying that it was a poor man's Goodfellas. I wonder what everyone's reaction to Casino would have been if it had come out first and not Goodfellas. The truth is is that Casino, while lacking the strong narrative of Goodfellas, is in many ways a stronger film in terms of acting, direction and in terms of being simply more entertaining. Goodfellas is very professionally made, but at its peak, Casino really does impress more, especially in its more dramatic moments. De Niro and Pesci are given more room to explore their characters, and Sharon Stone is just brilliant, proving that there is more to her than the trashy exploitation of Basic Instinct and the awful Sliver. Also this film has probably the best soundtrack of any film made in the 90's. Just check out the stylish use of the Stones' classic Can't You Hear Me Knocking as Pesci introduces his gang of ""desperadoes""."

It's not as good as some of Scorsese's other films, but is still very good.<br/><br/>DeNiro and Pesci are midwestern mobsters who get involved in the casino business in Las Vegas. Sharon Stone plays a showgirl who marries DeNiro's character. We always knew Sharon was sexy, but here we find out she can act, too. She is great in this film, which also includes James Woods and Don Rickles among a large supporting cast. <br/><br/>Casino delivers all the things we've come to expect from Scorsese: a long but exciting movie with great action, interesting characters played by top actors, popular music used effectively and alot of violence and profanity.

","Like Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" and Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"", Scorsese had created a bit of monster for himself when he released ""Goodfellas"" in 1990. He created an undisputed, instant classic for which all of his subsequent films - as well as all other Mafia films - would be measured against. As magnificent as ""Goodfellas"" is, it can be considered a curse. This is evident in ""Casino"", Scorsese's more-or-less follow-up to the life depicted in ""Goodfellas"". It is an impressive achievement, even more dense and visceral than ""Goodfellas"", but it has received some derision over the years by those who have accused Scorsese of ""copying himself."" (How can a filmmaker ""copy"" himself anyway? Nobody has moaned about Spielberg constantly re-visiting the days of WWII.)<br/><br/>Merciless in presenting his strict attention to detail, Scorsese chronicles the rise and fall of Las Vegas under the grip of the Mafia from the early 1970's to the mid 1980's. Utilizing endless freeze-frames, multiple voice-over narrators, incessant music, swirling cinematography and eye-bruising set decoration, Scorsese brings us deep into the diamond-crusted bowels of the big business of Las Vegas and how the mob ""skimmed"" all they could from it for over a decade. Robert De Niro brings a subtle gravity to the role of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a genius gambling pro from Chicago recruited by the Mafia to manage and operate the four largest casinos in Vegas. Rothstein's insurance arrives in the guise of childhood friend Nicky Santoro - now a hotshot Mafia captain (and rendered with crushing brutality by Joe Pesci). After years of successful slumming as a mid-level gambler, Rothstein sees Vegas as his shot at legitimacy. He tries to solidify his dream by marrying a high-class Vegas prostitute, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), who despite her glamorous exterior and sturdy attitude, is ultimately emotionally lost and still desperately hung on her greasy pimp / boyfriend, Lester Diamond (nicely underplayed by the eternally sleazy James Woods).  Ginger tires to escape Ace's marital clutch while still enjoying the perks of being the wife of the most powerful man in town, while Nicky disregards Ace's ""nice-and-neat"" policy of running business in favor of violent extortion and rampant thievery over everyone else in town. Ace sees the coupling together of his rocky marriage to Ginger with Nicky's aggressive attempts at taking over Las Vegas as problematic, but pride & greed prevent him from acknowledging the true severity of the situation. When Ginger and Nicky's frustrations with Ace inadvertently turn them toward each other, all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>There are probably very few other films that hit the three-hour mark and fly by as quickly as ""Casino"". Longtime Oliver Stone cinematographer Robert Richardson gives Scorsese's Las Vegas a polished, glossy look; bathed in neons, pastels and solids of every color imaginable. God's gifts to Editors - that being Scorsese's number-one partner in crime, Thelma Schoonmaker, creates a smooth but frenetic pacing in Scorsese's storytelling. The music - which encompasses a bizarre brew of blues, swing, classical, doo-wop, rock and even punk - works wonders. Only Spike Lee is as skilled as Scorsese at utilizing music to re-create an era instead of merely advertising the film's accompanying soundtrack. De Niro's take on ""Ace"" Rothstein - who's obsessed with doing the job right - allows Scorsese to splurge on showcasing the in's-and-out's of Vegas. We see Ace chastise reckless dealers, slightly overweight dancers, and beleaguered chefs in excruciating detail. This is not limited to Ace's perceptions, Scorsese explains how money is won and lost, and how it is stolen - whether by the mob or by the players. The first hour of ""Casino"" could easily pass as a documentary on the mechanics of operating a gaming establishment.<br/><br/>Aside from the usual mainstays, De Niro and Pesci, Scorsese has assembled a stellar cast. Both Sharon Stone and James Woods give fiery interpretations of their tortured characters. Stone really surprised everybody with her performance here, but really - how many people would agree to act in a Martin Scorsese picture and sleep through it anyway? Vegas comedy legends Alan King and Don Rickles also appear in straight roles as a casino manager and a mob front, respectively. The great character actor/comedian Kevin Pollack also offers his talent as the mob's squeaky-clean front man. No performance falls flat here.<br/><br/>One way to angle the film for yourself if you're at all put-off by its structural similarities to ""Goodfellas"" need only regard this - ""Casino"" is basically an explanation of what would have happened to the characters in ""Goodfellas"" had they succeeded beyond the middle-class comfort of where they roamed. The film also contains the novelty value of displaying De Niro's ability to juggle! I try to be concise when writing reviews and not ramble as I have done here, but it is difficult to do so with a film like ""Casino"", because it is a film so crowded in its presentation. It's a traditional American Mafia story about gluttonous, reckless, greedy people. Nonetheless, it is another Scorsese masterpiece."

"BlackBalloon","8","1","2","4 April 2001"," Strangely satisfying
","When I first saw this movie on the big screen when it was first released, I was overwhelmed, and not in a pleasant way.  The only other Scorsese film I had seen in a theater was The Age of Innocence.  Casino simply had too much dirty words, blood n guts, insanity, strife, drugs, and messed-up stuff in general for me to enjoy on an initial screening at a movie theater.  The surreal lighting didn't help matters.  <br/><br/>However, I recently watched it (on a much smaller screen) and liked it. Robert DeNiro's character, Ace Rothstein is likable, even though he could be a jerk.  He never once hit Sharon Stone's character, Ginger, unlike Joe Pesci's character, Nicky Santuro.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT I guess what I liked about Ace is he never really changed, despite the fact that Ginger and Nicky agreed to the contrary just before one of their disgusting love-making marathons.  He really was a tight-wad even before becoming big in Vegas, and he knew Ginger and Nicky were slime right from the start.  He saw the good in Ginger, and that's what he was attracted to when he decided to marry her.  She wasn't just a call girl to him. Unfortunately for her, she must have not valued that good in herself enough to stay out of trouble and stay alive.  As for Nicky, when he first decided to come to Vegas he DID consult Ace.  Ace's gut was against it, but he decided to agree because he and Nicky were friends.  If Ace had trusted his instincts to begin with, he might not have gone through the same troubles he had.  In the end, we see that Ace goes back to doing what he did before he ""became big"", which helps prove he never really changed-  he just acted on his instincts in the environment he was in.  He made some big mistakes, to be sure.  But the beauty of it is, he didn't ""play the game""-  he was himself.  <br/><br/>And basically, that's what this movie is about-  an environent in a particular time.  Ace, who, besides being an excellent gambler, really has no outstanding qualities and is something of an everyman, chronicles what it was like to be in his position in a way that people can sympathize with.<br/><br/>Ginger's demise is, to say the least, the most satisfying of the movie.  I found nothing about her character appealing, except for perhaps the first scene in which she appears.  From then on, she personifies fakeness, emptiness.  It's really sad that the one person she kept running back to was such a sleazebag (James Woods).<br/><br/>Nicky's death was pretty tough to watch.  The setting in the corn rows is creepy and the images are very grotesque.    <br/><br/>Sharon Stone and DeNiro are suberb in this movie.  The tension between them in certain scenes is incredible.  It seems like some of the scenes are improvised, they're so dead on.  <br/><br/>Well-acted, well-directed, well-written, highly recommended."

","Casino is an underrated film that sits in the shadow of other Scorsese greats like Goodfellas.  However, I honestly think this is Scorsese's best picture.  It has the best ensemble cast out of all his films, and each character is opened up more than in Goodfellas.  Sharon Stone's role is amazing and very enjoyable to watch... Pesci is his same great self... and De Niro shows us once again why he is the best actor of the last few decades.  I found that this story was very engaging and the insight it offered behind Las Vegas, crime, and casinos was very interesting.  The direction of this movie is superb... each scene carries emotion and brilliance.  I truly believe this movie deserves to earn a much higher IMDB rating.  It deserves to be among the top 250 movies, if not much higher. In fact, along with Pulp Fiction and American Beauty, Casino is among my 3 favorite dramas ever."

","""Casino"" is another modern classic from Martin Scorsese. Drawing parallels with his earlier ""Goodfellas"" , ""Casino"" again teams Scorsese up with writer Nicholas Pileggi having De Niro & Joe Pesci in lead traditional favourite of Scorsese. The result is a truly engaging tale of mobsters setting up a new gambling empire in Las Vegas and the subsequent ripple effects that involve the local authorities and the police.<br/><br/>A joy from beginning to end, ""Casino"" is an example of a perfect movie. There's nothing you'd want to change about this film. It's full of memorable scenes that are rich with outstanding performances and dialogue and it simply demands a repeat viewing.<br/><br/>Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos. Robert De Niro plays Sam Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and Casino. Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance. As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point. Scorsese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary. A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion. The entire production however, is sleek and very quick. The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorsese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene. Scorsese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone. One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of ""Satisfaction"" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>Being a complete movie buff, I generally don't watch films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorsese is definitely one of them. The man is a complete genius, and a gift to any movie buff - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, ""A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies"" which was done the same year as Casino. The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres. You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.<br/><br/>Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent. Robert De Niro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joe Pesci is chilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film.<br/><br/>My Rating â€“ 9/10"
"ctomvelu1","9","1","3","13 July 2012"," About as good as it gets
","I can't believe I've never reviewed this classic, but that's probably because it is a classic and therefore hard to do it justice in writing. Scorsese gives us an intimate look at 1970s' Las Vegas, when the mob ruled, and courtesy of Pillegi's novel. The plot centers on two childhood pals (DeNiro and Pesci), both ""connected"" and shipped out to Vegas. DeNiro's charismatic character Ace Rothstein runs a casino and hotel, while Pesci's strong-arm thug Nicky Santoro delights in causing old-fashioned mayhem. The difference in their approaches to Sin City will eventually cause them to be at odds with one another. Sharon Stone plays a grifter and prostitute whom DeNiro's character marries, to his eternal dismay, as she cannot shake her old ways. An almost unrecognizable James Woods plays her loser boyfriend. Everyone is at the height of their careers here. The dialogue is sharp, the editing first-rate, the vistas of a now-vanished version of Vegas truly astounding. There are moments when the dialogue is clearly being improvised, which gives the film a more natural feel -- even though I normally associate improvised dialogue with inexpensive indies, not a major Hollywood production. Along with Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" and Mann's ""Heat,"" a must-see."
"matthewwalker50","9","1","3","29 June 2012"," Scorsese's most compelling drama
","Totally compelling to watch. Robert De Niro at 43 years of age packs his best performance since Goodfellas! I've always admired De Niro as an actor. His narrating, acting, and undeniable talent as an actor is there for all to see. It may not quite be the movie Goodfellas was. But, I'd put it 2nd best in the whole MOB Movie franchise. A strong, ambitious story about a multi-million dollar Casino deep in the lively city of Las Vegas set back in the year 1983. Mr Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (De Niro)is given the opportunity of a lifetime to take on the job of running the huge Tangiers Casino, the biggest casino in Las Vegas. He marries the beautiful sexy wildcard ""Ginger"" McKenna played by the gorgeous Sharon Stone who looks elegantly dazzling. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is Ace's bodyguard or ""Muscle"" if you like. His job is to make sure nobody messes around with the golden jewel. Later on Sam's relationship with Ginger totally disintegrates leaving Sam and their daughter Amy in an out of control situation with the circumstances resulting in the crazed Sharon Stone going on a rampage of madness until she finally gets arrested by an FBI agent and taken to jail. Nicky Santoro also has every FBI agent in the city watching him with great suspicion thinking he (which he was) behind multiple murder plots. The problem was that they always had to let Nicky go because there were never, ever any witnesses or evidence that he murdered these people. Very late on into the Movie near the end, Nicky and his brother (His closest friend) named Dominic are mercilessly & tenaciously beaten down in acres of cornfield around the desert of Las Vegas and buried alive in holes & filled with sand. The scene is excruciating to watch as the beating is realistic and extremely graphic to watch. Nicky's friend Frankie was responsible as he had basically just had enough of Nicky's evil behaviour and finally puts an end to his dominance. Frankie and his murder plot chums use wooden baseball bats and metal crowbars and whack Nick & his brother with them very hard. Seconds after Mr Rothstein faces a NDE as a bomb is planted under his car. Ace survives with minor burns thanks to a device under his seat that saved his life. He is seen on a stretcher being wheeled into an ambulance with the emergency docs saying ""You sure are lucky, mister."" Everyone should take precaution that this movie isn't for the faint of heart and contains incredibly graphic and realistic torture scenes that should not be watched by people who can't watch bloody scenes. Also there is around 600+ swear words including 430 uses of the infamous F-word including 3 racial slurs which should also be avoided if you dislike profanity. The Acting is absolutely outstanding and spot on though with a great cast, story, and director. Movie Tag: ""No one stays at the top forever"""

Sharon Stone is excellent and Joe Pesci is, well, Joe Pesci. Like ""Goodfellas"" it is based on a true story. This time, the Chicago mob in Las Vegas. It has a number of effective scenes: Sharon's Stone's breakdown, the scene involving the two card cheats, and the brutal though richly deserved death of Joe Pesci and his brother. But the film left me cold. It could have been called ""Goodfellas Go to Las Vegas"". Scorsese, screen writer Nick Pileggi, and Pesci basically recreated what they did in the earlier film.

","In looking at Martin Scorsese's look at life in Las Vegas under control of the mob in the 1970s and 1980s, I became intensely curious as to what in particular Scorsese was trying to tell me. Was there any sort of outward message being presented in this sordid tale of greed, deception, backstabbing and violent behavior? And in the end, was this simply a spin off of Goodfellas? Many would disagree, claiming that Casino is an entirely different kind of Scorsese film, concerned more with the city of Vegas and its surroundings than anything else. Indeed, the first two hours fly by as Scorsese whisks us through the casino and its behind-the scenes facts. Long famous for the energy and spontaneity of his films, Scorsese's fluid camera snakes in and out of rooms, eavesdropping on the conversations of some of the highest and most powerful men in Las Vegas, some of which don't even live in Nevada. As in Goodfellas, there is innumerable amounts of information given. In fact, there are so many voice-over narrations going on one right after another, some may get dizzy trying to keep them all straight. All this, combined with fiercely intense performances from Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci make this a great two hour run. Unfortunately, this is a three-hour film.<br/><br/>The last hour of the film, for me, bears many marks of Scorsese's labor of love for these settings and subject, yet it feels to drag on and on and on. Never have I seen one hour go by so slowly that was directed by such a great filmmaker. Indeed, the main reason for such slow pacing is the fact that practically the same thing happens in every single scene. For the first two hours, Scorsese sets up nearly ever character for some sort of payoff or consequence. Now, the payoffs must come. They do, one right after the other and it is not only boring to watch but also painful. As with any Scorsese film, the bleakness and desperation of the situation is not shied away from. It is difficult to watch the relationship between De Niro and Stone crumble, in effect mirroring the mob's relationship with Las Vegas fall apart. Nevertheless, by the end, I was left feeling somewhat unsatisfied and cold with all these characters. Not a single one can truly be empathized with, and in the end all get what they deserve.<br/><br/>I know it is unfair to Scorsese to compare this film with Goodfellas, but there are so many parallels that it is hard not to. Where Goodfellas succeeded in having one main point of view narrate everything, here there are too many to consistently keep track of as well as too many scenes of people being beaten senseless and screaming at each other in drug-induced rages. I do not ask Scorsese to be gentler or sugarcoat his stories; I only ask that he create a solidly discernible plot flow throughout the film as he did in Goodfellas and The Age of Innocence. Regrettably, despite its many positive elements, Casino is not one of the great Scorsese's best."

They never say whether it was good or bad, they'll just say it was violent. Other then the scene involving the baseball bats, the movie is not all that bad. I thought movie's like Scarface and Goodfellas were a lot worse then this.

""GoodFellas II"" could've been the working title of this brassy and encompassing crime drama by screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi and director Martin Scorsese examining the underbelly of Las Vegas in mob-controlled era of the 1970s with De Niro as Ace Rosenthal the man running the show in glitzy corrupt casino Tangiers who eventually falls from grace to love interest Stone (nominated for Best Actress) and boyhood chum/psycho thug Pesci.

DeNiro and Pesci, though they've both done this same thing before, and better. The narrative, the camera work, first 45 mins of this are great, and if that could have been sustained for the entire film, this could have won the Oscar.  <br/><br/>Instead it desolves into a Vegas based Godfather knock off.<br/><br/>Now, I don't mind some film violence; and expected it big time with these guys. But WHY the baseball bats in the cornfield? Why the Pesci Vice bit? Did we have to see the old gal get shot 3 times in the head up close like that? <br/><br/>I think one of those scenes was enough; but having all three...overkill. There's some terrific supporting jobs here: Don Rickles, Alan King, Sharon Stone turns in one too. James Woods was fine. But when you get to the end, all you can remember is 'Batter up!'

","This is ridiculous. At the 35 minutes mark I was waiting for ""the movie to start"". I really and honestly was waiting for the voice over to stop explaining people's motivations and connections with each other and feelings and risks and problems and desires. Jesus Christ. And even if it went away a bit after that mark, it never completely disappeared. It is the laziest trick to tell a story.<br/><br/>If it was needed to tell the complete story in 3 hours, then this story should've been a ""two parts"" or a trilogy, without any voice-over whatsoever. I can understand this in fantasy movies like Lord of the Rings, but in a gritty and realistic story? Lame.<br/><br/>Also the miscast of De Niro. His character was annoyingly passive and nerdy. He just doesn't give that vibe. Not even close. Awful casting choice.
Also, no matter how awful your characters are, you should find a way to make them entertaining to see. Joe Pesci did that. But De Niro and Stone failed.
I was bored and annoyed by the voice over, and with time, I was bored and annoyed at the characters. I honestly couldn't care less about anything.<br/><br/>Good ""based on a real story"" movies tend to make you want to find out exactly what happened after watching them.

"keirjosephwilson","4","1","4","8 February 2020"," About the only thing I can say in this film's favour is I think I know what Scorsese feels like to people who don't like Scorsese
","About the only thing I can say in this film's favour is that after seeing it I think I have a good idea of what Scorsese films feel like to people who hate Scorsese (well, that and that I got a kick out of seeing Don Rickles and Joe Bob Briggs). Good lord this film is wasted potential. It's from one of my favourite directors and it has a great cast (hell even in this mess of a film the performances are pretty good), and the last Scorsese mob film is a contender for my favourite film of all time, and yet, this film was a near-complete waste of time. So what went wrong? Well, really this film suffered a death of a thousand cuts. I'll tell you this, the film certainly did not start out strong with opening credits that went on way too damn long and were quite dull, and on top of that even the music playing over the credits was sub-par. For that matter, I really didn't like a lot of the score/soundtrack for this film (in fact a few times I found the songs used rather distracting), which is saying something because this is a Martin Scorsese film and usually I love the soundtracks in his films, which brings me to this film's use of voice-over narration. As everyone and their mother knows, Martin Scorsese is usually very good at knowing how to use voice-over narration. Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, The Wolf of Wall Street, and the Irishman are all in my opinion films where voice-over is done brilliantly, so it pains me to say this voice-over in this film is terrible. For one thing, it's much too overused. Seriously, I was half an hour in and I think there had been like maybe 5 minutes where there wasn't a narrator talking. It does get better, but it's still overused. For another thing, I just didn't like the voice-over narration. Something about De Niro's voice I think, but I just didn't like it very much. This film gets compared a lot to Goodfellas, and while I can definitely see the basis of the comparison, Goodfellas is the far superior film. For example, while both films are rise-and-fall stories, Goodfellas does that job a lot better, whereas here I was left saying ""not much of a rise in this rise-and-fall story is there"", and even the fall was rather lacklustre. More than anything though, this film just really wasn't very interesting. It was extremely dull and I had to resist the urge to turn the damn thing off the entire time. What I liked about this film I didn't like that much, and what I disliked really really bothered me."

The similarities are obvious. There's a voiceover throughout the film, the relationship between De Niro and Stone is greatly similar to Liota and Braccos relationship in GoodFellas.

","I saw this when it was first released and it has not exactly grown on me. Scorsese peaked with ""Goodfellas"" and tried to re-create that magic with the same screenwriter, Nicholas Pileggi. He cast his usual trusty team of DeNiro and Pesce and Sharon Stone to play Ginger. The best of these was Stone, who reminded me of a lot of fake, greedy women I met in Las Vegas. DeNiro's character was just not likeable or sympathetic to me. Pesce was over-the-top psychopathic and his attempt at a Chicago accent was probably accurate, but annoying and distracting. James Woods was great as the slimeball Lester.
I thought the affair between Stone and the much shorter Pesce was comical.
The violence was too much, causing my date to shudder. Did we really need to see one of the gangsters spitting on the hero? Do we need to give the weak minded more examples of depravity?"

","Martin Scorsese is without a doubt one of the finest individuals to ever sit behind a movie camera having directed great films like ""Raging Bull"", ""The Departed"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""Hugo"", and ""The Aviator"" this movie is a welcomed addition to that already masterful resume for me. This movie is the ninth collaboration between Scorsese and his right hand man Robert De Niro and so far it's their most recent until their upcoming Netflix film ""The Irishman"" comes out later this year. De Niro stars as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein who owns a casino in Las Vegas called the ""Tangiers"" and happens to be based on Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal who started out as a sports better in Chicago and the mob decides that he would be a potential asset to their income and decides to send him to Vegas to run a casino. Rothstein then moves down to Vegas to run the place and not long after his best friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) along with his brother Dominic (Philip Suriano), and his associate Frankie Marino (Frank Vincent) are sent by the mob bosses to make sure everything in the place runs smoothly. Rothstein's trusted manager is an older guy named Billy Sherbert (Don Rickles) who at his side at all times during working hours and also watches everything that goes on and makes sure nobody does anything wrong. Then one day while the casino is in operation Rothstein sees a blond haired woman who he instantly falls in love with named Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) who is a hustler and former prostitute who has a pimp friend named Lester Diamond (James Woods) who she has known since they were kids and sometimes presents obstacles in her marriage to Rothstein. The movie's story is more than just the rise and fall of a mob family but also the downfall of one man's life, relationships, and wealth. Scorsese is a director who pays an immense attention to every little detail in his movies which makes it feel like you are there in the movie with his characters going through certain things in their lives, and in this case presents the excess that the characters live in perfectly proving that money can't make your life happy no matter how much you may have, and there are dire consequences with messing with a mobster's trust. This is one of the most violent gangster movies I've ever seen. Scorsese's direction is always in top form especially with this movie and his screenplay that he co-wrote with Nicholas Pileggi (who also co-wrote the screenplay for ""Goodfellas"" as well as the books that both films are based on.) Robert Richardson's cinematography is excellent same with the editor by Scorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker. The acting is also superb especially by Stone who nabbed an Oscar nomination for best actress who managed to get the movie its only nomination. But however my only problem with the movie is that it seemed a little bit on the long side for me which makes it seem a bit drawn out and at the same time is justified due to Scorsese's fast pacing and deep focus into Rothstein's personal life, and as a result is one of the best inside stories about a gangster I've ever seen along with ""The Godfather"" series, ""Scarface"", and ""Goodfellas"". The movie is one of the best of its kind and is a near masterpiece."

The dysfunction represented in this movie is amazing, every little thing leads to something worse. The beginning shows the rise of the Mafia's empire in Las Vegas: from the towering casinos to the floors of the casino, you get a little taste of everything in here. What's really interesting is that if you played by the rules, they treated you like gold, but if you double crossed them things could get pretty ugly (see the hammer scene). Casino, put simply, is a great movie. The only problem I experienced was that there were parts that seemed to drag out.

Will they all go down the drain or will they somehow find a way to survive this downfall of the mob in Las Vegas? That's the story.<br/><br/>Photography, soundtrack, editing, everything is done brilliantly. I personally think this is Scorsese's last greatest work of his carreer. Everything got a bit bland and predictable later on. But with ""Casino"" he delivers a magnificent portrait about GREED. 
""Greed is good"" that was the motto of the bankers who in the end took over the mob.<br/><br/>""Good Fellas"" is the most popular and critically acclaimed american mob classic next to ""The Godfather"", but I think ""Casino"" deserves that second place more. This movie truly cares for it's characters. They become true to life.

""Casino"" is slowburning, subtle yet twisted and without the usual glorifying of violence, although it has lots of it on display...<br/><br/>Clocking at 3 hours this is one heck of an epic about how the banks took over the mob's rule in Las Vegas. Gambling became a legit business for banks at the beginning of the eighties.The same debt ridden banks that later went on to cause the most destructive global economy crisis in recorded history.

","Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone. Now there's a group of people with which to make a movie. <br/><br/>Casino takes place in Las Vegas in the 70s. Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (De Niro) is sent to Vegas by the mob to run a casino for them. After a while they also send Nicky Santoro (Pesci) to keep the wheels running and to act as muscle for Rothstein. Unfortunately, these two have very different ideas on how things should be run. Ace would like nothing more than to run his casino, pay his ""honest"" dues to the mob and to just sit back and relax. Whereas Nicky wants to climb all the way to the top, no matter how many bodies he has to leave on his wake.<br/><br/>This movie is often compared to Goodfellas, Scorsese's previous masterpiece. And I can definitely see why. We have the mob, gangsters a plenty, rags to riches themes, and even two of the same actors, although Pesci is deservedly in a much bigger role this time around.<br/><br/>And yet Goodfellas it ain't. It's plenty good on its own merits, but it lacks that degree of identifiability a proper old time gangster film has. The 70s and Las Vegas muddle up the story, make it seem that much dirtier. Drugs flow freely, no one can be trusted and none of the main characters is at all likable. Which is most definitely the point, but it is also the reason why I prefer Goodfellas. A much better comparison mood-wise would be Scarface, although that takes an even harsher stance on the viability of the gangster lifestyle. Whereas this movie is kind of half-n-half.<br/><br/>Still, a good movie by any measure. Well worth a watch for all fans of the gangster genre."

","Exciting gets right to the point and delivers satisfaction for this subject matter. If you like movies with gambling, the mob, hit men, gangsters, money flowing, and that don't tax your attention span but instead compliment it then this is for you. Good directing, acting, supporting players and location (casinos and Las Vegas) all add to the realism. In real life, this type of living depicted and in scenes in this movie are despicable, sad, and while true to life represent a waste of life. I mean how many times can you gamble, have sex, eat, have best cloths, shoes and be pampered and then repeat and repeat again? They did a Twilight Zone on this where the guy dies and he enters into a world of having everything non-stop until it drives him nuts. He requests to go to hell being fed-up with this ""heaven"" and is told this is hell. Spot-on to make my point. Be entertained, satisfy your curiosity, let your inner gangster come out but then come back to your world. Good movie to eat with and have a tasty drink followed by a decent snack as we follow the characters. This movie has what I always look for in a quality movie i.e. memorable scenes. That means you will watch it again and again and it also qualifies for your collection too. Okay you lovers of this talented group of actors and professionals, get to watching and enjoy!"

"Davalon-Davalon","Null","0","3","22 May 2015"," Overrated, not brilliant and not a classic.
","I love Bob DeNiro and Joe Pesci. And I think in the right hands Sharon Stone can do a great job. But in this film, the best thing was seeing DeNiro in a brilliant new suit each time he appeared on screen. Here are my issues with the movie: <br/><br/>*The background soundtrack, all popular songs, almost always drowned out the dialog. I find that after watching a lot of movies, if the director doesn't feel 1) that we're going to get the message and/or 2) that there are some concerns over whether the scene is working or not, the quick fix seems to be, ""Pump up the jam!"" This is a terrible mistake. It makes it difficult to understand what's being said and the audience starts to lose what might be important information. This was a consistent problem throughout the film. <br/><br/>*As the movie went on, Joe Pesci slowly rose to the position of God. There's a scene where he yanks a phone off the wall and smashes it into Don Rickles, who works at DeNiro's casino as some kind of ancient security guard/yes-man. The point is... he works at the hotel and no one, not a single person, came to his defense. Joe, as Nicky, was allowed to slap, kick, sucker-punch anyone he goddamn wanted to without the least bit of concern as to whether there would be any repercussions. <br/><br/>*DeNiro signs a paper (at least the film makes it look that way) giving the contents of a money-filled safety box to Sharon Stone (who plays his wife, former prostitute, Ginger). Okay, that's his business. But, late in the movie, after she's gone on her inexplicable drug/alcohol binges, has tied up her daughter (Really? So she could have a night on the town?), and had an affair with Nicky (like she would!!!), she literally breaks into DeNiro's desk, as a police escort stands nearby, gets the key to the safety deposit box (because... somehow Bob got it back from her, even though he signed over the contents to her so that she would ""never have to worry"" if they broke up?), then goes to the bank to get her money (it's hers, Bob signed it over to her!) and then Bob is screaming into the phone, ""She can't do that. She can't legally do that"" ... and yet... he signed it over to her? So, in fact, she CAN do that. <br/><br/>*Marty would like us to believe that Joe returned home every morning, no matter what, to make breakfast for his darling little boy. You've got to be joking. While his wife did what? This man was an inconsiderate pig who thought women were mouths to put on his nether regions. Was this scene put in to show his ""sensitive"" side? He was a pig! So what that he made breakfast for his kid?! Did he ever think of what kind of role model he was to that child?... Yeah, I didn't think so. <br/><br/>*When Bob and Joe would argue, despite the fact that a lot of the dialog was funny, smart, smack-in-the-face kind of dialog, people don't talk like that. In other words, there was ALMOST no reaction time in between lines. You'd HAVE to know what the other person was saying to respond that quickly! I didn't buy it, although I enjoyed the exchanges. <br/><br/>*As others have pointed out, when Bob is screaming and yelling at people, he's kinda fun. But when he does this pathetically lame speech about what ""love"" is (no wonder Sharon Stone felt queasy about getting involved with him), all I could think is: This freak is a loser and he'd be better off buying ""love"" for the rest of his life. Sharon as Ginger tells him quite frankly that she doesn't ""feel that way"" about him. But Bobby won't take no as an answer... and, boy, does he pay for that. <br/><br/>* The overuse of the F word and every variant associated with. Why, Marty? It got so irritating and tiresome that it lost whatever impact they thought it was going to have. <br/><br/>*The voice-overs!!! Please, no! I was willing to buy one (Bob's), but then Joe chimes in, too, and then later, Frank Vincent, one of the many henchmen, chimes in, too! As others have said, this is lazy storytelling, there are things these people could NOT have known, and forced me to think, ""Okay, whose story is this? Am I rooting for anyone? Or is anyone who happens to be sitting in the studio when Marty wants a voice-over forced to get up and start jawing?"" I found it be intrusive, abusive and a coward's way out of telling a story. <br/><br/>*The level of violence was gag-inducing, covered with the loud soundtrack I mentioned before. If you like seeing people shot in the head, if you like seeing both men and women violently killed, if you like seeing Cosa Nostra type murders up close, including seeing Joe Pesci's character beaten to a pulp and buried alive, then you will be sure to have a good old time. <br/><br/>IF there was a story, it was about pathetic, stupid, sad, self-involved people whose only interest was money and squashing anyone else, and children, if there were any, bore the brunt of collateral damage. Sharon Stone snorting coke in front of her child! With her pimp berating the child! On the verge of harming the child! Yeah, yeah, I know; ""harsh reality"" torn from the pages of real life. So, if this is the sad mess of people's lives that you want to wade through... and three hours of it... have at it. IF Marty had actually done a bit more character development and not have essentially 1-2 note performances by every person in the film, then it could have been great. Right now, the best thing about it were Bob's suits."
"crendine","8","0","1","9 March 2015"," Good but a bit familiar
","Many reviewers have described this movie as ""Goodfellas Part Two"". While it's difficult to disagree with that assessment, I do feel that this picture has some merit of its own. Like Goodfellas, it is loosely based on a true story which adds some value. The presentation is very similar to Goodfellas but also provides different settings and plot twists. My major criticism is that of the length. It's just too long and contains a lot of unnecessary dialogue and extended scenery. However, Sharon Stone turns in one of the most brilliant performances of her career. All in all, a really good movie. Nothing totally original. But as stated before, a bit too long."

","If you've seen GoodFellas, chances are, you don't really need to see Casino. But it's a masterpiece, nonetheless, so why not? It stands as one of Scorsese's longest movies, only beaten by ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". But just like ""Wolf"", this movie will leave you on the edge of your seat, for a whopping 3 hours, never losing it's intensity for a second. Scorsese might be the only director in history to sustain such rapid fire, intense power on screen for that long. It's classic DeNiro and Pesci, enough said. The real unique gem of a performance in this movie belongs to Sharon Stone. She's plays a character about as despicable as the mobsters themselves, and fascinatingly enough, you'll tend to root against her. It's Scorsese's oldest tactic, which is to make you interested in awful people, and perhaps seeing the traits of them that are overlooked. Casino isn't Scorsese's best film, but it is a truly memorable, and watchable one."

","(70%) ""Goodfellas in Las Vegas"" holds up as one of the better crime movies of the 1990's. It's a movie of two halves with the first covering the operation as a whole with quite a lot of detail regarding the inner workings of their sleaze pit, and the second deals more with the downfall of each character. Sharon Stone plays one of the most hateful god-diggers ever, and Joe Pesci is more or less the same character he played in Goodfellas. The movie ends with other side of all that money, jewels, and luxury in a bitter tasting manner with a really quite brutal death scene highlighting the reality of greed and power and where it can lead. This is undoubtedly a good film, but Goodfellas is better, funnier, and overall stronger."

"RyanCShowers","Null","0","1","2 June 2013"," Great, but Great to Scorsese is Mediocre to The Everyday Director
","Trust. The fascinating theme and moral reassurance for Martin Scorsese's attempt to hit critics and audiences as hard as he hit them with his classic, Goodfellas. Unfortunately, his arm isn't strong enough to smack the audience on that level. However, he does leave a great impression thanks to his style, control, of course the two components that make his films the best of the best: his film editor and Robert DeNiro.<br/><br/>In Spanish, ""money"" is translated to ""diniro"". Hiring Robert DeNiro to star as the leading role in a film centered around gambling. The irony is fascinating. Thrown into a role that is more simplistic than past roles Scorsese has put DeNiro front and center for, DeNiro delivers the goods and is the MVP in Casino, when his two co-stars are given much more to raise a circus with. Speaking of, Joe Pesci. While one may question the actor's range with his role choices, no one can deny him the praise he deserves at knocking these types of characters through the wall and then some.<br/><br/>Talk about more irony. Sharon Stone was the only cast member (or crew member for that fact) to receive an Oscar nomination for her work in Casino. She gets to cry, she gets to yell, she gets to do drugs, but hardly is she ever to scratch below the surface and bring something real out in her character. Ginger is resorted to Stone's awkwardness on the screen, struggling through scenes other actresses could've killed by throwing a hissy fit. She doesn't work in the role. Not that the role isn't rooted in clichÃ©, unoriginality, and lacks the development needed to make this trite stereotype a quality character.<br/><br/>Much of the film is montage with narration guiding the viewer through the quick action. Scorsese films have tightly strung editing, but nothing ever like this has been produced before. The film barely gives us full length scenes until the last third, but those are drown in Stone's distracting acting efforts. It's a complete mystery to me how Casino was shot and edited; there are so many scenes to get caught up in that last 20 seconds at most some of them. Major props to the editing and Scorsese. I'm aware giving Scorsese praise in that fashion is redundant and expected with each film he directs, but here it's earned considering this is one of his weaker efforts.<br/><br/>The film's running time is a monstrous one, and coming from a person who checks their watch incessantly in a film that's over two hours, I didn't feel the length once. It kept me interested and invested in the happenings of the story. The viewer almost rides it like a raft down a river. But, just because it's watchable doesn't always mean it's worth watching. In this case, it is worth the flaws. Flaws, in which the film erupts with as does the opening scene's car bombing. The story is fun, minutely intriguing, and entertains us with the back dealings of Vegas and then seem. But somehow the story and the characters sometimes feel like they are struggling to stay above water. Casino is very reminiscent of The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, homaging the plot arc, specific scenes, themes, subject matters, and the iconic endings.<br/><br/>When I was growing up, my mother demanded respect at all times. Even when we were giving her respect beyond any of our peer's efforts for their parents, she still never felt it was enough. She was never going to be satisfied For DeNiro's character, Trust is his version of my mother's trust. He falls in love with Stone's character, knowing her tarnished reputation and her art of conning, but still he chooses to marry her and forces her to be loyal to him. Deep down he knows that he shouldn't trust her, but he lives reality as if she was worthy of his trust. Just as the average joe wants to believe Vegas is an honest place and in gambling you risk it all, but as the saying goes The House Always Wins. Perhaps DeNiro strives for personal strivings for trust result from his view of the unlawful acts of the city. Even though he tries to maintain legitimacy in his end of business dealings, maybe real trust cannot be found in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>RATING: 7.5/10<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"

The usual suspects are here and this pulsating, rhythmic, rocking Movie is nothing if not indulging. In fact, this great looking Movie goes so overboard in the third act with its Marital dysfunction, that it almost collapses like one of those Casino demolitions.<br/><br/>With its non-stop narration and relentless Music Soundtrack things move fast and frantic and sometimes looks so disorienting and bizarre that one might feel that the mind-altered mind of Hunter Thompson is behind the Camera.

","Las Vegas is a mythical place, a yellow brick road destination that came into being on the backs and bucks of men on the fringes of society who weren't constricted by petty, hypocritical morality. Naturally, it's a town of broken losers, desperate dreamers, and cold remorseless opportunists. So the most definitive, most emblematic American city is a paradox, promising pleasure but thriving on pain. This is the grim landscape that Casino occupies and Martin Scorsese is our gracious tour guide, pointing out all the garish, notorious landmarks with near reverential diligence.<br/><br/>DeNiro is convincing as the Jewish numbers expert Casino manager, Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, beholden to the mob and loyal to his would-be tough guy boyhood buddy, Nicky Santoro, played flawlessly by Joe Pesci, who shows up in town and complicates Ace's life. Ace has complicated things for himself, too, by hooking up with ex top dollar whore, Ginger McKenna, played by a raw and riveting Sharon Stone. Ginger's alcohol and drug soaked mind leads her into the arms of the wrong guy, the worst possible guy, setting the stage for an inevitable tragic showdown. No one escapes unpunished, but then again no one entered the game innocent.<br/><br/>It's a chilling image of a fiery hot world, burning white on the fumes of people's hope and fear, but it's a vision that's somehow sympathetic to the sad, twisted souls who choose to inhabit this godforsaken outpost. There's never an easy score, never an unearned jackpot. Every nickle and dime in Casino is hard fought, paid for with blood, sweat, and tears. It's often gruesome to witness the brutal depravity that passes for human behavior in Scorsese's films but it's never depressing. There's a sinister satisfaction to be found in all his dangerous, dark shenanigans, just like when you finally accept that you do in fact enjoy seeing other people get hurt. Or get killed.<br/><br/>It's not as groundbreaking or as awe inspiring as Raging Bull, or as epic as Goodfellas, or as ambitious as either. It's a somewhat more nuanced, mature version of that patented Scorsese style, this time not so much rejoicing in the opportunity to depict unconscionable violence, but certainly not ashamed of it's lurid excesses. If you choose to see all this as an expression of the curious - maybe demented - American psyche, then Scorsese has done his job. I think he's done it damn well."
"johnnyhbtvs27","10","0","1","2 July 2012"," Goodfellas II This Ain't
","When I first saw this movie I found it to be better than Goodfellas. Imagine my surprise upon reading reviews for this film that many critics proclaimed this to basically just be Scorsese going over old ground and being too much like Goodfellas. Why they presumed this I can see, but when looked at closer it is actually not that much alike.<br/><br/>The cast contains a number of similar faces in each movie such as De Niro, Pesci, Vincent Etc. But on the whole I found Casino to be more gripping than Goodfellas and just as well made. A scene near the end of this movie has the consequences of the characters actions throughout the movie shown to music by the animals in the form of the house of the rising sun. In Goodfellas the same similar consequences are shown to music from Derek And The Dominos' Layla (another captivating scene).<br/><br/>Going over old ground or not you can't deny that Casino is another winner for Scorsese, and if you think Joe Pesci was nuts in Goodfellas. you ain't seen nothing yet. From the soundtrack to the camera-work to the editing this film is almost perfect. Another reason I prefer this to Goodfellas is De Niro. He has a lot more to do in this than what he did in Goodfellas and the film benefits from him being lead again. James Woods also shines in almost a cameo role the way he struts in and out of the film several times then showing up for comedy effect later in the film. Sharon Stone got best Actress at Oscar for her performance (though good, I'm not her biggest fan) and she probably deserved it.<br/><br/>The opening credits should also get a mention for being quite possible the best I've ever seen and any film that opens with the 'death' of Robert De Niro would have anyone hooked. <br/><br/>In Conclusion this is a total masterpiece in my eyes and was way the best film of 95 and the fact it was beaten to best picture by Braveheart sickens me."

Casino follows a pair of gangsters who earned their reputations in Las Vegas in two very different ways. De Niro is Ace Rothstein, the man with the plan.

","I once saw a small piece of Casino, one of the later scenes in the movie between Robert DeNiro and Sharon Stone. Based on the scene, without knowing what was going on, I formed a notion that the movie was another loudmouthed violence film. I mentally, subliminally, resisted seeing it for the six or seven years since, even after taking in Goodfellas. It was seeing The Departed--twice--that convinced me to look into the picture.<br/><br/>Everything that can be said about its direction, camera-work, style, dialogue and overall quality has probably been said. But one thing that most reviewers have overlooked, and a nuance of the movie that I believe provides much pleasure in the watching, is how it addresses change. In this light we may interpret Scorcese's shots of coins running through the casino, like blood through veins, as sly visual clues.<br/><br/>On into the movie, Pesci and Stone share a line about how DeNiro's character has ""changed."" But one of the points Casino attempts to make is that no one really does change, no matter how hard they may or may not try, and no matter how hard someone tries to make them. After all of his friend's warnings and urgings, Pesci remains the hardheaded opportunist gangster; despite his old friend's growing disgust, DeNiro continues to try to make money within Vegas's politicized atmosphere; and Stone goes steadily along a destructive path to as much money and material goods as she can lay her hands on.<br/><br/>One of the genius things about the film, if so instinctive and everyday for us viewers as to be almost subliminal, is that the story is situational. Situations change, relationships between characters may change, but the characters themselves rarely do. The ways they react to these changes around them may or may not be expected, but they are the ways real people would react. Pesci and DeNiro were always a thug and a penny-pincher, respectively, but they grew up as friends; their surroundings never created a conflict between them before they went to Vegas. Similarly, Stone always coveted the material, but her new relationship with DeNiro begins to strain her sense of independence.<br/><br/>This is a movie that functions in layers of action and psychology: violence as a means to an end, the effects of power and greed, the straining of relationships, how we adapt to new situations, etc. All played out by a cast of very capable actors by the hand of a very able director."

The hotel remained opened until 2001.<br/><br/>The Tangiers was 'created' at the Landmark Hotel-Casino, which had been closed since 1990. Martians destroyed the hotel (The Galaxy Hotel in Mars Attacks!) in 1995.<br/><br/>The Landmark Hotel-Casino was imploded 11-7-95 and was, at the time, the second tallest building in the world to be imploded (by only a few feet).

Frank Rosenthal (""Ace"") was a sports bettor hero as he was responsible for the sports book concept in Las Vegas casinos - Stardust being the first.

The end of an era for Las Vegas.<br/><br/>One poster stated the tale was based on the Sands - it was actually the Stardust and many, many of the names were changed.

The late '70s-early '80 days were under a lot of Gaming Commision scrutiny with Harry Reid at the helm - who also had a bomb attached to his car once - and cops like Joe Blasko, who was a leak to Anthony Spilotro.<br/><br/>The narration?

It was much worse than what Scorcese is capable of at the top of his game, however, which makes it watchable.

He falls in love with a hooker (Ginger), marries her, and then his best friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci, playing a trigger-happy psycho for once!) comes and wants his share of what Vegas has to offer. Except Nicky's not even trying to go straight. Ginger ends up an abusive, cheating junkie bitch on wheels, and Nicky, by virtue of his relations with Ace, ends up messing Ace's life up in a big way. A main theme in this movie is trust - Ace begins with saying there can be no love without trust, and by the end it turns out Ace shouldn't have trusted anybody. Robert De Niro gave a pretty good performance - nothing compared, of course, to Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, or The King of Comedy - but he is from head to toe a fundamentally good guy with his head on right, who in fact tends to live too much in his head until he crashes for Ginger. He recovers quickly enough, though, and although he isn't perfect, we want him to win. One of the interesting points of the performance is that even though Ace is so logical and tough, when he gets hurt it's unbearable. Joe Pesci was OK, nothing compared to his performance in Raging Bull of course, and while I'm tempted to say Sharon Stone was awful she wasn't that bad. In my opinion Scorcese was a lot better before all the expensive sets and frou-frou camera-work. It just gets in the way of his message. I guess ultimately it's about how your life adds up at the end of the day, and how you can escape your past. It's got a very Catholic tone to it with respect to absolution - it seems to convey the thought that if you're just sorry enough for your sins, everything will work out."

","Casino is by almost all standards a great film. Its got a great ensemble cast,Sharon Stone gives one of the best performances iv seen by her and *obviously De Niro and Pesci are great. The film follows a rise and fall structure just like Goodfellas, which is probably why people are comparing them, and it follows the story of Ace Rothstein(De Niro) running a casino in Las Vegas which is under control by the mob. Aces operations in Nevada are put into jeopardy by the behaviour of his wife (stone) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and many elements contribute to a kind of decline for Ace.<br/><br/>The film isn't one of Scorseses best - but that means almost nothing in the general scheme of things- as its still great and infinitely watchable. The previous reviewer said the soundtrack was kind of like a mix tape but id disagree. The soundtrack coincides perfectly with the great moments in the film and reinforces them as well. I can see his point though,there are so many great tracks in there that it kind of seems like Scorsesee just picked the great ones but then again they tend to fit whats going on on screen, such as I ain't superstitious playing over a scan of the casino, and Gimme Shelter by the stones playing to the montage of murders ( like Goodfellas) and for music fans its almost worth watching just for the music.<br/><br/>One of the great things about films is its look, its really appealing to watch because of it and is pretty fascinating as well if your into that kind of thing. ( I dunno if I bought a dodgy version or something but i found there were bright lights around the characters which were hard not to notice- everyone else see that?)The storyline and themes are also interesting (unless your really fed up with gangster films. The direction is superb as usual and its a pretty flashy film as well,definitely more goodfellas than Raging Bull. There's lots of swish-pans and stuff and its fun to watch.<br/><br/>The thing this film probably lacks more than anything is emotional engagement and if you are after that this isn't the perfect film for you because Scorsese doesn't really nail that emotion engagement (whether he was trying to or not i don't know) but if you just want a couple of hours entertainment then this films is strongly recommended. Iv seen the movie three times and it was great every time. If your new to Scorsese films then I would recommend buying other films before this i.e Raging Bull,Goodfellas,Taxi Driver because they are probably a bit better but what can i say ,I ain't seen a bad film by the guy (Cape fear was ace).<br/><br/>Basically this is a great films, just don't expect Goodfellas 2 , it isn't quite that good. Most of the elements of the film are good - music,acting,cinematography and it adds up to an enjoyable film. Buy i."

","Martin Scorsese is one of our finest directors and Casino may not be one of his best films such as Taxi Driver or the very similar Goodfellas, or his worst such as the horrible mess called Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, and instead comes about at the level of The Aviator and maybe Age of Innocence. Scorsese has a fascination with the mafia and there is a lot you could say about the mafia, unfortunately most of it wouldn't work for a Hollywood film so he keeps telling practically the same story over and over again which is unfortunate. So once again we see this cool mob man played by Robert De Niro in a superb performance who is well standing in the community, and than we have his boy-hood friend the psychotic played by Joe Pesci who once again deserves and Oscar, and well we go from there. The film is masterfully written, acted and directed with very nice visual effects but is to familiar and long to be very engaging."

","Okay, so this is no Goodfellas, but if you like Goodfellas then it's well worth a watch. It's funny to see a role reversal with DeNiro and Pesci from Raging Bull. Now Pesci is the 'animale' and DeNiro the placid, reasonable man. Pesci is scary here, another classic movie psycho.<br/><br/>Sharon Stone is excellent in this film too. If you like Scorcese's style (pauses, tracking shots, voiceovers, Rolling Stones music) then this is well worth checking out.<br/><br/>Having said that, it only ranks after Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets and Goodfellas.

","Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again. What an incredible movie! This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in. Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch a lot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold. Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career. Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it. This film is truly a gem you don't find often."

"MichaelMargetis","9","0","1","21 July 2005"," ""Running a casino is like robbing a bank with no cops around. For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's like a morality car wash."" - Sam 'Ace' Rothstein
","Unfortunately, many people have slanted view that 'Casino' is basically 'GoodFellas' with a different name. I can definitely see why people would feel that away, after all it's a mobster movie based on a true story, Joe Pesci plays a crazed mental midget, Robert DeNiro plays the sly and cool leading male and f-bombs are dropped almost every second. I don't criticize people that feel 'Casino' is a bit of a rip-off, but I believe it's not. My experience of viewing Martin Scorsese's brutal and bloody classic 'Casino' is that it's similar in a lot of ways to 'GoodFellas', but it's a different film. 'Casino' isn't so much about the ups and downs of organized crime, as it is about how Vegas really got started, and it just so happens it was started by a greedy, ruthless and scary syndicate -- the Italian mafia.<br/><br/>'Casino' follows the true tale of Jewish tough-guy, Sam 'Ace' Rothestein (Robert DeNiro). In the heart of the 1970s, Ace is approached about running the Tangiers Hotel & Casino casino floor, which is run by the mob. Ace is told by another Jewish mafia associate, Andy Stone (Alan King) that he doesn't won't even require a gaming commission license to run Tangiers, since the gaming commission is ten-years behind registrations. Everything seems to be set financially for Ace, as long as he allows the mob soldiers to skim a percentage of the casino's money for the bosses of the different crime families. Ace is being protected by his best friend and mob capo, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and his crew of misfits. Nicky is cruel, lascivious, greedy and has a very short temper that when tested causes him to act outrageously violent and demoniac. Things are going great between Ace and Nicky, then Ace meets the seemingly beautiful and kind, but actually selfish and rapacious Ginger (Sharon Stone). Ace falls for Ginger and the two eventually get married, but have severe marital problems involving Ginger's old flame, the sleazy and conniving Lester Diamond (James Woods) and Ginger's drug and alcohol abuse. When everything seems so perfect and mirthful for Ace, his world falls apart very rapidly before his eyes. His wife is crazy, he's loosing money, he's having problems in general with the Tangiers casino and his once solid but now rocky relationship with the malignant goon, Nicky. The film also stars Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, Dick Smothers, John Bloom, L.Q. Jones and Kevin Pollack as the owner of the Tangiers Hotel & Casino.<br/><br/>What 'Casino' really boils down to is being a tale of avarice and it's consequences. The film starts out very optimistic and satisfying for all the characters, but quickly and abruptly turns sour for everyone. It perfectly demonstrates how money and wealth consumes you and changes you; especially in the case of having Ace and Nicky be bosom buddies in the beginning but end up loathing each other so much that they considering whacking one another. 'Casino' may drag a tiny bit in it's two hour and fifty-nine minute runtime, but when it's all over it turns out to be an excellent film. Martin Scorsese does another incredible job behind the camera, while the actors are even more solid in this one then in 1990's similar mob movie 'GoodFellas'. Robert DeNiro should have earned an Oscar nomination for his perfect portrayal of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein the Jew with Italian-mob connections who always plays his cards right. Joe Pesci is great as to be expected as the barbaric and cutthroat gangster, Nicky, but no where near as excellent as he was as the heartless waste of human life he played so impeccably in 'GoodFellas'. But the show really belongs to Sharon Stone in an impressive and remarkable performance as the crazy but ultimately pathetic junkie trophy wife of Ace. I never really thought she was a good actress until 'Casino', and in the film she really proves herself. James Woods is ideally cast as the film's undeniably unlikable parasite and Don Rickles is very upstanding in his role. The film features Frank Vincent (who you may know as the creepy mob villain, Phil Leotardo in HBO's hit drama 'The Sopranos') as Nicky Santoro's right man. The film has a lively music score and Scorsese and Nicholas Pillegi deliver a fine screenplay.<br/><br/>If you haven't already, take three hours to sit down with a big ass bowl of popcorn and watch Scorsese's 'Casino', but only after you've seen 'GoodFellas'. You may not enjoy or appreciate it's brutal violence, crude language and overall staunch ferocity, but hey, odds are you may enjoy it if you give it a chance.

","I remember seeing about half of the film, but I never finished it, and then I saw it listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die which annoyed me, so I had to watch it all the way through, from Golden Globe nominated director Martin Scorcese. Basically the film gives us an insight into the dark world behind the glitz and glimmer of Las Vegas, the gambling capital of America, maybe even the world. Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) runs one of the biggest and most successful casinos in Vegas, the Tangiers, with Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) helping him out, they are the mobsters that know everything there is to know about the running of a casino. They know how that the customer are never the winners, the money goes through a system of checks, they can spot the cheaters, and they know how the staff should be doing their jobs in the way they want. For about an hour and a quarter the film consists of the two friends, since childhood, narrating their knowledge of the gambling business, and then Ace meets Ginger McKenna (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Sharon Stone), a sure fire charmer to lure rich gamblers into the joint. Ace is the smooth operator, while the often troubling Nicky is the violent one who will beat someone if they cross the casino. As I mentioned, there is a dark side to the world of Las Vegas, and that is seen by Ace and Nicky, as Ace is lured into loving a hustler who he wrongly trusts with his most treasured assets, and Nicky gets involved with too much violence, drugs and alcohol. In the end, the whole casino and all of its building blocks come tumbling down, all the key staff members and mob heads are killed, including Nicky who is beaten heavily and buried alive, Ginger gets shot, and Ace only just survives his car blowing up. Also starring James Woods as Lester Diamond, Toy Story's Don Rickles as Billy Sherbert, Rush Hour 2's Alan King as Andy Stone, Kevin Pollak as Phillip Green, L.Q. Jones as Pat Webb, Dick Smothers as Senator and Frank Vincent as Frank Marino. DeNiro and Pesci both create vibrant gangster like characters, and Stone certainly deserved her Academy Award nomination for being a real hard-edge vamp, filled with the same sort of stuff GoodFellas gave us, the lust for power, the domination of money, some sleaze and some really graphic scenes, it is certainly a must see crime drama. Very good!"

","What a daring piece of cinema Casino is. Martin Scorsese holds nothing back in this masterpiece from the 1990s. Many consider Casino to be the sequel to Goodfellas. I completely agree with this, and for many reasons. And, if this truly is a sequel, I believe that Casino is the greatest sequel in the history of film-making. And I believe that Casino is better than Goodfellas, but not by much. This film is very in depth about the lives of gangsters and how casinos are managed. Parts of Casino feel like a documentary. Robert De Niro delivers one of his best performances as Ace. Sharon Stone is unbelievably believable as Ginger, who drastically changes as the film continues. Joe Pesci steels the movie yet again, playing Nicky, who acts very similar to the character that he played in Goodfellas. The lighting is beautiful and very shiny. Scorsese pulled it off once again. I heard that he claimed that after this film he would never return to violence. He did. Casino is one heck of a thrill ride. You must see this picture."

He doesn't play the typical Italian here. If he sees someone cheating at a table, he lets them go with a warning instead of killing them.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci, on the other hand is very similar to the character he played in 'Goodfellas'. His job is to make sure that nobody messes with Ace. He ends up going too far. After sleeping with Ace's wife, not taking orders from the bosses back home and doing things his own way, it's obvious he has to suffer the consequences.<br/><br/>Sharon Stone is at her best here as the gold digger and drunk wife.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Casino' is a well acted movie, but as I said it's not for everyone to see.

"HulkVader","8","0","1","9 February 2005"," Brings back memories
","Casino is an excellent and very accurate portrayal of events that shape a part of the recent history of Las Vegas. For those of us who have been in Las Vegas for the last 30 years or more, we well remember Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal (portrayed in the film as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein), the diminutive but brutally violent Anthony ""The Ant"" Spilotro (Nicky Santoro), casino front man Alan Glick (Philip Green), and the early days of the Stardust Hotel (The Tangiers). We also recall Spilotro's crew, ""The Hole in the Wall Gang"" who, as depicted in the film, were notorious for jewelry store heists wherein their method of entry was, yes, drilling holes in the walls. Rosenthal ran more than one casino at the height of his authority, including the Fremont, Hacienda, and Marina Hotels.<br/><br/>Of course, the time lines in the film have been doctored a bit for the sake of story-telling. For instance, the man (named Bill McCarthy) who's head Spilotro (Santoro) put in a vise and tightened to the point of popping an eye out of it's socket actually occurred back in Chicago, prior to Spilotro being sent to Vegas to protect Rosenthal and the Stardust's skim. Incidentally, Spilotro was first sent to Miami to function in the same capacity of protecting Rosenthal. In the film, Santoro's reputation was primarily built through the torture and murder of the fella in the vise. In reality, Spilotro's reputation was well in place, at least among the wise guys, by the time he arrived in Las Vegas. As for Rosenthal, we remember his awful television show after his first tangle with the GCB although, to this day, Lefty emphatically denies ever juggling on the show as Deniro did in the movie! Though, another truth in the film, once the increasingly power-hungry and reckless Spilotro became involved with Rosenthal's wife, Geri (Ginger in the movie), things were already going downhill. In 1986, the bodies of Anthony and Michael Spilotro were found buried in an Indiana cornfield. They had been bludgeoned to near-death prior to being buried. The amount of dirt in their lungs indicated they had been buried alive. Geri Rosenthal was, indeed, found dead in a California motel from a ""hot load"", a drug overdose. Alan Glick still resides in California (if memory serves) in a well fortified residence, likely still wary of retribution for his role, ignorance aside, in the downfall of the enterprise.<br/><br/>Nicholas Pileggi got a lot of it right, as did Martin Scorsese. Casino is a great film. It was an extremely interesting time in Las Vegas in the 70's and 80's, one that I am not likely to ever forget.

","Hey, it's a good movie. One of my favorites. However, it gets choppy at times, and the second half is all about marital strife. It gets old. It gets tiring. Overall, the acting is superb, the direction is awesome, and the trademark death scenes are great."
"Tug-3","Null","0","1","22 November 1998"," It made me kind of sick.
","I can usually understand varying points of view on a film.  I know that there are some people who actually enoy movies like *The Mighty Ducks* and *Gordy,* and I can accept that.  But *Casino* confuses me to no end.  I simply can't understand why anybody would want to watch such a violent, unpleasant, irritating movie.  I'm a pretty liberal guy, and I've seen plenty of ultra-violent films, but this is the only one that left me really unsettled with its complete reliance on brutality as a plot device.  I don't want to see people getting hit with baseball bats for five minutes--do you? If so, please seek help and stay the hell away from me.  Also, the acclaim given to Sharon Stone mystifies me.  People--really--feel free to admit that she's not a good actress.  She wasn't good in *King Solomon's Mines,* she wasn't good in *Basic Instinct,* and she's melodramatic and unconvincing in this worthless film."
"glopezruelas","8","0","1","31 October 2000"," yes, underrated...but could be even better
","I have heard several times that this movie is underrated, and it is, to some extent.  This movie became a clichÃ© the very moment it came out since it was directed, written and starred by the exact same people as Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Overall, Casino is a good movie, but maybe if it would've come out before 1995 (and 1990, for that matter), would have been more sucessful, and less criticized.  Also, I definitively think this is not Scorscese's best film...Goodfellas, Raging Bull are of more quality."

","Well if you don`t mind me being a little bit honest,a very scary movie!And I vowed never to go to Las Vagas.Something to do with the Desert!Though I very much enjoyed the acting of both sexes. Guess I`am where I`am suspose to be. Anyway the acting is as real as I have ever seen it.And SHARON STONE is absolutely breathtaking to watch on the screen weather at home or on the television.In fact thats why Iam writting to give its rateing a very easy,and successful ten."

","My neighbor (20+ years ago, in another state) was the national transportation director for a MAJOR US corporation, and he regularly had to go to Las Vegas to meet with Teamster bosses.  I just assumed that he was overhyping his stories, but, after seeing this movie, I now understand that I was very wrong in my gratuitous dismissal.  LV is now (as the movie observes) another Disneyland, but I know someone who just returned from another part of NV, and she has assured me that there are still ""a lot of holes in the desert"".  Just be aware, as you watch this wonderfully-made film, that it is NOT fiction."
"Kihan","Null","0","1","6 November 1998"," DeNiro/Pesci look like the real life ppl!
","The most interesting thing I noticed about the movie was that DeNiro and Pesci looked nearly identical to the real life people their characters portrayed. I had been watching a special about Las Vegas in the '70's and early '80's, and pictures were shown of the real people that were involved in the situations portrayed in ""Casino""; the similarities were nearly frightening. Congratulations to Scorsese for a very well made movie!"
"fowler1","Null","0","1","17 February 2000"," Scorsese At His Best - And Worst
","Since GOODFELLAS, Scorsese's gone beyond Great Director status; his talent, vision and confidence, combined with his unofficial coronation among serious moviehounds as King of the Medium, have elevated him to Virtuoso. Every one of his 90s projects feature staggering camera movement, audacious violence, tour-de-force visual setpieces. The opening of this film - DeNiro spinning up and out of an exploding Caddy in glittering slo-mo, segueing into credits superimposed over state-of-the-art montage work...your opinion of the film's morality aside, it's the kind of jaw-dropping stunner that has become a Scorsese trademark. Like the Copa sequence in GOODFELLAS, it's the unbridled brio of a director who has not just Arrived, but occupies a plateau where his only remaining competition is with himself. If only he had the ability to pull back now and then and maintain some perspective...but his style of complete immersion into the story he is telling, more and more often these days, leaves him adrift without a moral compass here. And, Lord, could CASINO use one. It's not simply the violence on display, but the soul-dead callousness of every last living, creeping or crawling thing in the film that numbs me even as I'm awed by the compositional fireworks of the filmmaking. Everyone in this film is either vicious and corrupt, or weak and corrupt, and several characters are both at once. The 'love' story between DeNiro and a shrill, hollow Sharon Stone is like a sick parody of romantic love. The gangster/buddy angle is nil, as we see from frame one that De Niro and Pesci's 'friendship' is mutually suspicious and parasitic. The Vegas 'backstory' angle, which dominates the first hour, is visually riveting as you'd expect - Scorsese employs every type of shot in the lexicon of moviemaking here, taking the viewer on the ultimate insider's tour of how a casino operates - all in the service of the most cynical of themes: the fix is in, there are only predators and prey, and the prey deserve their agony - otherwise they'd be in on the feeding frenzy. This is part of the increasingly ugly side of Scorsese: his conscious sacrifice of any moral center, the better to solidify his appeal to the sociopath audience, probably embodied in the gangster types he grew up with in Little Italy. Or am I alone in noticing that the amoral-adolescent audience (of ALL ages) who fetishize unfeeling 'hardness' respond and identify so strongly with his latter-day work, almost as visual aids to help achieve a zen-like serenity in ruthlessness? I've heard audiences laugh in approving hilarity at some of the most appalling brutality in his films, dating back to RAGING BULL but really emerging with GOODFELLAS, which parallels his increasing disregard for protagonists who represent any kind of moral conflict. The Joe Pesci of RAGING BULL was a torn and vulnerable individual; the Pesci of CASINO is a conscienceless thug, period. You feel nothing when he dies, not even revulsion at the blood and viscera of the scene. He's one more fly whose time has come to have his wings pulled off. There are no more Charlies (of MEAN STREETS) in Scorsese's urban films, or even Travis Bickles, to truly disturb an audience by awakening their own dormant conflicting emotions. There are only Max Cadys, Nicky Santoros, Jimmy Conways. Heroes, even nominal ones, are quickly trivialized into hypocrites, cowards, rats and larval psychopaths. One wonders if Scorsese, for all his brilliance, could have ascended so high in the current pop-culture firmament without throwing out any belief in something better than remorseless efficiency and murder-as-commerce like so much sentimental ballast. He could have been, still can be, the Michaelangelo of cinema. Of course, Goya was a great artist too, but how long before he abandons being Goya for Joe Coleman?"

","I won't even go into what is powerfully moving in this epic combination of the styles of Kubrick's 2001 and Vincente Minnelli's shrill melodramas. I'll just say that in his mastery of composition, editing, color, design and above all movement, Martin Scorsese shows here that he has no peer--no peer in the present, and none in the past. For anyone interested in the first revolution in film language since Griffith...rent it."
"Andrew-162","9","0","1","4 February 2000"," Great, except....
","This movie could seriously have been a classic. There are so, so many things right about the movie. The performances of the three main characters--DeNiro, Stone, and Pesci, are standard excellence. The script makes the movie quite enjoyable to watch. The sleazy vision of Las Vegas(visually as well as mentally) is well made. Scorceses direction is practically flawless, and the first hour of background on the Casino is some of the best footage of the 90's. This movie would have made my top 50 of all time except for one little problem....It is a pure carbon-copy of Goodfellas. The two main characters (Pesci, DeNiro) are the same, the general plotline (Naive rookie to the playing field sees the glamour at first in the business but soon realizes that the violence and politics might end in his own demise) is the same, the director and his style of direction is the same, the movie is shaped in the same way, etc.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a better movie, see Goodfellas. If you're looking for a more entertaining movie, see either of them."

","What more can you ask for when you see this film. Its has an interesting plot, with an outstanding cast. The film shows how the mob really acts in vegas. And like usual Robert DeNiro, Sharon Stone, and Joe Pesci show excellent performances. I actually like this a touch more then Goodfellas. This is one of the best."

","I just saw this recently on video for the first time.  Another vintage Joe Pesci character, I laughed out loud quite a few times at his voice-overs. DeNiro as always is the man, and Sharon Stone has never been better.<br/><br/>Starts out fast in a slam bang what's gonna happen next mode.  I was riveted.  Unfortunately the second half of the film was more like Divorce His/Divorce Hers than Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Not Mr. Scorsese's best but see it anyway."

","I think this is one of the great movies of all time. Scorcese again proved he can make Mob movies like nobody else. De Niro and Pesci rule together and even Sharon Stone proved he could be a great actress whenever the people around here are great as well. Evrybody should see this one!!!!!!!111"

","By far Martin Scorsese`s best film but it´s very well acted and well directed.The bad thing in the movie is that Sharon Stone´s Character has no deep and she has a big part of the film.Still it´s a VERY brutal film that I recommend but if you are going to see a gangster film see Godfather instead.4/5"
"cocaine_rodeo","Null","0","1","18 July 2001"," Casino, Ca-seen-it
","This movie was better when it was called GoodFellas. Now since Scorsese is such a great director, I figured it would be a good gangster drama, but it was really just a flashier, longer, gorier, dryer version of GoodFellas. Now GoodFellas is my #3 movie, and I guess that I would have liked this film had it had more originality.<br/><br/> James Woods and Sharon Stone did a great job in this film, Stone was a very convincing junky, as was Woods. As for De Niro and Pecsi, they've done this sort of thing before. I guess that if my expectations weren't so high for this movie I would have enjoyed it more, because a good deal of the time I enjoy no-brainer action movies, but I was hoping for a good movie, which turned out to be a regurgitated and much less plausible version of Scorsese's classic film. <br/><br/> But it's not all that bad of a film, I mean the flashy images of Las Vegas and the casinos were well shot, and some of the dialogue was good, but I didn't keep me interested for 3 hours. 5/10"

","I love this movie!  I can watch it over and over and over again and still find something new that I never noticed before.  Robert DeNiro is wonderful as the casino mgr and the ""golden jew"".  Who could be more evil than Joe Pesci putting a guy's head in a vise??? This is Sharon Stone's best role ever playing the hustler and a junkie who cannot give up her loser ex-boyfriend Lester Diamond.  Definetly a great movie to see."
"OOBE","Null","0","1","12 April 2001"," AMAZING !
","After seeing other great Scorsese and De Niro collaborations, such as, Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, I was sceptical about whether Casino could live up to those predecessors, well, I was completely blown away, this is definitely in my top 5 films ever, maybe 1st. Why ? The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is first rate, and once it is over, you cant help but yearn to see it again. Many critics, said this film was overlong, and somewhat boring, they know nothing ! This film is a definite must see. Absolutely essential viewing. Far better than other Scorsese / De Niro efforts."
"Monkey Bastard","Null","0","2","7 April 2001"," A highly religious tale
","A three hour masterpiece, accused to be ""GoodFellas all over again"" by those who don't know any better.<br/><br/>The first hour seems almost like a documentary on how to become a proper gangster, while the last hour reminds me of a drama by Swedish writer/director Lars Norén.<br/><br/>But when it comes down to it, this is not just a story about gangster trying to make it big in Lag Vegas. It's much deeper than, and the metaphores are obvious. Martin Scorsese always uses religious elements, usually Catholic, in his movies to accentuate the story, but here he decided to go for the big one and tell the classical tale of God.<br/><br/>Yeah, you heard me. God. It's so obvious that it surprises me that no other reviewer has mentioned this. It's simple, DeNiro's character is God, trying to create order in this thing he has created, while Pesci's character is Lucifer, always rebellious, always trying to break free and create something of his own. Pesci's character is even named Nick, which is an old name for Satan."
