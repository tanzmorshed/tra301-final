"Nazi_Fighter_David","8","72","78","29 April 2005"," The film's propaganda message was widely misunderstood at the time
","More than one director has realized that the perfect plausible way of confining your characters to provide suspense is to put them in a boat  a mini-world of people, unable to get away from each other and isolated in the vast impersonal ocean with perils of its own...<br/><br/>The film is set in World War II An Allied ship was sunk by a German U-boat and a mixed bunch of survivors got away in the lifeboat The enemy submarine was also sunk by the explosion and its Nazi commander joined the survivors in their lifeboat <br/><br/>At first they were prepared to throw him overboard  but it was his skill which saved their little craft and gradually, while the allies were torn by dissension, selfishness, divided aims and views, his single-minded strength of purpose and his disciplined abilities took command Unknown to the others, he was stealing their rations to keep up his strength, and directing them towards a rendez-vous with a German supply ship<br/><br/>Tallulah Bankhead, incidentally, dominated the acting of the whole fine cast except possibly Walter Slezak, as the Nazi As the woman journalist, keeping close to her material possessions, and only emotionally more friendly, she gave a performance with the power and the pain of a thirty feet salt wave<br/><br/>It is ironic that the film's propaganda message, which I believe weakened and over-simplified it, was widely misunderstood at the time Hitchcock intended to show at that stage of the war that the democracies should settle their differences and unite forces against the common enemy, who was disciplined, strong, and knew just where he was going Instead, a lot of people attacked the film for showing the strongest character as the Nazi!<br/><br/>""Lifeboat"" is an interesting thriller from the mounting tensions of the interplay of conflicting characters, trapped and isolated in the planks of their little boat"
"tripper0","9","65","77","23 May 2002"," another great experiment....
","""Lifeboat"" is an excellent film.  It is a great achievement by Alfred Hitchcock that he could create a film set on only a lifeboat interesting for its duration.  Hitchcock had a knack for experimental films, such as ""Rope"", which seems to be one continuous shot, and ""Rear Window"", which features one small apartment and a man in a wheel chair. With so little, he is always able to do so much. <br/><br/>In ""Lifeboat"", we start out with the sinking of a ship and people gathering on the lifeboat.  It's really that simple.  This is a character driven film. There are no lush chase sequences, there are no gunfights, there is no mystery.  Nope, its all about how this collection of characters interact with each other.  Its a study of how difference of opinion can creat tensions, and how people can deal with those tensions.  Its really fascinating to watch, and when its all said and done, you get the impression that it wasn't just an experiment, but that it had something to say, and it did.<br/><br/>The only slight flaw in the film is that we don't really get a sense of how long(exactly)they've been at sea.  I ""Cast Away"" we saw Tom Hanks lost a considerable amount of weight and grow a considerable amount of hair.  Well, that is the one thing you don't see with this movie.  Its really a minor quibble anyway because it doesn't diminish the entertainment value at all.<br/><br/>Hitchcock was the master of suspense, but he was never afraid to try other things, from screwball comedy(Mr. and Mrs.Smith) to psychological thrillers(Vertigo).  This film is definitely one of his best and most interesting experiments.  9 out of 10."
"Snow Leopard","Null","44","51","12 August 2002"," Quite Interesting
","One of the things that made Hitchcock great was his willingness to experiment, rather than just sticking with a proven formula all of the time. While not all of his experimental movies measure up to his greatest achievements, they're always worth watching, and ""Lifeboat"" is much more than just watchable.  It's a tense drama that combines psychology and action in an efficient and memorable style.<br/><br/>This is quite an interesting movie in several respects, and not least for the ways that Hitchcock squeezes so much out of one single setting.  Into the simple ""Lifeboat"" setting, he puts lots of details that are both interesting and appropriate.  The characters are interesting and believable, and most of all, the story is full of both suspense and substance.  As an extra bonus, there is one of Hitchcock's most creative cameo appearances.<br/><br/>Aside from the technical features, it is also noteworthy to see the ways that the characters are portrayed, with the contrasts among them perhaps a bit stylized at times, but done so as to make some important points.  The cast does a good job in making each of the characters come to life, and all of them get a chance to have some good moments.  It all fits together to make an unusual movie that is well worth watching."
"sabby","7","51","60","16 April 1999"," I'd like to be lost at sea with this great cast anyday
","In one of Alfred Hitchcock's earliest films, six people with different personalities and backgrounds are stranded together in a lifeboat after the passenger-carrying freighter they are on is sunk by a German u-boat in the Mid-Atlantic. The cast includes the fabulous Tallulah Bankhead as a bitchy photo-journalist, Hume Cronyn as kind-hearted man who finds love on the lifeboat, Canada Lee as a kind steward, Walter Slezak as a mysterious German, and John Hodiak who has to dodge Tallulah's nonstop advances. Hitchcock did this film on one set - the single lifeboat. What's amazing is that he could keep things interesting for two hours, but he managed to somehow. Bankhead is this movie's greatest asset. Reportedly, she didn't wear underwear on the set and constantly kept the crew at attention! This is a great, novel film."
"Infofreak","Null","93","114","26 March 2003"," One of Hitchcock's best that rarely gets a mention. Don't overlook this one!
","'Lifeboat' must be extremely high on the list of THE most underrated Alfred Hitchcock movies! I very rarely hear anyone talk about this little gem, which is a damn shame as it is as good as many of Hitch's better known films. The plot is simple but the film makes the most of it with inventive direction, a strong script, and an interesting ensemble cast, most of whom are very good. I believe that Tallulah Bankhead irritates many people but I thought she was effective enough and well cast.  I must say I was much more interested in Walter Slezak who played the Nazi and John Hodiak the tattooed tough guy. Both were excellent performances that really added to my enjoyment of the movie. Anybody who likes Hitchcock who hasn't seen 'Lifeboat' is in for a treat. Don't overlook this one. It's dated in some ways sure, but still much more entertaining than 90% of today's so-called thrillers. I strongly recommend it."
"Sprewell","10","52","65","9 February 1999"," As gut-wrenching as any Hitchcock
","For some reason, ""Lifeboat"" has remained a relatively obscure and overlooked Hitchcock film. True, the pace is nothing like a North By Northwest or Rear Window, but the level of drama provided is as high as any of Hitchcock's films, early or late. The scene where the mother wakes up in Tallulah's fur coat and asks where her little Johnny is was one of the most gut wrenching scenes I've ever seen in a movie, and I've seen plenty of movies. The movie, while wonderfully developing its own nine characters, also raises questions aimed at the viewer, pointedly questioning how each one of us would react in those certain situations. Personally, I thought the movie was another Hitchcock masterpiece, and I would definitely give it four out of four stars."
"jotix100","10","40","50","10 March 2005"," U Boat
","John Steinbeck's story was cleverly adapted by Jo Swerling, although it appears Ben Hecht was also a collaborator in the screen play. Without a doubt, Alfred Hitchcock scored another hit with ""Lifeboat"". For being done in one set, the boat, the movie never feels claustrophobic. The camera work is extremely effective because it conveys the hard voyage these survivors undertook after their Trans Atlantic ship was attacked by a German U boat.<br/><br/>The mood in the boat is driven by a sense of survival. The motley crew that gets on board after the shipwreck presents an assortment of people so different, but joined together by their predicament. It would have been highly impossible if these lives ever met, had it not been for the accident.<br/><br/>The characters are well defined. We see a glamorous reporter who manages to be in the boat by herself right after the wreck. The earthy Constance finds more from this experience than with her own work. Kovac, is the rough sailor who takes command. Gus, the injured sailor can't do much more but rely on happy moments in order to keep sane after his terrible predicament. Willy, the devious German, who the group rescues, has an agenda, but the others are too involved in their own problems to see right through this man. Sparks and Alice finally find peace and love with one another. The rich man, Rittenhouse realizes his money is not worth anything if they are not rescued soon.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's direction is what made ""Lifeboat"" the fine movie, and the classic it became. In a way, the ending is completely anti-climatic as the survivors realize Willy, the captain has steered them into a trap, but at the same time, after they watch the other German ship destroyed by an Allied vessel, they rescue a sailor, who threatens them, but is easily overpowered. We never see them saved, but we know they will be taken care by the approaching ship.<br/><br/>Tallulah Bankhead is excellent as Constance. In fact, her performance is perhaps exaggerated in order to convey the sophistication of the character. Little by little she is reduced to nothing as she loses all her material possessions, so dear to her and accepts the reality of the situation. John Hodiak, as Kovac, offers a mysterious side, as well as commanding power. William Bendix as Gus, offers a man who keeps thinking about happier times with his girlfriend.<br/><br/>Walter Slezak's performance is also equally satisfying. We know from the beginning he is hiding things from the people in the boat, but at the same time, he offers their only salvation. Hume Cronyn, an actor that worked with Hitchcock in a few movies, is good as Sparks. Mary Anderson is the sweet Alice who acts as a balancing agent. Henry Hull and Canada Lee, round out the magnificent cast of the film.<br/><br/>This is a Hitchcock film that deserves to be seen more often, for it offers tremendous rewards to its viewers."
"twanurit","8","64","85","23 June 2000"," See It for Tallulah
","Ms. Bankhead's performance is amazing in this compelling film. In the first scene we are shown astounding destruction at sea from a capsized ship until the camera pans over to a lifeboat where the lone, well-coiffured, mink-draped, all made-up Tallulah is sitting, cross-legged, smoking a cigarette. Then we are shown a close-up of her leg. There's a run in her stocking! She looks more annoyed at that than all the carnage surrounding her! Later on, with more survivors on board and in danger of starving, she worries about how she looks and applies more lipstick! Oh Darling! This is classic cinema and one of the few films of this great lady (she was mostly on stage). John Hodiak (very handsome) is her enemy (at first), while Walter Slezak, Hume Cronin, William Bendix and the others ably support. An astonishing Alfred Hitchcock film."
"ma-cortes","8","7","7","2 May 2015"," Intelligent and engrossing picture about some shipwrecked survivors of a torpedoing
","Lifeboat chronicles the trip of eight passengers after being sunk the ship they were traveling . As during WWII , several survivors of a torpedoed ship find themselves in the same boat with one of the men who sunk it . They adrift on a lifeboat when they take on a German aboard .<br/><br/>This is a very good film , a highly theatrical experiment similarly to ¨The rope¨ ; dealing with several survivors in lonely lifeboat and it is based in part on a real shipwrecked . However , at film premiere was dumbly panned as an artistic flop by most critics , dismissed for a few embarrassing failures and flaws ; but is , nonetheless , today very well deemed . This sea-going ¨Grand Hotel¨ was filmed in a few takes to provide a seamless of movement but it remains nowadays what it was them a perfect film about shipwrecked survivors . Interesting screenplay , though partially claustrophobic , by Jo Swerling who adapted John Steinbeck's original story . The film was shot entirely on a restricted set in which the boat was secured in a large studio tank . Alfred Hitchcock , always striving for realism , insisted that the boat never remain stationary and that there always be an added touch of ocean mist and fog compounded of oil forced through dry ice . Remarkable performances from a great cast such as tunnel-voiced Tallulah Bankhead as spoiled reporter Constance 'Connie' Porter , the veteran Henry Hull , the beautiful Mary Anderson , a tough John Hodiak , Canada Lee who was allowed to write his own lines , the character actor Hume Cronyn , William Bendix who joined the cast a few days into shooting when the original actor as Gus -Murray Alper- fell sick and special mention for Walter Slezak as astute Nazi in growing suspicion of the other survivors about him . The cast suffered harsh conditions during the hard shooting : actors were soaked with water and oil . Seasickness hit the entire cast at various times during production , and many of them caught pneumonia after constant exposure to cold water which led to two cases of pneumonia for Tallulah Bankhead , an illness for actress Mary Anderson and two cracked ribs for actor Hume Cronyn who almost drowned in a storm scene when he got caught under a large metal water-activator according to his autobiography . Production was temporarily halted twice to allow for recovery of the cast . And look for Hitchcock's photography trademark on a newspaper that the survivors are reading .<br/><br/>Aside from the opening and closing scene , there is no score in this film , the only music is the flute . Evocative and atmospheric cinematography by Glen MacWilliams , though Arthur C. Miller was the initial director of photography but he was replaced after the first two weeks of filming, when Miller became ill . The motion picture was compellingly directed by the great maestro of suspense , Alfred Hitchcock ; only Hitch would face off the challenge of such a flick . Although the film did good business and succeed in New York as well as other big cities , it failed to attract audiences in smaller theatres and rural areas . As a result, it was a rare Alfred Hitchcock film that actually lost money at the box office . Remade as a Sci-Fi movie titled ¨Lifepod¨ (1981) by Bruce Bryant with Joe Penny , Kristine DeBell , Neil Ross , Carl Lumbly and ¨Lifepod¨ (1993) by Ron Silver with Robert Loggia , Jessica Tuck , Stan Shaw , Adam Storke , Kelli Williams and CCH Pounder ."
"Steffi_P","8","7","7","8 November 2010"," ""That isn't funny, it's logical""
","During the years of World War Two, Hollywood production followed the necessities of morale and propaganda, but tended towards movies that were minimalist and stripped down. Due to the conflict available resources were even lower than the cash-strapped days of the depression, and crews were smaller as many studio employees joined the armed forces. As far as the quality of the pictures produced is concerned, it wasn't always a bad thing. With fewer elements, filmmakers were encouraged towards inventiveness, as well as a more personal focus.<br/><br/>In the case of Lifeboat, it lead to the first in a series of pictures directed by Alfred Hitchcock made entirely in one confined set. Four years later he would make one called Rope, which gave the illusion of being shot in one continuous take. As such there was a constant feel of the artificiality of the process as the director's self-imposed limitations forced him to change angle and focus by moving the camera around. Lifeboat is different, not because Hitch didn't have the level of technical expertise yet, but because it has a far more timely and important story, and he could not afford to turn it into some self-indulgent technical exercise.<br/><br/>What we actually have is Hitch at his most thoughtful and least extravagant. Rather than drawing our attention to the smallness of the space, he makes the drama revolve entirely around the characters. His shot compositions are mostly designed to show only the actors, not the boat. This isn't just done with close-ups, but many cleverly arranged group shots. In acknowledgement of just how much the human brain can take in at once, he might have one character talking, while several others stand around them, not as bits of scenery but as part of the narrative. A good example is Walter Slezak, whom Hitch will place in some innocuous part of the shot, only to have the actor turn his head at some key moment while someone else is speaking, making us suddenly remember him and wonder if perhaps he is listening. While Hitch generally let actors get on with their own job, I am sure such precisely timed and presented bits of business were at his behest.<br/><br/>This is not to say the actors in Lifeboat are mere puppets for the director. Slezak is in fact a brilliant performer, intelligently displaying an air of innocence, with now and then a touch of something deeper. His manner is genuinely ambiguous, which makes it believable for the other characters to be divided in their opinion of him. Tallulah Bankhead seems more or less to be playing herself, or at least the delightfully vibrant persona that she crafted for herself. On dry land she could easily come across as a bit of a fraud, but here in the Lifeboat she personifies the spirit of defiance in the face of it all. From the rest of the cast come solid turns which are distinctive and lively, but never quite going so far as stereotype or overstatement.<br/><br/>The end result is not the most conventional piece of wartime propaganda ever. But while not exactly rousing, it is certainly entertaining. And this is what is best about Hitchcock – when he wasn't busy being a technical show-off, he always kept his mind on thrilling and enthralling the audience. A director who plays TO an audience, pandering to a specific set of sensibilities, will make films that will only ever appeal to the tastes of one era. Hitch on the other hand plays WITH the audience, and this has made his pictures stand the test of time."
"barnabyrudge","9","43","56","9 May 2005"," Single-set thriller of the kind that only Hitchcock could make.
","Lifeboat was Alfred Hitchcock's only film for 20th Century Fox. It is not widely remembered nowadays - certainly not in the way that Psycho, North By Northwest and Rebecca are remembered - but it still ranks very highly in the director's canon. In the film Hitchcock demonstrates a fascination with restricting the action to a single set. He would return later in his career to the concept of single set stories, for movies such as Rope, Dial M For Murder and Rear Window. It is an approach that would bring most directors to their knees, but Hitch rises to the challenge admirably, finding ingenious ways to maintain audience interest and providing a ceaseless undercurrent of excitement.<br/><br/>A passenger ship torpedoed by a German U-Boat sinks in the Atlantic Ocean. Well-groomed society lady Constance Porter (Tallulah Bankhead, in an absolutely outstanding performance) successfully mans one of the sunken ship's lifeboats and steers it around the debris in search of survivors. She picks up various types from the sea, including injured sailor Gus Smith (William Bendix), crewman John Kovac (John Hodiak) and the German U-Boat captain (Walter Slezak) whose own submarine was critically damaged in the attack. The dynamic of the group is severely strained by the German's presence, as the other survivors contemplate and argue over whether to toss him to the sharks, or put their trust in him to steer their lifeboat to safety.<br/><br/>Slezak is very good as the tricky German, deviously keeping a stash of water to himself while the others struggle against chronic thirst, and at one point murdering a fellow survivor to keep his water supply a secret. Hitchcock and his script-writer Jo Swerling wisely let us in on the German's true nature, while the characters surrounding him are unaware of his treachery. This keeps tension on a knife-edge throughout the film, and holds the viewer in suspense for the whole story. Similarly, Bankhead's casting is so unorthodox, her character so intentionally ill-fitting to the oceanic setting, that her role in the proceedings casts a strange fascination. The film has a lot of political and propagandist subtext, and many people have viewed it as an allegory of the Nazi rise in Europe (Slezak is the metaphor for Nazi Germany; the others metaphors for surrounding nations duped into believing that the Nazi neighbour in their midst is helpful and trustworthy). Whatever else Lifeboat can and can't be interpreted as, one thing is certain - it's a mighty fine movie!"
"fimimix","10","6","6","19 May 2006"," ..so few people have seen this great work..
","Again, I watched ""Lifeboat"" tonight - and, again, I read every commentary posted here. AND - again - I'm asking myself how the couple of folk who gave it a ""phew"" revue could be so assured it is a piece of junk, when were unfamiliar with the acting-skills of a film made so many years ago, nor they've never been in anything near the situation of surviving in a lifeboat. I wouldn't even go to sea in one of those mega-ships; don't even suggest a skiff ! Actually, though, lifeboats are larger than we generally picture - they had to accommodate a number of people. There are a couple of long-range shots of the boat which shows it is larger than we visualize.<br/><br/>Only one commentator gave the film's age - 60 years !; only one commentator wrote that director Alfred Hitchcock considered ONLY Tallulah Bankhead for the female-lead. Several mentioned that Ms. Bankhead was a terror on the stage, so we can certainly assume she gave a lot of input to Hitchcock on how she would build this character. Many wrote that she was not cast in many movies - our loss !! Because the entire film was based-on close-ups, this is a testament to her beauty and skill in acting.<br/><br/>I was taken aback again on how scrawny John Hodiak looked in the movie, as he was one of the big box-office hotties in that period. His acting was superb, but the body needed a lot of work for the bully he played.<br/><br/>We all know by now that he took-over as captain of the lifeboat, but was bested by the rescued, German U-Boat captain - sneakily condescending for his own safety - by Walter Slezak - skillful ! As the movie was purposefully intended to show the reaction of dissimilar characters in a desperate situation, few people commented on the wonderfully-under-played role by a young-and-handsome sailor, Hume Cronyn. William Bendix was William Bendix, although he got higher billing than both Hodiak and Cronyn. Remarkably, no one commented on Canada Lee's question ""I get to vote, too?"", in those days a loaded line by a Black actor. I was engrossed in how these dissimilar people reacted to one another. I really didn't see this film as a huge, political statement. I only saw raw emotions - well depicted.<br/><br/>AGAIN - I wish to explain that I do not watch movies because of certain actors-actresses - although Bankhead was one of my favorites - I love the movie, as a whole. I was lucky to see it when it was first released and have NEVER lost interest in it. ""Lifeboat"" is a true-to-life, suspenseful thriller that never drags nor gets boring - it's got my 10-to-10...."
"The_Void","8","20","25","30 January 2006"," A lesser-known Hitchcock masterclass!
","Hitchcock made a lot of great films, many of which have been met with the acclaim that they rightly deserve. Lifeboat deserves a lot of acclaim, yet its lesser-known status doesn't allow justice in that respect. This film represents one of Hitchcock's major successes in scene setting and drawing the audience into the story. The way that Hitchcock uses his camera aboard the lifeboat is amazing, as by keeping the action on the claustrophobic craft, the great director ensures that his audience is always plugged into the plight of his characters; which helps the film no end when it comes to the story, as we know their situation at all times. In fact, it's amazing just how well Hitchcock does do this; while they were starving, I was too! The plot is simple, yet a great base for a wartime thriller. We follow the surviving members of a crew from a ship that was bombed by a German U-Boat. They're crammed onto a small lifeboat, but there's one survivor that isn't quite welcome. His name is Willy, and he's a survivor of the U-Boat that sank the ill-fated ship.<br/><br/>Given the time when this was made (towards the end of World War 2), it's hardly surprising that it's filled with propaganda. Usually, this annoys me; but here it's done really well, and the propaganda is actually worked into the story instead of just being there to rally the allied population at the time. Hitchcock turns this into a twist, and the way that he parodies the war on the whole on just a small lifeboat in the middle of the big ocean is great. The entire film takes place on just one single set. The action never leaves the lifeboat (aside from to pan around the surrounding area), but Hitchcock uses this to his advantage. The lack of locations really enforces the crew's isolation. The acting is melodramatic in typical forties fashion; but all of the cast members do well in their roles. Tallulah Bankhead takes the lead role and really is the linchpin of the movie. She is joined by the likes of William Bendix, Walter Slezak and John Hodiak, who give great turns despite not being A-class actors. Overall, this is a Hitchcock film that I would say is just as important to see as the likes of Rear Window and Strangers on a Train. This is Hitchcock at his best, and the film is a great ninety-five minutes to boot. Don't miss this one!"
"ShootingShark","6","14","17","26 June 2005"," Classic World War Two Confrontational Drama
","During World War II, a US merchant marine ship and a German U-Boat sink each other in the mid-Atlantic. Eight motley survivors of the freighter gather one by one on a small lifeboat, when a ninth man pulls himself aboard and utters a heartfelt, ""Danke schön"" ...<br/><br/>There are relatively few good films about the Second World War which were actually made during the war (The Great Dictator is the only other one that comes to mind), and only a director of Hitchcock's stature would attempt a film that is so politically charged - Allied morality versus Nazi sensibility - and technically challenging - a movie set entirely on a tiny boat. The fact that it stands up as a suspenseful and intriguing film sixty years after it was made is a testament to his genius. Written by John Steinbeck and Jo Swerling, it's a great idea for a claustrophobic movie; throw together eight people in wartime from one side and one from the other and watch how they treat each other. Bankhead, a much-acclaimed stage actress who didn't have much luck in films shines as a society hack, Hodiak and Hull square off nicely as young buck and rich old man rivals, Cronyn (who wrote and acted in a couple of other Hitchcock movies) has a nice part as a quiet good guy and the rest of the cast give strong support. Slezak (who was Austrian), has the role of a lifetime as Willy, the wily U-Boat Captain, using all his strength and guile to slowly take charge of events. His devious and sinister cunning are chilling, but the astonishing scene where the others snap and lynch him is one of the most disturbing and powerful scenes I have ever come across. A lot of war films deal with tragedy and injustice in a moving and dramatic way, but this film, made during a terrible bloody war, captures a thought-provoking truth about what conflict does to people with a truly intense and lingering profundity. Don't miss Hitch's amusing and clever method of including his standard cameo appearance, despite the film's setting."
"bkoganbing","9","27","36","1 June 2007"," Your Rescuer Or Your Captor
","When David O. Selznick got some loan out money from Darryl Zanuck for Alfred Hitchcock's services for two films (the second was never made), I'm sure Zanuck must have just loved Hitchcock when he told him that he wanted to make a film with just one set. Talk about cost cutting, anyway after a few failed scripts, Zanuck got American premier novelist John Steinbeck to write an original screenplay and since it was timely patriotic, Hitchcock did it.<br/><br/>So for Hitchcock asking for a one set film, the movie going public got Lifeboat. A disparate group of passengers and crew are torpedoed in the mid-Atlantic and wind up together in a lifeboat. After their ship went down however, another ship in the convoy rammed in the U-Boat that sank them. The last one picked up on board is a German.<br/><br/>The crew members include John Hodiak, William Bendix, Hume Cronyn and Canada Lee. Passengers are Mary Anderson, Heather Angel and a dead baby she clings to, and millionaire Henry Hull. And of course playing a Dorothy Thompson like correspondent is the great Tallulah Bankhead.<br/><br/>Lifeboat is a wonderful film not just for the fact that Alfred Hitchcock succeeded in making a one set film that you are never conscious of while watching. But it's the only opportunity to see Tallulah at the height of her fame. She made a bunch of Hollywood features at the beginning of the sound era, but they flopped for the most part. So she went back to Broadway which loved her best and her season box seat at the Polo Grounds where she was the New York Giants most devoted fan. Lifeboat should have rejuvenated a movie career, but she apparently didn't care. Lifeboat even on its own is her best work on film, let alone in comparison to other films.<br/><br/>The villain of Lifeboat is our German, Walter Slezak. He's a devious and cunning individual, he seems stronger and more fit than the other Lifeboat survivors and because of that and in spite of the fact he's hated, he gradually assumes charge. There's a reason for his actions and his fitness and when it's discovered, grave consequences erupt.<br/><br/>Canada Lee, distinguished black actor from the stage, gets a role here that's far from Willie Best or Step N' Fetchit. My favorite scene in Lifeboat is when Hodiak who represents the left on the boat is trying to rouse the rest to just toss Walter Slezak to the sharks when he first arrives, asks Lee for his opinion as he's a member of the party. Lee replies simply he didn't realize he had any vote or say in the matter, a very trenchant observation about how blacks were disenfranchised in a quarter of the USA, some twenty years before the Voting Rights Act.<br/><br/>The Lifeboat survivors are a cross section of the American people and this World War II allegory in microcosm is to show just why these Nazis are as evil as they are and why we have to resist. Even today more than sixty years after it was first made, Lifeboat is still a great cinematic achievement from Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>And it was made so cheaply which Darryl Zanuck ecstatic."
"greenman_99","9","11","13","24 January 2001"," A brilliant and harsh ride
","Before today, all I really knew of Hitchcock was his murder mysteries (I consider myself a huge fan of those).  Now I see why he is more often described as a master of SUSPENSE.  You would think:  how much suspense can there be within the confines of a 12 or 15 foot long lifeboat?<br/><br/>
There is plenty-  from a shellshocked woman tied to a chair after her baby is buried at sea, to an amputation performed by a Nazi during a rising storm, to the experience of being in a leaky boat caught between two ships that are shelling each other-  this movie was a much harsher ride than I expected, and makes me respect the genius of Hitchcock even more than I already did.  I watched it alone on VHS in broad daylight, and I STILL felt rattled by the experience...  I can only imagine what it must have felt like to see this on the silver screen in a darkened theater back in the day.<br/><br/>The brilliance of this movie is how it portrays good and evil in little glimpses instead of broad strokes.  Every character is morally ambiguous to some point, acting nobly one moment, brutally the next.  Despite the presence of a black man, an affluent woman, a (probably Nazi) German, a blue-collar sailor, and so on, there are no stereotypes aboard this lifeboat by the end.  Each has surprised you, possibly disappointed you, and definitely made sure that you will REMEMBER them as a person, not as a ""type,"" long after the movie is over."
"johnlsullivan","Null","11","14","11 December 2005"," Bankhead was brilliant!
","I can't imagine why anyone would consider Bankhead's performance ""terrible"" or ""over-the-top."" First of all, the role is obviously written as a very theatrical, flamboyant woman. She plays the part the way it's written, and the style of her performance in no way takes away from the other characters, who are also fairly stylized, such as Henry Hull's industrialist or William Bendix Brooklynese seaman. The character also goes through real changes as the movie progresses, losing all of her worldly possessions (typewriter, fur coat, diamond bracelet), losing her head to John Hodiak, and finally becoming just another one of the dirty, downtrodden survivors. Honestly, I don't know how she could have been better, and she probably should have won the Academy Award that year."
"DCBruton","Null","30","45","15 January 2004"," Perhaps the best single set movie of all time
","Lifeboat, the Hitchcock classic, defines the essence of the American super will in 1944. It pits the American melting pot irrationality and eccentricities against the single-minded rational Teutonic mind. Unlike the typical propaganda movies of its time, Lifeboat does not march without a reverse gear across the screen like John Wayne's boots. Lifeboat is circumspect, and asks profound questions about war, and values, and vulnerability. It second guesses itself. It wonders.<br/><br/>A freighter is sunk by a German U-boat and the cast assembles in a solitary lifeboat on a cold gray Atlantic Ocean for a two hour emotional roller-coaster. 60 years ago, before there were true female heavyweight actresses like Brittany Spears or Meg Ryan, there was Tallulah Bankhead, a thinking man's dame with an Alabama drawl and no underwear. Apparently she wanted to keep the attention of the camera crew during filming; mission accomplished. Playing the lead role of Constance Porter, Tallulah was in her element as the clawed feisty sharp talking journalist ripping apart at will anyone that crossed her path especially alpha male want a be, John Kovac, played by John Hodiak. Ruggedly ugly, Hodiak, played an impulsive hotheaded boiler room brute that acted first and used thought only as a last resort. His persona was that of a man raised on the wrong side of the tracks, vigilant like a stray dog with the hair up on its back most of the time.<br/><br/>Then there was Willy. Willy, played magnificently by Walter Slezak, was a rescued German U-boat sailor, ultimately unmasked as the Captain of the U-boat that sunk the freighter. Willy spoke perfect English. He knew the sea, navigation and knew how to survive. He was superior in intellect, physical strength, and cunning. Not only was he capable of saving Gus Smith's life by a surgical amputation of his leg, he also pushed Gus overboard when it was clear that Gus, played by William Bendix was dying and essentially wasting the survival resources of the others in the boat.<br/><br/>Other characters providing color included a young Hume Cronyn, hard to believe he was ever young, and famous cigar chewing character actor grouch, Charles Rittenhouse who played Henry Hull, ironically, a shipping tycoon. Other players had various levels of incompetence and mental instability.<br/><br/>What does this movie say? It says that Americans can only stand so much rational logic before they explode, even if the rational logic initially saves their lives. It frames the basis of ethical reasoning. For example who do you give a heart transplant to, a scientist or a street person who waltzes into the door two seconds before the scientist? Willy would give the heart to the scientist because he weighs the society above the individual, and the rest of the boat would give it to the street person, not because it is rational but because they base ethics on human equality, and seek to find some measure of 'fairness' as the basis of ethical decision making. While American society may tout the virtues of this kind of sentiment, they are not really that comfortable with it. Watching a street person with a newly transplanted heart swill down a bottle of Thunderbird wine is not particularly gratifying when at the same time the Nobel Laureate is being laid to rest, perhaps just short of a discovery that could have saved millions of lives. And this is precisely what the movie does in the end. It leaves us uncertain about our own brutality in the name of our version of ethical fairness. It also makes us question our own sense of reason and logic. What possible virtue is there in a society that shuns reasoning? This is the point that Hitchcock makes so cleverly. He leaves us with a sense of fear, from both a tough intelligent rational enemy, but also from a wild brutish killing wrought out of self-fear and ending with an uncomfortable lynch mob sense of justice. This was not a killing of self-defense; it was a killing of berserk passion and loss of control. These were after all, not soldiers, but they were us, suffering from a global war with no end in sight. Frustrated by a relentless predatory machine-like enemy, that could torpedo unarmed freighters, yet smile and tell jokes while rowing toward an enemy rescue ship.<br/><br/>Lifeboat is a movie of huge depth. If the brain aspects of the movie don't appeal to you, you may want to see the movie just to get a glimpse of Tallulah so you could actually see what a real woman once looked like before they became extinct in the sea of 18 year old tattooed tongue-pierced pop culture nothings and crack smoking 'super-models' that masquerade these days as 'American womanhood'. And you wonder why men don't want to marry anymore."

","There are times during LIFEBOAT where the claustrophobia can't be avoided, since Hitchcock chose to film it on one set--a lifeboat in the open seas. But thanks to his craftsmanship, it never ceases to absorb the viewer as it becomes a tightly-knit character study of the survivors and their interaction.<br/><br/>Most prominent among the players is TALLULAH BANKHEAD, losing her possessions but gaining some humanity. She's described rather accurately by another poster as ""the Maureen Dowd of the '40s"", the shallow but sophisticated columnist with a condescending attitude toward everyone but herself.<br/><br/>But it's the WALTER SLEZAK character, a German among the survivors, who holds the most attention and proves that nothing can be seen in terms of black and white when it comes to human character. On the good side, he operates on WILLIAM BENDIX to successfully amputate his leg--but later resorts to murder when Bendix outlives his usefulness.<br/><br/>The other characters are more or less stock types--but are well played by JOHN HODIAK, CANADA LEE, HEATHER ANGEL, HENRY HULL and HUME CRONYN.<br/><br/>Summing up: Absorbing entertainment, stark tale of survival with the Hitchcock touch."

","***Possible spoilers***<br/><br/>A wartime drama from Alfred Hitchcock, 'Lifeboat' is notable for the following reasons: it takes place in just one setting throughout, the 'lifeboat' of the title; it marked the return to movies of the husky-voiced, 40-something, Tallulah Bankhead, after years on Broadway, playing a hard-bitten journalist whose preoccupations are make-up, getting a good story, and getting what she wants; and it is filmed largely in close-up, adding to the claustrophobia of the small space in which the shipwrecked survivors and the Nazi captain of the U-Boat which sunk them find themselves.<br/><br/>Tallulah Bankhead's forceful screen presence makes her character the nominal focus of the piece, right from the first time we see her, immaculate and alone in the boat.  Whether she's lusting after the resident bit of rough (hot-headed crewman Kovac, played by the gorgeous John Hodiak), sparring with the German captain (good but limited performance from Walter Slezak), or needling the factory owning millionaire (Henry Hull), your eye is drawn to her.  However, everyone in the movie gets their chance to shine (Hume Cronyn, Mary Anderson, William Bendix, Canada Lee, and briefly, Heather Angel as a bereaved mother).<br/><br/>My favourite bits in this engaging movie include Bankhead's flirty writing of her initials in lipstick on Hodiak's chest alongside the tattooed initials of his previous conquests; Bendix's dreamy recollections of his dancing days with his girl; Lee's flute playing; Bankhead deciding to give up her bracelet for the good of her fellow survivors (and to help her get what she's after?) and Cronyn unpicking the ribbon from Anderson's hair and realising he is in love with her.  The scene where the German is eventually attacked and killed, however, seems contrived.  The camera pulls back and we're detached from the characters we've been close to until then. <br/><br/>
Not seen often enough these days, this 60-year old movie is one of Hitch's best.  It also represents career best performances for many of its talented cast."
"rmax304823","8","3","3","13 June 2008"," Thoughtful and Exciting Drama From Hitchcock.
","This doesn't get much attention and I'm not sure why, because it certainly deserves more. The story of a diverse handful of survivors adrift in the Atlantic after their ship is torpedoed, it represents one of the technical and narrative challenges that Hitchcock at the time was beginning to impose on himself. There's only one set -- the lifeboat -- and how do you give the ten or so people aboard enough to do and say to keep the audience watching? You can't have them almost mowed down by an airplane in the middle of a corn field.<br/><br/>Hitchcock and his writers handled the problem deftly. There isn't a dull moment in the film. They fight storms, cut off legs, play cards, get drunk, fall in love, and kill each other.<br/><br/>John Steinbeck wrote the treatment and the screenplay was polished off by Jo Swerling. It immediately ran into trouble with the Office of War Information and the Breen Office. The handful of British and American survivors pick up the captain of the U-boat, now sunk, that torpedoed their ship -- good old Willie. Willie proves to be more focused and more able than anyone else in the boat. He's not only a master seaman and navigator but a surgeon as well. He turns out to be cheerful, practical, cherubic, avuncular, perceptive, melodious, charismatic, and murderous. He rows the boat in the general direction of the U-boat's mother ship while he sings German folk songs and the others tootle along, accompanying him on a flute. ""How'm I doing, Willie?"", asks the millionaire Henry Hull. The hypermasculine, possibly communist, John Hodiak mocks Hull in a queer voice, ""How'm I doin', Willie?"", and then cackles. And why not? After all, everybody in the boat is accompanying Willie.<br/><br/>The problem, as the censors saw it, was that Willie was superior to anyone else in the boat and Willie was a Nazi. The fact that Willie was cheating by swigging from a concealed bottle of water, taking vitamin pills, and peeking at a hidden compass was trumped by the obvious fact that he was the only person who knew exactly what he was doing. The Germans could have shown the film throughout Europe as pro-Nazi propaganda.<br/><br/>Steinbeck caught most of the heat for this, as he had for an earlier screenplay, ""The Moon is Down,"" that humanized a German soldier. Was Steinbeck a crypto-fascist? It's ironic that the question should have been raised because before the war, Steinbeck, the author of such modestly leftist works as ""To a God Unknown"" and ""The Grapes of Wrath"", was accused of being a Commie.<br/><br/>There are a couple of shots that no other director would have employed because no other director would have thought of them, and they're not necessarily dramatic or suspenseful. It's a languorous afternoon on the becalmed sea. Hodiak, his torso mottled with tattoos is reading an old newspaper. We see the newspaper from his point of view. Then a mischievous finger pokes slowly through the page and pulls the paper away, to be replaced by Tallulah Bankhead's seductively smiling face dropping gently backwards onto Hodiak's lap. While they swap back stories, she produces her lipstick and adds another fake tattoo to his chest -- the initials C.P. They're Bankhead's initials, of course, ""Connie Porter"", but they also hint at ""Communist Party."" With only a few minor exceptions, the acting is superb. I never found myself under Talullah Bankhead's Magic Spell but if I had to choose an actress to play a spoiled, snobbish, rich bitch it might be her. She seems to belong in that mink coat and she practically owns that smoke-cured voice. In many ways, this is her story. She's progressively stripped of every material possession she uses to define herself, and it's her character that shows the most development. Canada Lee, as the black guy, is a fine actor and has the right face for the part but he's saddled with a stereotypical role. There isn't space to get into all the characters but it's clear that Hitchcock opted for genuine faces instead of glamor pusses in this story. John Hodiak looks like an ordinary stoker, not like Cary Grant. And I mean -- take a look at Hume Cronyn. A face made for radio.<br/><br/>You really shouldn't miss this one. It's a lesson in movie-making."

","Lifeboat is another fine film from it's director Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcok received the second nomination in his career for Best Director at the Academy Awards for 1944. The film was also nominated for Best Cinematography from Glen Macwilliams and Original Motion Picture Story for John Steinbeck. It's a great character study and is basically a stage play set at sea with a fine cast including Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Walter Slezak, Hume Cronyn, John Hodiak and Canada Lee. I've always enjoyed this film and have seen it many times. It's a well acted script adapted from a good Steinbeck story by Jo Swerling and Ben Hecht. All Hitchcock films are good and offer something different in each one.

","When one talks about Hitchcock, one usually uses the words Notorious, Psycho, Rebecca, Vertigo, Rear Window, North By Northwest, and The Birds. It's a shame no one almost never uses the word Lifeboat, it is one of Hitchcock's best films.<br/><br/>Being a rather large Hitchcock fan, I had wanted to see Lifeboat for quite sometime. I hadn't heard much about it, but the premise intrigued me. Nine people stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the Atlantic, waiting for a rescue that may never come. The setting alone was enough for me to start looking. It is a very hard film to find, and after a while I didn't think I would find it. However, by fluke, I found it one day inside a collection that also includes The Lodger, Rebecca, Spellbound and Notorious.<br/><br/>Having been disappointed by Spellbound, I put off watching Lifeboat for a while, until one day my curiosity overcame me. I must say Lifeboat is one of Hitchcock's very best. It's suspenseful, romantic and action-packed. Not what you would expect from a bunch of people stuck on a lifeboat. The best in the cast is Tallulah Bankhead. It is one of her very best performances. The cast is flawless. William Bendix, Walter Slezak, Mary Anderson, John Hodiak, Henry Hull, Heather Angel, Canada Lee and Hume Cronyn are all excellent.<br/><br/>The film has been unfairly forgotten, despite being a wonderful film. The technical aspects of this film are overwhelming. Hitchcock shot the entire thing on a 40 foot lifeboat in a water tank at Twentieth Century Fox. Bankhead got Pneumonia twice, Anderson got sick, and Cronyn broke a few ribs and almost drowned. Yet in the end Hitchcock triumphed. Unfortunately the film was doomed to the start, due to the fact that it shows a Nazi as being smarter than everyone else.<br/><br/>The critics called it unpatriotic. The audience didn't go for it. Yet it was nominated for a couple Oscars. Bankhead said it best when she said to the press: ""It's about time people realized the enemy is tough- that we can't beat him if we don't pull together."" That is the film in a nutshell. Unfortunately, people still didn't get it. However, today people do.<br/><br/>If you like Hitchcock this is a must-see. If you like suspense movies, this is a must-see. If you like good movies at all, this is a must see."

"ackstasis","8","5","6","17 June 2007"," ""Dying together's even more personal than living together.""
","Alfred Hitchcock will forever be known as one of cinema's most innovative directors. Many of his most fondly-remembered films are often categorised as film-making ""experiments:"" 'Rear Window' took place entirely in the one small apartment; 'Rope' was played out almost in real time, and was envisioned as a ""one-take"" movie; 'Lifeboat' takes place exclusively on a tiny lifeboat in the middle of the wide ocean. However, in my view at least, to categorise these films as mere ""experiments"" is to take away from the worth of the film itself. Hitchcock did not simply exploit these unusual scenarios as a mere gimmick to pique audience interest; he used them to his advantage, to maximise the emotional resonance of his films. And he did it better than anybody else could possibly envision.<br/><br/>After an Allied freighter is torpedoed by a German U-Boat during World War Two, a handful of survivors of differing personalities and beliefs clamber aboard an unsturdy lifeboat and await rescue. Among the survivors is the Nazi captain of the U-Boat which sunk their ship, and the men and women must decide whether this member of the enemy is trustworthy enough to remain on the boat. As the days drag on and on without a hint of rescue, and with supplies of food and water rapidly dwindling, some survivors forge lifelong bonds with each other, whilst others slowly and surely turn against one another. Meanwhile, the crafty, innocent-seeming German, Willy (Walter Slezak), imperceptibly begins to draw his plans against his rescuers.<br/><br/>A lesser director might have baulked under the task of making a continually-suspenseful 96-minute film set entirely in a lifeboat. Hitchcock, however, used the situation to his advantage, and the tiny set on which 'Lifeboat' was filmed (allegedly the smallest in film history), creates a constricting, claustrophobic atmosphere. The surrounding ocean landscape, presumably simulated using the director's favoured rear-projection, is surprisingly convincing throughout, with the black-and-white photography masking the obviousness of the effect which is often apparent in Hitchcock's later films. During filming, the cast members were exposed to the elements, which aided the realism of their performances, but also led to frequent illnesses such as seasickness and pneumonia.<br/><br/>Solid performances were crucial to the film, and, luckily, the casting here is spot-on. Tallulah Bankhead gives perhaps the stand-out performance as Connie Porter, the selfish and arrogant world-travelling author. Each biting remark is delivered with magnificent pretentious poise, and many have suggested that Bankhead's character is not too different from the actress' own persona. The roles of the other survivors are played very well by William Bendix, Mary Anderson, John Hodiak, Henry Hull, Hume Cronyn and Canada Lee, whilst Walter Slezak delivers a remarkable performance as the sly but strangely-likable German captain, whom you know isn't trustworthy, but you are tempted to trust him anyway.<br/><br/>Upon its release, 'Lifeboat' was interpreted by many critics to be pro-Nazi, and its box-office performance was poor. Nowadays, the film is more often seen to be quite the opposite, as a piece of American propaganda and a good one at that. Based on a story by iconic American author John Steinbeck, one of the film's main themes is how dark situations can bring out the worst in a civilised group of people. When the Nazi captain is first hauled aboard the lifeboat, wealthy factory owner Charles D. Rittenhouse (Hull) fervently calls for the man to be treated civilly, as a prisoner of war. However, after witnessing the devious exploits of the Nazi, his attitudes perceptibly change. At the end of the film, when a young German seaman clambers aboard the boat, he is among the first to demand that he is tossed overboard like a worthless animal.<br/><br/>The film's depiction of the enemy is quite interesting, though it is certainly not overly positive as many critics originally suggested. Willy, a fascinating character, is at first treated with some sympathy, but all this is cast aside when it is revealed that he has been hoarding food, water and a compass for his own benefit. The final line of the film, Connie's ""What are we going to do about people who think like this?"" in response to the young Nazi's asking whether or not they are going to kill him, carries a certain note of irony. The characters consider the Germans to be barbaric for even thinking of such a thing, and yet the American survivors had almost been all-too-willing to murder Willy from the moment he came aboard the lifeboat. Perhaps the film is saying that, when it all comes down to it, the Germans and Allies weren't really all that different. Now there's a social commentary that wouldn't have been looked upon too kindly during the early 1940s!"

","Excluding the fact that half of THE LADY VANISHES is set on a cramped train, LIFEBOAT is the first time Alfred Hitchcock experimented with setting an entire film in a single cramped set. (ROPE and REAR WINDOW did the same trick)  This time, the cramped set is a lifeboat full of American and British survivors of a passenger ship sunk by a German U-Boat.  The time is World War II, and the film serves as a microcosm of the world's feelings towards the enemy and ourselves.     These survivors pick up one more person at sea, a German, (frightfully played by Walter Slezak) one of the people who sunk the boat.

Saying this, each actor did a great job bringing their respective characters come to life, each one was vibrant and very much alive. The diversity of the cast added to the tension, which is felt quite strongly throughout the entire film. Other than the work of the actors, Hitchcock's use of the camera and special effects worked very well for them film as well. The constant rocking of the boat narrow shots never let the audience forget that the characters were stuck on that boat.

"bobsgrock","9","4","5","13 May 2009"," Original and exciting, even by today's standards.
","What a great challenge it must have been for Alfred Hitchcock to make this movie possible. Here we have a story that is stationary, no movement in terms of setting or action and yet with a fine cast and wonderful writing, Hitchcock was able to create a timeless and suspenseful drama dictating what great lengths people are willing to go to in order to survive as well as the goodness of mankind that can shine through.<br/><br/>As the story goes, a US ship has just been sunk and we see the remains floating along in the Atlantic and soon stumble across a lavishly dressed woman alone in a lifeboat, a reporter insisting on saving her material in order to project a good story. As more survivors resurface, we meet a whole group of them including a nurse, a radio operator, a crewman and a German who is immediately ostracized by the rest simply because he is from the boat that sunk the survivors' ship. What Hitchcock does in depicting these very different people and how they relate to one another and try to survive amidst the cold, seemingly endless Atlantic Ocean is truly fantastic. This is a set-up that would be exciting and seem original even by today's standards of unlimited special effects potential.<br/><br/>What Hitchcock does to maintain the narration moving forward and keep interest alive is not a stretch of realism nor is it far-fetched n its method. Here, simple and solid directing reigns and despite a somewhat anticlimactic ending, I found this to be one of Hitchcock's better movies; maybe one of his ten best. It is engaging, interesting and does a superb job of showing the true colors of people in such a situation. Here, in a boat stranded in the ocean, there are no Americans or Nazis, poor or rich. Everyone is equal and trying to strive to the same goal."

","Lifeboat (1944) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock lined up a terrific cast to tell the story of a group of survivors who find themselves together on a lifeboat without much hope for survival. The American and British people end up saving a German man who was on the sub that struck their boat and must decide if he's worth trusting or not.<br/><br/>I've never really understood why LIFEBOAT never gets mentioned when critics or fans discuss the work of Hitchcock. It's certainly not a masterpiece like PSYCHO, VERTIGO or NORTH BY NORTHWEST but it's certainly a highly entertaining and very good movie that deserves to get more praise than it does. For some strange reason the movie is rarely mentioned whenever people discuss the famed director and that's really too bad because it shows what the director was able to do with just one set.<br/><br/>I really liked the fact that the movie starts off with the boat already sunk and we immediately start on the lifeboat. A lot of times movies like this will take place on a ship where we get to know the characters then the disaster will strike and we will then see them try to survive. Writer John Steinbeck did a marvelous job at starting the acting in the lifeboat and this is where we get to know the cast as the characters get to know one another.<br/><br/>The screenplay is quite simple as it tells a strong story and obvious there are messages scattered throughout, although we're never beaten over the head with that message. Hitchcock does a very good job at keeping the stakes extremely high and he manages to build up tension during a lot of small scenes that of course add up to something big. It certainly doesn't hurt that we've got a terrific cast of actors to bring these roles to life. Walter Slezak is wonderful as the German man plus we get John Hodiak, a terrific William Bendix, HUme Cronyn, Mary Anderson and Henry Hull. Canada Lee also deserves a lot of credit as the black man on the boat. One of the few instances where a black man was shown respect in a Hollywood film from this era.<br/><br/>LIFEBOAT is a nice little drama that gets better with each new viewing. Again, I'm really not sure why more people don't talk about the film but it's certainly worth rediscovering to those who haven't seen it."

","The small-scale LIFEBOAT – with the entire movie taking place on the titular vessel – was never going to be one of the Hitchcock greats. Nevertheless, a pacey script means that it rarely sinks into the doldrums, instead remaining an engaging little movie. I've always enjoyed the tension to be had from one-set dramas and this one sees Hitchcock putting his sea-bound setting to fine use.<br/><br/>The story is pretty straightforward: a disparate group of survivors climb aboard a lifeboat after their ship is sunk in the Atlantic by a German U-boat. Soon enough, they are joined by one of the Germans and soon conflict breaks out as they argue over what's best to do with him. Some think they should kill the German, others think he should be allowed to lead them – and watching the drama play out is a lot of fun.<br/><br/>There weren't any major names in the cast in this one for me, and the top-lined Tallulah Bankhead is a bit of an aloof and icy character, but nobody puts a foot wrong as the drama unfolds. Broken limbs, seasickness, impromptu surgery, navigation, lack of food and water, madness, despair, stormy weather and sunstroke are just a few of the things our group has to contend with as the film goes on. The film also boasts a stronger role than usual for the black cast member, Canada Lee, who plays my favourite character, Joe: tough, brave and an underrated addition to the ship's ""crew""."

","I really enjoyed the film Lifeboat. I'm ashamed of admitting this, but I haven't seen a lot of Hitchcock films, but this is defiantly one of my favorites. He is such an amazing director, he can do so much with so little, and make it enjoyable. I thought Constance did really well in this film. She reminded me of my grandmother in a weird way, especially her choice of outfits and attitude. I liked that the movie was based in World War 2, that the Nazi's and German's were involved. The sounds and editing were great. I liked how Hitchcock could capture a moment just by focusing on one point. My grandfather told me that Hitchcock made the film just how Steinbeck wrote it in his novel. Which I thought was great, how many films do you see and say ""that was better then the book""."
"m-santana","Null","2","2","12 March 2010"," ""Dieing together is more personal than living together""
","Absolutely superb!!! Hitchcock did an amazing job capturing how it would have felt to be in that situation along with them. How cramped it would have felt, how tested one would feel physically and emotionally and yet connections would develop because they were going this awful and desperate situation together. So many moments of desperation from the baby passing, to the mother committing suicide, to the amputation,and then the delusions right up until the end. How each character shared themselves to one another and the movie just continued to develop. The suspicion arising in each one yet they tried to be fair. How they tried to remain good people possibly better than who they were on ground. The character individually and together had enough depth as the sea itself. This movie could have just had a fixed background and no real elements of the sea what so ever, but it would have ruined it. Hitchcock and all those involved knew that and created a balance. Once you had the slightest feeling they weren't at sea something came along and showed you different. At the end it not only made you hope that they survived it also made you hope that never happens to you."

","A merchant ship is torpedoed and sunk by the Germans, leaving only a handful of survivors in the process. Finding a lifeboat to share, the survivors are thrown into conflict when one of the survivors turns out to be the captain of the U-boat that sunk their ship.<br/><br/>Lifeboat is a truly fine Alfred Hitchcock picture, it's a little undervalued, and most probably under seen due to not getting a worthy DVD transfer until the new millennium. Adapted from a John Steinbeck story, Lifeboat finds Hitchcock experimenting with a single set picture that is awash with propaganda and containing a cast that are across the bows, both endearing and totally interesting. Really tho, it's with the moral posers and quandary heart that Lifeboat becomes a great picture, different classes and oddly assorted persona's are forced to survive as one unit, but invariably a fly in the ointment could turn out to be a catalyst of sorts, not only for this group's possible survival, but in mental fortitude's and their respective capabilities under duress.<br/><br/>Very interesting film from the maestro director, with Tallulah Bankhead, Willian Bendix, John Hodiak and Walter Slezak turning in very enjoyable performances. Lifeboat is unusual in the sense of Hitchcock's other well known pictures, but it definitely finds him very much on form and very much laying down a marker for the genius that was to come. 9/10"

","Engrossing drama about a group of survivors of a torpedo attack on a small boat. There is terrific ensemble acting by the whole cast, but the star of the film is Bankhead, playing a glamorous and flirtatious journalist. This marvelous actress worked mostly on the stage and did not have much success on the screen, with this film being her best by far. Although she did not have a particularly attractive face, she had a sensuous presence and a husky voice that oozed sex appeal. It's unfortunate that Hollywood could not take advantage of her talents. Although the entire film takes place on the boat, it never becomes tiresome, thanks to an engaging script, interesting characters, and Hitchcock's masterful direction."
"telegonus","10","6","10","8 August 2001"," Hitch At Sea
","Filmed entirely in a studio, Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat is set on a lifeboat containing the survivors of a ship torpedoed by a German submarine. It is among other things a very good take on the Allied predicament, and on the position of the Germans in the world at that time (adversaries, but smart and capable). <br/><br/>The American and British survivors know nothing about navigation, and only a little more about how to survive at sea, despite the presence of several seamen! There is a snobbish woman journalist along for the ride; also a rich industrialist. At things develop, a German sub captain is picked up and it is he who shows the way, as he is more adept at survival than the others, as well as a skilled surgeon, which comes in handy when a man's leg needs to be amputated. The others on  board despise the German and yet depend on him. They also squabble among themselves, fall in love, play cards, discuss politics, and get to know one another. Things do not end as one might expect, and the climax of the film is exciting and frightening, visually and dramatically. Hitchcock as usual is in perfect control.<br/><br/>Jo Swerling's script, from a John Steinbeck story, is deceptively excellent. The characters continually surpise us, and the plot twists are believable and never predictable. I especially like the forties slang, which does not feel dated, and is always used dramatically and in character, not for 'effect'. There is a good deal of wistful talk about the outside world, which makes the film feel less cramped, and in this sense it is like a skillfully written radio play.<br/><br/>The actors are all fine. Some may object to stage diva Tallulah Bankhead's over the top performance, but her audience-hogging mannerisms have the paradoxical effect of making the other actors look good, as they seem to work harder than she does, which is the point. John Hodiak is surprisingly strong and alert as the leftist working man whom Miss Bankhead has an eye on. Bill Bendix is very moving as a simple man way over his head in everything. Canada Lee plays a black man whose race is never mentioned and who is never treated differently by the others, but in various small ways one is continually aware of his race and predicament. Walter Slezak is perhaps a bit too jolly and refined for the sub captain, but is such a fine actor that one forgive his slight miscasting. That he is decidedly not your typical World War II Nazi fiend works in his favor. <br/><br/>From what I gather Hitchock regarded this film as a technical challenge as much as anything else, and in this respect Lifeboat resembles his cut-less Rope of a few years later. The movie also perhaps anticipates Psycho a bit in showing how much delight Hitchock could take in stretching himself a bit, just for the fun of it, to see how far he could go. That he chose such a confined setting to stretch his talent seems in character for a director who relished the irony and paradox in everything he did."
"itamarscomix","6","5","8","16 April 2012"," One of my less favorite Hitchcock films
","This early piece from Hitchcock is probably notable mainly for being his first real attempt at a single-set film, all taking place in one location with a limited number of actors. It was an interesting experiment, no doubt, but the same thing was done again later with much better results in Rope and Rear Window, which makes Lifeboat pretty obsolete. It doesn't fulfill its potential for character study (an obvious route to take with such an excellent and compact cast) and instead serves mostly as wartime propaganda - that was confusing enough to be considered inappropriate back in 1944, and seems simplistic and xenophobic now.<br/><br/>It's still a Hitchcock film so of course the cinematography is excellent and there are some truly gripping and effective scenes - not to mention terrific acting - but not as many as you'd think. The actors and dialog are good enough to give the hint of fascinating and complex characters, but they're given only the shadow of a personality and serve as allegorical prototypes more than human beings, merely serving the film's dubious message. Lifeboat is a notable point in the Hitchcock filmography, but it just feels outdated and doesn't play well today."
"slokes","8","5","8","15 February 2006"," Hitch Ahoy!
","World War II propaganda films say a lot about the societies behind them. Simplistic racial and classist dichotomies abound in Nazi and Soviet films, respectively, because of government demand and audience expectation. In Allied countries, however, democracy required a more subtle, less dogmatic ""Why We Fight"" approach, one best exemplified in this American wartime drama by British director Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>Tallulah Bankhead stars as jaded newspaper columnist Connie Porter who wears her cynical, relativistic view of life as prominently as her mink coat and diamond bracelet, coming off like a 1940s version of the New York Times' vampy Maureen Dowd with her needling asides and eye-rolling hauteur. CoPo is one of several survivors of a vessel sunk by a German U-Boat, now adrift on a boat with little hope of rescue.<br/><br/>Among the others: A smug businessman, a doughty British radioman, a Brooklyn jitterbugger with a wounded leg, a nurse regretting her adulterous past, an African-American steward with a knack for picking pockets, and perhaps most notably, a survivor from the day's other wreck, that of the U-Boat.<br/><br/>Stereotypes, yes, but the richness of ""Lifeboat"" in large part springs from the fact they don't always behave in stereotypical fashion. Take John Kovac, the black-gang communist played by John Hodiak. Many commentators claim the film's own socialistic sympathies are in evidence when Kovac makes his loaded barbs at the swells in the craft and urges the German be thrown over, which as the film develops doesn't seem so bad an idea. But Kovac often comes off too heavy for his own good, not to mention less than the exemplar of Comintern rectitude when he receives the amorous attentions of Connie.<br/><br/>Then there's the black guy, Joe (Canada Lee), outsider among outsiders, who stays on the margins, keeps his head down when others bicker, and manages to help out time and again without calling attention to himself, sort of this film's version of Ally Sheedy in ""The Breakfast Club."" My favorite is the capitalist, Rittenhouse, his name being the film's most obvious Marxist nod. He's full of tiny jokes and deathly banter, used to being appreciated because of his wealth and cloying in his pretenses at commonality, but in general not all that bad a guy. Henry Hull plays him so well you almost think he's the insufferable one, rather than his role. ""Call me Ritt."" Ugh.<br/><br/>At one point, when Rittenhouse gives his name to Kovac, Connie pointedly adds ""Junior"" to underline his wealth is inherited rather than earned. As one of the others note: ""She certainly has a way of getting at things.""<br/><br/>""Lifeboat"" garners praise for Hitchcock's compositions within a small space, and moments like the heating of a knife before surgery and the shadow of a sail crossing the face of Walter Slezak as the German show how clever and rich Hitchcock's vision could be. (There's also the all-time best example of Hitchcock's most overrated device, the director's cameo.) But the script by Jo Swirling and Ben Hecht is just as intricately probing, pulling back the covers with each of the characters and finding moments of tension and revelation in the smallest comments. There's enough going on here to reward many viewings. For example, the more we learn about Rosie, William Bendix's girl back home, the more we understand why Connie shakes her head after assuring him Rosie is waiting for him.<br/><br/>Okay, Hume Cronyn's British accent is on a par with Kevin Costner's in ""Robin Hood,"" and the ending does feel ten minutes longer than it should. But ""Lifeboat"" is a quiet triumph, not only for its technical mastery and deep characterization, but as a propaganda film that faces head on the underside of a mob mentality, the virtues of individuality, and the possibility that the enemy might have the right idea now and then. Hitchcock made better films, but none make me so proud to be an American, a pretty cool trick for a Brit."

","Maybe ""Lifeboat"" wasn't Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movie, but it was still interesting. It tells of several people who survive a torpedoed ship and have to live together on a boat. On the boat, they've got more than a few surprises awaiting them, namely because of the men who torpedoed the ship is on board with them. The main character is vain heiress Connie Porter (Tallulah Bankhead), who can never seem to apply enough makeup. The other characters (William Bendix, Walter Slezak, Mary Anderson, John Hodiak, Henry Hull, Heather Angel, Hume Cronyn, Canada Lee) also have their quirks - and secrets. All in all, this is a perplexing, and delicious, movie."

","This is quite a different film then I expected. When I heard of the movie Lifeboat I thought, maybe some kind of Gilligan Island type movie, but more on the dramatic side. I guess I was wrong.<br/><br/>Of course this doesn't stop the movie from being a well done Alfred Hitchcock movie. Again to my surprise this was done by Hitchcock. I hardly saw any Hitchcock movies, and did not know a lot about his films. But now after watching some of his films including Lifeboat, I have come to love his work.<br/><br/>Lifeboat is a full on dramatic film. To think about it, this was probably a low budget film since it only takes place in one place, the middle of the sea. The camera footage was nice, angling on important characters and even in the beginning Hitchcock used his camera angle of looking through a characters eyes, something I have come to notice Hitchcock uses in his films.<br/><br/>In a film like this, it gives you the chance to understand the characters even better, since it is confined in a small place. Learning their personal lives and their mental states. Also you get a better picture of all the drama that is going on. All the actors and actresses did a great job.<br/><br/>Throughout the film it gets you wondering, ""what would you do to survive?"" I have to say Alfred Hitchcock yet again made an outstanding movie a very good classic to watch at least once.<br/><br/>Not to give anything away...but I was kind of disappointed about the ending."

"classicsoncall","10","3","4","29 October 2006"," ""To survive one must have a plan.""
","Confined to a single set, the master Alfred Hitchcock directs a compelling psychological drama that uniquely challenges the viewer to reflect on his own reactions to the events presented on screen. In the early going, would you have thrown the German overboard, or acted as a humanitarian? What about later, after Willy (Walter Slezak) is exposed as a scheming Nazi captain deftly maneuvering the boat to his own country's supply ship? Would you have the stomach to assist in cutting off a man's leg? The movie doesn't allow much time to think about it, but that's how life works sometimes.<br/><br/>The film opened to immediate critical acclaim during it's first week of release, however when a negative reviewer opted to focus on the treatment of Willy's character, it called into question whether the story was sympathizing with the Nazi cause. Fearing even further backlash, Fox studio head Darryl Zanuck withdrew the film from general release. To my mind, the issue was dealt with rather expertly in the story. Even though Willy was a cunning schemer who took control of the boat during a storm, he sealed his own fate by going too far to keep Gus (William Bendix) quiet.<br/><br/>Hitchcock accepted a rather difficult task in taking on this assignment. Restricted to just one set, he employed what was until then the most extensive story boarding ever utilized for a movie. The entire movie was drawn out ahead of time, with a myriad of camera angles and weather related elements to convey something different in practically each scene. It works exceptionally well, as one is never left bored with static images or a fixation on any single character or situation.<br/><br/>As for characters, the one cast member with any name recognition at the time was Tallulah Bankhead, who portrayed the journalist Constance Porter. Bankhead was extremely difficult for the other players to work with, and she lorded her celebrity status over all of them. Staffers on the film were intimidated by her name dropping, yet in Hitchcock, she found a kindred spirit, someone she could talk with endlessly on the set.<br/><br/>For those who scour Hitch's films for his cameo appearances, ""Lifeboat"" presented a dilemma, but that was overcome with a little gimmickry. During this time, Hitchcock was trying to lose weight, succeeding in going from three hundred pounds down to two hundred. In the movie, Kovac (John Hodiak) is shown reading a newspaper, and the camera lingers on an ad for 'Reduco', a weight loss product and 'Obesity Slayer'. The director's full frame profile is used for the before and after comparison, prompting numerous viewers of the time to inquire where they could buy the product, but of course it was all made up.<br/><br/>If ever there was a film that employs symbolism, this one is a treasure trove. It was interesting to me that the first time one gets a view of the entire open sea is right after it's revealed that Mrs. Higley's (Heather Angel) baby is dead. That effectively places the boat's survivors in touch with their own mortality in what might be a hopeless situation. What does it mean when the lone black Joe (Canada Lee) doesn't participate in the gang up on Willy? Gus changes his name from Schmidt to Smith. The prospect of life giving fresh rain is replaced by sunshine instead of a storm, but which is better? There is something meaningful and fascinating to be taken away from this film in virtually every instance.<br/><br/>If all that weren't enough, it was an unusual coincidence of timing that had me see this film when I did. The Cardinals captured the 2006 baseball World Series just a couple of days ago by defeating the Detroit Tigers, four games to one. In the story, William Bendix' character Gus ruminates on the state of baseball at that time with - ""St. Louie's the team to watch this year""!"

"theowinthrop","10","4","7","7 August 2006"," Hitchcock's best war movie, and the ambiguities of behavior in wartime
","He called it (as did the critics) an allegory - and it is but it's characters are so complex that they rise above the normal stick figures of allegory. This is no PILGRIM'S PROGRESS with characters named ""Christian"", ""Faithfull"", ""Talkative"", ""Envy"", and ""Mr. Worldly Wiseman"". The characters represent economic and national types, such as labor (John Hodiak), capital (Henry Hull), the media and feminism (Tallulah Bankhead), Canada and the Empire (Hume Cronym), fuzzy headed American isolationism (William Bendix), the third world watching (Canada Lee), and the threat of German efficiency (Walter Slezak - maybe his best performance).<br/><br/>LIFEBOAT is the story of the survivors of the sinking of a steamer by a German u-boat (the ship sinking is done in the opening credits, and we hear the explosion, and see smoke, but the only thing we see sink is the smokestack of the ship as it goes under - a typically brilliant sequence by Hitchcock). The submarine was hit by a shell from the ship's gun (apparently one of those ships that the British merchant marine have as converted war vessels). As the survivors gather one mentions the sub was sunk. And sure enough an additional survivor turns up - a German (Slezak).<br/><br/>From the start there are frictions between the survivors. Hodiak, a member of the crew in the engine room, is very turned off by the way Bankhead commandeered the lifeboat for herself - and her luggage. She is a reporter, and instead of showing the gravity of the moment towards the dead, she boasts of how she photographed a dead baby. Hodiak is very happy when Bankhead loses her camera - the first of many things she loses. But as she loses her possessions she slowly picks up on her humanity again. Bankhead's movie career was very mixed, and this film is her zenith as a movie actress.<br/><br/>Henry Hull and Bankhead get along better as Hull is Rittenhouse, a prominent capitalist. He actually is a decent sort, but as the film progresses his card games with Hodiak become a running commentary of capital v. labor, to the point where when he thinks he's beaten Hodiak a wind blows their cards away, and Hull angrily accuses Hodiak of cheating him. Hull has a unique symbol. Like Bankhead he grabbed the first box of cigars from his room that he could and raced to the deck and the lifeboats. Ironically the box only had one cigar in it. For the entire film Hull has to just keep that one cigar (constantly in his mouth) to satisfy himself.<br/><br/>There is tragedy among the survivors. One of them is a Mrs. Higley (a passenger played by Heather Angel) who had a baby. The baby was lost in the disaster, and she is in a state of shock. The others try to comfort her, but she can't be. Eventually they find her missing - she went off in the night to join her baby.<br/><br/>William Bendix is Gus Schmidt (who has anglified his name as Smith, as an act of anger towards the Nazis). Gus has had a good marriage, but he and his wife pride themselves on their dancing. But his wounds (from burning oil) were such that he had to have his leg amputated in the lifeboat. He is in a messed situation because he wonders if his wife will remain with him now that he is crippled.<br/><br/>And finally there is Willy. As I said before Walter Slezak probably never had a better part. It was also the only time he worked with Hitchcock. It is easy to demonize Willy - he is a Nazi submariner (and - we eventually learn - it's Captain). He does work quietly to take the lifeboat to a rendezvous point with a Nazi ship. And (SPOILER COMING UP) he is responsible for the death of Gus.<br/><br/>That scene though supports what I said earlier. If this was a pure allegory of the war against the Nazis, Slezak's killing of Bendix would be done without any conscience at all. Actually Willy shows a degree of humanity here that the ""nicer"" people fail to show. Gus is not doing well, and is physically suffering. He is also emotionally low because he suspects that he is not going to be finding his wife supportive now that he is a cripple. Willy speaks to him at night and Gus does show he's suicidal. Willy is not acting opportunistic about this. He knows that if Gus survives he will be miserable for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>He does convince the groggy Gus to go over the side, and so it seems absolutely horrific (especially as Bendix starts screaming for help after he goes over the side and can't float). So we tend to think that Slezak is heartless. But what really would have been poor Gus's future? And if it is just a murder of an enemy in war (hard to really build on that point), Slezak certainly would not have requested that Gus return to his using the original German name that he gave up. There would be no need for that. The fact is that it is a type of euthanasia killing - which the Nazis favored for people who were feeble minded or physically defective. The viewer may be horrified by Bendix last screams, but we would still wonder if his life would have been better if he had survived with the others."
"bkrauser-81-311064","8","2","3","26 February 2014"," One of Hitchcock's Minor Masterpieces
","Lifeboat (1944) is considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's minor films. Much like Vertigo (1958) there are well defined and brilliantly acted characters, like Dial M for Murder (1954) the setting is tight and confined, in this case a sole lifeboat and not a London apartment. Also like Foreign Correspondent (1940) and Saboteur (1942), the movie has a blatant and obvious political purpose. It's a propaganda film through and through, myopically grappling on the zeitgeist of WWII. But just like all the aforementioned films, Lifeboat is likewise a well made masterpiece.<br/><br/>The film begins just after the torpedoing of an allied ship by a German U-Boat (which was also destroyed). A single lifeboat carries an assorted crew including reporter Connie Porter (Tallulah Bankhead), millionaire Charles Rittenhouse (Henry Hull), crew members John, Gus, Joe and Stanley (William Bendix, John Hodiak, Canada Lee and Hume Cronyn respectively), Nurse Alice (Mary Anderson), solemn passenger Mrs. Higgins (Heather Angel) and a German U-Boat officer the rest dub Willy (Walter Slezak). At first the group is suspicious of their fellow German survivor. Will the group be able to get out of their predicament? As you can imagine in an adapt-and-survive tale like this there are a lot of man versus the elements moments which up the suspense. The group faces raging winds and storms, a lack of potable water, navigation without a compass and illness and injury. If solely taken for a survival story, Lifeboat may just be among the best the decade had to offer. The fact that the entire movie takes place in and around a mid-sized dingy is a testament to Hitchcock's singularly brilliant direction. Of course the well drawn characters were made whole by John Steinbeck who distanced himself from the film for its ""positive portrayal"" of the Nazi character.<br/><br/>The fact that many critics at the time dismissed the film for being too pro-Nazi is an attestation to the fear and hatred shared by the allies, particularly the British towards the Germans. In newsreels, magazines and comic books the enemy was seen as subhuman and bloodthirsty. In Lifeboat the character Willy was sneaky, untrustworthy and manipulative and for that he was considered not villainous enough? Who were they expecting; Beelzebub? Sauron?<br/><br/>I was half-expecting the survivors of the shipwreck to be more symbiotic. The other half was hoping that if and when things do get all ""Lord of the Flies"", when the survivors are rescued there'd be a moment of contrition. Neither of these things happens and we're left with a little too much chest-pounding for my taste; the voice of reason and law muted by mob rule.<br/><br/>Of course I am too far removed from the realities of the time. Hitchcock wanted to represent a group of squabbling allies who mobilize to confront a seemingly invincible foe; a microcosm of the larger conflicts of WWII. The animosities of the time were due to perceived stakes and luckily I have never had to experience the cruelties of the Third Reich first hand so who am I to talk? Transplanting a modern perspective on an aged piece of art is like putting a CD player in a 1965 Mustang; it diminishes the art.<br/><br/>Lifeboat ultimately is a masterpiece of the highest order. Engrossing, technically flawless and thematically brilliant, the movie about a band of survivors faced with the vastness of the Atlantic Ocean is yet another feather in Hitchcock's derby. More than that, it's a telling piece of cinematic history that accurately sums up the frightening uncertainty of a world consumed by war. Do yourself a favor and set sail for Lifeboat.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
"ElMaruecan82","8","2","3","5 April 2012"," Victim of its historical context ...
","Although Germany would forever carry the 'moral' responsibility of World War II, a reasonable analysis would show that the peace concluded after World War I planted the seeds of an inevitable conflict, by allowing the rise of totalitarian dictatorships. History is so capricious that sometimes, the truth depends on the chronological limits you apply to your perception and as time goes by, it is written with more objective letters, and facts are gradually put into perspective and not carried away by some patriotic fever. The Holocaust will still be remembered as one of the most atrocious and shameful pages of Humanity's History, but the way the worldwide conflict ended with the dropping of two bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is still leaving us uncertain about the meaning of what is right or wrong, or when a life starts to have more value than another.<br/><br/>That is for me the touchy issue of any war, any conflict, all lives are equal and if there might be such a thing as a good or a right side, there's not such a thing as a life that deserves to die more than another. <br/><br/>""Lifeboat"" was not only made before some movies like ""Das Boot"" or ""Downfall"" would show that Germans suffered from World War II as much as any people, but it was made before the conflict even stopped, a time where propaganda was prevailing and somewhat necessary. ""Lifeboat"" was directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1944, when World War II was reaching its pinnacle, the Axis was suffering its first defeats, but the road was still long for the Allies, the D-Day, the two atomic bombs were not part of history and Hitler was still referred to in the present. The context here is important because it puts us right in the middle of the most important conflict that ever changed the face of the World and provides enough insights to judge the film with objectivity. <br/><br/>And two things occurred to me after watching ""Lifeboat"" several times: it is a great thriller film, but it's also a blatant case of propaganda, which would have been more acceptable if Hitchcock didn't make it.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's film is adapted from a novel by John Steinbeck and it tells the story of several survivors of a ship torpedoed by a German U-Boat, all from different backgrounds. Constance 'Connie' Porter is an international journalist with a strange yet appealing femme-fatale charm played by Tallulah Bankhead, Henry Hull is Rittenhouse, a rich businessman, William Bendix is Gus Smith, a radio operator, there is also a nurse, a steward, 'Sparks', a Biritish sailor played by a young Hume Cronyn and John Kovac, an engineer with communist tendencies played by the namesake Hodiak (an underrated actor who died at the early age of 41). The pivotal moment occurs when they rescue one of the very men who sunk the ship: Walter Sleazak as Willi, the German captain. Interestingly, while most of the survivors are American, two of them have European backgrounds, Kovac's parents are Tchekoslovaquian, and Smith's original name was Schmidt. Gus' resemblance with Willi is a remembrance that the issue was not with Willi being a German, but a Nazi, as if Willi automatically embodied the vileness of the Nazism.<br/><br/>""Lifeboat"" plays like World War II in microcosm and in a way, all the characters convey the strengths and weaknesses of their side. The Allies are good-hearted, with this Christian generosity than can pass for weakness in the way they treat Willi, and Willi is the most intelligent, practical, capable to amputate a leg, to row, and with great notions of sailing. He represents the 'greatness' of Germania and he's also evil, treacherous and naturally inclined to kill. Of course, I wouldn't have expected Willi to be like the Captain from ""Das Boot"" and the film needed a suitable villain, on which I must admit that Sleazak did a great job, because although he was particularly evil, his demise was quite horrific. The problem is that he was meant to prove that the survivors were wrong not to have prejudices against him and should have thrown him in the water the minute he said 'Danke shon' as if any other German would have acted the same. This generalization was still ambiguous and I would have accepted Willi happening to be a vile Nazi if the film wasn't 'ruined' by the ending where another Nazi soldier showed that he was no better than Willi, proving in substance than any German is an evil Nazi.<br/><br/>I still give the movie an 8, because it started as a gripping thriller and ended in a brilliant piece of propaganda and for the sake of objectivity, I can't judge this with today's eyes. Still, I wish Hitchcock could have avoided the patronizing statements of the last minute of the film. ""Lifeboat"" could have been a real masterpiece, but a masterpiece it is not.<br/><br/>By the way, how do you determine what is or what is not a masterpiece? <br/><br/>Well, I remember an interesting statement made by Orson Welles on the ""Dick Cavett Show"". He said that basically you could make a masterpiece in anything: even in pornography, if you intended to excite people and stimulate them sexually. However, you could never make a masterpiece that happens to be a pornographic film, because a masterpiece is something that elevates human spirit and challenge the emotions to a unique and unknown dimension, libido is too low and too easily aroused to be considered. And on that aspect, I would also add propaganda, which is aimed to convey an instinct of superiority; you can make a masterpiece of propaganda, but not a masterpiece that happens to be a 'propaganda' film.<br/><br/>I don't know what was Hitchcock's intent with ""Lifeboat"", but I guess that by trying to make both, neither of them worked."

","I wouldn't have expected that here Oscar nominated Sir Alfred Hitchcock, master of suspense, directed a war film, but on the other hand it is not really what I expected. It is pretty much like Rear Window, set in one location, and relying more on the chat than some action to get to the bottom of things. Basically it is World War II, and a ship has been torpedoed and sunk, along with its attacker, and many survivors are gathering in the nearest lifeboat. All are different backgrounds: columnist Constance Porter (Tallulah Bankhead), engineer of the ship Kovac (John Hodiak), radio operator Stanley Garrett (Hume Cronyn), nurse Alice MacKenzie (Mary Anderson), millionaire Charles 'Ritt' Rittenouse (Henry Hull), seaman Gus Smith (William Bendix), steward Joe (Canada Lee), and Mrs. Higgins (Heather Angel), a hysterical Englishwoman holding her dead baby. Though all these characters have different backgrounds, they put this aside to try and survive. Then German U-boat captain Willy (Walter Slezak) joins them, luckily Connie interprets to get direction toward Bermuda. As they travel they have to deal with disagreements, a leg that has to come because of gangrene, the hysterical mother drowning herself, and eventually, they realise that Willy in a stormy moment does speak English. Slowly they (and us the audience) see there is more to this suspicious character, he seems to have a compass, but more importantly more energy, because they find out he has a secret water supply. Towards the end they dispose of him over the boat, are almost rescued/captured (whatever your opinion) by a German supply ship which is attacked by the next oncoming ship, and sinks, and in the end, you don't see them being rescued, but there is that other ship coming, so we can only hope they did. It may not be as witty and exciting (well, suspenseful is probably the better word) as Rear Window, but it certainly does have some good moments and tiny twists. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Original Story for John Steinbeck. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!"
"carlas-1","Null","2","3","13 October 2007"," Takes a little higher order thinking
","This movie, on the surface, seems to be just another wartime movie with all the trappings: the enemy, the hero (in this case heroes), etc. but upon further analysis, one can see that it is a masterpiece. Take, for instance, the way that the writer and director treat Ms Bankhead's character, Connie Porter. When I first watched the movie, I thought ""Oh boy, like that would really happen"": referring to Connie in the lifeboat, unscathed and looking ready for, as another character said ""The Stork Club"". Then I realized that this pristine appearance would slowly evolve as we see more of the character unravel. Rarely is the lady with the baby mentioned on message boards here, but she is worthy of discussion. She was in shock and as far from reality as a person can get, and who knows why she jumped overboard? Could it have been to end her life, which she felt useless without the child...or could it have been to jump overboard to find the baby? Character studies in this movie were splendid. The only one I did not think was developed enough was Rittenhouse, which could have been deliberate on Hitchcock's part because he rarely missed things like this. The film was the kind of thriller I like to see...one of the mind, without utter and gratuitous gore. Too bad it did not get the attention it deserved though understandable in light of the controversy of the ""pro-Nazi""/""anti-Nazi"" when it was made and released. Worth a look....and some higher order thinking....for anyone who likes ""old movies""."
"MovieKen","8","2","3","3 April 2007"," Not my favorite, but still pretty good
","Just in case you don't know already what this movie is all about, here's a brief synopsis: During the Second World War, a German submarine sinks an ocean liner en route to England. Eight survivors from the ship scramble their way onto a lifeboat. Later, one more passenger climbs aboard, and it turns out he is a German officer from the sunken submarine.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is really just a character drama. We see some pretty average and ordinary people trying to survive long enough on this boat under increasingly difficult circumstances. I personally think this is a pretty realistic movie about how some people would likely react in the same situation. The acting is quite good, and the character development could not have been done any better. I think anyone desiring to write a screenplay should have to watch this film as an example of how to develop realistic and deep characters. In fact, I think most of today's movie directors could improve after watching this movie.<br/><br/>It is a very effective film, and it has not been padded with any extra non-essential fluff. In fact, it seems every scene builds on the previous one as the movie gradually builds to its conclusion. Again, the focus is not on the events of the film, but on the characters, and specifically, how each character reacts to what happens.<br/><br/>Having said that, this isn't one of my favorites, nor is it one that I would be in a hurry to watch any time soon. But that's only because it is not the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen. On the other hand, it is the kind of film you just keep watching to see what will happen next. Once you start, you're pretty much hooked.<br/><br/>Be warned, though, the movie is a bit slow because the focus is on the characters and not on the events. If you prefer constant action, you should skip this one, because you will probably fall asleep after the first 5 minutes.<br/><br/>One last thing, and this is where the potential spoiler may be hidden. Stop reading now if you want to be surprised.<br/><br/>* *<br/><br/>BEGIN SPOILER - <br/><br/>Actually, it's more like a goof than a spoiler, but it's an essential plot point, so I'm going to hide it from people who don't want to know anything else about this movie other than the brief intro.<br/><br/>In one scene, the character who is supposed to be the boat's navigator finds out that they have been heading in the wrong direction because of the position of the planets Mars and Venus. That probably sounded like a reasonable explanation to people like Alfred Hitchcock and John Steinbeck, or to anyone who is not familiar with astronomy. But the problem is that every ship navigator's understanding of astronomy would prevent them from ever plotting a course based on the positions of the planets. They would only plot their course based on the stars, and specifically, the North Star.<br/><br/>The planets change positions in the sky much too quickly. From one night to the next, the same planet will be in a different position in the sky even at the exact same time of night. The North Star, on the other hand, is almost perfectly aligned with the North Pole. That means its position in the night sky almost never changes. The other stars in the sky seem to move in a circular motion around the North Pole, due to the rotation of the Earth. The planets, on the other hand, do not move this way, and therefore, plotting a course at sea based on the planets is bound to lead to some pretty unexpected results.<br/><br/>Even ancient mariners knew this, and in fact, the word ""planet"" comes from an ancient Greek word which means ""wandering star."" The Greeks and other civilizations knew the planets moved differently in the sky, and that's why they charted their courses based on the stars instead.<br/><br/>Any navigator in the 1940s would also know this, so it's unlikely that the ship's navigator would have told this character that they were heading toward Venus, or Mars, or any other planet.<br/><br/>Again, this is more like a goof than a spoiler, but as soon as I took notice of it, I had to dock the film at least a point or two. Most of the film is very realistic, but on this one point, someone messed up somewhere. No, it doesn't ruin the film, but in my opinion, it's enough to drop a potentially 9 or 10 vote down to an 8. No navigator would have made this mistake.<br/><br/>END SPOILER -"

","I consider this movie one of the four best Hitchcock's films. (Along with Rear Window, Birds, Psycho.) It is amazing that essentially the whole movie takes place in the lifeboat. This could be done only - while making an interesting movie - with excellent cinematography and character development. We learn about the character of each survivor, through their interactions with each other and how they handle the various smaller crisis situations as well as their attitude to the possibility of not surviving.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, moral questions which will beg discussion forever are developed and approached with an amazing clarity. The movie makes viewers talk about these moral decisions long after the film ended."
"MBCD","8","2","3","24 October 2005"," Very interesting political commentary from Hitchcock, packaged as an adventure flick.
","This movie's strength is not so much the execution but rather the great and risky idea. It's the kind of WWII movie that you'd expect to see done 30 years after the fact (when it's safely irrelevant). But Hitch dropped this one on the public right in the middle of the unfinished war.<br/><br/>The show takes a handful of different characters, drops them into a lifeboat after a German sub sinks their ship, and then watches the personalities play out against each other. It's a metaphor for what society as a whole was doing at the time. Through modern eyes, the movie is definitely good but not quite spectacular.<br/><br/>The characters help make the show. In modern movies like this, you'd expect to get totally flat stereotypes for most of the smaller roles. Then the writer would strive to make the 2 or 3 primary characters SO much more interesting than the others, and so the primaries would start feeling a little contrived anyway. But in this case, Hitchcock struck a middle ground of characters that all seem reasonably predictable but still interesting in little ways. It feels realistic.<br/><br/>I hate to point to a solid old character drama and say: ""It needed more dazzling special effects"" but in this case I think it actually would help some. The whole movie takes place on the lifeboat (soundstaged) and the rickety background projection sometimes gets a little distracting in the tense storm scenes.<br/><br/>It's a good show that could use a good remake. 50 years later this movie is still more thought-provoking than most newer films about the war."

Nearly 75 years old, this is still faultless with a wonderful cast of characters, stuck in a lifeboat after a U-Boat takes out their WW2 ship. The dialogue is masterful and the delivery more so.

"Dan1863Sickles","7","1","1","14 September 2017"," Some Thoughts From A Steinbeck Fan
","Everyone remembers this as a Hitchcock film, and all of the reviews focus on how the great director shaped the material and gave every scene and frame his distinctive style. I saw this movie at the age of 12 and I loved it, but more than forty years later I'm really struck by the literary themes and the presence of great novelist John Steinbeck.<br/><br/>There's a reason why they call this ""John Steinbeck's Lifeboat.""<br/><br/>First I want to point out that this is a study of a group. Just the way THE GRAPES OF WRATH is about the Joads, and the Okies in flight, much more than about individuals like Tom or Casy, so in this story the lifeboat survivors are only meant to matter to the extent that they work together for common goals and uphold common values. In fact the one way the villain sticks out is that he's self- sufficient, able to keep his own counsel and do everything on his own. Steinbeck is always suspicious of individualism and even of individual strengths. The collective is everything to him, the survival of the group and not the triumph of the individual. <br/><br/>At the same time, when you look at the terrible murder in the middle of the movie, it bears an uncanny resemblance to the end of OF MICE AND MEN. Willi the U-Boat Captain and Gus the doomed cripple have a very personal scene in which they sound a lot like George and Lennie! Of course the viewer can decide if Willi really felt any compassion at all for Lennie or if he's an evil Nazi through and through. But the arguments he makes for getting rid of Gus are those George makes about Lennie in similar circumstances. <br/><br/>This movie reflects the great strengths of John Steinbeck's humanity and concern for the survival of the human community. It also reflects some of his weaknesses, particularly where the female characters are concerned. Tallulah Bankhead does wonders as Connie, the tough, hard-edged journalist, but it's fair to say that Steinbeck had a tendency to see women as either hard, vicious, and predatory, or weak, soft, and helpless. The young mother with the dead baby is presented as a pitiable victim but at the same time there's a sense of Steinbeck's vague distaste for the maternal instinct, since it reduces women to an animal-like state or to a state of total hysteria. It's no accident that the mother gets killed off early and that the hard, aggressive woman is not allowed much in the way of affection or friendship. Of course there is a romance between the British sailor and the nurse, but they are probably more Hitchcock's invention than Steinbeck's. Both are good comrades who keep a stiff upper lip, more English than American. <br/><br/>To sum up, this movie is a Hitchcock classic, but it's also a fascinating look at the world view of a Nobel prize winning author who was then at the height of his powers."
"zkonedog","7","1","1","10 March 2017"," Hitchcock's Character Study
","Though many of Alfred Hitchcock's films are extraordinary at developing characters, that development often plays second-fiddle to suspense, drama, & even subtle comedy. In ""Lifeboat"", however, the characters are on center stage throughout the entire experience, with Hitchcock masterful crafting them one by one...until the ending, of course.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Lifeboat"" tells the story of a group of Americans trapped on a lifeboat after the Nazi bombing of a freighter. When a German U-boat captain is pulled aboard and portends to know the direction they should be sailing, the characters must decide whether or not to trust the enemy captain. Along the way, all the personality types and individual prejudices are the survivors are explored.<br/><br/>In terms of a character treatise, this is an excellent film...one of Hitch's very best. I am a big fan of ""bunch of people trapped in a situation"" movies, so I was instantly drawn to this type of movie and was not let down. Though Hitch usually deals with personal/political topics in a very off- hand, tongue-in-cheek sort of way, he really seems to delve into them with much more gusto in ""Lifeboat"". Upon reaching the end, you'll feel as if you truly care about the characters and their motives/personalities.<br/><br/>The acting is also top-notch, with a case of seasoned veterans like Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Walter Slezak, John Hodiak, and Henry Hull, among others. In films of this nature (think: 12 Angry Men, for instance) the acting must be spot-in in order to generate emotion, as very few outside factors can be utilized.<br/><br/>Minor Spoiler: Sadly, the glaring weakness of this movie (and what keeps it from being a true classic) is its horrible ending. Hitchcock has a long history of sub-par endings, but this one might be the ""cream of the crop"" in terms of ridiculousness. For a film screaming for character resolution, this one gives you NOTHING. It literally just ends. Perhaps that was acceptable back in the 1940s, but today it is unforgivable.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""Lifeboat"" is a very interesting character study that is easily worthy of four- stars. Had it offered a bit of resolution, this could have rocketed to the top of Hitchcock's filmography. As it is, it's just a solid effort that fails in one key area."

But the differences between appearance and reality are illuminated as the story presents hardship after hardship.<br/><br/>Issues of class, race and politics are highlighted as Hitchcock strips away the veneer of society's rules and peels back the layers that make up the personality of each character. The film asks if you can truly know anyone. It suggests that people behave differently in times of emergency and extreme stress. But are we merely seeing the true nature of people in such moments?<br/><br/>Given world circumstances, the German character (Walter Slezak as Willi) becomes the symbol for an entire nation and its political philosophy. Or is he merely a man who also suffers at the hands of his misguided military leaders?<br/><br/>The boat becomes its own ""country"", where concepts of governance are tested. This is an important part of the story, for it shows that one's political preferences reveal one's true beliefs about the nature of man.<br/><br/>With such a brilliant script (from a story by William Steinbeck), an excellent cast, and Hitchcock's shining stewardship, it is no wonder that ""Lifeboat"" is a film that will never lose its luster or its relevance."

"dougdoepke","Null","1","1","29 September 2013"," Close-in Drama
","No need to recap the plot.<br/><br/>As a commentary on WWII and Nazis, the film is dated; as an allegory on democratic individualism, the movie's still relevant. The survivors, excepting Nazi Slezak, represent a cross-section of American society, from the upper-class Bankhead to the working class Bendix, including black man Lee, and by innuendo, communist Hodiak. How these representative types thrown together manage to coordinate under lifeboat conditions drives the storyline.<br/><br/>For example, note how prosperous businessman Hull assumes command without democratic procedure. Of course, there does need to be a division of duties so what needs to get done gets done. Moreover, he would be the logical choice since he heads factories, but he does not put it to a vote. Instead, he simply assumes the right. However, after a number of difficulties, Hodiak takes command by democratic consent, and I wonder if this too implies a political judgement on writer Steinbeck's part. In addition are the inevitable complications among the survivors including budding romances and class rivalries.<br/><br/>However, once Nazi Slezak is taken aboard, moral questions arise about what to do with an enemy captain. Being a Nazi during wartime means, of course, that Slezak can't be trusted, and indeed he has a number of tricks up his sleeve. But being the only sailor aboard, his seamanship has to be weighed against his politics. This sets up an interesting dilemma that the survivors must ponder. Only Hodiak senses the danger of putting him in charge of the boat's course. And again I wonder if this is Steinbeck's commentary on pre-war American politics when Americans tended to be apathetic about the Third Reich menace. However, that may be, the resolution remains a violent stunner.<br/><br/>Despite 90-minutes of a confined stage, Hitch makes things interesting with his targeted close-ups and other visual ploys. The acting too is first-rate, and I'm particularly impressed by Bankhead. Her headstrong personality is riveting. Too bad she didn't make more movies, her preference apparently being the stage. Anyway, the movie has dated in many ways, but still poses the question of how to coordinate in extreme conditions among a diverse group of people. It's not front-rank Hitchcock, but remains worthwhile for that reason."

","If Lifeboat isn't one of the great, unheard of Hitchcock films that he ever made, then I guess I must just have been more ignorant prior to watching it than I thought. The film is a simple, routine and straight forward drama driven by script and scenario which works better than most dramas do having had a gazillion-and-one things thrown at it. Set in one location for its entire duration, and I read drawing on influence from a stage show of similar ilk, Lifeboat is a never anything less than fascinating film feeding off this really effective sense of isolation and being stranded with different classes; genders and the enemy. It is a survival film, but a film wherein characters must use their wits and minds to work through situations; one wherein writers must use their own respective qualities in this department to further things along whilst running on a minimalist premise. When the on screen drama comes off, and the author is firing on all cylinders in the manner they are here with what they have their characters say; do and how they manipulate fate to up the ante, the results are quite extraordinary pieces of film-making. Lifeboat is one of these instances.<br/><br/>The film covers an array of personnel aboard a lifeboat, the titular lifeboat; a small yet large enough vessel for all half a dozen or so people coming to terms with the fact their ship has been shelled by a German U-boat in the Atlantic and they are now stuck riding the waves of the open sea. We are in the middle of The Second World War and, in a cruel twist of fate, the U-boat itself is struck and sunk resulting in a lone German sailor clambering aboard and into the fray. This of course causes issues given the global situation, but adds an extra dimension to things via the problem with the language barrier.<br/><br/>One might say the presence of these people together like this is representative of how people at the time came to find themselves stuck in a situation of global conflict as a whole. Different folk of British and American ilk, some female and some male; some white and one even African American – all of different classes and backgrounds, are here all together in the same boat (quite literally) at the bereft of a German attack no one saw coming and no one expected would interrupt their pleasant lives as they ploughed on. The presence of a German is intriguing in this sense, if beyond the fact it might act as a petty source for some form of antagonism in the future. Where cries of ""propaganda"" might arise, it is interesting to observe just how much more bloodthirsty certain American characters are in this film during this time of German induced mass-slaughter in Europe. Here, the German is not a beacon of evil or a mere stock villain; he is just as smart (if not smarter) than anyone else and is depicted as his own entity with a realistic set of goals for the scenario.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully paced and wonderfully directed; taking this premise of a bunch of people trapped in a boat and wrenching out as much heightened tension and such as possible without ever becoming stuck or just feeling like it were plodding along. Concept drams such as these have worked well in the past, films one can pitch in a sentence or a single line; in 1994 film Speed's case, a character is even able to outline three quarters (or the part most people remember) of the plot through a line of dialogue one feels they might say in that situation anyway regarding bombs on buses and the figures behind such a situation. There is less of that sense of spectacle in Lifeboat, but that same sense of energy and drama. The film doesn't have the room for its characters that films such as Cellular did, its inhabitants are stuck where they stand, but if we desire cause and effect to drive the proceedings, the 'cause' must often from within the craft itself while the 'effect' must then go on to have such a thing on everyone in said craft. If there was one film you had to see in addition to the standardised Hitchcock canon, one that didn't get the reputation and word of mouth most in said canon do, make it Lifeboat."

","***SPOILERS*** Far more effective then almost all of the films made during WWII in Hollywood in it showing the dreaded Nazis or Germans as formidable enemies not mindless brute's whom we ,the good guys, easily out think and fight to the point where you begin to wonder, in spite of the Nazis amazing military success in the early years of WWII, how did they even happen to get that far in the first place.<br/><br/>After being sunk and it's passengers shelled by a Nazi U-Boat in the North Atlantic the U-boat itself is hit by allied naval fire and sunk. As the survivors of the passenger ship assemble on a life boat they get an unexpected new passenger or visitor the captain of the U-boat that sunk and shelled them Willie, Water Slezak. Debating if to throw the ""water rat"" overboard or keep him as a POW the people on the lifeboat are convinced by both the high class and sophisticated writer and critic Connie Porter, Tallulah Bankhead, and industrialist Ritt Rirtterhoue,Henry C. Hull, to keep him alive. Since as Ritt says were not the inhuman savages that he his.<br/><br/>As the people on the life boat soon find out that not only Willie speaks perfect English he's, by being a U-boat captain, also very helpful in their survival at sea. But what they later realize is that Willie is only interested in his own survival not theirs. He's steering the lifeboat to a pre arranged rendezvous with a Nazi supply ship not to the island of Bermuda as he's been telling them all along. And when rescued by the German supply ship they'll all end up in a Nazi concentration camp where for the most part they won't survive the war!<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** It's when Willie gets a bit too over confident in his actions that he gives himself away. Thinking that he's a member of the Master Race and the passengers on the life boat are nothing but sub humans Willie makes his mistake by shoving the wounded and helpless American seaman Gus Smith, William Bendix, overboard in order to lighten the load. Confidently feeling he can put this one, the murder of Gus, over on his shocked fellow boat-mates the outraged passengers storm Willie and deep six him instead. Finally about to be rescued by a US naval destroyer who just sunk the German supply that was about to ""rescue"" them up pops another German sailor survivor from the sunken ship, William Yetter Jr, with the same ideas that Willie had in taking control of the life boat. But this time around the now wiser passengers on the boat don't let their guard down like they did before. Which to their benefit guarantees their survival as well as the befuddled , in thinking that they'll throw him overboard, German sailor.<br/><br/>P.S Alfred Hitchcock got a lot of criticism for making out Willie the German U-boat captain the real brains behind the shipwrecked passengers surviving in their ordeal at sea. But as Hitchcock correctly explained in that by underestimating your enemies you give then the edge to defeat you! Which is exactly why the Germans were so successful in the beginning and even end of WWII by them inflicting far more losses on the victorious allies, in some case like on the critical Eastern Front as much 8 to 1 in their favor, then they suffered in return!"

","There was only one true master of 20th century cinema and you can guess who that was. I haven't really found any director who could make so many exciting and interesting films as this brilliant man. Others had their hits and misses, but only he scored time and time again.<br/><br/>Lifeboat, while not as visually exciting as North by Northwest or Psycho is all that high drama should be. Sure, it has tricks up its sleeve and you might get lost if you don't follow what's on the screen, frame by frame.<br/><br/>One minor flaw is that it tries to cram a moral down your throat at the very end, something I would never believe would be in a Hitchcock film but I suppose, that it was a different time in the world from 1939 to 1945. Maybe it was the producers who forced Hitchcock to make this a message picture at the last minute.<br/><br/>Still, it has some great performers like Tallulah Bankhead. I just love her voice. William Bendix as the wounded soldier is quite effective too but the winner has to be Walter Slezak, as the sinister German U-Boat Captain.<br/><br/>There is something that I noticed at the mid-point, involving the death of one of the characters. It leaves a lot of questions and I took little notice to it the first time around. Watch it yourself and you will see how it is never properly dealt with throughout the rest of the picture and that is exactly what Hitchcock intended. Because of that scene, I will say that this was something out of the ordinary at that time, where you were usually treated to a lengthy explanatory sequence about how the whole thing happened. It makes the movie all that more interesting."

Did the Allies have a reason to trust the German? Did they even have a reason to spare his life? Does morality shift in war time? <br/><br/>I think this film is even more powerful given that it was from 1944, when the Nazis and Allies were still at war. Making this film in the 1960s would not have been so bold, although the moral question would still arise. How would this compare today? An al-Qaeda member who had just killed several people?

The film follows the quest to safety in Bermuda. However, only Willy knows the way.....<br/><br/>The story provides suspense as we watch Willy gradually take over control of the lifeboat. He is assured and possesses all the necessary skills that are called upon including surgery, seamanship, strength and a peculiar navigational awareness.... Do we, the audience, trust him just as the other members in the lifeboat have to? He seems nice enough.<br/><br/>The cast are good with Tallulah Bankhead and Walter Slezak winning the acting honours. Hume Cronym as ""Sparks"" has a peculiar voice and John Hodiak as ""Kovac"" has an unfortunate array of teeth in his mouth - he reminded me of 'Bingo' from the ""Banana Splits"" whenever he smiled. It's quite off-putting.<br/><br/>It's an entertaining film, if a little long, but it's worth seeing again.

","This is one of the most impressive Alfred Hitchcock films that I have seen so far. It is impressive because of its extreme experimental success in filming the entire movie on one little rescue boat that is stranded out in the middle of the ocean. Although the film begins rather slowly (most likely in order to let the viewer get to know the movie's characters), the film being so skillfully edited and the script being so well written, you end up becoming entirely engrossed and captivated, therefore easily forgetting that everything you are watching is all taking place on one little boat. <br/><br/>It does not surprise me that ""Lifeboat"" was a bit of a controversial film at first, considering it was released towards the bitter end of world war two. I think that the film's characters, interpretations and metaphorical content are extremely complex and (though, I believe intentionally) self-contradictory. Because of this, I am not surprised that the movie critics and the public at that time were quick to misinterpret its message. <br/><br/>In conclusion, however legitimate my interpretations of the films messages and content may be, I think that it is safe to say that it is truly patriotic and an experimentally successful one of a kind."
"Lejink","7","1","1","31 December 2008"," 6 Men, 3 women (and a baby) in a boat
","Rarely seen Hitchcock thriller which is well worth rooting out. People often forget just how experimental The Master could be and here he prefigures future exercises like the long takes of ""Rope"" and ""Under Capricorn"", the single fixed point setting for ""Rear Window"" and the B & W shock-horror of ""Psycho"" with a psychological drama set entirely at sea in a lifeboat. The difficulties of involving the audience with such a static setting are obvious but with a combination of an imaginative screenplay, first rate ensemble acting and of course Hitch's own masterly direction, this movie grips from start to finish. There are fewer than usual of the director's customary flourishes, instead we get that Hitchcock rarity, an actors' showcase, with fine performances coaxed from all aboard. The writing is subtle yet profound, making its point that the German enemy at large, (remember the film was made midway through the Second World War) isn't an obvious goose-stepping monster but instead a highly intelligent, multi-lingual, individual who for most of the movie deftly manipulates his co-passengers for his own ends. The film also makes telling points about the differing reactions of humans in an extreme situation in war-time but does so by avoiding obvious stereotyping and makes well its ""united we stand, divided we fall"" message. With heavyweight writers like Steinbeck and an uncredited Ben Hecht contributing, the dialogue is gritty and realistic, even risqué at times and only occasionally guilty of big-word incomprehensibility. All the actors deserve praise for their natural acting, reacting on the whole truly to their desperate situation, despite being deluged with an ocean's worth of water. Talullah Bankhead in particular shines as we see her lose all her personal belongings right down to her Cartier bracelet and make-up at the film's conclusion. Only a few of the process shots jar as unrealistic with Hitch's shot selection on the whole correct and intuitive. Of course the film falters a little from the enforced inaction and episodic progress of the narrative but I was engrossed throughout by the taut direction and unravelling of the passengers' ethics and morals as their plight continues. Hardly grace under pressure!"

","A classic Hitchcock movie, this film soaks up every ounce of tension and uses it to the fullest. It starts with the sinking of a ship in the Atlantic Ocean during a U-Boat attack in WWII. A lifeboat floats amidst the debris of the sunken ship, and a woman sits calmly smoking and recording the scene with a camera. From there, she is joined by 7 others, including a German from the boat that had just attacked them. What follows is a tense story of survival and betrayal that keeps everyone guessing. You wonder if this group is not doomed to curse the seven seas like the Flying Dutchman. You might not expect a movie that takes place in such a claustrophobic setting to work so well, but as Hitchcock showed in Rear Window (and Rope, and any number of others) it can be done, and quite well. You would expect nothing less from the master! Required viewing!"

","Now that this movie has been released on DVD, with quite attractive cover art and extras, I'm sure this movie will find a new audience of devotees. I however, am not one of them. This is not a movie I would want in my DVD collection only because after viewing it several times, there's no appeal to watch it repeatedly. There will be many people who will disagree with this but even Hitchcock made this movie as a pure technical challenge more than for a study between the classes in society (shades of Gilligan's Island). Tallulah Bankhead is perfectly cast bringing in sex appeal and her special brand of acting. This is not a disaster of a movie, there are many good qualities to it but in the end it may be too technical for me thus leaving me cold."

","One of the most interesting things about this effort is the presence of a Black man amongst the survivors because the Tallulah Bankhead character is playing a variation of Gene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones, as she gradually loses all vestiges of the civilised life she represents. Bankhead, in fact, is the main reason for watching this typically self-indulgent Hitchcock film, as he strives to illustrate yet again how clever he is. With a story by John Steinbeck, one of the school of thirties 'political' writers, only the most naive would expect a lack of axis (that's NOT a typo) to grind and we're not disappointed - and before you start writing your letters to the editor let me say that I'm a Steinbeck buff. The one thing we can't do, of course, is to view this movie with 1944 eyes but could we do so our reaction may well be colored by our own experience of war; how many loved ones had we lost, did we have a relative in a Concentration camp, etc. Probably the last thing we would have done would be to take it on face value, just another example of the Hollywood 'bomber-crew' syndrome, a disparate group of people thrown together in a confined space waiting for atavism to rear its inevitable head. For the record Bankhead is outstanding and the support is mostly out of the right bottle."
"robert-temple-1","7","2","4","26 April 2017"," The struggle to keep afloat
","This is one of the disappointing Hitchcock films. It is not that it is bad, it is just that it is not particularly good. It proudly proclaims that it was written by the then famous American author John Steinbeck. However, several other fingers were in that pie, and not all of them were called Steinbeck. (Never believe what you see on credits.) The story is simple, and there was only one set. Of course, all the cast got repeatedly drenched, because they were in a lifeboat and passed through storms, pulled themselves out of the water, etc. It was no fun for the actors to make. This film is the only Hitchcock film of which I knew the star very well personally. Of course I did not know her at the time, because this film was made before I was born. I am referring to Tallulah Bankhead, whom I knew well in the 1960s when I was in my teens and she took me under her wing for a while. This is the only film Tallulah made in her 'middle period' between being a glamorous Paramount starlet in several thirties films and making some when she was older. Tallulah dominates this film, just as she dominates the lifeboat. That was what she was like. It is important to know that she did not dominate situations for egotistical or narcissistic reasons at all. To assume that would be to misunderstand her. She did so simply from the overwhelming force and energy of her personality. She was like a human hurricane, and she could not be turned off like a fan or an air conditioner, she was simply on all the time. But she had that droll manner where she could deliver a one-liner put-down spontaneously upon any occasion, and she needed no script for her raucous life. Her close friendships with such writers as Noel Coward and Tennessee Williams were based not just upon her liveliness but upon her scintillating intelligence, razor sharp wit, gift for repartee, wide-ranging knowledge of people and events, and superb dry humour. I cannot imagine her and Hitchcock becoming friends under any circumstances. To describe them as chalk and cheese or oil and water is to underestimate the difference between them. He was essentially a neurotic, closed personality, whereas Tallulah was as open as a shattered French window. If he had let her get close to him, she would have let him know in no time that she thought he was a cowering wimp. She could be withering, but she was never cruel, and often kept her devastating appraisals of other people to herself so as not to hurt their feelings. She was really the perfect choice to dominate a lifeboat on the Atlantic Ocean in the middle of World War Two. Any German encountering her had better be worried. There is a patriotic tinge to this film, with disparaging remarks of the Nazis emphasized in a proud and flag-flying manner. In wartime it is hard to resist beating a few drums, which can throw subtlety overboard sometimes, and not just from lifeboats. The story cannot avoid being rather corny, nor is it realistic. I hesitate to call attention to what are tactfully called natural functions, but when and how did they take place over the many days in that lifeboat? What did they do with William Bendix's leg which had to be amputated? And how did they mop up all the blood? Things like that. Also, why are they all so unconcerned about getting seriously sunburned? But the film was never intended to be realistic, because Alfred Hitchcock was not Roberto Rossellini, and you went to a Hitchcock film knowing that you would get a Hitchcock film, and you always did. And this is one of them that has some holes in the curtain and is not as good as many of the others which sweep you away with his vision-of-the-day. Some of the cast are better than others. Tallulah is the best, of course. Walter Slezak is superb as the German U-boat captain whom they pick up. Henry Hull is excellent as H. J. Rittenhouse (as in the Philadelphia square), a charming multi-millionaire who has thousands of employees but cannot command a lifeboat. John Hodiak as 'the hunk' overacts and clearly suffered from Hitchcock's usual lack of directions to his actors. Canada Lee as the black man has a thankless task, since his role is to stand off to the side and take no part in decisions or events. In the script this was doubtless meant to highlight his oppressed social status, but in the film it merely comes across as his being feeble. No acting challenge there, as all he had to do was stand in the background looking powerless. Two unconvincing romances blossom during the time the cast are stuck on the lifeboat, but it is impossible to believe in either of them. Why Hume Cronyn should suddenly fall in love at the most unlikely time could not possibly be contrived, could it? This film is essentially a 'concept film' which fails its 'proof of concept' test. However, it has its moments."

The movie alternates between interesting passages and less exciting scenes, which makes the ensemble quite uneven and sometimes a bit long. The characters also suffer from a certain heterogeneity, still the group works pretty well and their twists and turns are enjoyable, though sometimes not very realistic. But the most disappointing aspect is the end, not particularly well thought-out and really too abrupt.<br/><br/>One could also debate the propagandist impact of Lifeboat and Hitchcock's approach, some dialogues strongly echoing in the historical context of the period."

","I'm the first to admit I don't like Alfred Hitchcock's movies in general, but Lifeboat is a good one. It's a gamble to make an entire movie about a handful of people stuck in a lifeboat together, with no flashbacks or change of scenery, but Hitchcock makes sure not a moment lags. He keeps up the pace, and uses interesting framing to draw the audience's attention to what he wants them to notice. At the start of the movie, he manages to keep every single person in the frame, showing they're sharing the same feelings. As tensions rise and certain people start pulling away from each other, they're separated into different frames.<br/><br/>In one great scene, everyone's suspicious of the newcomer in the boat, Walter Slezak. Hitchcock shows the other eight congregating on one side of the boat, chatting away. Tallulah Bankhead is given a closeup as she focuses on herself and the loss of her typewriter. Throughout the dialogue, the camera cuts back to Walter, in the same frame with only the man guarding him. Walter inches closer, checking to see no one will notice, so that he might overtake the guard.<br/><br/>Lifeboat is a perfect example of human nature. We've all seen it happen, greed, self-preservation, and stupidity coming to the forefront when human lives are at stake. Taking eight strangers and sticking them in a boat with little hope of rescue will bring out the worst in everyone. How will it unfold? You'll have to watch this entertaining movie (starring Tallulah Bankhead, Henry Hull, John Hodiak, Hume Cronyn, Walter Slezak, Mary Anderson, Heather Angel, Canada Lee, and William Bendix)to find out. If you get seasick, though, you might not be able to watch it. Since the dialogue is so riveting, I'd suggest watching it with a buddy, like my mom did. Put your back to the television and listen to what's going on, then ask your pal to tell you if there's a visual you've missed.<br/><br/>DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend.The entire movie is filmed on the ocean, so there are constant bobbings that will make you sick.

She is amongst only a limited number of people in ""Lifeboat."" Henry Hull, Hume Cronyn, William Bendix are included. There are no extras and Hitchcock's customary appearance is restricted to an illustration in a magazine at the beginning of the film. Hitchcock is sharing the plight of the cast with the viewers by confining the film to a single set - that being of the boat. You sense the incredible difficulty and challenge of the characters as they try to maintain hope that they might be saved. There are no scenes which take place elsewhere. It was a risk as the pressure was on the director to sustain the public's interest. I believe he achieves this. The acting, direction and writing make you forget that the whole film was made on a soundstage. Your imagination does the rest.

Glen MacWilliams received his only Academy recognition when his B&W Cinematography was Oscar nominated. Jo Swerling (The Pride of the Yankees (1942)) wrote the film's screenplay.<br/><br/>The director's mastery of his craft in on full display; he challenged himself by assembling a great cast of actors to play characters from various backgrounds with differing political points of view about World War II etc. and placed them in a very limiting environment, the titled boat.<br/><br/>Their ship had been blown out of the water by the Nazi's, and international journalist Constance 'Connie' Porter (Tallulah Bankhead) is the first to find herself safely aboard the lifeboat; she's dressed in her best jewelry and clothing and has managed to garner her most prized possessions on-board, which she loses one by one during the course of the movie. She's soon joined by millionaire industrialist Charles 'Ritt' Rittenhouse (Henry Hull), working class crew member John Kovac (John Kodiak), sailor Gus Smith (William Bendix) whose leg later has to be amputated, a Black steward named George 'Joe' Spencer (Canada Lee), a radio operator named Stanley 'Sparks' Garrett (Hume Cronyn), who has eyes for nurse Alice MacKenzie (Mary Anderson), a mother who believes the bundle she holds contains her still alive baby (Heather Angel as Mrs. Higley), and even a German U-boat captain they call Willy (Walter Slezak), who doesn't seem to understand their English language but has the ability to manage the boat.<br/><br/>Of course, the 'passengers' debate whether to kill their enemy or not, especially as they get hungry and thirsty as the food and water run out, yet Willy seems to be doing fine rowing (and navigating the direction of) the boat. An odd couple sort of attraction develops between the rich businesswoman, Connie, and the rugged 'commie', Kovac."

","Alfred Hitchock's Lifeboat will almost immediately draw comparisons with Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men. Both almost exclusively take place in a singular location. Both focus on a group of characters confronted with moral dilemma and how their biases, experiences and emotions bubble under and take control of them. It is unusual then, for Hitchock's film to be the lesser one in the art of suspense. 12 Angry Men had a remarkable ability of building up tension within the space and through Lumet's manipulation of focal length, and then finally washing away the heat and stress with rain. Lifeboat floats more breezily along, because inherently there are large gaps that the plot demands to have, being lost at sea. The setting holds it back; it is not nearly an incisive a demonstration of space and composition as something like Rear Window, and because filming at sea was not viable, the characters seem to be half-removed from the background of the endless oceans. Sure, the frame and the boat is continually rocking, and they are pelted with water and wind during the storms, but because Hitchock lacks the ability to pull out (or even swivel around), the master shot is always locked in, and the boat seems to be rooted to the small spot of water, hardly moving at all.<br/><br/>Still, the absence of the traditional score is a nice touch, in that the characters are left with only the soft, incessant lapping of the waves throughout to haunt them. So they can see as far as the eye can see, but it is only water, water and more water, so like the juror's room, the setting closes in claustrophobically, and gives rise to all sorts of conflict. The problem is simple: the American and British are asked to share a lifeboat with a German sailor, only moments are both vessels have been sunk. Opinions immediately start flying about; once a German always a German, the Nuremberg defense, the American vs the Christian way of thinking. Radioman Sparks thinks he should be subject to the proper authoritative procedures, whereas the Army nurse Alice can't understand why there must be so much killing in the world (baffling then, to end up in this line of work). The older, venerable characters are set up as the moral compasses; the good Christian Rittenhouse, and the worldly columnist Connie Porter. And so Hitchcock must inevitably engineer the downfall of their grace and goodwill.<br/><br/>The characterisations are muddled because apart from the clear path set for these two, the other inhabitants of the boat mill about in the background and don't change much (including the literal milling about of the steward Joe, pushed to the metaphorical back of the boat and only called upon to utilise his 'natural' light fingers). The crewman Kovac is initially the most volatile of them all, even more villainous than the Nazi they have just pulled aboard, and takes charge of the boat's direction only because of his own ignorance and spite (even if he is right). Later, out of his compassion for his friend, he finally relents, but after that is content to simply sit back and watch the proceedings play out. There are little bursts of littler consequences; the anger of card cheating fizzles out almost immediately, and Connie loses her mind for a split second...only to be lying in the lap of Kovac the next. <br/><br/>There is some drunken attempt at philosophising from Gus, but the most intriguing character must be the German, Willi. Walter Slezak has the sort of face you might trust, if it were not for the circumstances, and his jovial, ever-smiling outlook while rowing against the current almost allows the others to let their guard down. Willi has mastered the knack for pretending he isn't listening in on the English quarrels, so as Hitchock layers the profiles of his cast so that they are all facing the camera, there he is in the background, with a determined absent-mindedness about his expression, constantly swiveling and marvelling at the empty sky. It is a triumph in blocking for such a limited space, and Slezak dominates it. He sings merrily all day, not even a slight sign of tiring, and in the night cruelly goads a man to seek the depths of the ocean for relief (""Remember your name is Schidmt""). Critics were not happy about this, especially in the midst of the war. How could a Nazi be so resourceful, so sneaky, so clever? But Hitchock respects his villain, building him up as someone who could be an ally in a desperate time, and also making him despicable enough to warrant the fury that sends him overboard with a few solid whacks of the boot from the gentle industrialist Ritt. An inhuman act surely, but is it justified? Very tricky indeed. One last question: does the directorial tag of Hitchock ultimately hurt or better it?"

","The strength of Lifeboat is the very interesting mix of characters who survive the torpedo sinking of their American-British ship by a German u-boat. The movie is described as a propaganda film, shot in 1944 during World War II, and the character of the German boat captain (played by Walter Slezak) gives it that focus; however, it was a pleasure viewing a movie that serves up such a diverse group performed so well by a great cast, Wm. Bendix, John Hodiak, Tallulah Bankhead, Hume Cronyn, Canada Lee, Mary Anderson, Henry Hull, Heather Angel and Walter Slezak as the German. They all share a lifeboat and the German captain remains something of a mystery for much of the movie. With his marine experience, they hope he can help them. I found that Wm. Bendix gave a fine performance and his role proves to be pivotal. Tallulah Bankhead was outstanding as the journalist who shows her detachment from a crisis that has others trembling. In her high heels and well-coiffed hair, her character is not really credible but the air of being above the tragic event reinforces her steely character. She is also a realist and knows the German can help and persuades the others not to abandon him. She also shows a large measure of compassion when misfortune strikes. And she is not above showing passion for John Hodiak, a man who she actually loathes, except for her physical attraction to him. Hodiak's character is high strung, commanding and hateful towards the German. He does not hesitate to try to take control when the chance arises. The fact that he appears shirtless reinforces the macho image. It is an image that attracts and repels the female lead, played by Tallulah Bankhead. Canada Lee is the strong, silent character who adds spiritual solace at critical moments. His fine voice and stature are well suited to the character. Hume Cronyn and Mary Anderson are appealing characters, best described as team players; they also become a couple on the lifeboat. A great effort by director Alfred Hitchcock, it was a departure from his usual thrillers but showed his ability to handle another movie genre. I noticed John Steinbeck's name on the opening frame. One of the great American novelists, the strength of the characterization was likely due to his contribution; however, Steinbeck's disappointment with the movie led to a request to remove his name from the credits. I am glad to see that his name did appear anyway. To my mind, this has the feel of one of his works."

","Passengers are set adrift at sea in a lifeboat with one of the Nazis who torpedoed their ship. Sterling John Steinbeck story brought to life by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. The outstanding cast makes it work. It's arguably the best film made by Tallulah Bankhead, John Hodiak, Mary Anderson, and Heather Angel. Walter Slezak, Hume Cronyn, Henry Hull, and William Bendix are also great. Special mention to boxer- turned-actor Canada Lee, largely forgotten today but here gives one of the finest performances from a black actor in the 1940s. I was very surprised to read that many at the time of the film's release, including John Steinbeck himself, thought Lee's character was too stereotypical. I thought the character was portrayed with a dignity and intelligence that was uncommon for the period. A fine character study and an exceptional movie of its type. The type I refer to being films that stick a bunch of different personalities in a claustrophobic environment and watch them crack. It's a low-key film for Hitchcock but an excellent one."

","A ship is sunk by a German torpedo but before sinking, they fire on the submarine and sinks it. Famous journalist Constance Porter (Tallulah Bankhead) is sitting in the lifeboat by herself. Then others are pulled in. John Kovac worked in the engine room. Sparks Garett (Hume Cronyn) operated the radio. Alice MacKenzie (Mary Anderson) is an Army nurse. C.J. Rittenhouse (Henry Hull) is the wealthy industrialist. Willi (Walter Slezak) is a German who insists that he's just a crewman in the U-boat. Joe Spencer (Canada Lee) is a negro steward rescuing Mrs. Higgins (Heather Angel) and her baby but the baby doesn't survive. Gus Smith (William Bendix) was Schmit but changed his name because of the war.<br/><br/>Director Alfred Hitchcock is putting a bunch of people in a small space under pressure. It was probably controversial for portraying a German as a real human being during wartime. It didn't help that he was so smart. His character is so mesmerizing and memorable. It is very tense and doesn't let up. The tight space restricts movement and forces the people to be on top of each other. The constant rolling in the sea can cause a bit of nausea. That's really the only problem I have. This is quite a ride."

","Shot entirely on a single location, Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat is his first film to employ the minimal settings environment which he used to greater effect in his later career & despite the many constraints of framing so many characters within such limited space, this master director triumphs in creating an effective thriller that even today remains one of his most underrated works.<br/><br/>With its entire plot unfolding on a lifeboat during World War II, Lifeboat concerns a group of survivors left stranded on a lifeboat after their ship & a German U-boat sunk each other in combat. Trouble starts brewing when they pull a man from the water who turns out to be from the U-boat. And so begins the clash of opinions between the rest of boat members as they discuss about what to do with him.<br/><br/>The direction by Hitchcock is brilliant for the manner in which he's able to assign the required screen time to each member on the boat & handles the suspense element beautifully from start to finish. The scripted characters have a complex & morally ambiguous dimension which adds a sense of unpredictability to the entire plot. The camera-work is a gem considering the limited options it had & yet each moment feels crisply captured.<br/><br/>The performances by the cast is no slouch either & everyone portrayed their descending arcs rather well. Also, the music is virtually absent from the entire film but thanks to its cleverly structured narration, there never felt the need for any. On an overall scale, Lifeboat may not be amongst Hitchcock's famous works but it sure was a stepping stone towards his experiments with film narration which he went on to explore remarkably well in his future films."

","Saw The Lifeboat (1944) early this morning, when I was tucked up in bed with flu. Very enjoyable.<br/><br/>It's a really intense exchange of dialogue between very different characters. I could see the inspiration for kitchen-sink drama + (maybe) who-will-survive horror films. Did it influence The Old Man and the Sea? It's Hitchcock with Steinbeck as writer (someone else as screenwriter), so the atmosphere is good. The confined space works really well, with cheesy backdrops of the seascape.<br/><br/>But it's really a propaganda film, so a lot of the charactertisation is unnatural, and the dialogue is sometimes irritating. I actually sympathised with the German, because I would have reacted in that realistic way. And the other characters lost some plausibility, in that they seemed to cheer for themselves selfishly. Maybe that's my contrarian horror-loving prejudice coming through. <br/><br/>Anyway - thank God they were all rescued by the state after committing murder, which turned into a propaganda point. A later Hitch would have taken retribution on those characters, but in the end we get a false justification of the unjustifiable.<br/><br/>In fact this film would have measured up to Hitch's psychological greats if it had been made clear that the German's command was actually in the best interest of the other characters. What do you do then? But that's not going to happen if your release date is circa D-Day!"

","Tallulah Bankhead leads the cast of nine in Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat, a film that doesn't necessarily begin with great impact, but one I left being absorbed with, wishing the story could go on. That's a mark of a film that develops the characters well, when the audience doesn't want the film to conclude and they have to leave the characters forever. The characters in Lifeboat aren't extraordinary people, they start out dry and uninspiring. But as they live in this lifeboat together for days, they begin to change affections with each other and the audience is exposed to the beauty that lies within them. The climatic action was concluding, I looked at the clock, and was disappointed to be leaving these characters I had grown to care like.<br/><br/>Lifeboat's is morally compelling. The screenplay shows the difference between Americans and the Nazis, and tests an individuals trust. I'm the type of person who sees the weakness and humanity in everyone, so I believe everyone is deserving of a second chance. The first act, I had the thought the film was a metaphor for Capital Punishment; the people in the lifeboat against the Nazi were the republicans and the people giving the Nazi a second chance symbolized the Democrats. The characters divide and it's interesting to see them run with the tricky plot line.The big mystery in Lifeboat is the mystery of trust. Trust is the thing that holds our lives from falling to pieces with the people we allow (or don't allow) into our lives and what information about them we chose to tell (or not tell) them about ourselves. <br/><br/>Lifeboat, at the core of the intention, is an anti-Nazi film. It gives Americans the opportunity to offer the Nazi's semi-peace and a second chance. But like I said, once Lifeboat reveals its secrets, the message about the Nazis are cut out with clarity. Lifeboat also explores the bonds made by these characters, bonds that any survivors of an accident could possibly (and most likely) make. <br/><br/>Bankhead is handed a meaty and fascinating character, that she wrings out a great deal from. She carries the film with little help from the actors. Bankhead is marvelous overlooked by many because of the visual effects for the time. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is wonderful and on spot as one could expect. In a film that doesn't have much for the audience to figure out, Hitchcock keeps the audience on edge waiting for a big twist to come, but he allows us to get so personal with the characters that it doesn't matter that the twist never comes.<br/><br/>The technical aspects for this movie are really quite interesting. The film was shot on a sound- stage and in 1944, the visual effects weren't up to today's standards so what we see today in 2013 looks like a simple job, well done, but really required much thought, time and effort. In the finale, especially, the visuals there are something impressive for that time period. The sound is also well-constructed. Hitchcock creates a eerie little movie, with fabulous lead performance and great character development. <br/><br/>Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Alfred Hitchcock's 'Lifeboat', based on a John Steinbeck story about a group of American passengers during World War II whose ship is sunk by a German U-boat, and must pile into a small lifeboat to survive. The entire film is set within the confines of this lifeboat, and the story is set by the emotion and the conversations the passengers have. The story is a dramatic one at best. An array of passengers are aboard, a young woman who loses her child to the rich woman who speaks German and is accused as a Nazi sympathizer.<br/><br/>Along with them, a German Nazi from the U-boat comes aboard as well. At first, the Americans feel sympathy for him, but as time goes on, the Nazi comes to overpower the Americans. Critics at the time of its release were outraged by this fact, and demanded that Hitchcock change the premise. It is thankful he did not hinder to them.

A somewhat ensemble cast, this movie at equal points feels like Stagecoach and Inherit the Wind. Hitchcock achieves a general feeling of isolation in this movie, as almost every shot is a closeup of someone talking, making the audience feel cut off from the rest of the world the same way the refugees are.<br/><br/>Several people from disparate pasts join together, and things are complicated as a German soldier survives his way onto the boat. Racism and ethnocentrism is dealt with beautifully in this movie, as several Americans almost changed their tune as they say the German try and take charge, somewhat successfully. Although when the soldier was shot this movie did border on propaganda (it was 1944... so German's weren't exactly sympathetic figures.) A diamond in the rough of 1940's movies, worth the 96 minute runtime."

The movie seemed to move so fast that there really was no looking away. I was amused the entire time. All of the characters had their own little quirks which we got to learn about quite well since they were stuck together on a boat for a while and you can tell that none of them are too particularly happy to be aboard a lifeboat with each other. I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that Willi (Walter Slezak) was able to save Gus's (William Bendix) and seem like a good guy, but then eventually have to push Gus overboard because he was too injured and too much extra baggage.

I feel that Hitchcocks' experimentation with a one set movie was a great success, and it proves it doesn't take a great production studio, with a lot of sets to make an amazing film. As long as your audience can get pulled into a film and feel like they are apart of everything that is taking place, you have created a great thing.

","What happens when you plonk Tallulah Bankhead (""Darling!"") into a lifeboat with a bunch of other supporting players? Well, Hitchcock's great, very entertaining Lifeboat is the result. Bankhead gives a terrific performance as Connie Porter, pretty much dominating the picture. Hitchcock was reportedly very fond of her, and shaped the film around her performance. After their boat is sunk by the Germans at the height of WW2, a bunch of weary, disparate survivors climb aboard a lifeboat and must face the elements, starvation, and each other, in order to survive. They make a crucial mistake in allowing a Nazi (Walter Slezak) aboard, and this drama unfolds as Bankhead has a rough and ready romance with an earthy John Hodiak (you know that they would jump each other if they just weren't on a darn lifeboat), William Bendix has his leg amputated, Heather Angel's baby is drowned and she jumps overboard to join it, among other things.

"commandercool88","8","0","0","8 July 2008"," An early Hitchcock gem.
","Alfred Hitchcock loved a challenge, and the premise presented in 'Lifeboat' certainly falls under that category. Released during World War II in 1944 and before Hitchcock would make his most recognizable films, John Steinbeck penned the story of nine very different individuals isolated in a lifeboat shortly after a British ship is sunk by the Germans. And as fate would have it, one of these survivors happens to be a Nazi.<br/><br/>'Lifeboat' was met with considerable praise upon its release, but not everyone saw Hitchcock's achievement as the piece of pro-Ally work it was meant to be. Some accused it of being a poster child for the Nazi war effort (when nothing could be further from the truth), and writer Steinbeck criticized the final product as being condescending to Joe, the lone black survivor aboard the boat. Like many other films from its time, Joe is there but not really there (like Sam from 'Casablanca'). Nonetheless, 'Lifeboat' was never a wide success, and it would be many years before its accomplishments would be truly appreciated.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is no stranger to tight, claustrophobic sets. But 'Lifeboat' would be his first. To make a 90 minute feature film without leaving the confines of a lifeboat drifting at sea, that was the mission. No easy feat. Hitchcock took on this character study with politics thrown in the mix and transformed it into a classic setting rich with developed characters, compelling dialogue, and a thick atmosphere. And even though Hitchcock's trademark twists or thrilling murder mysteries are mostly absent from this one, there's more than enough material here to sustain the film's running time.<br/><br/>Tallulah Bankhead, the materialistic journalist focused on delivering the story above all else, practically makes 'Lifeboat' what it is. She is that strong-willed and hard-headed character that a movie like this thrives off of, and her presence on-screen helps make this the powerhouse that it is. The rest of this ensemble cast -- John Hodiak, Walter Slezak, William Bendix, Mary Anderson, Henry Hull, Hume Cronyn, Canada Lee -- all make the most of their roles, butting heads and struggling to survive. 'Lifeboat' may not be one of Hitchcock's most well-known film, or even one of his best, but it's a great piece of film-making that only Hithcock could pull off. A suspenseful and engaging thriller, it crackles with drama during an era few will forget.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

","Lifeboat is an early experimental film by Hitchcock, the film mainly taking place in the limited confines of a lifeboat. A US ship has been bombed, and a number of survivors reach a lifeboat. Connie Porter is a self-interested, strong-willed reporter, Kovac is anti-Nazi, and each of the other characters have their own problems and opinions. When a young mother kills herself after her baby dies, the crew become closer and try to find a way out of their situation, deciding to sail for Bermuda even though their compass is broken. When a German joins the boat they argue over what to do, some don't trust him, others say they cannot just throw him out. The German says he knows which way Bermuda is and the others follow his course. He has another agenda though, appearing to lead them to a Nazi supply ship, keeping the water and food pills for himself. However, when he lets one of the group die they turn against him in typically brutal fashion. However, was he genuinely trying to help them? And how will the group escape now?<br/><br/>The film is of course character driven, but unfortunately many of the characters are not interesting and no matter what happens they seem passive and unemotional. Perhaps this was on purpose because of the starvation and dehydration, perhaps because the performances of some are average. Each actor does well, but none stand out and the tension created is small until the last 15 minutes or so. However, the film is still watchable and we do want to see if they will escape or not, and what they will do to Willy, the German Captain who sunk their ship. It is true that Hitchcock would hone these elements in later films such as Rear Window and Rope. It is interesting because we would ask ourselves what we would do in such a situation, perhaps being exposed to our enemies or those we do not trust.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","I can't believe that so many people thought Tallulah Bankhead was great in her role in Lifeboat. In my opinion, she drags down what could have been one of Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces. She chews up every scene with her over-the-top acting style. It becomes tiresome instantly. Her character is by far the least compelling of the group. I know Hitch made the film for her, more than anything, but it would be interesting to see someone remake this film and subtract that character. Why remake Psycho? It's perfect. Remake one that is somewhat flawed. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is outstanding, however. I love Hume Cronyn. He's also great in Hitch's Shadow of a Doubt, and, of course, everything else he was ever in. I am not familiar with most of the other actors, but they're all great. <br/><br/>Besides acting, Lifeboat is one of Hitch's most interesting films in every aspect. First off, it is historically interesting. For one thing, there is an ad at the very end of the film telling you to buy war bonds in the lobby! If you've read the Truffaut interview book, Hitch explains how angry Americans grew over this film because of its depiction of the German vs the depiction of the Allies. This film is actually incredibly brave in this way. It definitely is not anti-Ally in any way, as some interpreted when the film was first released. There are plenty of references to the inhumanity of the Germans and just a lot of general enemy-bashing. But the film also criticizes aspects of our culture, especially materialism. In the best scene of the film, the Allies form a mob, or a pack of wolves, as Hitch himself has said, and kill their enemy. It is an incredibly great moment. The ending is also one of Hitch's most complex, although he was especially gifted for creating incredible endings. Anyhow, see this film, even if you are not a Hitch fan. It is in no way his standard fare (the typical Hitchcock film being, in my thought, Ti Catch a Thief). 8/10, -2 for Tallulah Bankhead's mega-ego and terrible performance."

We don't have personalities functioning so much anymore - the Bette Davises, the Katharine Hepburns -- but ""Lifeboat"" demonstrates the truth of that statement with one of the great personalities, Tallulah Bankhead.<br/><br/>On film in the early '30s, Bankhead wasn't as effective as she is here, mainly because she played ordinary roles that anyone could have played. Here, the stunning actress plays a journalist, Constance Porter, as filtered through Tallulah -- in a mink, sitting on the boat with a typewriter, a camera, and wearing a Cartier bracelet, as she addressed everyone as ""darling.""<br/><br/>Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"" was a World War II film about a group of people stranded in a lifeboat after the Germans sink their ship. The stars, besides Bankhead, are John Hodiak, Hume Cronyn, William Bendix, Mary Anderson, Henry Hull, Canada Lee, and Walter Slezak as the Nazi who hitches a ride and nearly outsmarts them all - quite a statement during the war.<br/><br/>It's a story of disparate people working together trying to survive through horrific weather conditions at times, injuries, hunger, and thirst, and then being virtually taken over by a Superman who sings in German and can row the boat, probably toward a German supply ship instead of Bermuda. ""So we're all going to fold up and die,"" Constance says to the passengers when they have lost hope. ""We not only let the Nazi do our rowing for us, but our thinking!""<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful, from Hume Cronyn as a Cockney, Slezak as the cruel German, macho John Hodiak coming on to Constance, and beautiful Mary Anderson as a troubled young woman. Especially poignant was William Bendix's performance as Gus, a regular guy in love with a good-time girl named Rosie.<br/><br/>A very exciting film, done in the days before special effects -- it's a tribute to Hitchcock's ingenuity."
"dvts","Null","1","2","12 November 2015"," propaganda with a difference
","Weirdly sophisticated because it does something you rarely see in war propaganda - functions by wholeheartedly accepting as true a piece of enemy propaganda. Whatever contemporary critics thought, it's Allied propaganda - a call to unity and solidarity among the diverse elements and interests of the Allied west, specifically in the US. It's also a brutal denunciation of what the film wants us to believe are Nazi ethics, and in contrast, a celebration of what the film wants us to believe are Allied/American ethics. The Nazis are devious, callous, amoral, selfish, and without compassion, even if outwardly friendly. Even where they seem human, they are in fact inhuman monsters, most merciless precisely towards those who are most vulnerable and least useful.<br/><br/>And if that were all, it'd be more or less typical war propaganda. But it's how it achieves it, or things it does in the course of achieving it, that makes it strange and made Allied media dislike it. <br/><br/>To make the point about German heartlessness and deviousness, the u-boat captain is portrayed as outwardly likable and sympathetic and human. He's played by a likable-looking actor, a heavyset guy with a kind-looking face and even a kind voice. And at every step throughout the film, practically, he's set up as sympathetic, or at least likable and friendly. Until he's not and we find out what he's really about. We never quite trust him or his motives (having seen him sneak looks at a hidden compass), but even as we suspect he may be lying to the crew and bringing them to one of his own ships, we like him and don't think he's a monster or a bad guy or a villain, or even necessarily an antagonist. All because of the casting and the way he's portrayed as charming and friendly. <br/><br/>But that's not what elicited most of the complaints.<br/><br/>What elicited most of the complaints is, to make the propaganda point that everyone needed to work together to be as strong as the Nazis and win the war, the Nazi's shown as superhumanly strong and able. Willie, the u-boat captain, is, despite being heavyset and having an unassuming look, the Nazi superman in the flesh. And this may make it even stronger Nazi propaganda - ""Look, even a regular-looking schlub, if he's German, has these superpowers."" Willie, besides being hypercompetent (which fits, given his profession) as a seaman, is depicted as hypercompetent as a medical man (this is given as his previous profession), and as a tireless rower (that he's later revealed to have been drinking water and energy capsules the whole time does little to diminish our impression of his abilities in that direction). In one scene Bankhead's character even explicitly says, ""He's made of iron, we're mere flesh and blood, how can we compete with that?"" The film was really laying it on thick. <br/><br/>So that's an odd concession - to allow your enemy's argument that he's superhuman and Godlike and hypercompetent, in order to better make the case to your own people about the necessity of their all working together to fight him. But that's how Hitch and his writers (presumably not including Steinbeck, who disowned the film) chose to go about it. While it may weaken it as pure propaganda, it makes it a much more interesting story and work of art than it would've been otherwise. I think it says a lot about Hitch that he couldn't even do war propaganda straight, but had to make these weird thoughtful additions and changes to the usual format in the service of making a more interesting and entertaining film. That was always his foremost concern, and I see this film as the best compromise he could come up with between the demands of propaganda and the demands of making a good movie. Technically, it does work as propaganda, albeit not ideally, since not so easily - you have to think about it to see how it's Allied propaganda, and that kind of defeats the purpose. But technically he's off the hook, at least. And of course no one during wartime (especially during WORLD wartime) wants to hear someone is amoral as propaganda against them. I think that's why so many saw the German's portrayal as sympathetic, despite his seeming (to me) to be the most evil Nazi ever depicted on screen. In wartime, saying the enemy is a devious killer of the weak who'll sacrifice anyone's life for his own interests just isn't that damning. Better, most think, to show him AS the weak, than as a killer of them. We're not arguing before God or the Pope here, after all. This is war, not a morality contest.<br/><br/>Or so most probably think, or thought at the time.<br/><br/>The film itself, as a film, is quite good. In many ways, despite their different settings, situations, and points, it reminded me most of 12 Angry Men and the Twilight Zone episode ""5 Characters in Search of an Exit"". Strip the intellectual content and context from it and that's what it most resembles. It's a handful of people stuck together in a tiny space over days; the three stories have the same manner of characters being defined for the audience and for each other, and meeting, and dealing with each other, etc. Same ups and downs. I liked the u-boat captain, and Bankhead's character and performance. Rest of the cast didn't really stand out or make an impression, tho Bendix was memorable (not altogether in a good way) as Gus, who gets the worst of it during the trip. <br/><br/>This was Hitch's only film with Fox and in that and other ways it's unique for him. Most Hitch films, even back to the 30s, you know more or less what you're getting. This one's weird and un-Hitch, while still managing to be good and entertaining and involving, and giving one a lot to think about besides."

","Alfred Hitchcock has often put himself to certain tests as a filmmaker, if for nothing else probably just to get the blood flowing a bit in-between his big commercial projects. In the case of Lifeboat though it is and it isn't a similar situation to that of Rope: there's only one location, but he's not going for something one-of-a-kind with the stylistic approach. His main innovation with Lifeboat is in putting up a big theatrical ensemble, where the thrills are more in two points- pure instinctual survival and the damnation of opposing sides in wartime- and it's a successful one all the same. <br/><br/>As directors like Ford and Huston were off doing their own parts during the war, Hitchcock didn't make a ""real"" war film (aside from a couple of doc shorts, albeit the holocaust one is stunning), but this is to say on the battle-lines. But one could look at this film and Foreign Correspondent as the Master of Suspense putting his eye on the fragile relations and backstabbing of those not out in the battles. The premise, as set-up by John Steinbeck and fleshed out by Jo Swerling, is that eight people get put together by fate (or rather, a sinking during a shoot-out) onto a lifeboat, with all but one Americans or British.<br/><br/>The German of the group, pulled up among the others, is distrusted, but also seen as something of a damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don't figure, as he was the Captain of his ship. This adds immediate tension for Hitchcock to toy around with, but he doesn't make it that simple. On the contrary he casts his ensemble very wisely, with Bankhead playing the prissy but pragmatic photo-journalist who one by one loses everything of monetary value of her person. <br/><br/>There's also the tough all-American who doesn't at all trust the German from the start, the weathered middle-aged skipper, the ex dance-hall guy who now has an amputated leg, and the woman who was once a nurse and cannot do a thing, not to mention the token black guy, who actually isn't nearly as stereotypical as could have been for the period. And the drama is boiled down to essentials: they're running out of food, especially with water getting tossed about; Schmidt/Smith, who loses his leg, tries to think of other things, but gets drawn into the German's fiendish exploitation; trying to get on course; the subtle romantic advances of the women to a respective man on the ship.<br/><br/>What ends up happening is something of a mild double-edged sword, though not necessarily in a very bad way. Instead of his classic thriller set-pieces featuring a trademark Herrmann score, or with ultra famous stars heading off on the front bill (albeit Bankhead is, and acts like, the star of the movie as the sort of odd-woman-out among the others), it's about character revelations, and about the subtle tricks that a desperate situation can bring out in people, for better or worse. Not that Hitch doesn't give a few momentary thrills for those expecting, as there's a scene in a storm that's rather suspenseful, and there's a rather brilliant ironic twist towards the end involving the German ship. <br/><br/>At times one might feel the tendency that the script may start to drag, but it doesn't take long for the backwards claustrophobia of a lifeboat starts to creep in. It's also, uncharacteristically for Hitchcock, with something of an agenda for the period, which is fine as well; if he didn't make at least one or two movies meant to boost morale for the Allies it would seem a little odd. Luckily for him he found just the right thematic materials, and a good enough cast, to mask them around a melodramatic morality play at its finest."

","""It is the nature of a man as he grows older ... to protest against change, particularly change for the better."" -John Steinbeck<br/><br/>It is movies like Lifeboat that prove the merit of film as an art form, not quite because it is nearly a magnum opus but because it tells a story by John Steinbeck that most would envision as a stage play, and puts it on film in a purely cinematic way. From beginning to end, the entire film is set within a lifeboat in which a group of American and British citizens are stuck after their ship and a U-boat sink each other in combat. A German survivor is allowed aboard after some debate, but could be the U-boat captain. His belief in his vision as inscrutable as always, Hitchcock's pace is steady, consistent, never allowing a dull moment, not to mention does not let his imagination cease and give up his gimmick of appearing in the background somehow.<br/><br/>An assortment of American and British civilians scramble into the same lifeboat after their ship and a U-boat sink one another in an attack. Walter Slezak plays Willi, a German survivor, who is hoisted aboard and denies being an enemy officer. During a fervent wrangle, Hodiak's Kovac, the practical enthusiast who shapes the limited, raw material of the lifeboat into serviceable survival apparatus, and who demands the German be thrown out and left to drown. Less flappable aptitudes triumph with Garrett, played by the shrewd and receptive Hume Cronyn, asserting the German's POW status, and he is accepted onto the boat.<br/><br/>Kovac is the voice of the bottom-line gung-ho Conservative. Bankhead is the voice of the diplomatic level-headed Liberal. They manage to pull together and survive, even bond, despite their radical differences. Indeed the young nurse played by Mary Anderson is the voice of pacifism. It's about how they deal with the entrapment with the presence of a Nazi during the war, learning to accept the Nazi propensity for amassing as many targets as possible, even if they don't understand it. Bankhead knows foreign language of enemy while Kovac shuts out anything the German says. The charm is that we like and perfectly understand both rivals. Then there is the millionaire Rittenhouse, played by Henry Hull as the rational mediator yanked from left brain to right in moments of mob impulse; the tragic seaman Gus, played by Bendix, the folsky everyman stripped by his wounds and delirium of the horse sense that made his life meaningful.<br/><br/>But it is the character of Joe, played by Canada Lee, a black working man, who is the unadulterated temperament is a tranquil control group of the ensemble, as is Slezak's SS monster. Brilliantly placed at completely opposite ends of class, culture and present significance, they both share a common wisdom that transcends that of the other characters. The times when Joe opens his mouth come as a surprise, yet they are more meaningful than the stubborn conjectures of the other survivors. Willi, as it were, could initially have been Steinbeck's most intimately drawn characters. He sees obedience as a gift from his master race to these lower creatures, and surrender as the gift they should graciously reciprocate to him. They are the clay on Hitchcock's forming wheel. And the collective unconscious of them all is the sea.<br/><br/>Tallulah Bankhead, more of a fascinating person than a fascinating actress, maintains her enjoyable presence throughout. With all her crudities, doubts and confusions, there is nothing in the world she so reveres as beauty and pleasure, as opposed to Hodiak's manly man who takes charge, rationing the little food and water available, gradually finding his control taken away by the enemy, with Slezak's great unruffled imposition. William Bendix also harnesses his character's sympathetic situation to magnify the tension in scenes of suspense.<br/><br/>Due to the careful visual composition of its consistent narrative structure, the mood in the boat is determined by a sense of survival, fueling the film with riveting interest. There is special attention given to the technical film-making in Lifeboat, not because it takes place in a tight space for two hours. There have been scores of films that have done that successfully. It is Hitchcock at the helm that seems to draw attention to its claustrophobic setting. How did he do it without letting it get boring? Where did he place the camera? How did he get that shot? If one looks beyond this inclination, one can see that this is indeed one of those early times in Hitchcock's prolific, indefatigueable career in which his style seamlessly remained hidden to stealthily intensify the story, as it is supposed to be."

","When we find out that Gus, who loves to dance, has a wound in his leg, we know right then he is doomed. Sure enough, the leg becomes gangrenous. As it turns out, Willi was a surgeon before the war and says that he can amputate. Gus does not want to have his leg removed, because he is afraid that he will lose Rosie, the girl back home whom he loves. He fears that she might not want to marry him if he comes back without one of his legs, especially since she loves to dance as much as Gus does. To make matters worse, Gus has a rival, Al Magaroulian, whom Rosie used to date and who is also a good dancer, even though fallen arches have kept him out of the war. Gus is afraid Rosie will go back to Al if he has his leg removed. But eventually he relents, and Willi performs the surgery.<br/><br/>Later in the movie, while everyone is sleeping lethargically from dehydration, Gus catches Willi sipping a drink of water from his flask. To keep Gus from telling the others about the water, he pushes Gus overboard. When the others awaken from hearing Gus's cries for help, they realize Gus has drowned, and they ask Willi why he didn't do something. Willi does not, of course, tell them that he pushed Gus overboard to keep him from talking. Instead, he tells them that Gus voluntarily jumped overboard and that he thought it would be best not to do anything about it, saying, ""You can't imagine how painful it was to me. All night long, to watch him turning and suffering and nothing I could do for him. The best way to help him was to let him go. I had no right to stop him, even if I wanted to. A poor cripple dying of hunger and thirst. What good could life be to a man like that?""<br/><br/>Yes, German Nazis are evil, but are we all that good? Consider Willi's justification for letting Gus drown. The lie that Willi thinks will be an acceptable justification for ""allowing"" Gus to drown is actually repugnant to the other survivors, who listen to his words in horror. And we who watch this movie are likewise repulsed by Willi's callous remarks. But now let us ask ourselves why those who made this movie put this into the story. We cannot say it was to show that Willi was evil. We already knew that before he killed Gus. But if a murder was needed to really drive home the point, it was not Gus that had to be murdered. For example, it could have been Canada Lee that saw Willi sneaking a drink of water and who was then murdered by Willi and thrown overboard. Willi could then have tried to justify why he didn't save Canada by saying, ""Like the Jews, Negroes are inferior. They are better off dead and the world is better off without them."" That would definitely make it clear just how evil Willi is.<br/><br/>One could come up with other ways of dramatically showing how evil Willi is, but there is no need. The point is that those who made this movie had a special reason for killing Gus off beyond making it clear that Willi was evil. They did it to make those in the audience feel better. The audience then and we today would have been uneasy if the movie had ended with Gus still alive in that lifeboat. Sure, Rosie might have not cared about Gus's leg. And she might have married him because she truly loved him. In a movie like ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946), Hollywood could make sure that things would turn out that way. In that movie, Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) agrees to marry Homer (Harold Russell) despite the fact that both forearms have been replaced by prostheses and despite the fact that her parents want her to break off the engagement. But in real life, we know things do not always work out that way. Rosie and Gus were not even engaged. Instead of being like Wilma, Rosie might have tried to put a good face on the situation for a couple of months and then broken up with Gus and gone back to Al Magaroulian.<br/><br/>And so, rather than leave the audience suspecting just such an outcome for Gus and Rosie, which would have been depressing, those who made this movie killed Gus off. In this way, the audience was able to leave the theater feeling much better about the movie than if Gus had lived. You might even say that Gus's death was necessary for there to be a happy ending. But does that not imply that those who made the movie as well as those who watched it then and those of us who watch it now are essentially in agreement with Willi when he asked, ""What good could life be to a man like that?""<br/><br/>We shake our heads No. We insist that Gus could have gotten over the loss of Rosie and dancing, that he could have lived a full, rewarding life nevertheless. But if that really were the way we all feel, Gus's death would not give us a sense of relief. Those who made the movie and those of us who watch it are all complicit in wanting Gus's death so that we can all feel better.<br/><br/>Of course, there is a big difference between committing an actual murder and merely writing a story in which a man is murdered, between saying the dead man is better off and saying that the death of that man makes the story better. And so, whereas Willi was guilty of a horrible crime, we are only guilty of liking a movie better because such a crime takes place.<br/><br/>And yet, and yet."

","Sometimes greatness can be achieved in a singular way, even if the totality of a work of art is not great. This came to me upon watching one of my dad's all time favorite films, and one which I have watched several dozen times in my life- Alfred Hitchcock's 1944 black and white Lifeboat, which is also one of the three or four best films Hitchcock ever made, and did receive Academy Award nominations for Best Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Screenplay. While I am not a rabid devotee of Hitchcock, because most of his thrillers are filled with rather cardboard cutout characters, despite the films' technical excellence, this is still probably my favorite Hitchcock film; not only because of the memories of watching it with my dad, but because it is one of the least Hitchcockian films in his canon- in terms of its relative lack of formulaic suspense, and because of the great and inimitable Tallulah Bankhead (one of my dad's favorite actresses), who utterly dominates every scene of the film she's in.<br/><br/>The film's greatness comes in the way it realistically sketches human reactions and nature in extremis, even as it relies on some of the grossest human caricatures, stereotypes, and is a blatant bit of agitprop. That said, and given the limitations of having the film set totally in a boat, that Hitchcock comes even within spitting distance of the film being a great work of art (it's not; it misses by a hair, for the flaws mentioned) is, itself, evidence of greatness at work. It is also one of the most brilliant and odd character studies on film.<br/><br/>The very schizophrenic screenplay, which alternately depicts real human emotions in characters blatantly constructed to teach a didactic lesson, and be props to push the tale forward (i.e.- how convenient it is to have both a doctor and a nurse in the same boat when another character's leg needs to be amputated; among many), and then reduces them to utter stereotypes, was adapted from an original novella, of the same title, that Hitchcock commissioned John Steinbeck to write. When Steinbeck was done, and went off to the Second World War, Hitchcock hired playwright Jo Swerling to punch up the dialogue. For Hitchcock fans, wondering how the director snuck in his cameo, it's when Gus is reading a newspaper, and we see an ad for a diet pill- Reduco, which features before and after pictures of Hitchcock. That same gag was reused in Rope. If Lifeboat is not a great film, it's damned close, and given all the technical and script problems it had to overcome, that's a hell of an achievement, for, unlike many Hitchcock films, this one can be seen over and again and force deeper conversation each time, because it is not dependent upon a simple-minded twist ending. Thus, despite all its failings, Lifeboat is a true work of art, something its heroine has also been called. Viva recapitulation!"

","Nicely done presentation of a rescue scenario at sea with its own characteristics namely different personalities, problems and for a nice touch, we are at war too! The stars of this movie bring it to life thus Life in the boat or Lifeboat! Hitchcock kept it interesting with his directing and what unfolds is believable and entertaining. There are plots known and unknown at work which keeps us involved as it unravels slowly allowing the viewer to take it in quite nicely. Then, things happen and we watch how this group rises or falls to the occasion. There is nothing like a good ole fashioned emergency to bring out what is hidden as well as the best in all of us. This is that movie. You will find each character interesting and how they all share the common as well as what they have going on personally. What makes this all work is that it is not real as in filmed on location and in the actually sea but only duplicated as what could have happened thus this particular story minus the sunburn, seas sickness, lack of food and water, etc a la Hollywood. I have read many accounts of people lost at sea and those stories are unforgiving and involve life and death. Still, there is a touch of that at work here too. I was pleased when I found out that John Steinbeck of the Grapes of Wrath fame did the writing. He knows how to make and capture a personal story using everyday people. In Hitchcock's hands, it is put to the testing and it holds up quite well. At some point, ask yourself what made them all relax after a while? Sharing close quarters for lengths of time does that with people. Remember also that everyone has to go potty too and that makes us all human right off.

","Stranded on a lifeboat after their ship is torpedoed by a German U- boat, a group of survivors find themselves torn between what to do after rescuing one of the Germans who sank their ship in this wartime thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. With lots of talk and a single location, 'Lifeboat' moves rather slow at first with some very obvious moral dilemmas; ""we're on our own; we can make our own laws,"" one of them claims. Things become more twisted and intense in the second half though, beginning with a surprise revelation regarding the mysterious German, played perfectly by Walter Slezak. In fact, the entire second half of the film is rather riveting once the intriguing Slezak becomes a point of focus (none of the other characters are particularly remarkable) and the film ends on a strong note. The final scene is a little on the didactic side, but it is relatively brief and for a film with a clear anti-Nazi agenda, 'Lifeboat' offers a near balanced portrayal of the Germans at its best. The basic story (by John Steinback) has a refreshingly timeless quality to it too, with ideas in terms of trusting 'the enemy' and the uncertainty posed by wartime conditions coming across as fairly universal themes (see also George Seaton's 'The Hook' and 'The Long and the Short and the Tall'). Beneath the surface of Allied vs Axis tensions, there lies here a human tale here of trust, mistrust and desperation in adverse conditions."

","LIFEBOAT is extremely tense and provocative film. All the action is concentrated in the title of the film. It is fascinating that at any point the lifeboat is not out of the frame. It is the means of salvation and support for the people in it. People caught in the clash of thought and belief, on the edge between life and death.<br/><br/>When in one place unexpectedly gather people of different character, attitudes and social status, then their characteristics dictate the new situation. In this case, the war accident. Hitchcock was with a little parody presented resourcefulness and sense in seemingly hopeless situation. When his own feelings suppressed sense and resourcefulness then you are in danger. In this case the feelings provoke anger. The blood is paid with blood. I'm kidding of course. It's simple, the heat of the moment people do not think. The consequences come with a peacefulness.<br/><br/>Any rescue in this case is not a product nor reason nor resourcefulness. I think that the people in the boat in any case doomed. Spas is a mere coincidence. It is interesting that the time in which their life was hanging by a thread quickly forgotten.<br/><br/>Lifeboat is technically excellent film. Very exciting sea drama. Acting does not leave you breathless, but not bad either.<br/><br/>Tallulah Bankhead as Constance ""Connie"" Porter is sly trifler. A woman who takes care of themselves and each situation trying to get you to your advantage. If necessary, she will fall in love with. She is an actress who captures the appearance. In this case the dominant over others. Master of black humor. Walter Slezak as Kapitan Willi is one perfidious villain, commander of submarine interesting name Willy, with the cunning and intelligence put in the category of perfect movie villains. Officer's masterpiece, subtly playing with seemingly superior 'hosts' experienced its culmination in the film finale. Cunning and brutal character of the other hand is actually practical, brave and resolute in its intention. One moment of human madness and anger can not be no one to resist.<br/><br/>The story of trust and betrayal and manipulation is well-designed. Black humor in large quantities is followed by constant voltage. It is unfortunate that with certain illogical, movie finally got propaganda note. However, the damage was not so big."

She played Constance Porter, a self-involved wealthy journalist, who was aboard a ship before a Nazi torpedoed it. She survived along with her luggage in the lifeboat by herself until other survivors come along. Bankhead had a history of difficulty and perhaps it is why she never made a film career. Bankhead was better known onstage in theatre. The cast includes other theatre veterans like Hume Cronyn, Canada Lee and more. Mary Anderson and Heather Angel are the only two female supporting roles overshadowed by Bankhead. A film veteran like Walter Slezak also performs. The cast and ensemble work together as a team though surviving in the lifeboat. The film could actually be adapted to a stage production if possible. The film is set in one lifeboat surrounded by water. The director Alfred Hitchcock did an admirable job with this film. Sadly, ""Lifeboat"" gets overshadowed by other Hitchcock gems. If you see his entire film catalog, you will ""Lifeboat"" as a gem and treasure not to be missed. It should have been nominated for Best Film as well too. I only wondered and worried about what happened at the end of the film. It leaves you hanging and wanting more."

","Dear Neeraj Pandey, <br/><br/>there was a better propaganda filmmaker than you back in the 40s. His name was Alfred Hitchcock. Lifeboat is a pretty gripping and desolate propaganda film. A group of people from various strata of American society are trapped in a boat after their ship is attacked by a German boat. One of the survivors from the German boat also enters the boat of survivors. The Americans disagree on what to do with the German. Soon, the good guys win and they decide to use the German who is a navigator to take their boat to Bermuda.<br/><br/>For a while, the focus shifts to the bickering between the working class and upper class Americans. Before the German becomes the focus again. Because while everyone is thirsty and weak, the abnormally strong German goes on rowing the boat to who knows where. The German character gets the best close up in the whole film.<br/><br/>It is a really interesting setting with people having to get along with each other because there is nowhere to go. Apparently the whole film was shot inside a tank with a boat in it.<br/><br/>Talluah Bankhead has some great one liners. She really stole the show. The whole cast was very impressive. Hitchcock always chooses great actors in supporting roles.<br/><br/>There is a pretty terrible scene of mob violence in the film.<br/><br/>But please do not remake this with Akshay Kumar in it.<br/><br/>Best Regards, Pimpin.<br/><br/>(7/10)"
"Christopher_Reid","9","0","1","20 January 2016"," Engaging and tense, raises moral questions
","Lifeboat is one of those films that takes place only in one spot. A handful of random survivors are thrown into a tough situation together and are stuck with each-other for a length of time. In this case, a freight ship has been sunk and the survivors gradually accumulate in a lifeboat. We meet them one by one and start to learn what's going on. We get first impressions of them but the characters gain more depth as the movie continues. And wouldn't you know it, one of the Germans from the U-Boat which also went down has to join the party as well.<br/><br/>Some of the people are dominating whereas other are submissive, some are upper class while others are workers. It's a microcosm of society at large. They all have stories, personal things they reveal when they feel like it. They are not caricatures but have details to their personalities - subtle quirks and contradictions. They can be reasonable and civilised but also argumentative and confrontational. They face moral choices and it's the thoughts and feelings they go through that are more important than their final decisions. We are free to assess their choices and behaviour. We see a more intense, raw side of humanity in these kinds of situations.<br/><br/>It's impressive that the film manages to be so engaging even within it's claustrophobic environment. It's not artificial entertainment either. We are naturally interested in the characters and whether they will survive or not. Shocks and twists occur at random intervals. New information comes up that creates more drama and tension. We don't know if we can trust the German. We don't know if the boat is headed in the right direction or not. We don't know if a storm might be just around the corner.<br/><br/>One part calls for an emergency operation which really had me squirming in a way few horror movies can achieve. The movie doesn't shy away from the simple reality of what is happening. The movie isn't bogged down by clichés, it's confident in the value of real people behaving realistically. I feel like Hitchcock's direction is simple and transparent. He doesn't try to do too much.<br/><br/>The actors are all believable and do a good job. Bankhead in particular stands out. She seems arrogant and superficial at first but emerges as mature and reasonable compared to the others. The German comes across as intelligent and calm. Canada Lee plays a dignified African-American in a time when I believe that was rare. It's a shame he's not given more to do in the film. In fact, when the others ask for his opinion on something, he's surprised and taken aback that he even gets to have a say.<br/><br/>It's interesting that the movie has practically no music. But the splashing water and swaying boat fulfills that job. It's calming and creates a unique atmosphere. I'm sure a lot could be read into the symbolism of a lifeboat floating in a vast ocean. You could deeply analyse the interplay of different personality types as well. I'm sure there are numerous examples of various psychological phenomena.<br/><br/>Lifeboat has many similarities to films like 12 Angry Men and Reservoir Dogs. We don't see the events that led up to the film. Just the aftermath. Characters judge and accuse each-other. Perhaps not everyone's versions of what happened are fully accurate. Someone might be deceiving the others or keeping quiet about something. But really these movies are just a chance to get into the human psyche a bit. To consider extreme circumstances and observe the spectrum of possible human responses. You might not like every character, but then you might like to ask what you would do in the same situation."

","This interesting piece of WWII memorabilia was plucked of the $5.00 rack for its' first viewing and I immediately felt as if 10 Little Indians had a second go of it. John Steinbecks writing was turned into a script where character definition was more important than storytelling. All I know, is that if I survived a torpedo attack in the Atlantic in WWII, pontificating on personally defining yet random moments of my life would be suffocated by fear and anger. My adrenaline would be through the roof, yet the only survivor with a pulse is a tattooed seaman more angered at the Tallulah arrogance than having his crew killed by the Germans. Yet, the characters are interesting despite their stories unfolding rather neatly on screen. Bendix' sappy love of his dancing ""Rosie"" is just bad stage acting and Slezaks' Willy speaks English way to well to pass a a foreigner. The attempts to make him charming fell short, though was a good attempt at drama, yet I'm still enjoying the point to the film, the American propaganda Ode to liberal American blindness to the truth about human nature. Stereotypes are born out of fear which is born out of experience. Ignore the facts and you open yourself to being swallowed up by the great sea of evil."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","0","1","9 April 2013"," One of Hitchcock's undeservedly underrated films
","Well actually there are a lot of people who regard Lifeboat quite highly, it's just that while it is possibly not one of Hitchcock's very finest films it is one that is worthy of more credit than it gets. One or two of the characterisations are on the stylised side, like Henry Hull's, but it's not enough to properly drag Lifeboat down. The acting is exceptional on the most part, Tallulah Bankhead's forceful lead performances was most dominant though Walter Slezak's subtle creepiness also stood out. Lifeboat is remarkably well made, it may be deliberately just one set but utilised in a way that it is never monotonous or uninteresting. The cinematography and editing are exemplary, and Hitchcock couldn't have been a more perfect director, his suspenseful touches and atmosphere are all over it without it feeling too much. The story is very suspenseful and gripping, maybe the identity of the villain is not so much of a surprise but what's ingenious is what is done with how the characters find it out for themselves. The dialogue is taut and well written, and there is a brooding score that does nothing to undermine the tension. All in all, a great film and one of Hitchcock's most underrated. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"ianlouisiana","9","0","1","2 May 2012"," A direct line from""Stagecoach"" to ""Lifeboat"" to ""Big Brother""...
","Shove a disparate group of people together in a small space and sit back and watch.It still works today as it did when Ford and Hitchcock made their earlier films. ""Lifeboat"" is a microcosm of the free world's struggle against Nazism and during its course the twisted allure of that philosophy is displayed. We also see the morally corrupting aspect of war as the survivors turn on the Nazi U - Boat captain who has in fact very cleverly ( a bit like Capt Bligh) guided them through treacherous and uncharted seas to a German supply ship where he expects to be rescued and they expect to be put in a Concentraion Camp.They beat him to death with any implement that comes to hand. However,civilised behaviour is restored when they rescue a German crewman from the ship and spare his life after disarming him. A special word about Miss Tallulah Bankhead.Regarded as a dilettante at best,more often as a free - spirited maverick who dished the dirt in Harlem's jazz joints - as they used to say,and lived on controversial publicity,she was.when given the chance,a fine performer.Here she is splendidly disdainful,cynical but brave and the strongest character in the film. Not for another 13 years did another actress - Miss Rita Hayworth - have so effective a femme fatale mystery woman role (in ""Fire down below). This is a taut,tight piece of work which stands up with the director's best.Unhesitatingly recommended."
"Tweekums","9","0","1","22 April 2012"," A gripping drama set in one small boat in the Atlantic
","After the sinking of their ship by a German U-boat a motley group of survivors end up in a lifeboat together; not long afterwards they pull another man out of the water; this one however is German; a survivor from the U-boat that was also sunk in the encounter. Some on board believe he should be thrown back in to the sea but the others argue that to do that would make them criminals themselves. They opt to keep him on board and as one of them, photographer and journalist Connie Porter, can speak German they question him; he explains that he is just a crewman. Things get grim very quickly when one of the survivors realises that the baby that she has been cradling has died and one of the freighters crew has a serious leg wound that quickly turns gangrenous. Not knowing if the ship was able to send an emergency message the survivors decide to head for the nearest land; the island of Bermuda; a small dot in a vast ocean. This won't be easy as they have no compass and opinions are divided about what is the best course... should they trust their German captive or would he take them in the wrong direction towards German shipping and certain imprisonment.<br/><br/>This early Hitchcock film contains the tension that he is known for in his more famous films; the black and white filming worked in the films favour making the sea look almost black which created a particularly bleak feeling. Whenever the sea broke over the little boat it looked far more realistic than modern films and their CGI water! That isn't to say everything looked as good; the starlit night sky looked very much like a painted backdrop. The cast did a fine job as the varied group of characters; most notable were Tallulah Bankhead as the wealthy Connie Porter and Walter Slezak as Willy the German but they all contributed and each had a distinct character that brought something to the story. Keeping the action confined to the lifeboat for the entirety of the film created a claustrophobic atmosphere despite the fact that they were adrift in an ocean; more so when tensions between the survivors rises as they have no way of getting away from each other. The 'twist' when it comes isn't a total surprise; after all this was made during the war when the Germans were the enemy and people were hardly going to be encouraged to trust them! Whether you are a fan of Hitchcock or not this film we well worth watching."
"Atreyu_II","6","0","7","2 February 2012"," The whole thing takes in a lifeboat. That's all?
","I can see why is this film considered one of Hitchcock's limited-setting. To be honest, I wasn't particularly thrilled. The scenario and backgrounds are nice and the film is neat-looking but it's just too limited. I mean, the whole thing takes place in a lifeboat. There isn't even a scene in the ship that sinks. It could use at least some 15 minutes in the ship before it sinks instead of beginning the movie with the ship already practically sunk. And at the end there isn't even a boat that comes in rescue! It's kinda like what they ask themselves: «What do you do with people like that?».<br/><br/>And having that said, I also have to be fair. This isn't a bad movie, it just doesn't really make my type. However, it could be a good bet for Hitchcock fans. This is probably one of his least famous and heard, so it should be one for ""hitchcockians"" to discover."
"celluvoid","7","0","5","4 April 2011"," PCA considerations
","The film Lifeboat (1944) contains racial discriminative elements resulting from the PCA code failure to follow it's own primary principle of disallowing creation of entertainment that does harm to human beings in lowering the moral standards of those who see it. Drafted on March 31, 1930 the PCA omitted language of the initial meeting minutes that would have provided protection from willful offensive treatment of race. The review process for the film Lifeboat addresses individual censorship concerns only in relation to the moralistic behavior of white passengers. In contrast, the review poses no restriction nor objection to the 20th Century Fox Studios negative portrayal and morally objectionable inferences imposed on the sole African American character. Furthermore, it allowed for the continued representation of the stereotypical socially denigrated Negro at a time when movie viewing on a national scale was approaching its peak attendance. For both blacks and whites such portrayals caused harm to the moral fabric constitutionally governed that all men are created equal."
