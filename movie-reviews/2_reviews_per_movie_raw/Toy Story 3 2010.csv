"The_Fifth_Echo","10","982","1095","27 May 2010"," ~One of the Best Trilogies of All Time~
","I attended a special screening for Toy Story 3. I went in with HIGH expectations. I LOVED the first two Toy Stories movies. Toy Story is a beloved franchise that almost everyone that I know loves the first two films. Now how about the 3rd film? Well all I could say is that it lived up to my unbelievably HIGH expectations and then some. This is such a good film. It has the laughs, magic and best of all the entertainment. The new characters in the movie feel like they were in the previous two films, they were that engaging and really worked well in the movie. The best part of the movie has to be the ending, I almost cried and was moved to just about to tears. I truly believe that this is one of the best Trilogies of all time. It might even rival the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.<br/><br/>This movie has a real chance to become the First Animated Film to win Best Picture. I surely would not be surprised.<br/><br/>10/10 An Amazing End to a Fantastic Series Go Watch It"
"dee.reid","10","44","46","4 November 2010"," An amazing third ""Story""
","Lee Unkrinch directed ""Toy Story 3,"" the third and presumably final installment in the ""Toy Story"" movie franchise. One could argue that this is probably the best one yet (1999's ""Toy Story 2"" remains my personal favorite of the three), and I won't argue with those who think otherwise. I still hold onto ""Toy Story 2"" for deep personal reasons, but ""Toy Story 3"" does build upon events foreshadowed in the previous installment, which does gives this film a weighty emotional punch - a rarity in animated films these days.<br/><br/>As foreshadowed in ""Toy Story 2,"" Andy (John Morris) has finally grown up; he's 17 now, and is on his way to college in just a few days. His mom is putting pressure on him to get rid of his old toys, either by throwing them out with the garbage, donating them to other needy children, or simply putting them in the attic (a sort of gone-but-not-forgotten-and-within-reach-type of deal).<br/><br/>Woody (Tom Hanks), brave leader of the toys and Andy's favorite, manages to dodge a bullet somewhat, but puts himself in the line of fire when Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the other toys are accidentally thrown out but somehow or another wind up at Sunnyside Daycare, where they are welcomed with open arms by the resident toys there. This introduces us to Lotso (Ned Beatty), the strawberry-scented teddy bear who runs the place, along with the metro-sexual Ken doll (Michael Keaton) and others. As it turns out, this daycare center is actually a prison, and Lotso runs this place with an iron fist; of course, Lotso has a very tragic back-story that explains his evil ways, much like with Jessie (Joan Cusack), who first appeared in ""Toy Story 2."" So Woody and the other toys must mount a valiant escape if they are to be reunited with their beloved owner before he leaves for college.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" is an amazing film, and a fitting end to a wonderful film series that started in 1995 with the first ""Toy Story,"" which also signaled the arrival of the very illustrious and extremely talented Disney-owned animation studio Pixar. They have yet another significant hit on their hands with this picture. The animation here is at its most life-like and real and it's damn-near flawless and strikingly beautiful, which signals just how far Pixar has come in the 15 years since their first hit with ""Toy Story."" And every film since then has added significant amounts of realism, weight, and dimension to their animated stories.<br/><br/>While ""Toy Story 2"" had a high nostalgia factor for days long gone by, ""Toy Story 3"" is a film about the inevitability of children growing up and putting away their toys. There are also themes about the effect of loss, love, and friendship going in the proceedings here. In addition, ""Toy Story 3"" can also be an incredibly dark film at times - a bold move considering that this is a family film - but there's no need to worry because the fact is that it's all perfectly balanced out amazingly well with some very light-hearted humor, fast and furious action scenes, and stirring emotional moments that just might bring a few tears to your eyes.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" is a triumph of animation and imagination, and I say that as a die-hard ""Toy Story 2"" fan. What we get here, is a fitting closer (?) to an amazing film series that just continues to surprise again and again with each new entry. It's just a great reminder for all of us heartless adults of better days in our youth that have long gone bye-bye.<br/><br/>10/10"
"interrealm","10","984","1154","18 June 2010"," How in the world did Pixar make adults CRY over TOYS??!
","The best magic tricks in the world are ones that cannot be unraveled, reverse engineered or dissected to figure out exactly how they are pulled off. This philosophy is doubly applicable to Pixar's ""Toy Story 3"", the storyline-ending outro of the beloved Toy Story, uh, story.<br/><br/>I feel it relevant somehow to divulge my age, as it somehow validates the powerful emotions evoked throughout the film. I am a 28 year old male, who, fifteen years ago, was fresh into the teen years of supposed adolescence at the release of some weird, 3d animated movie (wait, they can animate with computers?) entitled ""Toy Story"". This was a pretty bold move, a calculated stroll to the edge of the cliff and a daring leap off into the thin air of creativity and innovation. And it was a hit, ensuring 3d animation a place right alongside (more or less) 2d animation. And naturally, Pixar would be at the forefront, leading the cavalry charge of digital animation ranging from great to gawd-awful.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" starts off as comfortably as possible, with our friends Woody and Buzz Lightyear doing what they do the best...playing with Andy in his world of make-believe adventure. We are then treated to some familiar Pixar progression, like abandonment, solidarity, coming back to friends, and the passing of the torch. Clearly, in the eleven years between this point and when ""Toy Story 2"" wrapped, a computer revolution or four has occurred, allowing a world of unsurpassed clarity, reality and imagination to shine through like never before. TS1's spark is TS2's candle, and that in turn is TS3's blazing sun.<br/><br/>Roll the last fifteen minutes of film. It became clearly obvious that the figurative tables have been turned, because a good number of the adults in the audience (including myself) were sniffling and teary-eyed, while the kids were looking up, likely thinking ""jeez mom and dad, they're just toys, get over it"".<br/><br/>Wasn't it conventional wisdom that just the kids get emotional over losing plastic playthings? With ""Toy Story 3"", Pixar has shown us one of the greatest magic tricks in modern showbiz history, likely not to be outdone or duplicated, that we all have very real and deep connections to our childhoods and to the things and people that allowed us as kids to be free, and innocent, and pure, and most importantly, to dream. This, to me, is a life lesson worth remembering, to infinity and beyond.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" gets 10 of 10 blazing stars"
"MR_Heraclius","10","38","41","15 February 2020"," Best animated movies ever made
","Toy Story 3 in my opinion is by far the best of the trilogy! It is the most emotionally investing out of all the Toy Story installments and is an outstanding entry to the Pixar library!"
"SoloHero5","Null","28","30","24 June 2010"," I'm 19 years old... but wile watching I was a child again.
","I'm nineteen and I wasn't as enthusiastic about going to see this as I was when I was eight years old.<br/><br/>I entered the theatre; the lights went out, the movie began, and after the first twenty seconds I was a child again. The laughter came often and natural. The story was even better then the previous two combined.<br/><br/>I went to go see this with my seven year old nephew and if I laughed that much when I was his age I know I had a good childhood. The mix of humour and emotion mad this movie one of the best I have ever seen, including big ones like Godfather and Shawshank.<br/><br/>This movie is both hard and easy to review because you try to look at the down sides to the movie but the hard part is that there isn't any. I'm sure if you shut off your emotions you could see a fault of two but when it comes to an animated trilogy this is by far the most enjoyable time you can spend in a theatre... The best part, you can bring your kids.<br/><br/>I can't vote... in my opinion ten isn't enough!"
"diac228","10","480","592","18 June 2010"," By delivering an amazing finale to an amazing trilogy, all we can do is bow and thank Pixar once again.
","Star Wars. Indiana Jones. Fistful of Dollars. Bourne. These are all incredible trilogies that can, will, and should stand the test of time. Yes, I am neglecting the fourth Indiana Jones. Upon the mention of the third Toy Story, I was deathly afraid. Afraid because it has some major, major shoes to fill. The original is a masterpiece that changed animation forever, and the sequel is among the best in the history of film (I mean that). The first two Toy Story films are among the best movies of all-time and to this day entire animation studios have failed to duplicate an ounce of the magic contained in Toy Story. Could part 3 even come close to the original two? My friends, I am very happy to say, the answer is a resounding yes.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 does exactly what the first two did, delivered on all cylinders, all aspects of film-making and entertainment. The humor is back, the heart is back, the delightful cast of characters is back. This time, thanks to an incredible script, there's more suspense, more drama, and many more surprises. Like any spectacular trilogy, it wraps up all loose ends. It literally is difficult to find any flaw or any slow moment in this movie, and even if there is, it will immediately be forgiven by the next major laugh or the next major revelation. The predictability factor in this movie is low, and the payoff to all the suspense is extremely high. Guys, this is the go-to movie of the summer, and makes up for any disappointment you have seen this year or last.<br/><br/>Just like Toy Story 2's subtle and underlying themes, Toy Story 3 revolves around the group of toys and their latest adventure, but dwells far deeper than that. On the surface, this movie is about the toys in a series of circumstances, winding up in a daycare center that isn't all it seems. At the same time, Andy is heading for college, but Woody isn't quite ready to let go of his owner and the memories that follow. The deeper aspects involve aging, growing up, and moving on. Michael Arndt, the Oscar winner that wrote Little Miss Sunshine, was behind the spectacular screenplay in this third trip in the world of toys. Then with the help of John Lasseter and Lee Unkrich (who serves as the director), we see plenty of references to Pixar, other movies, the previous Toy Story installments, and even we even see nods to the influences of the entire animation studio (Miyazaki).<br/><br/>The writing wasn't the only thing that was on par with the first two Toy Story movies. The voice acting cast was once again phenomenal, with popular actors, underrated talent, and great character actors filling the bill. Come on now, just read em': Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, John Cusack, Wallace Shawn, Jody Benson, Estelle Harris, Blake Clark, John Ratzenburger, Ned Beatty, Jeff Garlin, and Michael Keaton. Unlike what Dreamworks pulls off on a yearly basis, Pixar carefully chooses their voice cast in terms of pulling off the best performances, not to generate more money. Because honestly, was there even a point to Angelina Jolie voicing the tiger in Kung Fu Panda? On the other hand, very few can pull an authentic Barbie like Jody Benson (a.k.a. Ariel in the Little Mermaid). It takes reliable and authentic acting to pull at the heartstrings, and everyone definitely was on their A-game.<br/><br/>Lee Unkrich directed this movie with incredible pacing and just as much heart and dedication as Lasseter, who was in charge of the first two. The truth is, Pixar directs the movie together, as they share ideas and suggestions amongst each other. This fact can be traced to the similar pacing and directing styles seen in Pixar's better works like Ratatoille, Finding Nemo, and Up. They all have the similar technique of incorporating just as many tears as laughs. But unlike all the other Pixar movies (with the exception of The Incredibles), Toy Story 3 has a heave dosage of suspense and peril, which is climaxed by one of the most exciting animated sequences this side of Castle in the Sky (a Miyazaki adventure masterpiece). Other reviewers have noted this before me, but this Toy Story is quite scary in depth and in imagery at some instances, so be wary of this while watching this with the kids. With so much time invested with these toys, the drama runs a bit high.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Toy Story 3 secures its place in cinema brilliance by becoming the best third installment since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the best sequel since Kill Bill Vol. 2, and the best movie we've seen this year. This movie is usually hilarious, sometimes thrilling, and sometimes downright tear-jerking. And yes, just like Up's opening 10 minutes, there is that one major sequence in which Pixar will play with your heartstrings like Eric Clapton playing tears of Heaven. If you enjoyed the first two Toy Stories, there's no need to worry about the third and hopefully final chapter in the quality-filled saga. How Pixar manages to deliver yet again is absolutely beyond me.<br/><br/>Walt Disney may not be one-hundred percent proud of his company if he were alive to see it now, but he would be absolutely delighted at seeing what beautiful art Pixar has delivered ever since 1995. Pixar has re-created Walt Disney 's magical methods of storytelling and movie-making, and arguably has taken it a step even further by adding depth to the characters and depth to the overall stories presented. The direction was fantastic, the writing was Oscar-worthy, and the overall production is Best Picture caliber. This is Pixar's best work since Finding Nemo, and a must see by any means necessary. Despite my cynical nature, there's no way I can grade this any less than perfect. Just no way."
"beastwarsfan","10","367","462","17 June 2010"," Simply brilliant!
","I was about 10 or 12 when I watched the first Toy Story in the cinema with my little brother and sister. We were all enchanted! Years later Toy Story 2 came out and it was a blast! Again we all went to the theater to see it and we were so thrilled and excited after the movie! Im 24 now, and just yesterday I was at the Bulgarian gala-premiere of the film. My brother was fortunate to win an invitation for two (he took a photo of himself with our small collection of Toy Story toys and sent it to the website), and we had the chance to see the third part on its first screening... and for the 1st time in 3D! No doubt that the animation is better than ever, the guys from Pixar constantly push the limits, but that's kinda natural for them. But still it feels like 100% Toy Story, with all the improvements, somehow I don't feel this 15-years-wide gap between the first and the third part.<br/><br/>What matters more is the (Toy) Story itself! And it is just fantastic! I had really high expectations of this film and honestly, after seeing it, my expectations were surpassed! The plot is really emotional, with so many nostalgic moments... Being kinda grown-up myself, but doing my growing-up with the first two parts of Toy Story, I couldn't relate more with this one! I was really touched! I just wish the theater was empty. Then I could stop holding back my tears! And it's not just t the big story, but also all those little things that go on around it! I don't know how many of those references and gags were in the script and how many were put in there in the making process, but it's just amazing! Even if it's the most dramatic and the darkest of the 3 (as dark as Toy Story can get) the comedy is still there, and I was laughing out loud all the way through! It's a wild roller-coaster, and I'm not even sure who will have more fun with it, if it will be the kids, or their parents! There's just so much more in there for you to notice, admire and laugh at! And I'm sure that after watching the film again I'll find out even more! There's also a really neat Totoro cameo, and it's great of Pixar to pay homage to their old friend, Miyazaki san.<br/><br/>The old lovable characters are all here, and they are joined by an army of new ones, and each one of them has his real personality and you can recognize in them characteristics of someone, both visually and with their attitude they express different things and you instinctively feel what these toys stand for. It's really funny to recognize in them some movie archetypes or features of people that you know.<br/><br/>I realize that I just poured out tons of superlatives, but there's nothing else you can say about this film! It has everything! (And about how many 3rd parts you can say that?) The only thing I could criticize is that there is one really freaky baby-toy, that can give the creeps to the smaller kids, but it's done on a purpose and for me it was really an enjoyable touch to the atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>To wrap up this review, I will just say - Thank you, Pixar!"
"russb216","10","143","175","5 July 2010"," A Perfect Tale of Adventure and Devotion
","Since I felt none of the other reviews here do the movie justice, I became compelled to write my own. It is the most inspired film I have ever encountered.<br/><br/>The creators of Toy Story 3 have an imagination that is unparalleled. I cannot begin to compare any of the other animated movies that I have ever seen to it. It is a fantasy in an unconventional sense: aside from the talking toys, the environment and settings are typical; commonplace. Yet, the Pixar Team manages to cram every last drop of energy into the incredibly clever story and inventive plot devices out of just common household objects. The animation is so brilliant that it captures shading, lighting, and textures that have yet to be seen on film.<br/><br/>Then, Toy Story 3 becomes a beautiful elaboration on the first two, with very clever character development. Its maturity of relationships is concise but witty: Woody, the wise sheriff, leading the other toys with courage and finesse; a spaceman winning the love of a cowgirl; the loyalty of the dog, slinky; the grumpy married potato and his devoted wife; the superficial relationship of Ken and Barbie; the broken spirit of a lost teddy bear. At the same time, Pixar uses a metaphor that is so strong that it drives the audience to love these characters with all of their hearts. It is a similar emotional complex to a happy puppy who is brought into a home and has nothing on its mind but playing with its youthful owners. But these toys never age, and as its owners, once in their playful youths, leave for work and college, these toys still know nothing more than their youth and happiness of living to one day play again. As you leave for work every morning, your dog doesn't know where you go. And every day, he does nothing more than pray that you come back to see him, every day waiting for you to bring out the ball again for a game of fetch.<br/><br/>Finally comes Pixar's ability to integrate so many emotions - fear, love, action, and comedy, among others - with each having so much vigor in its own right, that the movie becomes a roller coaster of animation and adventure, wound together by the constant movement of setting and storyline, always keeping the audience guessing on what might happen next. It is a brilliant tale; a perfect movie for children and adults alike. I cannot wait to see it again."
"xamitlu","8","37","42","24 June 2010"," Toy Story 3 is not a movie for adults who DO NOT want to cry during a movie.
","The only Disney movie I cried in was Lion King. The other Disney film that came close was Pixar's WALL E. I did not cry during Toy Story 3. I went home walked into my room a realized that my Optimus Prime is not at the foot of my door, my Sylvester the Cat stuffed toy was not on my bed, and my McDonald's Sonic the Hedgehog toy was not on my shelf. My conner only housed my stack of video games. I asked myself why did my mother give away my toys without my permission? At THAT moment is when I thought about the last 30 minutes of Toy Story 3 I started to cry. This film was a carelessly thoughtful stoke of genius! It keeps both children and adults entertained. Lots of drama, lots suspense, and lots of toys! Disney and Pixar outdid themselves with this one. Toy Story was a smash hit when it first hit the screens. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, was not as good as its first installment but it was a film that almost never hit theaters so I'll give them the benefit of doubt. But Toy Story 3 set the bar ""to infinity and beyond!"" The VA cast was pheNOMenal. The visuals were stunning! The script was enjoyable! This movie reached all corners of film greatness (and its a kid's movie). I have no idea how Disney and Pixar knock out great movies like this (they make it look easy). I related to Andy in this film just as I did in Toy Story 3. The ending was so tough to watch without sniffling because if you watched Toy Story at around Andy's age during the time and you watch Toy Story 3 around Andy's age now (he was 17 and I am 22 and went through roughly the same hassle as he did when he was moving out for college), you would feel a wallop of emotion. Toy Story 3 is a MUST SEE. If you don't have children to take to go see this film then take friends who saw the first two films."
"DICK STEEL","10","206","263","17 June 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Toy Story 3
","It was in 1995 that Toy Story signaled the arrival of Pixar, and the rest was history. To date, I have personally always found myself to have enjoyed all of their outputs, and it does seem that Pixar has indeed grown from strength to strength with sophistication in its graphics and attention to detail, but more so that their creative teams have always come out with solid stories to tell, which is always the key beneath all the glossy bells and whistles visuals.<br/><br/>And I simply love this installment, not only because it reunites us with the characters whom we have taken to heart as old friends, welcoming them back to yet another big screen outing, but because it has a moving story to tell, and has various elements from action-adventure, comedy and drama all rolled into one, allowing an outpour of a kaleidoscope of emotions as we journey for close to 2 hours with Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Mr and Mrs Potato Head (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Res (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Blake Clark) and the aliens (Jeff Pidgeon) for one last hurrah.<br/><br/>The storyline for all three Toy Story films may share some similar plot lines in having the constant fear of being discarded and unwanted when one turns old, or to obsess with the thought of being forgotten and unappreciated, and almost always comes with a distance to conquer. That continues here in stronger terms given that it's been some 11 years since the last Toy Story film, and that the toys' owner Andy has already outgrown the toys and have chucked whatever's left all into a treasure chest. Making things worst, he's about to relocate to attend college, and thus the anxieties that Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang has to come to terms with, being provided 4 options of heading for the trash, the attic, being given away or being that rare toy that gets to accompany Andy to his new environment.<br/><br/>New toys get introduced by way of how the story got crafted involving a children's day care centre, where we get to meet up with the over-emphasized, metrosexual Ken (Michael Keaton!) from Barbie (Jodi Benson), and others such as the Lotso bear (Ned Beatty), together with those belonging to a new human character called Bonnie (Emily Hahn) who owns a cool plush Totoro (which doesn't speak of course)! Sequels tend to overcrowd their stories with plenty of characters, but it worked perfectly for this installment as other than those which get lines, there are plenty in the background that you may just spot a few that you too may have owned at some point in time. Things also aren't quite what they seem at the day care being the paradise for toys in constantly being played with and loved but never to suffer a heartbreak or to be left feeling unwanted, and provides the basis upon which the story develops, providing plenty of challenges for the gang to overcome (gotta love that Monkey!)<br/><br/>What's powerful about Toy Story 3 are the themes that get thrown in, such as that about loss, and the search and fight for things that are worthwhile. It emphasizes the bonds of friendship and courage, while tackling how the lack thereof in abandonment and the feeling of tremendous loss, can someone turn one into a bitter soul, which allowed for the film to take on tragic, darker consequences unseen in the earlier installments, while balancing the light hearted moments. We get to grow with the familiar characters a little more, while having new ones which are just as fun. Just ask Ken!<br/><br/>And a word of caution - prepare those tissues and hankies! Parting is such sweet sorrow, and the manner in which director Lee Unkrich deals with will definitely tug at your heartstrings. At least two scenes got to me, one involving facing a consequence of inevitable hopelessness that is a definite edge of your seat stuff only to remind you of how much you really care for the characters, while the other was what I deem as the perfect send off, an au revoir fit for closing the chapter on this Toy Story arc, while leaving room for another to happen (if it does). It moved, and shows how valuable it is to be loved again, and I thought it was pitch perfect. It would be interesting to know how the creators had intended to end the story, but it was brilliant to have chosen with what was.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is a must see, and it's contending for a space in my top 10 for the year. It's a sequel done right, a tale with a lot of heart, with elements encompassing what essentially is a fitting tribute and farewell to beloved characters that have blazed the trail for computer generated animation to take centerstage. As with all PIxar feature films, a short precedes the main feature, and ""Day and Night"", like the one offered in Up, comes without dialogue, but with plenty of imagination and again, a solid story for a well animated short film that only Pixar can."

I cannot label them as cartoons as there is nothing cartoonish about their stories; they have heart, meaning, feel-goodness with the right touch of class & humor. The formula is A1 yet without feeling overused.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is once again a hit. We are treated to our favorite familiar characters and reminded again why we like them so. They are heroes who share the same values of team spirit, bonding and camaraderie. No one gets left behind. The technical aspects are again flawless.

","Well, this lived up to the hype, which usually isn't an easy accomplishment. Toy Story 1 & 2 set the bar high so, frankly, I was expecting a disappointment with this one. Thankfully, it didn't happen. ""Toy Story 3"" was another amazing story in this (so far) trilogy.<br/><br/>With a bunch of reviews already here, there is no sense going into the story. For those who haven't seen it yet, three surprises stood out for me: (1) the high number of new characters introduced; (2) the darkness of some of them; this is not always a fun story; (3) the incredibly-touching last 15-or-so minutes. <br/><br/>All three of these facets should make this a fun 103 minutes every time I watch the DVD, much like the first two. Also, the artwork is at the usual high standard, especially some scenes in the last half hour at the dump yard, of all places. <br/><br/>Finally, what's really cool, too, is that the people who voice the main characters are still the same men and women who did the first two films, with the exception of Jim Varney (""Slinky Dog""), who died in 2000. It's great to still hear familiar and distinctive voices, such as those of Wallace Shawn (""Rex""), John Ratenzenber (""Hamm""), Don Rickles and Estelle Harris (""Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, respectively).<br/><br/>Kudos to all those involved in making this film. They nailed the essence of ""Toy Story"" and how much loyalty can mean."
"SunshineMike","10","7","7","22 July 2010"," Just amazing
","After seeing Toy Story 1 and 2, they quickly became my favourite set of films ever and just last year when i heard there was going to be a 3rd, my heart immediately sank. As with sequels before, i thought it was going to be aimed at an entirely new audience, for the sake of profit and would squeeze the love i had for the series right out of it.<br/><br/>Then i began to read about interviews and the plot line and how it continues from both previous films, with Andy just a child back then, he has now become a teenager ready for college. This got me a little excited and for the rest of the year building up to it i was looking more and more forward to it.<br/><br/>Usually, walking out of cinema doors, i have a feeling of disgust and disgrace having just watched an awful film for a high price. So, it would have been safe to say my expectations for this film were ridiculously high, i mean there is not many series' of films that keep followers for 15 years.<br/><br/>It felt like a mere 10 minutes that i had been in my seat when the film finished. I was on the verge of tears, had a huge smile on my face and almost felt the need to jump up and clap. There are few films like this out there, Toy Story 1 and 2 being the exceptions. It continued the story so well, you still had the same love for the main characters that you always did.<br/><br/>For a film aimed at children, it had an amazing plot, that never confused but always kept you guessing. It is perfect for all ages, whether old or young, it is a magical story.<br/><br/>My only criticism would be at the lack of characters from previous films. It was explained immediately whether they had been sold or lost but i really felt disappointed that some old favourites were missing.<br/><br/>Still apart from that, the film was faultless. I recommend going immediately and watching it in 3D. Nothing really pops out in your face, but it is made really well to fit 3d."

","So I'm 26 and jaded. I most often hate the world and everything in it. Well that being said I absolutely lost myself watching this movie. I had seen the two before it as a kid growing up but I never felt so strong about them as I do with this one. I have spent the last couple weeks after seeing this movie spreading the word about how awesome it was. The theme is so universal that anyone despite their background or feelings can absolutely relate. We've all been to that place were we feel like we've been used and that were done with. The feeling as if we have nowhere to go or anyone to turn to. I really want everyone to experience the overwhelming feelings that boiled inside of me as this movie came to an end. The second the toys held hands at one point my face absolutely exploded and from there it didn't relent. Seriously I could not breathe it was almost to much. But its not. Go see it. Now.......................................what are you waiting for?"

","I went in with HIGH hopes and i was not disappointed! The first toy story movie was by far my favorite movie as a child, i literally watched it two or three times a day. Im emotionally attached to the toy story movies so this movie felt like the closing chapter to my childhood. Aside from my emotional attachment this movie was still amazing! I laughed, which is expected since its the all might pixar. But i also cried...i was kinda embarrassed haha. I was holding back the tears in this one scene but since i don't want to spoil anything so ill stop there. But by the end of the movie i couldn't hold back and instead of watery eyes i was in full tears haha. Everyone should watch it!"

","I am now 20 years old and so, it was at the age of 7 when I first watched Toy Story. I found it amazing that the toys were alive and all the story was superb either. When I found out that a 3rd part was up to be released I had been dreaming of it all the time. So, I went to watch it. In the theatre there were parents with their kids and thankfully they were really quiet. When the film started with the narration of the ages that had passed, I felt so touched. During the film I was back in my childhood when everything seemed -and were- so easy and I was with no concerns. All the purity of that age came and hit me, although I knew that would happen. I admit that I first found the story average, but when the film was on I was enchanted. There were no thoughts in my mind. I was there watching a masterpiece that in my point of view can be truly appreciated by only us, those who matured since the first movie, but still carrying all the heroes into our hearts. I must admit that I was up to cry in several moments, especially when the toys were in fire and in the end. Leaving the cinema and though I cried -cause, yes, I did!- I was too happy. Entering the house I was singing the theme song...<br/><br/>I highly recommend it to you all!!!! 10/10..."

","Is ""Toy Story 3"" good? Yes, it is. Is it exciting? Yes. Is the animation good? Excellent. Is it worth the money? It's worth. Is it better than the previous two? Much, much better. ""Toy Story 3"" is an excellent movie for all ages.<br/><br/>First, the animation. The moves of the characters are simply perfect. Ken and Barbie, they're robotic moves are so breathtaking. The moves are simply so detail and mesmerizing. <br/><br/>The appearances. Not much to talk about. But, the appearances of the characters were perfectly designed. The main characters were really cool. Ken and Barbie, they're really designed in detail. For Barbie, the line where is visible in the neck was really detail. Ken is also really detail especially with his body. Lot-o-Huggin'-Bear was also carefully designed by the paper which often appears on dolls listing the warning or whatever.<br/><br/>The way the movie is presented. Very well done. In around 90 minutes of running time (excluding ""Day & Night""), the movie was not boring at all. It had some laughable expressions which are pretty funny. I liked it when Buzz turns into Spanish mode where most of the audience laughed. That moment was hysterical. The scenes were also thrilling like the end scene (which I'm not going to tell you) or the scenes in Sunnyside. I thoroughly enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>The new characters. Well, I think there's one negative point. I think little kids around the age of 3, 4 or 5 might be scared with the appearance of Big Baby, because, his appearance is kind of scary for little kids.<br/><br/>The 3D effects. Not so cheesy and not so breathtaking but pretty good. The depths of the items in the film were not bad. <br/><br/>The sound acting. They were really good. Tom Hanks on Woody was really good. He really projected his voice until he becomes a real Woody. Tim Allen on Buzz Lightyear was also good and satisfying. He really sounded like a real astronaut or space ranger. The others were also good. But, I think Tom Hanks on Woody still has the best projection of voice in the film.<br/><br/>Final thing, the short film attached to it: ""Day & Night"". It was shockingly, awfully, crazily cool. That short film was quite funny. It was really good. Overall, the short film compliments to the film to be a very good movie.<br/><br/>A short advise, you might want to prepare some tissues to wipe your tears as there are some pretty sad moments in the film. The scenes were just so sad that that's another praise for Lee Unkrich on his directing. So, if you don't prepare those tissues, I hope you have something you can use to wipe your tears.<br/><br/>As an amazing end to such a magnificent trilogy, ""Toy Story 3"" is a must watch movie. Watching it in 3D is not a bad choice. Your kids will definitely be thrilled watching this film. I truly believe this is the best animated film of the year, or even the best film of all 2010 films. If you haven't watched this yet, what are you waiting for? Go purchase your tickets and enjoy this masterpiece. I guarantee you that you won't regret watching this movie. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a perfect score of 10 stars. I wish a fourth installment would be made."
"MovieAddict2016","10","25","34","18 June 2010"," Thank you, Pixar.
","I left the theater in 1995 after seeing the original Toy Story strangely moved. I was only six years old, and I'm not sure I had even fully grasped the revolutionary CGI for what it was (it probably just registered as animation to me, and I didn't quite understand its impact), but I did know – at least on a basic level of storytelling – that it was fantastic. Four years later I went to see the sequel with my younger sisters and felt the exact same way I had the first time. Even at a fairly young age I knew there was something special about these films.<br/><br/>Many times nostalgia has to compensate for quality (or lack thereof) in your perception of entertainments as you age. Suddenly Mac and Me isn't as awesome as you once found it to be. You revisit films from your childhood and learn to appreciate them based solely on the memories they conjure up, trying to block out the reality that, hey, This kinda sucks.<br/><br/>That never happened with the Toy Story movies. As I grew older, as I saw them more and more times, they only seemed to improve. New layers appeared – adult humour that I never appreciated when I was ten but suddenly blindsided me. Characters that revealed new depths; emotional scenes that only became increasingly poignant and meaningful, like that amazing scene where Buzz first becomes aware of his own mortality as a toy that can't really fly, or when he learns to cope with that fact by embracing the fact that he can instead fall rather well (with style).<br/><br/>The point of this rambling trip down memory lane is that Toy Story, the whole legacy of it, means a lot to me. I grew up with these pictures and never tired of returning to them, and they were always there for me like a good friend is. I approached Toy Story 3 with the slightest of reservations, fully trusting Pixar, and yet wondering how they could possibly produce anything that would live up to such high standards.<br/><br/>Well, suffice to say, they did it – if Toy Story 3 isn't the best of the series, then that's merely because it comes eleven years after the last one and it hasn't been given some time to work its full magic on us. This is every bit as engaging, heartwarming and funny as the first two films – but it's also the saddest, most human and most moving.<br/><br/>The plot has already been outlined by other critics, so I don't feel a need to recap anything. Nor do I want to inadvertently spoil any key moments (and please, for your own sake, avoid reading too much about the movie before going to see it – some reviewers are a bit too keen on giving away the ending, although it's understandable given how surprisingly emotional it is).<br/><br/>The introduction of new characters is seamless – Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton) is hilarious but thankfully not overused, and the other assorted variety of toys, including Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty), are fine additions to the series.<br/><br/>And Woody and Buzz (Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, respectively) pick up right where they left off, and you feel, in a weird way, like you're visiting old pals. The movie features the best animation of the trilogy, and the second half – which is darker than the two previous installments – makes excellent use of lighting and cinematography. The climactic finale is incredibly intense (especially for a ""kids movie"") and features particularly impressive visuals. Many reviewers have noted that they cried during the finale, and even I must admit that I came pretty close.<br/><br/>In a summer full of bores, disappointments and under-achievers, Toy Story 3 is not merely the first thoroughly satisfying motion picture of the season – it's the only truly moving one. It is fairly ironic, perhaps, that we must turn to movies about pieces of plastic to find such poignant reflections upon human nature, but then again, I'm not sure I'd want to have it any other way."
"commentary","10","5","5","12 August 2010"," Toy Story 3...never disappoints
","When I heard that Toy Story 3 was coming out, I felt two things: excitement and worry. Why the worry? Because despite Pixar's consistency with making fantastic films, I didn't want Toy Story's reputation to be marred by a slump in the franchise (Indiana Jones 4 anyone?).<br/><br/>All these worries went away when I saw the film. It really is hilarious, and really tense in parts! It had everyone in the cinema genuinely cracking up. For me, it was a much better film than Toy Story 2, and I liked Toy Story 2 a lot. <br/><br/>It's always great to catch up with gangs of characters as likable as these toys. I'm glad that they had material that was consistently hilarious throughout the movie and didn't just have a cop-out story to get more money from the franchise (again, Indiana Jones).<br/><br/>One thing to note is how touching this movie is as well - people in the cinema were genuinely crying and upset. I don't cry at films, but this had me very close indeed.<br/><br/>Anyhow, go to see this movie! You won't be disappointed and will laugh throughout. It's suitable for children and adults alike. :)"
"slokes","9","5","5","8 July 2010"," Metaphysics By Mattel
","Is there Life after playtime? Can you handle a film in which the toys are playing with us, the audience? The third chapter of the Toy Story saga asks some tough questions of viewers, but the rewards of seeing this remarkable film outweigh the emotional toll.<br/><br/>It's the last week of summer before Andy heads off to college, and Woody (Tom Hanks) and the other remaining toys in Andy's bedroom find themselves in fear of what's to become of them. It looks like the attic, but events conspire to throw them a day-care center called Sunnyside. It looks swell enough, at first...<br/><br/>""You'll never be outgrown, or neglected,"" the toys are informed by the chuckily plush play bear Lots-O (Ned Beatty). ""Never abandoned or forgotten. No owners means - no heartbreak!""<br/><br/>It's odd to see a film series that started out as an animated lark turn into ""Watership Down"", but there's always been some existential angst at the heart of the enterprise, c.f. the fragile buddy system employed in the first ""Toy Story"", Sid's hapless victims, and talk of rummage sales. The second film pushed these buttons a bit harder, to the point of losing the humor.<br/><br/>This time the drama is stronger than ever, yet the film amazingly manages to stay refreshingly clever and hilarious. We meet Ken (Michael Keaton), who introduces himself to Barbie saying ""We were made for each other"". Ken must deal with wisecracks about being a girl's toy, or as Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) puts it, ""an accessory, a purse with legs."" The daycare center is also fabulously realized, a cacophony of misfit toys all showing signs of wear from constant play. Every now and again we break away to see Woody in his new situation, being played with by a girl named Bonnie who is very nice but has a left-field imagination. ""We do a lot of improv here,"" another toy tells him.<br/><br/>All this is very funny, and director Lee Unkrich and the Pixar writers and artists find brilliant ways to keep humor close to the center of things throughout. Yet this movie is no lark. One of the funniest scenes the first time I saw this movie three weeks ago, involving a cutaway to a clown staring at a window, got hardly a laugh when I saw it again tonight. I think it was because the rest of the audience, like me, knew what was coming; a sad story about cosmic indifference and cold-hearted abandonment which sets in motion the real emotional undertow of the film.<br/><br/>Set against this is Woody's firm if shaken resolution to ""be there for Andy"", even when it seems he and the other toys are no longer wanted by their owner. It's a message of faith you relate to, yet it also brings out another point, the notion of change, even painful change, as needful. The toys know they'll be neglected, perhaps forever, if exiled to the attic, but prefer it to the unknown. This actually makes sense. What can happen out there isn't very nice, but even in the face of extinction the film suggests a certain nobility through acceptance can be still possible. It's a pretty heavy message to take away from watching a G-rated comedy.<br/><br/>The film doesn't leave you on a down note, but it's a funny thing. In the past, I always looked forward to the post-credit goof scenes as something to laugh at on my way out of the theater. This time, I appreciated it just as much as a chance to wipe my eyes before I got out of my chair. It still felt good, though."
"wainscoat-1","10","22","30","20 June 2010"," A wonderful movie in every single way, especially in the most important way.
","I am 52 years old and have seen an embarrassingly huge amount of movies over the past 45+ years. Toy Story 3 is one of the best movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It took me a few days to figure out why I was so affected by the movie. Toy Story 3 is really funny and imaginative, but so are a lot of other movies. I could see that the audience, including my own two children (16 and 11), were deeply engrossed in the film, laughing and crying, and bursting into applause together after the final scene. It is very rare today to see a theater audience having such a deep and common understanding of something as a group. I had seen this occur more frequently in the past, however, so the shared experience (while very nice) isn't really what makes the movie so great for me.<br/><br/>I think that the movie is great because Woody has to struggle with his age and purpose in way that seems so shockingly real. In the first part of my life, I only wanted to find a role that was worthy of me, an education or a job or a spouse that would let me....well...what I did wasn't really important, only that I be the greatest at whatever unique thing I was supposed to do. In the second part of my life, I found myself doing something that wasn't unique - it was pretty much what others did; Nor was I the greatest - I was only average. But I did it anyway, because the things I was to trying create and help, both in job and family, those things were important, even if they were ordinary. In the third part of my life....I sense there will come a time when I will still be loved but not needed. And it has to be that way, because otherwise death would be too hard to bear, for me and for those I leave behind.<br/><br/>I can accept all of this....but still be really happy when Andy plays with his toys one last time."
"tomoforster84","10","10","12","24 June 2010"," Ending on a high note!!!!!!!
","I went in to the movie cinema to see this film with high hopes and expectations judging by the first and second films' brilliance and must I say that I was in no way disappointed and can actually state that this film is the best of the trilogy. These 2 movies were my favorites as a small child. When I say that this is the best of the three I bid no demotion of the standard of the first and second installments. I applaud Pixar on maintaining their perfect record.<br/><br/>The film starts with a high action but still childish scene. True fans of the series would recognize that the scene is a revamped version of the two playtime scenes involving One- Eyed Bart and Pork Chop. Then starts a montage that shows how far and attached the toys have grown to Andy, their owner. Andy then plans to put the toys into the attic but they are accidentally put out with the trash. Later they venture to a daycare center in which first impressions were deceiving The real luster of the film hits a climax in the last 30 - 40 minutes in which we get to take in the emotional journey that the toys have made together as they head for an incinerator. The movie closes on Andy playing with his childhood friends for the last time. I bawled like a baby at this point.<br/><br/>The new characters were a lively addition to the old gang. My personal favorite being Ken (Michael Keaton), the spunky, cool dream hubby of Andy's little sister's Barbie Doll. Barbie and Ken form their own little sub plot together with a rather amusing fashion scene. Also occurring were omissions of previous toys including Wheezy the penguin, Bo Peep and the toy soldiers who exile at the movie's beginning.<br/><br/>Pixar have once again showed us that any movie that comes out their door will be coated in gold. Woody and Buzz have yet again proved to be Pixar's golden boys and the trilogy has ended with what is in my opinion the best movie ever made!"
"Quinoa1984","10","23","33","18 June 2010"," few trilogies can be considered whole and complete, but this is now one of them
","Toy Story 3 brings back nostalgia, but that's to be expected. We all think back to fifteen years ago, or eleven years ago, when the Toy Story movies came out the first time. If you're too young for that, then at least the re-release was last year to catch people up, though it's not quite the same thing. As Andy is off to college- as was predicted would happen as a given in Toy Story 2- we in the audience realize that this third film follows a kind of time-line that runs with our lives. Even if you're an adult (i.e. older than my 20-something age) you can relate to what the toys and Andy are going through. What happens at the end of the film, the resolution of the ultimate conflict of what to do with the toys as life goes on, is one of the most beautiful and heartwarmingly bittersweet (well, more like sad-sweet) moments in recent cinema. Pixar tends to do that.<br/><br/>This is the kind of third movie that makes it a trilogy- it's hard to see it going on to a fourth film and having any kind of the same resonance- and one that seems perfectly fit together in terms of a progressing story. But where something like Star Wars saw the second film as the darkest and third one coming into (somewhat) lighter terms, this is not quite the same with Pixar's baby. Toy Story 3, with it becoming a prison movie in more than just a sense (the toys get sent to Sunnyside Daycare, run by a cute-looking but ruthless bear voiced by Ned Beatty), and what happens in said prison. To be sure, other cute things abound in the movie, from Peas-in-a-Pod to (yes) Totoro from Miyazaki's movie. But in that prison, and other things that happen such as the trip to the junkyard/landfill, it gets dark.<br/><br/>And yet, Pixar continues their outstanding method of storytelling and entertainment: nothing is even scaled-down for kids, and nothing is too sappy for adults. A couple of obvious song choices aside- 'Dream Weaver' for when Ken and Barbie first meet, and 'Freak Out' as Ken hilariously tries on a wardrobe- there's nothing that doesn't work for kids and adults, equally, and often more-so for adults than kids (I wonder, for example, when Buzz is reset and becomes El Buzzo and speaks Spanish if the wee little ones will be able to read the subtitles). When it's funny the humor is aimed at sophisticated one-liners and, yes, sophisticated (or just well-timed) slapstick, when there's action it's intense just as in the previous Toy Stories, and when it's heartbreaking it'll make everyone in the audience cry. I wonder if Pixar has some kind of magic movie-voodoo to get the old adage to come alive: you'll laugh, you'll cry- and sometimes in the same breath! <br/><br/>The new toys are great additions, but they never detract from the classic cast. And even with them, and the great dynamic of the daycare center and its prison atmosphere, we never get lost in the shuffle of toy conflicts and desires and dreams halted (Lotso's backstory is like a twisted version of Jessie's story from Toy Story 2). It would also be a given to say that the animation keeps getting better, a little higher quality in stylization and panache, but the animators and filmmakers also aim higher in a number of ways. The opening of the film, with its grand depiction of what's going on inside of Andy's mind as he plays with his toys, an Old West-Sci/fi hybrid complete with a train full of troll orphans and Hamm as a giant flying pig-spaceship-weapon, is so epic as to seem like it's out of a much bigger Summer Action Blockbuster than it should be. Or rather, Toy Story IS this summer's big Blockbuster, and it's epic enough to be qualified as a kind of mini-masterpiece - that is, until the rest of the film unfolds.<br/><br/>At the least, Buzz dancing to Spanish Salsa music, and that end of the movie, make it one of the high points of Pixar's career - and this is following WALL-E and Up!"
"jordancelticsfan","10","18","25","27 June 2010"," One of the greatest achievements in movie history.
","Just how good is ''Toy Story 3'', you ask? It's simply one of the greatest achievements in movie history, I answer. This film, right now, should win the Oscar for Best Picture, hands down. I honestly doubt there'll be a better film than this all year. That's how absolutely brilliant this movie is. Pixar is officially king of everything! This movie is smart funny, thrilling, engaging, and, most importantly, it taught me about friendship. It taught me to stick by my friends, no matter what. The final sequences of the movie are absolutely breathtaking, and I couldn't help but shed a few tears. It doesn't feel like you're watching an animated movie. In some scenes it feels like you're watching an Alfred Hitchcock film, due to the great thrills, and others you can't help but cry over due to the togetherness of the whole gang. One of the film's themes is obviously never give up. This film can really inspire you. This film is also about loss and letting go. Who knew a film about toys could have such true themes on life. This is a masterpiece, one that once again pulls you in with the characters from the second it starts. Don't go see the grotesque Adam Sandler comedy ''Grown Ups'', or the action flick ''Knight and Day''. Go see this. This film is about a quintillion light years better than both those films. This beats, as great as they were, the first two ''Toy Story'' films. It beats them by a lot, actually. Take your family to go see this, but also, if you're an adult, go see this with adult friends. This is a film to go see with friends. This is the best from the greatness that is Pixar. 10 out of 10, a miraculous, comedic, inspiring, joyful, entertaining, adventurous, smart, tear jerking, and enduring film to cherish until the end of time."
"abrown975","10","9","11","9 July 2010"," Oh my god, there is absolutely no animated movie, maybe even movie, better than this one (and I am not exaggerating)!
","Oh my god, I cannot stress how good, no GREAT, this movie is! The animation is top notch, of course! You can almost feel the texture of the cloth Woody or Bullseye is made out of just based on it's looks. That's how good it is. The voice acting- superb. They have the original cast with a few added into the mix (some are subtle, like Bonnie Hunt or Whoopi Goldberg), and EVERYONE fits their part! Music- Randy Newman, you never fail to disappoint me, and this is no exception. Humor- Joke after joke, coming at you like bullets, leaving you no time to catch you breath because you're laughing so hard- until the climax, when you are either bawling your eyes out, or your heart is pounding at the speed of light, or both. There are many emotional parts in this movie that you won't forget, especially if you are an adult and have had that one bunch of special toys you just didn't want to let go of when you were a kid. Writing, music, humor, animation, acting, and emotion were all the best in any movie of 2010 and I seriously hope this wins Best Animated Feature, Best Music, and at least be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. So bottom line is- stop reading this review, get off the computer, and go see this movie! And if it's already out on DVD by the time you're reading this, go buy it!"
"guiarRK","10","137","237","15 June 2010"," A definite change in direction for Pixar, but fantastic nonetheless.
","So I saw Toy Story 3 tonight at an early screening here in Houston, TX. A little background info about me. I am a big, no HUGE, Pixar fan, I've watched every film that they have created dozens of times. Let me begin, this is definitely no Ratatouille, Wall-E, or Up. Pixar is definitely coming back to it's family roots and Toy Store 3 is extremely evident of that. Don't get me wrong, Pixar has completely outdone themselves once again offering a film that is extremely entertaining, thrilling, and fresh, but it is kind of disappointing that the film doesn't reach any true depth until the POWERFUL last act.<br/><br/>I'm going to divide my review into several sections.<br/><br/>Writing: The humor was straight up HILARIOUS. There were several scenes that had the audience ROTFL'ing, even I, as crude and bitter I may be when it comes to comedy, was laughing out loud at a few parts. However some jokes do fall flat into Dreamworks territory with potty humor (lincoln logs anyone?) which I hope does not become a recurrence, but overall the film had some wonderful writing and dialogue creating a truly believable setting and tone.<br/><br/>Animation: It's truly a shame that some of the later scenes in the final act haven't been shown in the commercials because, DAMN, the detail is truly remarkable. Since this is a no spoiler review I won't move further into that but let me tell you now, you will be impressed. Humans are beginning to look more realistic with ton's of attention to movement and the toys have benefited from some spackle in the facial department in an attempt to create a more emotionally expressive character. While it didn't blow me away like Finding Nemo and Wall-E did when they released, the work done here by Pixar is truly solid and way above anything Dreamworks has brought to the table. The 3D is also decent, I'm not really buying into this whole fad because after a few minutes you don't notice the effect. The added depth is nice but you honestly won't be missing much if you watch it in a good quality cineplex.<br/><br/>Sound: The theater I went to had a pretty weak sound system so I can't really comment on the effects but when it comes to voice talent, the actors truly shine. It was sad to see some characters go like Bo Beep and Squeaky but some of the new additions like Lotso and Ken, played by Ned Beatty and Michael Keaton, are some true standouts thanks to the excellent dialogue provided by the script. All the original characters once again do their job quite well and with the excellent editing and mixing, the dynamics of social interaction between the characters are expressed clearly.<br/><br/>Depth/Theme: You know I was going here and I HAD to talk about it. Ratatouille had the whole analysis of segregation with ""Everyone can cook"", Wall-E brought environmentalism, consumerism, capitalism, and most importantly love to the table, while Up directly deals with death and the emotions that stem from it. Toy Story 3 repeats the abandonment and moving on angle from Toy Story 2 which is TRULY the film's weakest link. Not because the movie copies the second films moral, but because TS3 virtually ignored these themes until the last act which I will admit was quite compelling. It would have been nice to spread these serious moments throughout the film to create a balanced equilibrium but unfortunately this does not happen. However I do want to talk about this pivotal juncture in the final act, there was a moment in the movie that only last a minute or two, but felt very, very, very real. I can't stress this enough, I have never felt anything like this from a movie. The first time I cried in a move was with Up's ""Ellie"" sequence but for some reason I didn't do it here. My emotions went beyond crying, I don't know if it was the swirling bright ember colors contrasting with the stark images or the expressiveness of the toys in that very moment, but I sat there in disbelief and was affected in a way that has not existed before.<br/><br/>Overall: I really do wish that Lee Unkrich could have spread the last 15 minutes throughout the movie but that didn't happen which is why I could not give this movie a 10, however, that last act SAVED this motion picture from being another run of the mill Dreamworks film. Aside from some of the lame toilet humor and disappointing direction choices, Toy Story 3 is a very solid conclusion to one of the best trilogies of all time that needs to experienced solely for the last beautifully gratifying act with the gang that I grew up with."

","To put this review in perspective, I am 26 y/o. My fiancé is 28, and we went to see this together last night (forewarned that we may need tissues - which we both did!).<br/><br/>**There be (tiny) spoilers ahead, so please don't read on if you don't want any inkling of what's in store for you. Suffice to say, we thought TS3 is an absolute triumph and I guarantee that you're going to love it!** Firstly, the ""Day & Night"" short. Seriously, Pixar was just showing off! They knew they needed to be better at 3D than pretty much everybody else, and they are. The short was crazy - I haven't seen 2D and 3D mixed like that before, and to do it so expertly was gobsmacking. So, once we saw that, we knew TS3 was going to be GOOD.<br/><br/>We recently went to see Shrek 4 and thought that, in order to make the characters seem fresh and exciting, Dreamworks basically resorted to giving the entire cast a personality transplant. So we were delighted that Pixar, who have clearly won the battle of the 3D animation giants with Toy Story 3, stayed true to the characters and their personalities as well as their standard of high quality story-telling, clever dialogue and excellent direction, and still managed to keep it fresh, exciting, emotive, and entertaining.<br/><br/>The themes running through the film are similar to those in the previous 2: loyalty, abandonment, friendship, ownership, new beginnings, journeys and getting that all-important play-time! But you don't feel like you've seen it all before. On this note I'm glad they didn't stick with ""Demo"" Buzz for very long, while ""Spanish"" Buzz has me in fits of giggles even a day later (whatever happens do NOT leave the cinema until the end of the credits!).<br/><br/>Secondary and new characters were surprisingly well-developed (Dreamworks should take a few notes I think) and even the 'baddies' had understandable feelings and motives while being just menacing enough. I personally felt sorry for the slightly sinister baby, and was happy to hear baby gurgles at the end after that hilarious raspberry! He doesn't say a word in the whole film, but I still cared about that baby toy. That says a whole lot about the sheer mastery of Pixar's storytelling, which had me gripped, laughing, excited, tense, sympathetic, empathetic, and a whole gamut of emotions you just don't think one film can make you feel, but somehow TS3 does.<br/><br/>It's been a while since one movie made me feel so much in such a short time; a very long time since the audience remained in the theatre for the credits, and even longer since the audience applauded at the end of the movie. I left feeling a little sad (poor Andy, not having ANY toys anymore!), but happy, very satisfied and a little awed by the whole experience. It really was that good, and that moving, and that entertaining. If it's not one of the greatest movies of all time, let alone animations, I think there's no justice in the world.<br/><br/>Should there be a TS4? I thought Bonnie was cute, the perfect person to receive Andy's legacy, and her existing toys are funny and sweet. Personally I would love to see more of Mr Pricklepants the thespian, and Bonnie was so adorable it'd be lovely to get into some of her games. But even if there isn't a 4th movie you know that all the toys are going to be happy with her, and have some awesome supernatural adventures! This is definitely going into my DVD collection - I'd buy it for the Buzz/Jessie paso alone. Whoever thought of a matador-posing, paso-dancing Buzz should get a pay raise because that was inspired.<br/><br/>Honestly, the best movie I've seen in AGES. Go see it, and you'll love it like pretty much everyone else lol Will be watching the Oscars with interest..."
"J_Jammer","10","17","24","22 June 2010"," ""Toy Story 3"" It's Not Goodbye, It's See You Later.and That's Not a Tear!
","I randomly wonder if the Toy Story trilogy created any hoarders, because if I were a child and saw these films, I'd become a hoarder—just sayin'.<br/><br/>The complaint that I see through many reviews is that the animation isn't adequate. Really? Pathetic excuse for people that claim to love movies. Ick.<br/><br/>Pixar makes me feel good without making me feel guilty. Thank you seems so small in comparison to what they've given and as saccharin as this sounds; it's true. It's so hard to get a close to wholesome experience at a film in today's industry and Pixar can be trusted to do just that. Their films are wholesome because they do their darnest to make them so and families appreciate that more than they probably will ever know.<br/><br/>I wondered how they were going to get to Sunny Side and the film sets it up perfectly. Like dominoes falling one after the other the things that go wrong have the toys end up at the day care only to want to go back home. Perfect display of story creation is taking a simple concept and squeezing an amazing adventure out of it. Many themes run through the film such as feeling unwanted, misunderstandings, bullying, jail break/escape, and then the wonderful reunited moment.<br/><br/>The Toy Story Gang is back sans Bo Peep and I'm not as sure as to why. Maybe there's an interesting story in there somewhere or I missed the explanation in the film. There are so many great moments that I can't pick one. The Ken (Michael Keaton) and Barbie (Jodi Benson) moments were so cheesy they were awesome. They were cheesy in an 80's kind of way. Plastic perfect, if you ask me. Buzz (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack) connect in an adorable manner. Her infatuation with him while he's stuck in Spanish mode had her in a Latin heat mood smoldering in ways no one thought a little cowgirl doll could. Andy and Woody (I know, I know) have a strong connection that is shown in Toy Story and takes a great turn in beginning and even bigger one in the end.<br/><br/>John Morris grew up with many of the viewers on Toy Story as Andy for all three movies. Random awesome factoid.<br/><br/>If Toy Story 3 (and I'm only reminded of the Oscars cause of what I read in someone else's review) doesn't dominate the Oscars it would be a travesty. It is by far the best film of the year (thus far) and I'm sure that won't change too much this summer.<br/><br/>The end of Toy Story 3 takes all of Toy Story history and makes the caring moviegoer, who supported the film from the onset in 1995 until now, break down and cry for toys. How incredibly gifted a storyteller are these people? This is why the bar will remain unbreached because they not only set it high, they make it insurmountable. The tears for the toys are more for what we all miss. It's the carefree feeling, the love for the simple and the power of imagination that is lost when we cross a certain threshold and nowadays the age gets younger and younger. When people watch Toy Story 3, not only are they a little shocked by the dark nature it takes on, they cry because of the goodbyes. They do so because they'd trade all of what they have in technology to have that mindset again. With the last scene the classic song playing, ""You got a friend in me"" Toy Story 3 ends in the most amazing way possible for a film that made us all believe that toys come to life the moment our backs are turned. Pixar has given what many creators of worlds wish to give and that's immortality engraved on the hearts of film lovers that'll last ""to infinity and beyond."""
"Emtzzz","10","10","13","23 June 2010"," This is what I called an excellent movie!
","I have to say, I'm not a big uber fans of toy story, I watched TS1 and TS2 and while I can say they're good, but they're not really unforgettable for me...<br/><br/>Seeing the trailer of TS3 in the cinema, I wasn't expecting lots of things since I thought the setting will be kinda boring (come on the background story is they're going to be left off and they're going to do adventure only within the daycare), one of the reason I wanted to watch it is because it's in 3D, and I've watched all the prequel...<br/><br/>It turned out to be one of the best movie experience that I had in years! This is how an animation/family movie should be!<br/><br/>I watched it without a lot of expectation, but it slapped me right in the face and I can't take my eyes of the screen for the whole movie!!<br/><br/>The opening was brilliant! and so how the story developed, it's just fun! I had great laugh! esp when mr potato head turned into tortilla and later comes back as a cucumber (which I think more like a giant jalapeno) and also when buzz go to espanola mode...and the ending...it was also very good, I couldn't really tell what the ending would be and what woody is writing until Andy stopped in front of a normal house...and during the ending scene, I'm sure lots of the adults audience shed a bit of tears or had teary eyes :D<br/><br/>This is one movie that I would recommend to everybody, hell, I even register to IMDb exclusively just to say that this movie is this good!<br/><br/>If you want to have a good laugh with your loved ones, or just by yourself, or with your family, this is the movie to go with!<br/><br/>Great job Disney n pixaar! To infinity and beyond!!! 9.9 out of 10!"
"crazyshells219","10","8","10","21 June 2010"," Magnificent
","I'm not as eloquent as all the other people who have been writing reviews on here. But I'm absolutely a huge Toy Story fan, especially since I was 7 years old when the first one came out in 1995, and I've watched it so many times I can basically quote the whole movie.<br/><br/>Needless to say I've been excited about Toy Story 3 for months, ever since I found out it was coming out. And for some reason I wasn't even worried that it wouldn't be good. Somehow I just knew it would be. And wow was I right. I dragged my friend to the movie with me, and even though she's not a huge Toy Story fan, she loved the movie too. <br/><br/>I laughed out loud during almost the entire movie, and could not believe that parts of it actually made me cry. Toy Story 3 was magical, wonderful, amazing, brilliant, and so fabulously done. And my words aren't even doing justice to it! Really! So if you haven't seen it, just go see it!! Pixar isn't just for kids. But we're all kids at heart anyway. <br/><br/>If you're like me, and you grew up with Toy Story, it being that one movie that you watched over and over and over again, driving your parents crazy, then you absolutely MUST go see this movie, and you'll love it. Thank you, Pixar!!!!!"
"thesar-2","10","12","17","19 June 2010"," Third time's a Charm
","I think the harshest thing I could say about the latest Pixar adventure, or Toy Story movie, for that matter, is even attempting to determine with Toy Story film is the best.<br/><br/>How Pixar does it blows my mind. Time and again. Sure, they start with what I consider the number one quality of any movie: story. Character depth and development ranks second for me. Despite all my male-counterparts that simply love action, things blowing up, beautiful women (or people,) etc., fall behind – far behind – the front two. <br/><br/>Toy Story 3 has all qualities needed to make a fantastic, adventurous and successful movie for tons of people of all creeds. But it puts both of my favorite staples first: excellent story with (yes, even animated) deep characters. And it's a lot of fun to boot.<br/><br/>Starting off with a literal bang, Toy Story 3 sets the scene early that these ""Toys of Owner Andy"" love to be played with. It's what they were made for, what they yearn for and it gives them hope and a soul. Unfortunately for them, like the expiration on food, (yes, even Twinkies, thanks Zombieland) kids grow up and out of toys.<br/><br/>Will Andy be faithful, keeping his prized Buzz Lightyear (Allen,) Woody (Hanks) or (most of) the rest of his toys, ones adults like me grew up with in Toy Story and Toy Story 2? Kinda.<br/><br/>As in usual Toy Story fashion, there are mishaps and the adventure begins! Follow the toy crusaders from this point on from Andy's house to the curb, from the day care of hell to new child's house and so on.<br/><br/>I would hate to even divulge in more of the secrets, twists, turns, comedy (and I mean roll on floor laughing humor), suspense or ideas presented. I can't imagine even some movie-goers on the fence that actually ""have to decide"" to see it.<br/><br/>As equally tough as it would be to rank all Pixar movies – though, I plan to – and rank these Toy Story movies in order, it would be equally hard to pinpoint the best parts of Toy Story 3, aside from to aforementioned great script and characters. But, I'll try.<br/><br/>I loved the monkey! Though brief, I laughed so hard every second he was on screen. Furthermore, I loved the other new characters, especially Mr. Pricklepants (Dalton.) I loved the intro. I loved the plan of escape. I loved the Ken ""secret"" references. I loved the español. I loved the comity (as found in the other Toy Story movies, but I would say it's most evident in this feature) between the leads, as well as newcomers. I loved the extreme attention to detail, the crispness of the film and the cinematography while never forgetting this is a cartoon. (And to add to that, by far, the graphics and technology has tripled this time around, even though the previous groundbreaking entries were still way above par.) I loved the overall comedy, including the tongue-in-cheek jokes. (I actually found myself laughing hard and out loud at some of the under-the-radar jokes that apparently no one else either caught or cared for. It was a tough and somewhat quiet crowd around me – aside from the annoying and crying kids and their equally inattentive guardians who don't know how to muffle their kids.) I love that as well created and designed it is, this could very well be a stand-alone feature, though it helps to see the first two and it does play homage to fans of the other Toy Story movies. So much so, it's hard NOT to get choked up in the finale, if you can make it that far without getting somewhat emotional.<br/><br/>That's just a short list. There's so much wonder and awe and it's jaw dropping that Pixar, or the returning voice talent/actors could pull this offagain. But they did. It's highly recommended, and I would say to see it on IMAX 3-D for the quality and grand scale – like I did, but Disney STILL has yet to shock me with their ""version"" of 3-D. I was blown away during the 3-D in Monsters Vs. Aliens, but here, like in Up, it was so-so. Thankfully, Pixar does know how NOT to rely on 3-D as a gimmick. They spend their money on the talent to create everlasting stories, fun and adventures.<br/><br/>Side Note: The preceding animated short, one I always look forward to prior to any Pixar film, Day & Night, was pretty good, and inventive, but not great. At least it featured Vegas."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","9","12","27 June 2010"," A perfect way to end the beloved Toy Story trilogy
","Again, I don't mean to sound like a broken record but it seems like Disney/Pixar is the only competent movie company that produces great films and classic stories. They know how to write, shoot and tell a story well. Toy Story is Pixar's baby, at the time of the first film's release and was the start of what we have today with computer animation. Now the first Toy Story was good, the second Toy Story was great and Toy Story 3 was absolutely fantastic. The stories just get better and better as they keep coming. Bringing back our favorite characters but adding a fun new little twist to them, it brought a new audience in and kept the one's who saw the first one and gave us something new to enjoy. Pixar's last films like Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up kept raising the bar higher and higher, not only are they Disney's great films, but they're also some of the strongest and best films of all time. Toy Story 3 can now be added as this is my favorite of the trilogy, bringing in some great new characters and magic to the story, I couldn't stop laughing and crying with this movie. I thought this was a perfect ending to the trilogy as it gets to all the adults when we had to grow up and give up our childhood toys.<br/><br/>Now seventeen years old, Andy has outgrown his old toys and is preparing to move to college. He decides to take Woody with him and packs the other toys in a garbage bag, intending to store them in the attic, but Andy's mom mistakenly puts the bag on the curb. Believing that Andy no longer wants them, the toys sneak into a box to be donated to Sunnyside Daycare. As the only toy who saw what really happened, Woody tries to clear up the misunderstanding, but the other toys refuse to believe him and they are all driven to Sunnyside. Woody tries to convince the others to return to Andy, but they decide they are happier at Sunnyside, so he leaves without them. The others soon discover that Lotso had placed them in a room of toddlers, whose young and rambunctious nature causes them to abuse and torture the innocent toys. Woody learns that Sunnyside is a toy prison. Realizing their error, the toys try to leave but are imprisoned by Lotso, the head bear of the toys and his henchmen. Woody must return to Sunnyside to help his friends break out.<br/><br/>One of the things I absolutely loved about this film was that it is darker than other family animated movies, I felt like this one had to be as it's really sad that Andy has to say good bye to his toys. But I was telling my friends the other day how it's sad because a lot of animated films while they're good, our films that we grew up with always had a dark touch like Who Framed Roger Rabbit or The Lion King, along with others long before those films. I thought maybe this generation was just a bit wussy when it came to having a little bit of a scary story. But Toy Story 3 has some genuinely chilling moments, the group of evil henchmen toys turn Buzz evil and it is actually kind of creepy the way they come at him. I loved when they put our group of toys in the bins and had a little tribute to some great prison movies, something for the adults to enjoy. I also saw a little Puss in Boots when the group gets a hold of Buzz and resets him by accident turning him into Spanish Buzz Lightyear, I couldn't stop laughing at his actions and lines. Incredible animation, great story along with a strong cast, this was a terrific film that I was so glad to see. I don't like to over hype a movie because you'll have a certain hope for it, but I went in with high hopes and not only got what I wanted, but much more. I can't wait for this movie to be added to my DVD collection. It's a new classic that I'm sure you'll absolutely love.<br/><br/>10/10"
"davielee15","10","9","12","23 June 2010"," The greatest three-quel of all-time to the greatest trilogy of all-time!
","I've seen a lot of disappointing three-quels in my days. Pirates 3, Shrek 3, Spidey 3, X-Men 3, Rush Hour 3, and much more. But this movie is not only a great three-quel but it could be the best three-quel of all time. Everything in this movie is excellent and I mean everything! It is dark, hilarious, clever entertaining, colorful, amusing but most of all it is very emotional, especially at the end. Thankfully, I did not cry on the outside but I cried a lot in the inside. Toy Story 3 is unforgettable and I am sad that there will never be another toy story movie but unfortunately it had to be ended. What a way to end a perfect movie and, I believe, the greatest trilogy of all-time. I am begging every single person to go see this movie instead of some crap like Prince of Persia, robin hood, the A team, or especially Jonah Hex. This is the best movie of the year and is the best movie of the decade... so far."
"Fields201","10","9","12","22 June 2010"," The Box Office is Dominated by Toys
","Let me first start off by saying that this was my most anticipated movie of the summer. Not Ironman 2, not A-Team or Karate Kid, no it was Toy Story 3. Many of my friends laughed at me because I was going to see this movie with anticipation. I still maintained my dignity because, well, Toy Story was my favorite Pixar film and it was a good part of my childhood.<br/><br/>So, in honor of that, I went to go see Toy Story 3. First there's this short, called DAY AND NIGHT, which actually fascinated me. It was a mixture of hand-drawn animation and the 3D we are accustomed to today. I don't want to say too much about it, but if you really put some thought into it, it's pretty deep.<br/><br/>Then it was Toy Story 3 itself. I must admit, I wasn't sure if the film was showing promise in the beginning. I got what was going on but, well, there was a storm outside and my mind was lingering on that. I was thinking, ""Man, if this film isn't any good really soon, I'm going to go check out this storm!"" I love storms, as you can probably tell. And I was soon regretting paying for my ticket that night and waiting for the matinée the next day.<br/><br/>Then something happened. I forgot about the storm. I was sucked into this film. I was engrossed into the characters once more, the story, the environments, and I soon came to realize that nothing was really lost between Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 2. Pixar, yet again, makes a satisfying film.<br/><br/>After watching this film, I went home and I read a lot of other reviews, mainly those on IMDb.com. A lot of people talk about the climax of the film and how epic it is. It is. There's a lot going on and there's a lot of excitement in every turn. What makes this climax work, is something called EMOTION, which a lot of films seem to lack. You see, when you care about the characters that are put on screen, it generates reaction from the audience. It's an art form that is not easily mastered but somehow Pixar is able to wave that magic wand.<br/><br/>However, the ending does lead to a flaw for me. It's how they written in how the bad guy of the movie gets what's coming to him. To me, it felt shoehorned into the script. It's like saying, ""Hey, how are we going to get rid of this guy now?"" And then someone is like, ""Well, let's just throw this scene here and DONE!"" Really, it was a little unsatisfying for me but that's about the only flaw I could really think of in the whole film.<br/><br/>And last but not least, I cannot forget to mention Ken, voiced by Michael Keaton. Let's just say he made the movie. It was like that extra ingredient to make an already great film even better. In fact, I could hardly tell it was Michael Keaton. I had to really hone in on certain mannerisms of his voice to catch that it's him. Seriously, he was a riot and it almost seemed like he was having a lot of fun in that sound booth.<br/><br/>All and all, check out Toy Story 3. Hopefully your friends won't laugh at you like they did to me!"
"ungy357","10","19","30","16 June 2010"," A Movie For The Ages
","The one name in Hollywood today that can be truly, universally trusted every time is Pixar Animation Studios. Their two ""missteps"", ""Cars"" and ""A Bug's life"", are disappointments only in that they don't contend for best movie Pixar has made. They're A minuses instead of A's. ""Toy Story 3"" joins the pantheon of great Pixar films, and all-time great sequels. It stands out as the best film of 2010 at this point. While it may not be as brilliant from start to finish as the second ""Toy Story"" film (the animated equivalent of ""The Godfather Part II""), is so engaging, so witty and entertaining and exciting, that adults and children will be pulled in all the way. And the third act ramps up the emotion to a degree equal to the best of it's predecessors (my 5 year old nephew had to turn around and ask ""why are you cwying?"") The highly publicized plot line deals with the toys beloved owner Andy moving on to college, and choosing the fate of his beloved toys. Through one of those complex farcical events that seems so common in Andy's household, the attic bound toys (minus Woody, who is supposed to go to college with Andy) are accidentally donated to a daycare center. Woody, of course, has to rescue his friends, but there is some doubt as to whether they want to be rescued: Andy hasn't played with them for years, and the daycare, a toytopia presided over by lovable teddy bear named Lotso Hogs Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty, in a welcome return to the screen), promises the chance to be played with everyday. And when these kids get older, new kids replace them. To the love starved toys (especially Jesse the yodeling cowgirl, who is terrorized of repeating the experience she had with her beloved Emily), this seems like the opportunity of a lifetime. It goes without saying that all is not as it seems.<br/><br/>Part of the genius of Pixar is that, in what are ostensibly children's films, they deal with very sophisticated and adult themes. Here, the struggle to grow up while holding onto the joy of childhood is captured beautifully, as are the themes of moving on and dealing with the loss of loved ones (there is a a brief reference early in the film, just a few lines, where Woody's reaction, between the animation and the greatness of Tom Hanks voice acting, is an exquisitely subtle and poignant heartbreaker). And, of course, the comedy is hilarious. I wouldn't have thought there was still new material left to be milked from the Potato Head's detachable appendages, but the new twists are innovative and hysterical.<br/><br/>If you have kids, take them to ""Toy Story 3"". If you don't, go anyway. Pixar has once again proved that they are the most reliable name in film today."
"Apemangalore","9","14","21","18 June 2010"," A worthy conclusion to a fantastic trilogy
","I've said this before, but I'll say it again: Pixar has shown with their initial ten films that they haven't the faintest clue how to make a bad movie. And yet, somehow, I always find myself feeling doubtful whenever a trailer for one of their new films is released. With Toy Story 3, I got the impression that it would be just another adventure with Woody and the gang for the sake of having one. So, with this, and a movie year that has been relatively lacking so far, would Toy Story 3 disappoint? The answer: absolutely not.<br/><br/>Probably the most surprising aspect about this film is that, even after eleven years since the release of Toy Story 2, the material that has made this series so damn enjoyable hasn't been lost one bit here. All of the old characters are just endearing as ever, if not more so, and all of the new ones feel right at home here. Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton) is especially hilarious, to the point where even the mention of him got me laughing.<br/><br/>To touch briefly on the visual front, the characters themselves are just as expressive as they've always been. However, like Wall-E, the world that they inhabit looks much more photorealistic this time around. Also, this is one of the few instances when the 3D aspect actually enhances the film. It's by no means as crucial to the experience in the same way that it was for Avatar, but it gives the film a little extra something.<br/><br/>The action sequences, too, are spectacular. These are toys that we're talking about, and somehow, Pixar's managed to provide these scenes with one hell of a punch. Not much else to say about 'em other than that the climax in particular feels as epic as anything from The Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>What really puts Toy Story 3 above most films out there, though, is how it deals with the themes of loss and growing up. Even after getting to know these characters over the course of two films, I was still surprised by just how much I got sucked into their despair. Without giving anything away, there were two scenes that caused me to tear up, and even more that had me on the verge of doing so.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is not only a worthy conclusion to a fantastic trilogy, but also the one third installment (other than Return of the King) that I feel is better than its predecessors. For all of the reasons already mentioned and more, it's one of the studio's best entries. Sorry for doubting you, Pixar, even if it was just for a bit."
"junglecruiser","10","7","9","23 June 2010"," All's well that ends SWELL!
","I waited a few days to review TOY STORY 3 as I was profoundly moved and wanted my feelings to subside a bit. I was puzzled as to why a 50 year old man would feel emotional about a kids movie (and a third installment to boot). I have a 11 year old son who LOVED the Toy Story characters, yet during the movie; even at the end he was far more composed then his old man. TOY STORY 3 is a wonderful film. Read the other reviews for plot descriptions and more superlatives as I agree with them all. For us folks with kids I can tell you I believe the root cause why you maybe so moved to tears as I was. Through our children we learned about and grew to care about these characters. They represent our children's early childhood; a time for joy and wonders. Now our children are growing into teenagers and we collectively weep for those days not long ago we could marvel at how our children would drag around a Tattered Woody or hold up a Buzz Lightyear and exclaim ""To infinity and beyond!"". If your children ever pulled you through Disneyland and waited in line to stand with Woody and Jesse, get a photo and maybe even an autograph, this film will so remind of those lost days that well....lets just say bring tissue and thank god for the 3 D glasses as you don't want anyone to see you crying over what my son says ""Is a cool movie...for little kids""."

"meininky","10","11","16","18 June 2010"," Another Pixar masterpiece
","By now, it's become a cliché to say ""Pixar has done it again."" But that doesn't make it any less true.<br/><br/>Year after year, Pixar releases movies that leave audience's jaws on the floor. Toy Story 3 is no exception. With 15 years' worth of personal investment in the series, Pixar has crafted their most emotional outing yet. We've grown up with these characters (I was 5 when the first one came out, and as Andy heads off to college, I'm just home from my first year), so there's already a built-in connection. We care what happens to these toys. It's a world we're all familiar with: not just because the films have been around for a decade and a half, but because everyone has had toys and (probably) grown out of them. It's an interesting reflection of our reality, because as we flinch when Andy calls his toys ""junk,"" we know that we've done the same.<br/><br/>I cried. A lot. On the way home, I cried some more. Pixar has done a simply beautiful job of finishing this series. It's always been fun to see the way the toys handle different aspects of life that are stressful for them: birthday parties, Christmas, yard sales. But having their owner grow up and leave them is something totally different. While many of the toys resign to their fate or even embrace the possibility of going to daycare, Woody's unflinching loyalty reminds us of why we love these characters so much in the first place. And these reasons are reiterated to great effect in the final, amazingly written and executed scene.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Toy Story 3 is the way all the different elements are blended so seamlessly. There's heart to spare, hilarious comedy, clever writing, and intense action sequences. In fact, I can't remember the last time I was so stressed out watching a movie. These toys have to run the gauntlet on their adventure, and it makes the ""no toy left behind"" policy even more affecting.<br/><br/>Genre lines are blurred, as well. The opening is an appropriate western/sci-fi mix that hearkens back to the first film. A large portion of the film takes on the characteristics of a prison break film to thrilling effect. Each generic evolution feels natural, making the movie increasingly complex and thus, the perfection with which it's pulled off that much more impressive.<br/><br/>As with all of Pixar's films, the technical aspects are dazzling. The animation is simply beautiful, especially the texturing that's achieved on some of the softer characters, like Lotso. The 3-D is well-implemented and utterly unintrusive. There are no gimmicks here; Pixar doesn't make things pop out of the screen to justify the heightened ticket prices. The film itself is worth the money, and the 3-D just makes everything look that much crisper and more gorgeous.<br/><br/>The voice cast is phenomenal as always. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are still the perfect leading pair, and all their support is hilarious. The new additions to the cast are fantastic, as well. Michael Keaton as Ken gets a lot of the films biggest laughs. He captures just the right blend of sinister and clueless, with a healthy dollop of vanity to coat it all. Other new highlights include the wonderful Kristen Schaal and Timothy Dalton in small supporting parts.<br/><br/>The series also continues its tradition of great villains in the vein of Sid (who makes a subtle cameo as a garbage man) and the Prospector. This time, we get a terrifying pair in the form of the cute and cuddly Lotso and the horrific, droopy-eyed Big Baby, who recalls the claw- bodied doll head from the first film. The pair make an interesting team and are given a backstory that makes them more sympathetic than most film villains. Their flashback is reminiscent of Jessie's in the second film (although there's no heart-breaking song accompanying it).<br/><br/>Randy Newman is back in the music department and delivers an appropriately flexible and exciting score. He also provides a great new song to the Toy Story canon: ""We Belong Together"" (can you think of a better title?), which plays over the credits as fun extra scenes help relieve the emotional load.<br/><br/>Simply put, Toy Story goes above and infinitely beyond my highest hopes and expectations. It tugs at the heartstrings in a genuine way. In typical Pixar fashion, there's no emotional trickery being pulled here. Pixar's focus has always been on story, and with their latest masterpiece, they've brought their first story to a beautiful, fitting close. I couldn't be happier."

","I just attended a free screening and, without having seen the ending (it was a ""cliffhanger"" screening), I believe this is the best Toy Story yet. I didn't know if they'd be able to keep the magic going but this story is extremely clever and, as per usual, beautifully animated. From the beginning I found myself happily smiling in my seat. The new characters are funny and support the old cast, some of whom are reinvented in their own ways, wonderfully. This movie had a college crowd laughing hysterically, showing that Disney Pixar movies can truly be for all ages. Although I was afraid the plot would become too stretched by having Andy head off to college it still manages to be very heartfelt. I'll be excitedly going to see the rest of it in June."
"immortalmahyar","10","3","3","9 October 2019"," Thank you guys

Thank you guys for being a part of our childhood until now that we are grown ups but whenever we look at you we see our childhood.
So Thank You Guys..."
"jccwu","10","20","33","15 June 2010"," What it lacks in originality, it makes it up entirely in its ending.
","After 11 years later, we finally get to see another Toy Story movie! Even though it wouldn't be realistic to expect this sequel to be as good as Toy Story 2, you can always believe that Pixar will deliver another entertaining film.<br/><br/>It was so refreshing to see all the Toy Story characters again. Surprisingly, the only speaking toy character that was in the first two films that was absent in Toy Story 3 was Bo Peep. Other than her, the rest of Andy's toys have returned and all of them get a good amount of screen time. As for the new toys, Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty) & Ken (Michael Keaton) have the largest roles.<br/><br/>If there is something negative about this movie is that it lacks originality, but the ending is golden! As for the generic portion of the film; you will notice that the formula for this movie is very similar to Toy Story 2, such as the villain and the toys' rescue mission. As for the conclusion of this movie, it is so good that I hope they do NOT make a 4th film. It feels so fitting to have this movie end the trilogy, as the moral & theme of the story represents the entire Toy Story films.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how emotional the final scene was; but then again, Pixar is great at adding the human elements into their stories & characters. As for the main theme song ""You got a Friend in Me"", it's a universal message throughout the entire Toy Story films, to the very last sequence of this movie. As for the moral of the story (including the whole trilogy), it is learning to let go when the time is right; whether you are a toy, a child or a parent. I loved how this film ends! What it lacks in originality, it makes it up entirely in its conclusion."
"TourettesPersonal","10","8","11","1 July 2010"," It's all about the story!
","The third part of every trilogy usually ruins the series. ""Toy Story 3"" was almost a victim because the plot was suppose to be about ""Buzz having a defect and he was shipped to Taiwan to be fixed but instead he's going to be replace by another Buzz Lightyear, and the other toys will rescue him."" if that's the plot of ""Toy Story 3"" then it will be an unnecessary sequel. But good thing Pixar changed it in to a better plot. Everyone's favorite childhood movie is back to the big screen and it is still the same old Toy Story movie that we always love! Toy Story 3 is one of the best sequels of all time.<br/><br/>The reason why other third parts of the trilogy fails because they didn't have a great story. Pixar never made a bad movie yet because they care about the story of their movies. The movie is non-stop entertainment. There are no boring parts. Even the parts with no dialog are so entertaining. The old characters still have their same old personality. The new characters are fun to watch, but too bad Mr. Pricklepants didn't have enough screen time. I liked that character even though he didn't have enough scenes. Randy Newman's music score is a little nostalgic to the first two Toy Story movies.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" is darker, suspenseful, exciting, and has more drama than the first two movies. The movie also has a large scale. This might be the biggest sequel of the year!<br/><br/>Poor olé' Dreamworks, they have finally made a classic but still their rival is still going to beat them. So better luck next time DW. Animated Movies this year are overwhelming and a-must-see-to-the-big-screen-than-DVD-and-Blu-ray.<br/><br/>You might be asking ""What is the best Toy Story movie?"", the answer is .... All of them! All three Toy Story movies are classics and unforgettable. Sequels doesn't need big action and explosions to be good. It's all about the story. I think Toy Story needs to end here.<br/><br/>5/5 stars! Best movie of the year!"
"zactac","10","8","11","22 June 2010"," Enchanting, loving, and emotional. Toy Story 3 lives up to high expectations and more.
","I've been watching Toy Story as long as I can remember and now its hard to imagine this great trilogy come to an end. Toy Story 3 delivers beyond what we were expecting. It has great comedy, wonderful performances by its all-star cast, probably one of the most emotional stories made by Pixar, and a climax so suspenseful it makes the ending all the more emotional.<br/><br/>Toy Story comes from an older generation of films. By now everyone who saw the films when they were younger is grown or just about grown. But it doesn't stop Pixar. Toy Story was one of the first animated films I had ever seen. Then Toy Story 2 came out and that film helped keep me fixated on Toy Story for a long time. Now I'm older, but it doesn't stop me from loving Toy Story and its great sequels. In a way I think its the filmmakers saying goodbye to the older generation of kids who first saw Toy Story and the other great Pixar films and welcoming a new generation. However you look at it there is still an obvious message in the film. And the message is simple but like all Pixar movie messages are they are also smart (especially the way its executed), but I think I'll let you find out what it is on your own.<br/><br/>The film is about Andy leaving for college and now the toys are worried about their future. Then one thing leads to another and they end up at Sunnyside (a daycare) where they meet some new toys like the leader Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear and at first they think its great until they learn that they were put in the toddlers playroom. After being tortured by the kids they learn Andy is looking for them so they decide to break out of there. However they learn that Lotso isn't as nice as he seems. So now with time running short before Andy leaves they have to break out and learn what it truly means to be a toy.<br/><br/>I found this film to being darker than the previous Toy Story films. In the first film Woody and Buzz are afraid of being alone on the side of the road or being trapped in an evil kids house. In the second one Woody's afraid of being sent to Japan. But in this film the toys are afraid that they're going to die. And the darker element I have to say is great. It helps build for a more suspenseful climax and shows that Lotso is probably one of the most evil and insane villains created by Pixar. Especially since at first he seems nice and lovable but when he shows how cruel he is you know the toys are in trouble. And the darker element got me thinking about Up and Wall-e. Both of those movies were Pixar's move out of their comfort zone. Wall-e being a post-apocalyptic film with a message about the future of the world if people don't change and Up taking on serious elements like marriage, life, death, and learning to let go. And now Toy Story 3 does something different as well, it has a much darker tone for a Pixar film which really works. There might be a couple scenes where younger kids might be scared but nothing that should terrify them beyond the point of seeing this film.<br/><br/>And a little warning, this film is a tearjerker. The end practically had me tearing up and a couple times I felt a tear run down my cheek and I could see it in the faces of the rest of the audience as well. The film is meant to be bitter sweet. Because of that tears are pretty much guaranteed.<br/><br/>This film brings back some of the most beloved characters in film-making history and even brings back its audience from more than a decade ago. There are so many memories in the Toy Story films anyone who loved them when they were a kid can't help but see this film and shed a few tears for their old childhood friends. And who can blame them (including me) for doing so, Pixar has proved time and time again that animated films are for more than just children and that the emotional aspects of the films can even be better than some of the best live action dramas that have ensured tears from their audience.<br/><br/>My love for animation has proved to live on again in the new Toy Story film. Ladies and gentlemen what we have here is sure to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Film this year. I thought it wasn't possible but my high expectations were met when I saw Toy Story 3. It has beautiful animation, loving characters, a great and emotional story, and a finale fit for the toys who have enchanted our lives for more than a decade. Toy Story 3 is the best Toy Story from the trilogy and is yet another Pixar masterpiece."
"pharoah6905","Null","45","86","5 May 2010"," Pixar has done it again!
","I saw the cliffhanger version at my college yesterday and I must say that I'm thoroughly impressed by it! Pixar knows how to keep the story fresh, and entertaining. They kept the entire crowd laughing every other moment, and mixing in gasps of fear whenever anything happened to the main characters. The visual effects are simply stunning, like nothing you've ever seen before, with lots of great cinematography. Even though we didn't get to see the end, they still gave us enough of the story to make it very satisfying. There are plenty of classic Pixar references so keep your eyes peeled for those. I will definitely be at theaters on June 18 to find out how this amazing saga will end!"
"IamtheRegalTreatment","8","20","35","13 June 2010"," Toy Story 3. Let's be kids again...
","I am a 21 year old male. I watched the first Toy Story in theaters when I was 7 years old and the second Toy Story when I was 11. These films are a part of my childhood and I can assure you anyone between the ages of 18-30 have a special connection like I do for them. I personally have been waiting for this movie for 10 years now, since the ending sequences in Toy Story 2. Ten long years later, I finally received my wish.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is the story of our classic and new favorite characters Woody, Buzz, Slinky, Ham, Rex and friends as they try to cope with the fact that Andy is going off to college. They haven't been played with in years and they're becoming restless. As much as they want to believe Andy will save them and keep them in the attic as Woody predicts, our beloved toys start to question his motives as college day is coming and Andy's old room is starting to deteriorate into a trash hold. Which will Andy decide upon? The plot for this movie at first glance made me very satisfied, seeing as Pixar and the writers are trying to follow the time frame we are accustomed to. Back in 1999 when Andy found his new toys Jesse and Bullseye, he was still a child with imagination and joy to play with these toys. Ten years later, he is no longer a child but grown into a graduating senior who is ready to venture off the college for the first time. This plot is a classic scenario that new-bound college teens deal with on their moving date: whether or not to give up hold on our childish bonds. It's time to grow up sometime. This plot grabbed me in easily.<br/><br/>As the rest of the movie continued, Pixar led us on a classic Toy Story adventure, much like the opening scene in Toy Story where the Army men move downstairs to find what Andy receives in his birthday presents, or the scene in Toy Story 2 where the gang try to manage their way to the toy store across the highway. These very simple and drawn out scenes are what grab our attention because of the detail with every move, every instant that our friends are in peril. They also help a child who is watching to use their mind to follow along, from one frame to another, as Woody jumps from floor to toilet seat to toilet paper roll and nearly falls creating applause, up to the stall to the ledge and out the window for freedom. These actions take a lot from a child to stay along, which helps develop brain activity in problem solving. Step 1 to Step 6 leads to success, and this is a positive attribute to teach to our children.<br/><br/>This movie is a little longer than most child films, close to 2 hours, which is a perfectly acceptable time frame for a movie so anticipated. Having it be under 90 minutes would have been a little selfish for the animators seeing as they knew how long we waited for this. If you are seeing this in 3D (which I believe is a must) you will be drawn in very easily and your attention will be kept throughout. With introductions of new characters and vigorous imagery, it is hard to lose track of what's going on. The animation was flawless as usual, storyline close to perfection, characters are lovable... I truly see no reason to dislike this film.<br/><br/>Overall I gave it an 8 out of 10. This movie lives up to the first 2 in the series, not so sure about being better than the original. Close but undecided. You can make your own judgment call. If you are between the ages of 18-30 or you have children of your own, this film is one of the better ones you will see all year. Be a kid again, it won't hurt for 2 hours."
"nunyerbiz","7","22","40","20 July 2010"," Still a fun Pixar effort, but the weakest of the Toy Story films.
","I know, I know... I'm sure I'm going to get destroyed over this review. Anything under eight stars for a Pixar movie is blasphemy! While I thought TS3 was an entertaining two hours... it just wasn't quite up to par with the first two entries from the trilogy.<br/><br/>The opening and ending dealing with Andy growing up and the toys outliving their usefulness to their owner was well done Pixar heartstring tugging... no complaints there. The middle act, which boiled down to a prison break movie, was a bit dull despite all the Pixar eye-candy trying to convince me otherwise. There were some gags to be had, a funny turn by Potato Head needing to use real vegetables, some thin and obvious (but still humorous) banter between Barbie and Ken and the now required shtick of Buzz Lightyear getting reset to various memory-wiped settings... but in general the middle 60 minutes of the film just seemed oddly disconnected from the rest. The end result was an odd sandwich effect, with the bread on either end actually being much more enjoyable then the meat in the middle.<br/><br/>While I'm certainly not trying to slag the movie, I don't think 7/10 is anything approaching a hatchet job, I found this one to be clearly a level below the two films that preceded it. Pixar didn't waste the magic they built up with TS1 / TS2... but they certainly didn't expand on it either."
"callmebond","10","7","10","30 June 2010"," It's an emotional roller coaster ride.
","I wasn't really of a fan of Toy Story 1 and 2 though it became a part of my childhood. So after 11 years; and the hype that it gets from my friends, I decided to give this one a try. I came to see it with low expectations. It turned out to be a really, really good movie. Even the short film before it, Day and Night, complemented the movie very well. It was visually amazing. Also, it has a great story. The 'old'characters were still lovable as well as the new ones. Barbie and Ken were great addition to the series. Big Baby was a bit scary though. Many scenes made the crowd inside the cinema laugh real hard but there were also those scenes that silence covered the entire room and sobs were the only sound that can be heard. The ending is very sad. It's so sad that it really had me crying on my seat. Just imagine, I'm an 18 yr old college guy and it had me crying like a baby. Well, it didn't embarrass me at all because when I turned around, people were crying too. So it turned out that I'm not the only one. That scene was just so perfect, with the right timing of music and the proper execution of emotions on the characters' faces, it's just so right. So for the last installment of, I must say, the well loved series, it is indeed the best. With the right amount of laughter, thrill, and tears, it is totally an emotional roller coaster ride. :)"
"sundaefires","10","8","12","25 June 2010"," Triple the fun. Triple the excitement. Triple the tears.
","A decade after the second film comes Toy Story 3 which I found exciting as well as heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Just by reading the plot, I know this movie will be too emotional since I'm going to college like Andy and like him I pretty much outgrown my toys and never played with them.<br/><br/>What if toys have feelings? We don't know, but TS3 creates this simple idea into a massive hit. First off, the characters, they are so well done, from animation to characterization. No one is missed out.<br/><br/>Now Andy is 17 and he's off to college, the toys are faced with a very hard situation, Andy is leaving, what will be left of them? Feeling they are being outgrown by Andy, the toys planned many things to get noticed i.e. they stole his phone, puts it into the toy box where they are then calls it but no avail. Mishaps ensues when they are all mistaken as a garbage headed into the dump, the toys realized that they are not significant for Andy except for Woody and decides to go into the SunnySide Daycare.<br/><br/>SunnySide is a perfect place, they will be never forgotten, there are nonstop supply of kids that will play with them. Lotso, a fluffy, cute, pink bear is the leader of the SunnySide, he's a wolf on a sheep's clothing. <br/><br/>The new characters are a great surprise, we got Lotso, Ken, Buttercup, Trixie and much much more. The appearances and disappearances of characters were quite good, this film tends to focus on the principal characters more thus removing Bo Peep, Wheezy and the other toys into the story, which I found amusing and heartbreaking since the toys on Andy's room decreased terribly.<br/><br/>As the characters realized Andy's searching for them they plan an escape after Lotso and his troop imprisons them. It's a series of mishaps, solidarity and nonstop emotion as we follow our characters back into their lovable owner.<br/><br/>Story is quite good, simple but priceless, this is just not a movie about toys, it's about the relationship with it's owners. I loved how the toys feels so nurtured by Andy that they will do anything to get back to him, even though it will take their life, especially on the incinerator scene which got me into tears, I felt a sudden wave of loneliness when the toys gave up and hold each hands where a large fire is in front of them and I will not gave away what happened after this but they got saved.<br/><br/>The last part of the movie is where it really got me, Andy's passing of torch to a little girl named Bonnie. Here, we see Andy flinch for giving Woody away, the line ""He'll never give up on you"" is so heartwarming, we can see in Woody face (even though he's in freeze) that he's choking into tears.<br/><br/>Andy driving away is the greatest shot of the movie, below we see his toys staring at him as he gets away, it's so bittersweet, it just doesn't tug a string in my heart but punched a big hole out of it. Woody and the gang is not maybe mine but Pixar made me feel they were, this movie is a big part of my childhood, as the credits roll you will realized this is the ending of your childhood and you have to move on... as what the toys and Andy did.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is breathtaking, guaranteed to make you cry or laugh from start to finish."
"tarek-elghazaly-md","10","9","14","22 June 2010"," Easily, this is animation movie making at its finest, by a wide margin.
","I walked into this movie with high expectations, and this is usually a mistake. Not with TS3 it wasn't. Toy Story 3 was incredible, to put it in one word. Who would have known I would cry the most in Toy Story 3, more than I did in Any.Other.Movie -animation or not. It was just THAT engaging. It took me back to my childhood, and made me yearn for my Supermen models. It was very ""realistic"", which I know is an unusual way of describing an animation movie about living toys, but that's what it was. Incredible story, music, moments... everything.

","Sequels by definition mean very different things to very different people. Sequels are met with sighs, gasps, cheers, dollar signs and more than often ""wtf?"" This is because sequels notoriously never quite (or at all) live up to their originals, it is a sad fact that some of your favourite films have more than likely be ruined by inferior siblings. Films such as Speed 2: Cruise Control and Ocean's Twelve spring to mind as two films that we could all do without ever seeing and no doubt omitted from numerous stars résumés. The secret lies in recreating the magic that made the 1st film such a hit and for many directors, writers and studios it is something they all too frequently fail to achieve. There are exceptions to the rules, as ever, and every so often sequels manage to muster together enough cinema gold and give birth to a sequel that is on par with its older sibling and on that rare special occasion a sequel that I dare say is better than its predecessor. Films such Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Aliens, Clerks 2 and X2, have all shown that sequels can be just as good or even better than their originals. Further down the line the dreaded threequel and numerous non-direct sequels plague the video-store shelves covered in dust and outlandish quotes engraved on the cover claiming to be ""better than the original"" or ""if you loved Mega Piranha, you are going to love this"". They are an inevitable evil in this world that tarnish the name of its forbearer that we must live with, Shrek The Third, Spider-Man 3, Stars Wars: The Phantom (JarJarYouAlmostRuinedStarWarsBinks) Menace, The Godfather 3, Alien Resurrection etc, a horrible list that goes on and on. Which brings me somewhat fittingly to the matter of Toy Story 3, a sequel, a threequel , so is it any good? Rather simply no, to call Toy Story 3 simply good would be both an insult to Pixar and every 20-something who 1st watched Toy Story 15 year ago because Story isn't good it's brilliant.<br/><br/>11 days is a fairly long time, 11 months is almost a year and 11 years seems like a eternity for some but that's how long it has been since Toy Story 2 graced our silver screens. In those 11 years gone Pixar have released no fewer than 7 films, in which we have seen superheroes, cars, monsters, rats, a flying house, fish and a very special robot light up our picture houses but not since 1999 have we seen the return of Toys until now. Initially my reaction was ""oh no, they are going to ruin Toy Story"" but then I reassured myself with the notion that this is a Pixar film after all, and while I will admit that I am not a huge fan of Cars, Pixar are pretty much 10 for 10. Furthermore we only have to look at Toy Story 2 and see that lightning can strike twice in the same place, and if anyone was going to make lightning strike for a 3rd time it would be Pixar.<br/><br/>What you have to admire immediately about Toy Story 3 is just how accessible it is to both devoted followers now in their twenties and the new generation of booster seat lovers. Moreover how the parents are the ones that are dragging their kids and not vice versa, as trust me I think I can safely say that I will not lose any sleep over missing Shrek The Incontinent come its premiere in 2022. Toy Story 3 picks up with the gang minus a few members in the same bedroom that we met them in 15 years ago but now resigned to the toy chest. Andy is all grown up and off to college soon, the bedroom we once knew is now a distant memory and now that of a teenage boy. During the clear out of his room ,Andy comes upon the toys he adored so much as a child and is met with a difficult decision of what should become of the toys, attic or rubbish? But of course things don't go to plan and the toys wind up at a day-care and in true Toy Story fashion it is up to Woody to convince the gang that they don't belong there and need to return to Andy before he heads off to college.<br/><br/>While the story may feel familiar, as you may remember in Toy Story 2 the gang were trying to make their way back to Andy after Woody was mistakenly picked up at a garage sale, it doesn't feel old or rehashed one bit. Written by Pixar genius John Lasseter and Wall-E director Andrew Stanton, the series regulars appear to be both new and refreshing while instantly familiar as if they had never left us all. Woody is still loyal as ever to Andy despite being neglected for some time now, Mr and Mrs Potato Head still fighting like a newlywed couple, Hamm sarcastic as ever and Jessie still showing signs of a underlining fear of neglect. In which lies Toy Story's emotional core, the themes of friendship, loss and moving on. Whether we like to admit it or not we don't like change, we get used to things the way they are and when that changes, it's sometimes hard to admit that a change has occurred. Woody has always had a issue with change, ever since Buzz turned up on Andy's bed and that fear of change still carries weight throughout Toy Story 3 as Woody tries to convince himself and the group that they need to get back to Andy<br/><br/>*** Head over to www.dvdisdead.co.uk to read the rest of the review ***"
"Polaris_DiB","10","4","5","9 July 2010"," We've faced replacement and we've faced neglect--now on to death
","This is now officially one of the most qualitative franchises I can think of, and a Toy Story 4 of even half the quality would send this right to the top past the Alien Quadrilogy. The storytelling is brisk, the animation is beautiful, the scenes range from funny to disturbing to terrifying to heartwarming to outright tear-inducing. The garbage combustion scene alone is bound to give children nightmares, but Buzz bustin' out the flamenco is more than enough to keep this one fun for the whole family. What I like best is that they manage to keep to the spirit, look, and characters of the other movies while still amping up showmanship and surprises, storytelling and subthemes.<br/><br/>That said, this movie follows the same essentail formula as Toy Story 2, including having a roughly similar turn-out for the villain of the picture, and the ending pretty much sets us back at point one so that this can just continue on and on. These movies are, essentially, all about limited time and limited life, these characters all know one day the end will come, but of course the audience knows that it won't, at least during the movie that they're watching. So even though I trust Pixar enough to go to see Toy Story 4, if it ever exists, right here would be a very good place to end. After all, the first is about surviving replacement, the second about surviving aging, and the third about surviving the afterlife (I would say that the daycare center stands in for Purgatory and, well, the inferno for Inferno quite well), so any more existential worries about the end of the toys given time would probably be repetitive--best to start thinking about other adventures they could possibly go on, or settling on the score while it's still high.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

Pixar have continued to provide epic film after epic film, but this will be their very best, along side the second Toy Story."

","toy story 3 was an awesome movie. i loved it it was a bitter sweet story at the end. when i was little i loved toy story then i was hoping for another and in 1999 Pixar did it! then i thought there could be another but i lost hope for it. 11 years later i found out and was ready to see it. i loved it tied in with the whole story. and had more action than the first two! nothing negative to say it was the best. the end was sad but yet happy. how Andy played with his toys one last time. and how he knew his toys were alive. 10 stars! loved it. this is for sure the final toy story. great ending. they closed the movie just right. like i said bitter sweet."
"dadrifter-1","10","4","5","21 June 2010"," Simply Amazing
","I watched Toy Story 3 on its midnight premiere. It was great to have the crowd behind the characters, but also the story was really fun and emotional. It also helped that I have grown up with these characters (literally) the first one came out around the same time I was Andy's age and 1999- toy story 2 was 8. Now 10 years later the character Andy and I are both graduating, I always thought that was cool that pixar progressed his age, sorry for digressing. But anyways this movie is amazing, it breaks all the flaws of a second sequel a complete rarity. First most all the characters and voice overs come back except for slinky who sadly passed away but his friend voiced this one but its spot on, also there is explanation as to the whereabouts of the other toys that we do not see, bo beep, etch a sketch, and squeak. Leaving no apparent plot wholes. The story also progresses at a good pace, and makes you feel like a kid again, rooting for the characters every step of the way, it makes you hope that at the time of the movie your old toys are conversing waiting for you to play with them. Very nostalgic in that sense, I don't think at all that this was just a venture for Pixar to make more money, because the movie it so great! oh and all you Miyazaki fans, TOTORO has a cameo*!!!! Fantastic movie!"

","Pixar never ceases to amaze me. The Toy story franchise was destined for greatness from the beginning, and this third installment in the series lives up to its predecessors.<br/><br/>I went into the theater with high expectations and hopes that it would be what I believed. My hopes were exceeded in the first few minutes of the film as my emotions were taken on a ride of crests and troughs throughout the entire experience.<br/><br/>Not only that, but Pixar somehow managed to slip brand new characters into the plot so seamlessly that if you had never seen the two previous movies, you would have guessed that they had been around for the whole trilogy. I was in shock to see the third movie in a series perform better than any threequel I've ever seen. It even rivals the first two.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend that you do. All ages are allowed at this cinematic occasion and all ages can enjoy it."
"MartinHafer","8","7","11","26 June 2010"," Technically brilliant and enjoyable but it still left me a bit flat.
","You should by all means see this film--it is quite enjoyable and Pixar should be proud. And, a week after its debut, the film has earned $2138123413713471035 dollars (more or less)--so it's obviously a huge hit. And, I did enjoy the film....BUT. There's that nagging 'but'...a certain odd something that I felt was lacking in the film. Personally, I STILL prefer ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Up"". I also am a bit concerned whether this is the best film for the youngest members of the audience.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, this is probably the best looking CG movie made to this point--though I am sure in the next few years they'll manage to exceed this one--that's the nature of things. There are so many scenes where you just marvel at all the elements--there is just so much to see and your eyes just delight in this. One of the examples are the amazing daycare scenes--with so many toys, kids and knick-knacks about the rooms, you can't believe the Pixar folks could do it! The other is is the scene at Bonnie's yard at the end of the film--the colors, textures and depth were just mind-blowing. It was first-rate in just about every way technically, though the 3-D aspects were very good but not great. Yes, they looked nice but they weren't 100% necessary to the film and didn't seem to use e 3-D to its fullest (like they did in ""How To Train Your Dragon""--a film that did manage to use the 3-D as more than just a nice novelty).<br/><br/>As for the plot, I really don't want to recapitulate what's in the film. There have already been a ton of IMDb reviews that have done a very good job of detailing the plot. Instead, let's talk about I think this was actually a bit weak. Sure, the old characters were mostly back and I loved a few of the new ones (Ken was great), but the film had a dark and slightly unsavory element to it that bothered me. A lot of families would naturally bring kids to see it--kids too young not to be terrified. While another recent CG movie was terrifying (""Coraline""), as least it was not rated G and did not have the family-friendly aura about it. In this films, the problems were not like they were in ""Toy Story 2""--whether or not the toys could make it home. Here in ""3"", they not only struggled with this but also were often in jeopardy of being completely destroyed--either shredded or incinerated!! Also, while they didn't bother me at all, a couple of the new characters were downright creepy--such as the baby and the crazed monkey! Yikes--imagining a 3 or 4 year-old seeing this makes my skin crawl! Aside from these concerns, I have to hand it to the film. It was highly manipulative and will make you shed a tear--even if they are only toys! And, it certainly was lovely--real eye-candy!<br/><br/>UPDATE: This film just won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. In addition, it's now #31 on IMDb's Top 250. Considering it's a sequel, I just don't get this...."
"maloned","9","7","11","24 June 2010"," I love you Pixar
","Those guys at Pixar know how to tell a story! These characters will live in our hearts forever! They really know how to tug at our hearts.<br/><br/>This is more ramblings about the movie then a review.<br/><br/>There are so many movies that can't get me emotionally involved, movies in which I don't care at all about the people whom I'm supposed to be rooting for.<br/><br/>But Pixar knows how to get me. And it's not just a rooting interest, it's a love for characters, a love that hurts. I know I'm not the only one who's fallen in love in Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, Up and most of all in the Toy Story movies.<br/><br/>It's been so long since the first one that the special effects don't distract me in awe of them. The first two movies were so good that the story kept you from being distracted, but I couldn't help but stop and look at how beautiful the animation was. But now that I'm used to it, I was able to just watch the movie.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie wasn't that great. It seemed like rehashed themes from the first two, but the second half of that movie made up for it and much more.<br/><br/>The key to the puzzle of this movie, for me, as a father, was that moment when the mother sees Andy's room empty and realizes that her baby has grown up and he's moving away. That moment captured that whole movie's spirit.<br/><br/>It was time to let go and say goodbye.<br/><br/>Thank you Pixar. I watched 'The Pixar Story' on the Disney Channel this week and after watching Toy Story 3 it makes me so grateful for them. They tell great stories, they make great movies.<br/><br/>Please forgive my spelling and grammar. I am a product of the Miami-Dade Public School System."
"BJBatimdb","10","2","2","12 August 2010"," GREAT movie but too scary for small children
","This movie really has it all - belly-laughs, wonderful animation, sly observation - the list goes on. But it's also extremely frightening in places and I wouldn't want to be the mother of a five year old during - or for several years after - taking it to see this film! There is a real air of threat hanging over our trusty Toys for much of the film, and some genuinely dark and scary villains. Of course, children's films have long been peopled by menacing characters - the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Cruella Deville etc - but the baddies in Toy Story 3 have less of the cartoon and more of the nightmare about them, and I found them quite chilling.<br/><br/>It's also a bit of a tear-jerker on several levels - for adults as well as children! - and if you take children to this one, expect to deal with the fallout of tears and fears for a while afterwards! Also, the movie's 3D version is a big waste of money. The most noticeable thing in 3D was the subtitles, and I wouldn't waste my money on the extra expense of a 3D experience on this one.<br/><br/>Despite all the dire warnings above though, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It was more emotionally involving than any live-action film I've seen this year. It's a very long time since I actually GASPED in a movie! Toy Story 3 is a winner all the way."
"hyperballad13","9","2","2","10 August 2010"," Play Time Comes Alive
","For 16 years the Toy Story franchise has captivated a whole sleuth of generations with two amazing films. In almost two decades, there have been millions of kids rushing back from their schools or quickly opening their bedroom doors after they are gone to double check that their toys are not alive. Toy Story has stood the test of time and has become one of the greatest children films of all time and spurned a fantastic sequel. But how do you top that? Can Toy Story 3 make this one of the most brilliant trilogies? <br/><br/>Toy Story 3 sets off 11 years after Toy Story 2 with Andy, Woody and Buzz's owner, all grown up and heading for college. The Toy's fate lies in his hands; trash, attic or donated? After a series of bumbling mistakes, the Toys wind up heading for the seemingly perfect Day-care centre, Sunnyside. Sunnyside is ruled by the lovable bear Lots-o. However, all is not what they seem and the toys suffer a terrifying play time with children way below the appropriate age. What seems like a dream quickly turns into a nightmare for the toys as they head the great escape. <br/><br/>Pixar, by now, has learnt each trick into hooking the adults as well as the children and not by turning to subtle dirty humour. What is so wonderful about Toy Story 3 is the experience of childhood that you remember or you are living right now. While we are introduced to so many new characters each one comes with its own quirk that is easily lovable and easily memorable. The quick fire lines don't just appeal to every age; it makes them laugh and chortle. Ken, the doll who has never met a Barbie, is a wonderful inclusion to the Toy Story cast with his vanity, self image but also having a big heart. The villain, without giving anything away, is also reminiscent of Sid and Stinky Pete of the previous films. Not only this but the action is every bit edge of your seat entertainment that left the audience gasping and jumping at every moment. I, for one, will never look at a baby doll in the same way.<br/><br/>The most triumphant part of this piece of cinema is how your heartstrings are tugged in each and every way. From the opening sequence to the credits, I have not wept so much in a movie since Up; another Pixar classic. The story and the sadness is told so beautifully that it probably made a few people think twice about throwing away old toys or replacing those who are lost. <br/><br/>I'm not saying that Toy Story 3 is without flaws. There are times watching where you feel like you had seen it all before with it's predecessors and at some parts the film does becomes predictable. But that is where the classic Pixar genius enters giving enough twists to keep you hooked on till the end. <br/><br/>The Toy Store elite films are delightful and to dismiss them as children's films would be an outrage. I found more shock, love, terror, comedy and intrigue that most ""art"" and ""sophisticated"" films are missing. The greatest trilogy of all time? It would be foolish for me to say. But this is definitely up in the big leagues and will last from infinity and beyond."
"Floated2","9","2","2","10 August 2010"," Great third version of a successful series!
","I've decided to watch toy story 3 because i was a fan of the previous two toy stories and I thought those were really well done and had great stories. Toy Story 3 proves that the third film of a series does not have to be the weakest and that it can sometimes even be the strongest. Toy Story 3 is just as magical as the first two offerings and the quality of the animation is second to none. Now I don't necessarily remember exactly what happens in the previous two toy stories but I remember liking them a lot and how the stories were great. I feel that Toy Story 3 is the best out of the 3. Toy Story was great but the third one does it the best, in my opinion.<br/><br/>All the same toys are back but this time their are new toys (some good, some bad). Unlike the previous toy stories, this one is filled with more frightening scenes and more mature themes. This one is also more darker and some scenes can scare little kids slightly, but that's what makes it great. I was surprised that their were some scenes like that, after reading some comments from critics and reviews. This movie isn't really for young children but it all depends on their views. The finals scene was a great way to end the series and movie Overall Toy Story 3 is a fantastic film filled with magic moments, strong characters and visuals that only Pixar can produce. Amazing job"
"Capo-idFilm","Null","2","2","9 August 2010"," Pixar's most openly adult film
","If 1999's Toy Story 2 presented to Pixar the novelty of creating its first sequel, and an opportunity to both extend a world and expand upon characters already familiar to us, its follow-up brings to a fitting close the narrative cycle first begun in 1995.<br/><br/>Each of the Toy Story films have dealt with an established order, of sorts, which is abruptly upset or invaded. The first film saw Woody, a toy cowboy, having to deal with and overcome personal jealousy of new addition and possible favourite, spaceman Buzz Lightyear; the second film, fresh from the resolution of the first, has Buzz and the rest of the gang embark upon the dangerous mission to rescue their cowboy leader from an opportunistic collector; now, the third instalment's central narrative premise is altogether more grave: the toys, excluding Woody, are to be abandoned by their owner Andy, who has now outgrown them and is about to leave home for college.<br/><br/>The dilemma is immediately existential, and perhaps marks Toy Story 3 as Pixar's most overtly adult film yet. Here we have a gang of characters requiring no introduction, whose history and evolution are already known to us, and the entire concept of their newest adventure is openly traumatic: the long-deferred reality of rejection – not only rejection, but an entire loss of purpose.<br/><br/>If mortality is writ large here, though, it's in quotation marks. As in Pixar's other statement of enviro-happy conscientiousness WALL·E (2008), there's a strong case for preservation and recycling here. Just as the first film had Andy accept both his new hi-tech astronaut and his dustier ranchman, here the toys' initial dismay at being deemed outmoded is replaced by joyous anticipation that they are to be donated to a local daycare centre where they will be played with again – for the first time in years.<br/><br/>From here, the plot splits in two. Woody, Andy's sole selection for the trip to college, finds himself wrongly placed in the donation box with the rest of the gang and vows to make the trip back to his lifelong residence at all costs; the others, meanwhile, are happy to have found themselves in a daycare that looks infinitely more promising than the horror stories suggested.<br/><br/>That early promise is quickly thwarted. There's a delightful moment when Buzz notices all too late that the toys' collective excitement is in deep contrast to the other daycare veterans, who are hiding themselves away on, beneath and behind shelves, as a bell rings and riotous children re-enter the play-den to attack anything in sight. As a staccato of ghastly discord sounds relentless alarm, there's a dark, sinister edge to this humour that is magnified by Woody's naivety unfolding elsewhere.<br/><br/>There is an obvious self-reflexivity at the centre of the film. Absolutely distraught by the violence they've had to endure on their first day at daycare, Buzz and the gang insist these children are ""too young"" to know how to respect toys of their ilk. It's a statement that quite easily applies to the film itself, the third in what is now a 15-year old trilogy. Indeed, if the second Toy Story film came soon enough after its predecessor for fans to be young enough to remember the original and enjoy the sequel in equal measure, the third is some eleven years in the making, so to speak.<br/><br/>In this respect, the film has allowed the Pixar collective to return to their roots if only to mark, perhaps, a more open and accessible confirmation of what many already knew after the brave and subtle excellence of Ratatouille (2007), WALL·E and Up (2009): these are children's films for advertisement purposes only; in all others, there's a sincere artistic seriousness at work.<br/><br/>Similarly, perhaps because of our familiarity with this world and its characters (whereas the same strengths in more novel pieces may get overlooked), Toy Story 3 demonstrates why Pixar are at present the leading storytellers in mainstream animation bar none. Not only does the film show the usual fine attention to visual nuance – note the marks of dirt on seasoned daycare vet Lotso – there's a careful and thorough approach to set-piece invention.<br/><br/>What should be a fairly obvious part of the film-making process, such as how a shot is framed or when a scene should be cut, seems to be made effortlessly simple by Pixar to the point at which you realise just where a lot of the competition goes wrong. The rhythm and relative brevity with which the toys execute their escape from daycare, for instance, is a delight to watch. Or note the self-damning observations of the toy soldiers who unquestionably accept their early fate as the ""first ones to go"" whenever an ominous trash bag appears. Or the simple but seemingly inherent hilarity of juxtaposing glum clown Mr. Chuckles with a happier memory of himself. Or the quiet satisfaction of Mrs. Potato Head finally being re-acquainted with her lost eye. All three Toy Story films show a relish in such amusing detail and character investment.<br/><br/>http://www.idfilm.blogspot.com ||| http://www.idfilm.proboards.com"

"DarthVoorhees","9","2","2","12 July 2010"," There is nothing 'kiddy' about this universally great film.
","I was the ripe demographic for the original 'Toy Story' when it came out. I remember seeing it as a kid for the first time and it was a magnificent experience. The animation was of course stellar but the film had heart. In some ways I feel the 3rd entry of this brilliant trilogy is more for me than it is for younger viewers. In many ways it is the perfect conclusion to this story. What I loved about the film was that it acknowledges the journey our characters went on. In many ways I did emotionally invest myself with Buzz and Woody more so than I'd like to admit. I have to hand it to Pixar, their films really deal with classic themes. Sure films like 'Toy Story' and 'Up' look pretty and colorful to kids but they deal with emotions that adults have trouble grasping.<br/><br/>The setting of the movie is brilliant and is able to add a lot of great humor. The toys are given an opportunity to go to a Day care center and be played with. They are ecstatic but soon find out that their new home isn't all that it is cracked up to be. Lotso, a stuffed bear, runs the center like a dictator. The lesser toys are left to the mercy of the toddlers. In many ways Lotso is the best villain in the series. He is a toy who was replaced. The character is fleshed out and at times has moments where he is very intimidating, although the punishments are very comical to the viewer. The debate about age approriateness had me in stitches.<br/><br/>'Toy Story 3' is about the loss of innocence and the end of childhood. Dark stuff for a Disney film. Our pals Woody and Buzz have laid in a toy box as Andy has grown up with out them. The toys fear their fate, either a trip to the attic or worse the dump. I like the fact that the film begins on a bleak note. We are already given reason to fear this fate. The memories of Toy Story 2's subplot are fresh in our head. Kids are fickle as they turn into teens. Woody is especially in turmoil, his love for Andy is as strong as it ever was. Woody is the personification of that innocence and childhood. The scenes Andy has with Woody are brilliant.Woody is forced with a dilemma, rescue his friends or miss out on Andy taking his next step in life. The finale of the film is one of the most powerful moments in Disney's long history and really ranks up there with some of their best films. The kids may not appreciate it but the adults will be in tears."
"imdb2-556-923983","10","2","2","12 July 2010"," Pixar pulled it off yet again
","Let me start off by saying that I am not a fan of sequels. Never have been. The idea of squeezing a few more bucks out of people by rehashing a successful title, I find despicable. Even though I am a Pixar fan, I thought ""Toy Story 2"" was their weakest release to-date. But THIS movie, well, this is a work of art on its own right. Calling it a sequel is like saying that ""Wicked"" is a prequel to The Wizard of Oz. The love to the characters and the story shines through every scene, and the emotions the movie invokes are genuine: you will laugh, you will cry, and you will sometimes do the two simultaneously. The folks at Pixar continue to amaze me by topping both their CGI abilities and their storytelling abilities each and every time. Here, CGI highlights include clutter, voluminous light and fire effects. (When I watched James Cameron's Avatar I distinctly recall thinking ""well, they've got the water, fabric and skin right. I guess we'll have to wait until Pixar makes a fire movie in order to see realistic CGI flames..."") Clutter we already saw much of in Wall-E, and other stuff (fur, facial expressions, gravity, wind, etc.) that Pixar pioneered in earlier films now take their places in the background, making the world of ""Toy Story 3"" much more real and large than in earlier movies, without upstaging anything.<br/><br/>I will not go into the storytelling for fear of spoiling any surprises, but I will say this: it is good. Humor, action, relationships, story, pacing - everything finds its place here, and even though one would rightfully say that parts of the plot have been rehashed from earlier Toy Story movies, Pixar did take (as it always does) some risks with the plot, and these risks paid off: the story comes together better than ever.<br/><br/>Pixar returns to its roots here. The movie, tone-wise, is far from Pixar's latest installments, but in this return to the roots Pixar continues to show that it did not lose its mastery in the art of animation storytelling. The CGI, spectacular though it is, does not serve as an excuse for making a ""like live-action only animated"" movie. Every character - from Ken the doll to Slinky Dog - is explored for its graphic/physical potential and how this reflects its own emotionality and its relationship with the other characters. In short: an animator's dream.<br/><br/>I had lots of fun watching this movie. It's been a while since I've been able to say that.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up from me. I don't know how Pixar does it every time, but the folks there certainly pulled it off yet again, setting a new bar for all others to gawk at and envy."
"Eternality","9","2","2","11 July 2010"," Unkrich takes rein and flies the Pixar flag with confidence and conviction.
","At the end of my review of Toy Story 2 (1999), I challenged Pixar to ""convince us (with Toy Story 3)that we have been frozen in carbonite all these years, that we haven't really aged at all."" I am extremely delighted to say that Pixar has done it again. Director Lee Unkrich takes rein and flies the Pixar flag with confidence and conviction. The co-director of Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc. (2001) and Finding Nemo (2003), Unkrich finally proves that he has what it takes to be fully in charge of a Pixar picture.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3, I would guess, is the last installment of a very remarkable trilogy, which in modern cinema, is perhaps only bettered by Peter Jackson's action-fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003). Its success also breaks the ""curse of the third film"" that has plagued popular series such as Spiderman, The Matrix, Pirates of the Caribbean, and maybe even Shrek. Pixar's eleventh straight box-office hit, Toy Story 3 is the epitome of consistency, not only for the famed animation studio, but for animation cinema as well.<br/><br/>If there is a minor blip, Toy Story 3 is the least original in the series. Visually, it is arguably the most creative. But plot-wise, it copies the structure of its direct prequel. An action-packed prologue in which the toy character(s) live out their (or their owner's) fantasy? Check. Meeting of new toys in which one of them appears to be kind but is actually wicked? Check. A flashback sequence that details the fate of a toy? Check. Indiana Jonesque action and adventure in another great escape? Check.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is still very entertaining to see Woody and co. pick up from where they left off eleven years ago. They have not lost any character trait, nor our love for them diminished over the years. The story goes like this: Andy is all grown up and going to college soon. The toys fear that they will become unwanted and unloved. They are then accidentally donated to a day-care center, to their delight of course, where children could play with them. Their enjoyment turns into horror when they realize that at night, the center becomes a prison controlled by a gang of ""veteran toys"".<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is less funny (dialogue-wise), has less film references, but hits the jackpot with great character interplay, of which the most memorable ones include that of Buzz and Jessie, and Barbie and Ken, most of them of a romantic nature. Many of the action set-pieces are thrilling (and sometimes frightening) including one involving a garbage incinerator in which the fear of death brings a collective sense of identity that has never been exhibited to such a heart-wrenching extent in a Pixar film.<br/><br/>Unkrich leaves the very best for the last. The final act is touching, with enough emotional resonance to warm even the coldest heart. The younger viewers in which the film is targeted at may not be old enough to appreciate the nuances. But adults who tag along with them, and children who grew up with Toy Story (many of whom are now slightly older than Andy) will find tears in their eyes as they recollect memories of childhood that now look like a distant afterthought. Suffice to say, Toy Story 3 is a definite shoo-in for one of the top ten films of 2010.<br/><br/>SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","Toy Story 3 – Firstly to begin with the animation in this film was the best yet, Pixar have done it yet again. It never ceases to amaze me the realistic animation that is available these days. Now the storyline was about Andy going away to college and deciding what to do with his old toys (Woody, Buzz e.t.c), he decides to put them in the attic. Then accidentally he leaves the bag of toys on the floor. His mum then picks them up thinking that they are trash. They somehow manage to get out of the bag and they end up in a box off to Sunnyside daycare centre. At first the toys think this is great and they are in a safe place. Woody is the only one to say that he believes that Andy didn't want to get rid of them and only wanted them in the attic. By the way Woody had been chosen by Andy to go to college. So then the toys try to escape from Sunnyside, in turn trying to get back to Andy. That is the basic plot. Now this is a great film for say age 3 and up, basically for the whole family. You will love the animation. The characters will capture and break your heart again, and it's just so much damn fun. I loved this film, it bought me back to my childhood, and reminded me how much I loved movies, and when I loved to play with my toys. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. I already strongly recommend the academy to consider it for best picture at the Oscars in February 2011."
"CA_movie_fan","10","27","59","12 June 2010"," A worthy completion of a classic trilogy
","I went to the San Francisco Film Festival screening at Pixar Studios last night not really knowing what to expect. Toy Story has been with us for 15 years now (20, in terms of actual development) and I had a sinking feeling that maybe all the character potential had been used in the first two and this was some shameless plot by Disney to exploit the franchise (""Little Mermaid 2"", anyone?). Well, shame on me for underestimating the capabilities of Pixar, who once again have shown how a small studio in Emeryville is a storytelling powerhouse that leaves the rest of the industry in the dust.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is the tale of Andy, the toys' owner, going to college and their quest to determine their future - headed between the attic or a daycare center. If you've enjoyed the way the first two films blend character drama with innovative action and humor, this cocktail hits its stride in the third film, which draws on everything we already know about the characters and then adds two new entire sets of toys to the plot. There's a new villain, two very amusing romance sub-plots and a litany of visual gags that push the envelope even further. I'm not allowed to go into any details but the second half of the film is a familiar set piece performed in a completely new way that will forever change your view of certain toys and day care centers.<br/><br/>Apart from a level of animation that sets the bar in the industry and an attention to detail that makes you wonder what most ""real"" films actually do in pre-production, the real genius of the third film is to provide a satisfying conclusion that gives every character a completed character arc. About 20 minutes before the end, I was wondering how they would do this since there were some fairly dark moments (similar to those in Wall-E and Up), but naturally they manage to pull it together. There's literally not a single wasted shot, let alone a wasted scene, and the pace quickens throughout to keep the tension mounting.<br/><br/>Overall, this is another Pixar classic that easily has enough for both kids and adults (and movie aficionados). It's not difficult to see why each of their movies takes five years to complete - yet despite the technical wizardry, the success of their movies is fundamentally routed in their stories, a fact which most other studios seem to forget these days. As to whether the stage is set for Toy Story 4, I suppose they could always pull it off given the creativity at work here, but I think there was a deliberate attempt to make this the last in the series."

But the chase and the movie as a whole was a lot of fun, capped off by some fun Randy Newman songs.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 2"" was an even better movie, because it added an interesting ingredient to the soup: An acknowledgment of death. The sequence where Jessie laments how her life lost its meaning when her owner grew up is truly heart breaking. And the final spoken lines of dialogue, referencing Buzz's catch phrase ""To infinity and beyond,"" but placing the phrase in the context of death itself was a masterstroke. Adding these dark elements in select moments elevated the movie into something special.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" makes the mistake of taking those select moments and turning them into the WHOLE MOVIE. The stink of death, loss and alienation is as prevalent here as a Beckett play. The story of Lotso's grim rejection by his owner and his subsequent change to a dark, Nazi-like dictator poisons the fun. (What, no up tempo Randy Newman song about that?) And the depiction of Ken as a gay stereotype was offensive, and future generations will squirm at those moments, like they do today over the racist depiction of Asians in ""Breakfast at Tiffanies."" (The Pixar films would never take a black or Jewish toy and make them act in a stereotypical fashion, but I guess gays are fair game.) As with most sequels, character growth is mostly zero. The characters have done all their growing in the earlier segments, and so they spend the movie mostly running around, learning nothing, never growing. Woody comes off as absurdly delusional in his belief that the best thing for him and the others is to sit in a plastic bag in an attic for decades until such time as maybe Andy wants his children to play with them.<br/><br/>But life at the daycare center is another form of hell. The film strives to depict the toy's plight as a parody of a prison film, but ends up evoking the holocaust and Nazi concentration camps. The tyranny, torture (yes, torture) and betrayals the toys face in the day care center are dark and awful, but still pale in comparison to the act three climax. Here, we have the pleasure of watching our heroes in a trash compactor, facing an almost certain death in an oven, to be burned alive. Again, one can't help but think of the holocaust and how the victims there were burned in ovens.<br/><br/>But it all ends happily. The characters are saved and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Or do they? For a film that shows such craft in its writing and such subtlety in its characterizations, the final fifteen minutes of the film are mind boggling inconsistent with what has come before. It begins with the claw, that rescues its characters, God-like, from their peril. Up until now, God-like interventions had been non-existent. These characters always had the ingenuity to get themselves out of jams, but suddenly not here.<br/><br/>In the scenes that follow, Andy suddenly loves his toys. And life at the daycare is a toy utopia. (Remember that the only change is that Lotso is gone. I guess he took all the evil with him when he left.) The final image of the film is the sky, with a series of similar looking clouds. Seem familiar? It's the same clouds as the wallpaper in Andy's room. The characters have found themselves, post-fire, in a happy but manufactured world. Conclusion: They died in the fire and this is heaven. I'm happy for them, because sitting through this movie, I felt like I was in hell."

","You go to hear Steve Jobs at one of his Keynote addresses not because you worship the man. It is because you want to be a part of history. You want to be present at the moment that in the future people will say that the world changed. Jobs is a revolutionary; always was. Always will be.<br/><br/>His whole approach is based on advancing, advancing, even if he ends up cannibalizing his own market. This is why no one can really compete, because there has to be a fearlessness to do the new. Pixar was like that, and it is why I cherished their projects. Oh, they used good old story engineering. And they were quite happy to pander to simple established emotional responses. But in every film they did two things which kept me coming back. You might call it the Orson Welles model:<br/><br/>— advance the cinematic vocabulary so that the narrative has fresh power.<br/><br/>— support a narrative that itself is new, that does not rely on genre conventions, so that it can hook to the cinema rather than the memory.<br/><br/>Well, folks, Pixar might be dead as a force in film. This movie is a disaster. Oh, it is polished enough. It has that Pixar sheen. It is profoundly effective in making you cry at the endearing new character, Daisy. But it has no new visual ideas in it. None. None at all, the first Pixar project of which this can be said. I will point you to the texture of the shredded garbage toward the end and its luminescence which is novel. But this is merely a software advance that isn't leveraged. No. After giving us a new set of camera conventions every bit as influential as Hitchcock's, they have stopped. <br/><br/>Disney? The ""just a manufactured product"" mentality? I guess.<br/><br/>Oh, and the story. I will grant you that this story is superficially like the others. But look more closely. In the past, they have been scrupulously original. They would never, never have sullied a story by asking you to refer to another movie — excepting other Pixar movies of course. Let other, lessor studios do that, seemed to be their stance. So while it is okay for ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Afric"" to be made entirely of references to other films, Pixar stories connected because they connected with your emotions without a film memory as intermediary.<br/><br/>But what do we have here? The central element is the big escape, and a half dozen movies are trotted out. Sure, we get it and it is even a fun thing. But it is not pure storytelling, not of the kind we expected. <br/><br/>Don't go to this if you do not want your heart broken. They have grown up and gone to college, and have left their imagination at home.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"djansen24","6","13","26","13 November 2010"," Good movie, but the first time I have been disappointed by Pixar.
","Toy Story 3. Stunningly animated. Clever. Funny. Technically innovative....DARK.... I was indeed shocked by how dark this movie was. And it is probably being marketed to little kids which would be shameful since this movie left me feeling tired and down instead of the usual exhilarated experience I have with Pixar films. It is not a little children's movie. No kid under 7 should see it unless they have already been jaded by watching stuff too mature for them. It seems as if the producers were aiming their script at the audience that saw Toy Story 1 when it first came out 12 years ago in theaters. Because it is too perverse for today's children. It is a brilliantly edited and filmed technical achievement which has a lot of laughs, but there is an undercurrent of tragedy, hurt, and despair that runs through the lifeblood of this picture. It is unnecessarily cruel with some of its back-stories and comeuppances. The very ending and end credits are delightful and touching, but they feel like cool water sprinkled on ashes that have burned way too long. Too late... <br/><br/>The thing that made the first and especially the second movie so great was the insights into Child/Toy relationships. That made for a touching and beautiful experience amid the fun action. This movie offers no new light on that, but brings the Toy Story trilogy to a fine close at the end. But what an ordeal to get there. I feel Pixar was trying to outdo itself with the effects and action. They could have closed the trilogy off much more simply. Here's where I feel they went too far: <br/><br/>1. Characters who were too perverse. A big baby doll who acts as a bruiser. Would have been great if they gave baby a tough guy voice. That would have been funny. The baby voice made the whole character too perverse. Also the Monkey doll at the security booth was drawn way too creepy. Sid from Toy Story 1 was a great villain. Dark, but not too much. Just right. They wanted to make Sunnyside a bad place and they did it too well.<br/><br/>2. Way too much action, and done with a sense of despair. Having the toys in this movie all clasping their hands resigned to being melted in a trash incinerator did not leave me on the edge of my seat. It made me depressed. Lotso breaking the heart necklace, again, much too cruel.<br/><br/>3. Why not redeem Lotso? That would have been logical and would have eliminated the scene in the incinerator. Lotso didn't need to have his comeuppance. <br/><br/>Toy Story 3 taken on its own terms is a very well made movie and has moments of brilliance, but it is no way a little kids movie and it is a shock when compared to the charm of the first 2. Though still keeping it's high standard for quality, Pixar really let me down on this one."

","Okay this is Toy Story 3. The film everyone says that they liked, they say it was the Citizen Kane of animated films. And I'm just going to say, I don't get it. The main problem with the movie is it's just unpleasant. How did this get a G rating. I'd love to get somebody, anybody, from the MPAA to say maybe, just maybe, we should have given it PG! I mean that there is no fun in this film. But my review will be in obvious contrast to the others because I think it's bad. Well, it is. Granted it some good moments but it was just dark and unpleasant. Cars 2 get's hated while I like it. This get's liked while I hate it. Cars 2 get's hated because they say it was so much darker than the 1st. But this is twice as violent. Granted the last 2 films weren't all whimsical but in the last two did you see the toys getting tortured?! No! This simply does not happen! When did ""You've got a friend in me,"" turn into ""Burn alive, burn until you rot in hell!"" When did that happen?! Is there something I missed in the last 2? Do I have an abridged DVD? Somebody tell me when the last 2 films were as dark as this! I'm sorry but this film is horrible! I still don't understand why so many people liked it.

Romance, action, drama, comedy (I cant stress how much I laughed during this movie), and suspense. <br/><br/>This movie did not let me down, I will tell you that. I did not like how they wrote out Toy Story 1 characters such as Bo peep and RC. However, Buzz's Spanish mode overcompensates. His facial expressions and poses were priceless! I would definitely watch this movie again not for just Spanish Buzz (even though this is good enough reason to), but for the little details that I may have overlooked the first time.

May not be as good as the first one but I feel it's better than the 2nd one. For it's story it's surprising to see such a great introduction for each new character and for each one to have a unique personality, that stays true to the franchise, such a richly scripted movie. If there's a company that really knows how to do good animated films it's Pixar.<br/><br/>Such good and fascinating animation and story, making this the best animated film of the year. With a great ending that made me tear a little but it's touching and it makes you think. I never thought a G rated movie would make and entire audience cry, even adults were sniffling and weeping, how is that even possible?!

","Toy Story 3 is my most cherished movie experience of all time. The whole trilogy is a creative, heartfelt and overall perfect piece storytelling for all ages. With the first movie, we experience jealousy and rivalry between toys, as well as the realization of finding out you're a toy. In the end, the toys come to terms with their differences, and their roles in life and learn to co-exist. Toy Story 2 explores issues of abandonment and how lonely an unused toy can become. However it's with 3 that Toy Story packs a wallop of a tale. <br/><br/>The years have passed and Andy has grown up and is set for college. Woody & the gang haven't been played with in years and face the dire consequences of human aging. Before they come up against this situation, they are thrown into one last adventure, where they will have to escape an evil teddy bear that resents being replaced by a young girl.<br/><br/>Pixar's magic always seemed to work because they managed to mix a good story with nice comedic elements and great emotional moments. Basically the goal was to explore human feelings by presenting us with a beautiful animated world, where anything can happen. The balance between real world conflicts and an imaginary existence was mostly the secret behind Pixar's success. So it's no surprise that Toy Story 3 not only embodies this, but may have the best execution of that idea. Never have I been more in sync with the plot and the characters in a movie. They laugh, I laugh, they get scared, I get scared, and most of all, they cry, I cry. In what I can describe to you as the best 10 minutes I've ever seen in a movie, animated or live action, Andy says goodbye to his childhood by passing down his toys to a new owner. He will always remember them, and they, in return, will always be there for them.<br/><br/>So if you know what it's like to let go of your childhood and grow up, but still crave a nice reminder of those carefree times, Toy Story 3 is the perfect film for you. I'm 18, and even I already feel like Andy and all others that can relate. This is my favorite film of all time, and it may very well be for years to come. Just breathtakingly perfect.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10"
"julianakeagle","9","3","4","29 September 2014"," Great ending to a great Trilogy
","Toy story is without a doubt one of the best animated trilogies. Toy story 3 ends the trilogy with improved graphics and lots of new characters. Although, this movie still brings back all the original characters and their classic voices such as Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and Joan Cusack. These familiar actors and actresses take on a new role as they use only their voices to bring personality to their characters. The idea of using toys as the main characters in this Disney Pixar trilogy opened the door for endless creativity as to the characters. This gives the trilogy a distinction that sets it apart from all other animated movies. <br/><br/>Toy Story 3 brings the long journey that the toys have had with Andy to a bittersweet end. Andy is leaving for college and must decide what to do with his cherished toys. After a brief scare, all of his toys end up together at Sunnyside Daycare. What seems like a great solution to their departure with long time playmate, Andy, turns into a call for action. The toy soon learn that the young kids don't play with them like Andy did so they seek out Lotso, a stuffed bear who is the leader of the toys, to be moved to the older kid's room. Lotso denies them and Andy's toys begin to learn about who Lotso really is. His hidden evil intentions leads the toys to plan their escape. Just as their escape plan seems to successfully conclude, they are stopped by Lotso and his followers. At the end of their brawl, both Lotso and Andy's toys end up on their way to an incinerator. As the toys are feet away from the incinerator and begin thinking it may be the end, the Aliens pull them out using an industrial claw. The toys make it safely back to Andy's where Woody plans to go to college while to rest will go in the attic. At the last minute Woody writes a note on their box. In the end, all the toys end up going to Bonnies's house, even Woody. Andy realizes he must let go of his toys and pass them along to someone who can enjoy them as he had. <br/><br/>Toy Story 3 takes its viewer on an incredible adventure in which he or she will experience both feelings of bliss and fear in the same movie. The toys must come together one last time in order to conduct their greatest escape. Toy Story 3 contains an interesting plot with tons of laughs. It is a bittersweet movie which ends in a theme that everyone can relate to. Truly one of the best endings to a trilogy."

My situation was exactly the same with Andy's, as I said.

"petra_ste","9","3","4","16 August 2014"," Memento Mori
","Disney characters often face death, and yet death itself is usually an anomaly for them, a breach made by villainy in their happy worlds. Toy Story 3, however, might be the first major Hollywood animated feature more or less explicitly *about* death. The premise has the protagonists terrified by the prospect of their now seventeen-year-old owner Andy going to college and getting rid of them. They know they are running out of time: even when they end up as gifts in a daycare run by a dictator-like teddy bear and attempt to escape, the specter of the garbage bin looms over them. It's no coincidence the last act features escathological imagery like the hellish fire of the incinerator or the heavenly sky of the last shot.<br/><br/>Not that Toy Story 3 is bleak; it's a good-natured roller-coaster ride with quirky characters, creative set-pieces, witty dialogues - a funny tale of flamenco-dancing toy astronauts, self-absorbed Ken dolls and happy endings. Still, this unique perspective lends it a special pathos; good movies can simply be well-crafted, but great movies need to be ABOUT something. Pixar has been tackling with serious themes (diversity, paternity, senility, abandonment) ever since the first Toy Story: this is one of their boldest projects yet. Let's hope they keep pushing the envelope - to infinity and beyond.<br/><br/>8,5/10"

","Objectivity is never easy, but in judging Toy Story 3, it's an almost entirely pointless aspiration. I got my Woody and Buzz toys when I was six. I had those stylized clouds from Andy's room on my wallpaper. I was choking up when ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" started playing over the film's achingly nostalgic VHS opening.<br/><br/>I could try and share my overwhelmingly positive and occasionally negative observations--the breakout scene pops with Chaplinesque inventiveness, while Jessie is a tad underserved by the screenplay etc--but for me, Toy Story 3 is defined by the fact that I was streaming tears literally non- stop for the last twenty minutes or so.

Maybe he might be a professional soccer or baseball player for the major league. Well that is hard to explain because I do not know yet. Buzz Lightyear is one of my favourite Toy Story characters because he is futuristic, a space ranger; maybe he can be one for law enforcement as well.

Barbie & Ken have become some of my new favorite characters. They add great comic relief to this film. The imagination behind Disney and Pixar is one of the most important elements in this trilogy. If a toy was ever made, they find a use for it! It's incredible. If you loved the other two films, definitely check this one out. The 3D doesn't really change the film or make it extraordinary, so don't worry about that! This film is great for people of all ages so bring the whole family. No one will be bored."
"pcongleton-1","9","3","4","13 July 2010"," As Andy grows up so does the Toy Story franchise.
","What troubled me the most about this film was it felt like it was the same story (Andy leaves the room, Toys get lost or in trouble, Toys need to work together to get home, Antagonist makes life tough for Toys, etc), but as the film unravels you remember the real reason you are here. To see Pixar animation come to life, beautifully I might add, and to be entertained for an hour and a half. All our returning friends are back, minus a few, but now Andy is 17 and moving onto college and the fates of the Toys are sealed. The characters who are gone are replaced by some new and exciting characters. The film also opens up with a new adventure in the beginning that is exciting too. This part was never done in the other two films either and gave a new dimension to this film. It obviously is an adventure that is generated by the ideas found in Andy's head but the Pixar team gives it to you like it was totally real. The interesting thing about the story is the parallel lines between Andy's situation and the mood the film will eventually take that catapults it into being one of the best films of this summer. As Andy grows up so does the Toy Story franchise. This film takes a startling, but welcoming turn towards the mature side of things and dishes out a dark side and a violent side that tells us that the Toy Story world has grown up. I don't want to say what happens, but it is jarring. Some highlights are Potato Head as a tortilla shell, Barbie & Ken, Michael Keaton expertly handling the voice of Ken and an homage to the now classic theme song ""You Got a Friend in Me"" in Spanish. In my opinion it still isn't as good as the original, but damn close. It is a fond farewell (hopefully not the last)."

","The best magic tricks in the world are ones that cannot be unraveled, reverse engineered or dissected to figure out exactly how they are pulled off. This philosophy is doubly applicable to Pixar's ""Toy Story 3"", the storyline-ending outré of the beloved Toy Story, uh, story.<br/><br/>I feel it relevant somehow to divulge my age, as it somehow validates the powerful emotions evoked throughout the film. I am a 28 year old male, who, fifteen years ago, was fresh into the teen years of supposed adolescence at the release of some weird, 3d animated movie (wait, they can animate with computers?) entitled ""Toy Story"". This was a pretty bold move, a calculated stroll to the edge of the cliff and a daring leap off into the thin air of creativity and innovation. And it was a hit, ensuring 3d animation a place right alongside (more or less) 2d animation. And naturally, Pixar would be at the forefront, leading the cavalry charge of digital animation ranging from great to gad-awful.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" starts off as comfortably as possible, with our friends Woody and Buzz Lightyear doing what they do the best...playing with Andy in his world of make-believe adventure. We are then treated to some familiar Pixar progression, like abandonment, solidarity, coming back to friends, and the passing of the torch. Clearly, in the eleven years between this point and when ""Toy Story 2"" wrapped, a computer revolution or four has occurred, allowing a world of unsurpassed clarity, reality and imagination to shine through like never before. TS1's spark is TS2's candle, and that in turn is TS3's blazing sun.<br/><br/>Roll the last fifteen minutes of film. It became clearly obvious that the figurative tables have been turned, because a good number of the adults in the audience (including myself) were sniffling and teary-eyed, while the kids were looking up, likely thinking ""jeez mom and dad, they're just toys, get over it"".<br/><br/>Wasn't it conventional wisdom that just the kids get emotional over losing plastic playthings? With ""Toy Story 3"", Pixar has shown us one of the greatest magic tricks in modern showbiz history, likely not to be outdone or duplicated, that we all have very real and deep connections to our childhoods and to the things and people that allowed us as kids to be free, and innocent, and pure, and most importantly, to dream. This, to me, is a life lesson worth remembering, to infinity and beyond.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" gets 10 of 10 blazing stars"

","11 years later, Toy Story 3 still manages to stay true to the original concept and blows us away. Directed by Lee Unkrich (co-director of Toy Story 2), it manages to induce plenty of laughs and few tears from the adults who as kids had drooled over the first two movies. I wouldn't claim to be a huge Toy Story fan but the third installment just made me realize how much in love with the characters I was.<br/><br/>Andy Davis (voiced by John Morris), now 17 years old and heading off to college, needs to decide what he wants to do with the few toys he still holds on to. This predicament leaves him in some angst and in the end decides to take Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) with him while leaving the rest of the toys in the Attic. But due to various mishaps, all the toys end up in a day care centre called Sunnyside that is run by the huggable, strawberry scented Losto Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty). This is where most of the action takes place i.e. from Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) being reset, Woody leaving the others to go back to Andy, Ken (voiced by Michael Keaten) and Barbie (voiced Jodi Benson) falling in love, being played/tortured by infants, Woody and gang saving the other toys from the evil Losto etc.<br/><br/>The process by which the movie builds up is just plain eye candy for us viewers because it makes us fall in love with each of the characters all over again. The opening scenes showing Andy as a kid playing with the toys takes us back to the original movies which in my opinion was the best way to get the viewers nostalgic and hooked from the start. Even though a lot of the toys/characters from the first two movies didn't make it to this movie, all the remaining ones were handled in an ideal way making sure we didn't miss the ones that were lost. Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack) was the perfect cow girl, Mr & Mr Potato (voiced by Don Rickles and Estelle Harris) head were adorable, Rex (voiced by Wallace Shawn) was his scary best and Slinky Dog (voiced by Blake Clark) the faithful sidekick irrespective of his age.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the middle of the movie, I did get slightly bored but as the ending unraveled, the whole thing made complete sense and this is where the movie blew me away. The likelihood of an emotional ending going bad is usually high but the way the writers handled it was just mind bogglingly faultless. I won't go into details but in all honesty, I'd watch this movie over and over again just for the ending. Loved it...well done Lee Unkrich."

","Pixar does it again (yeah everyone says that because they deserve it), funny - sorry hilarious, didactic for both kids and adults, dramatic, and definitely first class entertainment. Technically speaking, all characters outsmarted their earlier performance both animation-wise and character-wise. What we expect Woody or Buzz to do is right there. At one moment, when Buzz goes Spanish all the theatre exploded in laughter it was hilarious. When Andy is giving away the toys you could hear people crying both young and adults and unashamedly. The didactic feature gains more importance because it is not straightforward. Toy Story makes us think about themes such as boredom, the purpose of our existence, retirement, loyalty, friendship, trust, the environment, giving for charity, the fact that at one moment we need to let go of things we cherish because holding on to the past makes things stagnant. We only learn to appreciate the things we have (including emotions) when are about to lose them. Yet, we must be courageous enough to keep moving forward. All are great lessons. What's more important is that there is no glorification of crime Hollywood style. I advise people to watch it again and again and take their kids too."

","At first seeing the previews of yet another toy story i thought Disney and Pixar was just trying to make another movie to bank on a good series, but i was soo wrong. I've scene the film 3 times now and still the movie makes me laugh and brings me nearly to tears at the same time. The way the plot lays out beautifully, and the characters (new and old) still manage to be lovable. I would recommend seeing this film with someone you care about so you ca appreciate it's awesomeness together. I'm almost positive you'll agree with me. Oh, and I would also try to get anyone who hasn't seen the first 2 films to watch them first, because it will ruin a some of the plots of either of the movies before you even see them."

","Toy Story 3 is an adventure filled, entertaining and deeply emotional film for all ages. <br/><br/>Toy Story was the beginning of PIXAR's extraordinary journey and they have delivered with just about every film since. The only question in my mind before seeing this film was ""Will it live up to the lofty standards of the first two films?"". Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were great in their own right but this film outclassed them both. <br/><br/>The start was subtle, we see Andy playing with his toys as usual but something has changed. Then we embark on a journey with all the toys, again as usual. At this point the movie was only good but in the second half it just takes off. Can't say more without spoiling it. It has to be experienced. And the best part comes last, the ending of this movie gave me utmost satisfaction. What an end to the best trilogy of all time (atleast in my opinion) and Toy Story will remain the best trilogy unless Batman 3 proves otherwise. <br/><br/>This film will made me laugh, jump with excitement and cry...thats right, the last 5-7 minutes were so moving that I shed a few tears. If you are wondering how can adults cry over toys, go see this. <br/><br/>The wizards at PIXAR have delivered a masterpiece once again. The bar cannot be raised higher. <br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is now officially my favourite animated feature film along with 'Spirited Away'.<br/><br/>P.S. Kudos to PIXAR for 'Day & Night'(short film screened before Toy Story 3), it was simple yet amazing."

","Toy Story came out November 22, 1995 just 2 weeks before my sixth birthday. Naturally, I became obsessed with it as it was funny, nail-biting, and had an awesome toy to play with: Buzz Lightyear! That Christmas I had my parents frantically searching high and low for a Buzz Lightyear action doll in a period of weeks that i'm sure resembled that of ""Jingle All the Way's"" infamous shopping scene. As time progressed, Buzz became a regular cast member in my various imaginative ventures through childhood. Him and I also revisited Woody and the gang countless times with my VHS copy of the movie...needless to say it got damn-near worn out.<br/><br/>I was excited when I saw the first preview for Toy Story 2, as it was released just 2 weeks before my tenth birthday. However, slight disappointment ensued at the end credits and I could only describe the sequel in comparison to the first movie as ""weird."" I was not pleased entirely with the journey the second film had taken me on. Not to say it didn't have it's funny moments (the return of ""space ranger buzz"" and even Bullseye was cute), but all-in-all it was NOT the first one! So I did not end up with a VHS copy of that one, and continued through the rest of my childhood with cherishing the memory of Toy Story and having only snippets of memory for Toy Story 2.<br/><br/>Through my teens I lost the eternal love for Toy Story that I had once had. So when they released the first two back in theaters in 3-D last year I did have a slight desire to see them as I remembered Toy Story as being ""that movie I used to love when I was a kid"" and Toy Story 2 as ""that movie I had only seen once or twice and can't remember why mom and dad never bought it for me,"" but alas this was not enough for me to actively jump at this chance to see them again like i had never imagined them (obviously I have some regrets now). I also knew that the 3-D event was an intentional precursor to Toy Story 3 in 3-D happening the following year. I had my doubts about the movie of course (i had seen what happened to Shrek), but having fell in love with several Pixar movies in the previous years (Finding Nemo, Wall-E, UP) I had faith that it would not be terrible.<br/><br/>So earlier this year I rented Toy Story 1 & 2 so I could refresh my memory. Toy Story was the most fantastic trip through memory lane I have ever experienced as it was exactly how I remembered it as a kid. EXACTLY! I was a teary-eyed at this revelation that some part of my childhood had not been tarnished by my new-found adult criticism of movies. Toy Story 2, however, was significantly better than I remembered it as a kid, but it was still NOT the first one, nor is it one of my favorite Pixar movies. After reviewing the first two movies again, I have become obsessed with collecting everything Toy Story I can get my hands on. I even unburied my old Buzz Lightyear Toy and have him sitting on my shelf with my other collected items from the movies.<br/><br/>All this excitement made me more than eager to see the third (and apparently final) installment of the series. I found myself already tearing up at the beginning of the movie as the old home videos from Andy's childhood set up the finality-theme of the movie. I wasn't ready to say goodbye just yet, luckily for me I didn't have to as I had one more very dark journey to go on with my old friends. This movie played with my child-like feelings towards the toys as I was emotionally stressed from the extreme peril they were placed in, and unable to fully accept the changes happening. On the other hand, I was in awe of the flawless technology that had went into making the movie: a great paralleled observation as Toy Story was Pixar's first movie and Toy Story 3 had come a long way from it's 1990's technology and arguably reigns as Pixar's greatest triumph 15 years later. I cried passionately when the toys were about to face certain oblivion, and I bawled like a baby when Andy said good-bye while playing with them one last time. This just proves how magical Pixar films really are. Dreamworks certainly would NEVER be able to make you cry over the fate of a bunch of plastic toys, or over the fate of any character they could create.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: Toy Story 3 means more to me than any film I will ever see and lived past its expectations. I share the affection towards Barbie and Ken's scenes as the rest of the world does, and believe that it was the perfect cherry on top of a great trilogy. This movie will be a strong contender for Best Picture at the Oscars...and is arguably the certain one to win along with screenplay, director, animated feature, and visual effects.<br/><br/>Pixar has really outdone themselves and has effortlessly put all other movie-distributing companies (even you Disney! That crap you call movies that you have been releasing in the past couple of years has been shameful!) to shame. I only hope they don't trip on their egos on the journey to making the upcoming Cars 2 and Monster's Inc. 2 (both of which's predecessors I did not care too much for)."

","32 years ago I watched my first movie. It was Star Wars Episode IV. Today, my 3-years old son watched his first movie in the big screen. Only to keep with the family tradition, Toy Story 3 is going to run the same fate as one of the greatest movies ever. This is a spectacular movie, inspiring, moving and hilarious all at the same time. It touched me, made me cry and made me think about what's really important in life. I usually don't care much about technical variables. e.g. the animation itself. But in this case the plot and the animation are so brilliantly delivered that it's hard to imagine one without the other. There is one scene in particular (and don't worry I won't tell you which) that will pass the test of time as one of the greatest moment of this beautiful form of art."

"jaskunwar993","10","3","4","25 June 2010"," Senorita! What a wonder!
","I was glad to find out that my little hometown had decided to put up Toy Story 3 in PVR, and that too in 3D. Hearing this, I left the toilet midway (:P) and rushed to book the tickets for the next available show. 11 years and here it was... Toy Story 3 was officially out in India. <br/><br/>Having seen Toy Story 1 and Toy Story 2, the latter being my favourite Pixar production, obviously my expectations were, least to say, 'sky- high'. I must slap myself for doubting them, I must throttle myself for even thinking it, I should get ""lasered"" by a real Buzz Lightyear for being afraid of it, and I must get ""coyboyed"" by Woody for having second thoughts about the result... but guess what. After close to 2 hours of delight, depression, hope, inspiration and a pure heart-warming tale, I suddenly had a new favourite Pixar, and I daresay a new 2nd favourite (nothing beats TDK): Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>Funnily enough, the basic central theme of all Toy Story's is the same: Rescue. However, it's HOW the theme is shaped and shelled that makes a movie ""awful"", ""ok"", ""good"", ""great""... or ""Toy Story 3"". I tried to be as cruel to the movie as possible, trying to find mistakes, trying to find a loophole, trying to locate ONE black spot in pure, white, serene beauty, but I couldn't. <br/><br/>The Direction: Perfect. Lee has done a wonder job with it. No bumps, no goofs, no feeling of ""What? Why? How?"". Everything is so well explained, so well done, every action and event has an explanation. <br/><br/>Music: Makes the movie what it is. Gives it the feel.<br/><br/>Script: Wow. Wow. Wow. And wow.<br/><br/>Editing: Perfect.<br/><br/>Cinematography: Though there isn't any, the sense of cinematography is totally perfect.<br/><br/>Voice(s): Oscar winning performances, for the voices at least...<br/><br/>Ideas & Concepts: From the most heartwarming scene, to the most threatening scene, to the most touching scene... to the most hilarious scene ever (Buzz! Senorita!). The ideas that are reflected in these scenes... and again the direction... makes you ACTUALLY experience the moment.<br/><br/>And finally...<br/><br/>The Animation: What can I say... Pixar is already perfect but somehow they're getting better and better. Perfect movements, which create perfect moments, amazing sense of animation, the reflections, the expressions... the... well, everything.<br/><br/>But what is it that makes this movie what it is? I don't know. I watched this movie once but I guess that wasn't enough. I'm gonna watch this movie again, again, again and again. But I know that I still won't be able to tell you WHAT it is that makes this movie the wonder it has turned out to be. All I can say is, don't give a DAMN about the price of the ticket, this movie is priceless. Grab the next opportunity, and make way for it if you don't get one, but go, 10-year-olds, 20-year-olds, 40- year-olds, 80-year-olds... there's something in there for everybody. Go. Don't waste more time. Go and live a wonder that I think will never, ever, EVER, come again.<br/><br/>A perfect 10/10."
"sid231991","9","3","4","25 June 2010"," An all round winner !!
","Toy Story 3 opens in a similar vein to the previous film, but this time Woody (Tom Hanks) is the hero of the imaginary adventure. Watch the three films back to back and you'll see the progression in the quality of the animation. In this film the people are still stylized, but the level of detail and expression is far beyond what was in the previous film; it's really beautiful and helps you connect to the human characters more than ever. Having said that, I did see it in 3D and frankly the film would have been just as good without it.<br/><br/>As with everything Pixar does, the attention to detail here is incredible. How the slide in the playground becomes a watchtower at night. How marker smudges become prison stats. The level of detail, in things like Woody's rounded-down hairline, is astounding. And yes, that's the voice of John Morris, now 23, playing Andy once again. Why get the same actor when only a few might notice? Because everything is everything here.<br/><br/>And talking about the emotional part of the film; it starts tugging at you a little bit early on, then gives way for a lot of the fun stuff. If you don't shed a tear at some point you might just be made of stone. There's just one scene after another, going from touching, to heartbreaking, back to touching and melancholy. There are few live action films that can reach your heart the way this one did in the last 15 minutes or so. And the jail-break sequence was so exciting, you forget that you are watching an animated movie and get totally involved with the characters.<br/><br/>The relationship that the toys have with their owners in the Toy Story-movies has always been a curious thing. In order for toys to truly feel wanted, their owners need to really use their imaginations while playing with them. There almost needs to be a heightened sense of wonder involved in order for the toys to feel complete. This is what drives them to find a place where the kids would connect to them and enjoy playing with them. Thats when all hell breaks loose and everything seems to go wrong. You can't help but notice the small values of life that these toys teach us in almost every juncture. No matter what we have around us, be it living or not, its special. Its special 'cause it serves a purpose that no one else can !<br/><br/>Go see Toy Story 3 and take the whole family. It might just end up being your all time favorite Pixar film. The three movies have now shown us that the story of a toy is, overall, a sad one. But not one without pride. And not one without joy."
"rebelhopeful","10","3","4","24 June 2010"," It was like it was almost about me!
","Toy Story 3 is an amazing movie. It goes farther than just a movie about toys, but the emotions in the generation that grew up with Andy and the toys. I am Class of 2010 and I'm now myself headed to college once the summer is up. I almost cried at the end. I didn't think it would be so, but I really do believe this movie tops the previous two, and they are great movies in there own right. Besides all of that, the movie itself was vintage Pixar full of great clean laughs and an entertaining plot. I think the movie would be more enjoyed by my generation that grew up with it from the mid 90's up to now, and others can enjoy it as well. Bravo once again Pixar.<br/><br/>10/10"
"montera_iulian","9","3","4","24 June 2010"," A wild emotional journey through the perfect ending of the best animation trilogy ever made
","I must start this review by saying a few things about the Toy Story franchise. When I was a kid I didn't saw Toy Story in '95 nor the sequel in '99. I remember I saw Toy Story in 2003 and I thought it was okay. Now with all the surrounding hype of the third installment I decided to go through the first 2 movies before I'll watch Toy Story 3 so few days ago I saw them and I was amazed what I lost when I was at a very young age. The first 2 parts are amazing, the first deserving an honestly 8,9 and the second a better 9,1, but because of the hype of Toy Story 3 I was a little bit skeptic about how good it would be. Today I saw it and it was awesome! Not only awesome but I think one of the top animations ever made.<br/><br/>The story is perfect because it has real funny standout moments, it has no major flaws, it has action sequences which are executed by the finest hands from Pixar Studios. Besides that it has a great way of developing the characters and providing the necessary amount of suspense or thrill at times. Along the movie you feel happy, sad, scared, terrified, amazed, ""WOWed"" and more than anything entertained. All that not only because of the great comeback of the toys but also because of the incredible soundtrack provided by the talented Randy Newman.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 ain't just an animation movie, it's more than that. Adults and children could be entertained at the same time. Who doesn't remember how much passion and how much we loved our toys when we were kids? Who doesn't remember how it's to feel something for a bunch of plastic things? But the strongest part in the movie isn't the beginning with the great introduction, nor the action sequences but the ending which was this close to make my tears drop down. I had a feeling that I remember I got when I was a kid and I watched ""Lion King"" which was a great emotional journey. Toy Story it's the same having by far one of the greatest endings animation movies have ever seen and I'm sure that if I saw Toy Story as a kid I would definitely could not have controlled myself today.<br/><br/>As far as a franchise Toy Story is by far the best animation trilogy. Talking about technical aspects I would say that the sound editing was top notch, integrating very well the score, audio effects and dialogue into the movie. Cinematography was good but had some times were it could have been better. The 3D was rendered perfect in my theater so I had nothing against it though there were not so many actual stunning 3D effects.<br/><br/>In the end I don't know, go see the movie and see for yourself how good this is. Till now it's the best movie out this year and I think the next one that could top it might be Inception."
"marchingman","9","3","4","24 June 2010"," Remarkably Profound
","It's astonishing to think of the impressively high standard Pixar has set for animated films. It's astonishing to think of any animated movie - including Pixar - equaling, much less surpassing, that standard set by Pixar previously. It's even more astonishing to realize that Pixar never fails to reach and/or surpass that standard. <br/><br/>See, part of me hoped this film would disappoint. Having heard rumors of a series of sequels from Pixar - this, Cars 2, Monsters, Inc. 2, and a potential Finding Nemo sequel - I feared Pixar may start falling victim to the seemingly severe case of sequelitis that is plaguing Hollywood. Alas, I realize that Pixar is not a victim of sequelitis, but rather the antidote; the definition of what a sequel needs to be.<br/><br/>Earlier this year, I watched How To Train Your Dragon and for the first time believed I had witnessed a film that had finally matched Pixar quality. Then Toy Story 3 came along, and reminded just how high that standard had been set. At times feeling like an animated Shawshank Redemption and other times a profound existential commentary, TS3 may eventually prove to be the best of the trilogy, which is one of the strongest trilogies ever made.<br/><br/>In this, we see the toys accidentally donated to a day care facility days before Andy sets off for college. Immediately we are greeted with a conflict of loyalty as Andy chooses Woody as the only toy he will take to college. The bond between the toy and his owner has really been the core of the trilogy, and it drives this film even further. It is what makes the realization of Woody's future and existence so profound, and what makes the ending the humbling farewell this trilogy deserves.<br/><br/>Determined to keep the gang together and - after hearing of the truth behind the day care - concerned for his friends, Woody embarks on a journey to save his friends from a very bleak future. Throughout this journey, Woody comes to perhaps the most profound realization a toy could encounter: that his purpose is to be the character of imagination, an imagination which Andy can no longer fully provide. And in a bittersweet conclusion, a new future for the toys is realized. <br/><br/>Beautifully crafted and enduringly realized, Toy Story 3 works its way near the top of the list of the greatest animated films ever made. Pixar has done it yet again."
"jake-law123","10","3","4","22 June 2010"," excellent conclusion to the greatest trilogy ever!!!
","Whether your a toddler, a child, a teenager, or an adult, you will love this film, especially if you love Pixar, which is about everybody out there. Every Pixar movie, with the exception of Cars, is terrific, but the best is Toy Story. Toy Story 2 was also great, but then this came and perfectly concluded the trilogy, surpassing Toy Story 2. Pixar's first trilogy, and the greatest trilogy ever!<br/><br/>Also the funniest Pixar film, even though its not as good as the first, but just by a tiny bit. It has comedy, action, and tons of emotion. Has a really clever plot, which borrows from The Great Escape a little bit.<br/><br/>Andy is heading out to college, leaving the toys in depression. They get donated to a Daycare center which looks like a toy paradise, but turns out to be a prison led by a pink bear named Lotso where new toys are played with by roudy toddlers that play with them like rag dolls, in which they plot to escape.<br/><br/>The fact that the first was the first movie I've ever seen is the only reason I like it better, but this film is not only funnier, but is a lot more epic, of course thats because its the last one, with the most emotional ending in Pixar. You will cry watching this film if you are a fan of Pixar, guaranteed. I don't just love the ending, but I can't help but think back at the other ones. Its emotional not just for the movie, but it even reminds me of when I had to give something up that I really liked in my childhood, such as my Rescue Heroes, or my Dragon Ball Z action figures, or even some Toy Story toys that I had of my own. No matter what you think, never feel the movie's plot is fading throughout, cause in the end it will all be resolved.<br/><br/>You will be stunned by how good this film is. It was 10x better than what I expected. Without a doubt the second best Pixar film, and also one of my top ten favorite films."

","There's nothing that can be said bad about this movie. I mean it, nothing-bad-at-all. Toy Story 3 not only rocks (I'm 30 years old and I took my two young nephews to go see it just today), but its the BEST (in my opinion) of all three Toy Story movies. It seems that with each Toy Story installment, the movies not only get better, they get more entertaining and humorous for audiences for all ages. Toy Story 3 has depth, a great story, characters you care about, wonderful writing and the animation is top notch. As I said, there isn't anything I can say negative about this film.<br/><br/>(Spoiler Alert) Andy is growing up and heading off to college, but the question we want to know is ""What's going to happen to the toys?"" After a series of misadventures, the toys arrive at a day care, where we are introduced to several new characters and the movie becomes a cliché of classic prison escape movies, though you really don't see it as such until later. The new toys we are introduced to are Ken doll, Lots-o-Hugs Bear and even a toy triceratops named Trixie. Each new toy (as well as our favorite old toys) have their own unique and entertaining character traits that make us laugh or at least smile. Buzz himself goes through a humorous transformation that you have to see to appreciate. Both old and new toys interact well in the movie, thanks to both the animators and the characters voice actors.<br/><br/>There's not much else I can say that praises this film that others haven't already said. Toy Story 3 is a classic in the making, and if Pixar knows whats best, they'll retire the Toy Story films now before they ruin them. (Granted, I was apprehensive before going to see this one because I didn't think they could out due the second installment, but hey...). If your a fan of Pixar films, or a fan of the Toy Story films, this is a must see for you."

","I am a 46 year old dad that loves Pixar's animated movies. My wait to see TS3 has been giving me anxiety for over a year in a good sense. My family and I saw the movie last Sunday with very high expectations. Off course the wait paid off and in a big way. This movie provides the audience with all kinds of assortments, superb technical details, laughs left and right, surprise plot twists and a heavy dose of nostalgia, my beloved wife was sniffling as usual. The folks from Pixar are gifted people who for over 15 years have managed to pull off what the audience like to see. Their products all have been hits because their dedication to every detail and commitment to quality has made them a big name in the industry. TS3 could easily be considered the best in the trilogy, just like Star Wars III did in year 2005. Simply it is flawless, the studios have perfected an already outstanding theme. What I like the most of TS3 is that the story although a bit predictable, still knows how to pull the right strings into making an engaging movie packed with emotion that can compare to real life experiences as well. I am no movie expert nor critic, but for me this flick shall be awarded all the Oscar's it can be nominated for and not just best animated movie category, but best motion picture of the year 2010."
"beenhavingfun","10","3","4","22 June 2010"," The ending of an excellent childhood
","I don't really know how to describe what this film means to me. When Toy Story came out I was about 4 years old, I bought Woody and Buzz and had both costumes as well. These movies pretty much sum up my childhood and like all good movies the characters stick with you. Every time I watch Toy Story its like visiting old friends I haven't seen in a long time. While this may seem kinda silly(they're freaking toys for pete's sake) it reminds me of being a kid, of when I looked at the world in a less cynical way and probably understood love better than I do today. <br/><br/>I am 18 years old now, I'm about to start college and stand on my own two feet. Its as if Pixar planned this perfectly, sure for many it is a nostalgic thing for them, but I feel like I am Andy. I am bidding goodbye to my childhood, to these friends I've known for so long. The beauty of this film is that it nails the truth down about all of us, we remember being kids and sometimes we long to be those kids again. <br/><br/>This is a wonderful film and sequel, trust me it has more going for it than just nostalgia. The film has some breath-taking visuals, hilarious humor, and thought provoking moments. A complete trilogy if there ever was one. The ending is pure poetry, not modern poetry but timeless like Emily Dickinson, its not trying to be sad for sadness's sake but is truly moving. You'll enjoy this movie I promise, if you don't then you must not be much of a kid anymore."
"ggerue","10","3","4","22 June 2010"," Toy Story 3 : Amazing
","Our family went last night to see Toy Story 3 and let me tell you that I came away from that movie completely satisfied. I am 40 years old and I think I enjoyed the movie more than my kids, who are 16 and 14. How Pixar is able to create such an attachment to their characters is a testament to their wonderful creative team.<br/><br/>I won't go too much into the details but if you are only going to see one movie this summer, this would be it! There is something in this movie for everyone and every age group. This isn't much of a spoiler but if you have really young children the landfill scene might be a little traumatic for them. My wife even jumped a couple of times during that scene.<br/><br/>All in all, this has got to be one of the greatest trilogies of all time, and second only to Lord of the Rings for me. The ending is very well written and yes I'll admit it, I teared up a little when it was over. Again, it's amazing to me that Pixar is able to create such an attachment to these ""toys"". These characters are so much more than that as they have been around for the last 15 years. I was 25 when the first Toy Story came out and you definitely get a feeling of nostalgia when this movie ends. I guess what is most upsetting is knowing that there will be no more Toy Story movies, as this one ends perfectly.<br/><br/>Pixar has really outdone themselves with this movie, and you would think that the creative well would run dry over there. Each time a Pixar movie is released, you half expect it to be the one that really doesn't measure up to the previous films. Toy Story 3 is not that movie and I think it has to be one of their best films, right behind Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Hope this review was useful and do yourself a favor and go watch this movie."
"goth_nina","10","3","4","21 June 2010"," What a perfect way to end the story!
","I honestly don't like giving perfect scores, but that's how I exactly felt about this movie. The Pixar crew did exactly what I expected, a fantastic screenplay, & a vivid adventurous story that could finally conclude with a happy ending (please, no Toy Story 4). I don't want to discuss the film in detail, it's very much worth watching it for yourself. You'll experience happiness with the whole gang, you'll feel sorry for them & you'll probably tear like I did, it's a fantastic sequel. This film clearly tells me we can all rely on Pixar to enter their original films a second time, a wonderful world they've created, whether if in the monster world, or the superhero world. You'll definitely enjoy this beautiful ending from the first world we've experienced back in 1995!"

","i watched toy story 1 when i'm about 5- back then, i didn't care much about the plot and of course, i didn't really look into the movie that well.. when i heard toy story 3 was coming out- i downloaded toy story 1 and 2 so i could watch it again and refresh my mind about the plot. from a VHS (if you still recall) to a hd rip file downloaded from the internet.. then i watched toy story 1 and 2, and it blew me away. it was even better than the movies today.. i couldn't get rid of the feeling of excitement for the trilogy. my mind was like - ""can pixar pull it off?; will it be better than 1 and 2?; andy is going to college, how can they end the story well?"" then it came, i watched 3 and after that... speechless, totally speechless. it was like after riding a extreme roller coaster, with your senses still tingling, your mind and soul couldn't get rid of the excitement.. the feeling just took over me and the only thing i really could think of doing is just to look at my ""roller coaster mates"" and say.. ""let's go again!"" p.s - there's only one thing missing though, woodie's lover. the girl sheperd. i wish they have included her in 3... oh well.."
"ironhorse_iv","9","4","6","31 July 2012"," Literally the toys are us!!!
","There are movies from our childhood that continues to make an impact on us, even when we're adults. This movie directed by Lee Unkrich is one of those. Unlike the 'Shrek' franchise that became a shell of its former self. The 'Toy Story' is a movie series that continues to get better with each film added to it. Yet, I really, hope this is the end of 'Toy Story' trilogy, because any fourth movie will not live up to this. Debuting in 1995, Pixar's 'Toy Story' introduce us to the world of 3D computer animation. Most 90's children will remember where they were when Toy Story came out. Some of us were like Andy playing with mixed match toys, making our own adventures with them. When Toy Story 2 came out,(1999) some of us were in middle school or high school and slowly the toys were become less and less interesting to us similar to Jesse (Joan Cusack) retelling of Emily in Toy Story 2. Fast further to 2010, and we watch Toy Story 3. The movie series that we saw during our childhood has gotten better since then. Surprising, when I got there, I thought I would be swamped by little kids who knew little about Toy Story, but it wasn't like that. I saw many of young and mid 20's years old who grew up watching this movie there watching this movie and every moment of the film made us remember our own childhoods. If you haven't watch Toy Story 1 or 2, you might want to watch them, before entering into this movie. The start of the movie was very interesting, and it's really pit the nostalgia feeling in this movie, as it remind us of the beginning of Toy Story 1. It made us seems like we were there growing up with Andy. Andy doesn't play with most of his toys anymore since he has grown up and move on to better things like college. His sister, Molly seems to be more... let's just say she was nicer when she was a baby. Most of the gang can't get that through their plastic skulls that both are out of that stage of play. Well, at less, Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) are still there with the normal supporting cast minus a few characters. I don't care about Weezy, but why Bo-Peep? Plus, no explaining why she isn't there. The gang felt abandoned and when they were mistaken for trash. They wanted out and move out of Andy's house and into in a daycare center lead by Lotso (Ned Betty). His present on film remind me of a mixed character between Cool Hand Luke's Warden (1967), Dr. Moreau from Island of Dr. Moreau (1977), and Jabba the Hut from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1983). He is a very great actor and he really gives this character depth, and made us feel pity for the character when a flashback of his past came to view. Lotso's second in command is a Ken-doll (Michael Keaton) tries to make the new toys feel welcome in their new home. This character will become a gay icon similar to Cher. Big Baby was creepy, but he did have a great role in the film as the enforcer. His presence in the film might scare little children, so do warn. From all the new characters, Dolly (Bonnie Hunt) is my favorite. Soon, they find out that the day-care is not the ideal place they think it is, and more like a prison. Now it's on, as Andy's toys must find a way to escape. There were a lot of good jokes. Look out for a lot of Hispanios jokes. The action scenes in the film were great as well, most likely the last action scene in the film. I forgot it was a Disney movie at that point, and totally forgot I was watching a cartoon in that scene. It was really heart pounding.There is a lot of tear jerking moments in this film. Without giving much away, just note the ending of the film is heart breaking that will leave you crying. Overall review: it seems to be the darkest of all the films, audience seems to like the gritty darkest to films as of late, but the running theme of abandonment, concentration camp like places and near incineration might turn off others as depressing. Still, a good movie. Overall, an great movie 9 out of 10."

","Emotional and imaginative -that's how the final entry in the enormously popular Toys trilogy is described in Netflix, and I can't agree more. Who would have thought that one of the very best and most exciting films of the 2010 in the genres action adventure / thriller perfectly and brilliantly mixed with the comedy and touching drama would unfold in the playroom of the regular Anywhere, US suburban kindergarten. Who would have imagined that the bravest, most resourceful, loving, loyal, and lovable heroes of this adventure will be plastic and metal toys?<br/><br/>How often does it happen that not even the first but the second sequel in the popular series will surpass two excellent predecessors on all counts and become a rare film, that would make even the most ironic and sarcastic male critics who could tear any movie to pieces with their harsh criticism shed a tear and not be shy to admit it?<br/><br/>A very smart person said once: ""You need to write for children like you would for adults, but even better."" Toy Story, Part 3 is Toy Story, Part 3 is drawn, programmed, staged, CGIed and acted with such brilliance, talent and joy that every viewer, regardless of age becomes a child and is immersed in an extraordinary world of adventure, where one for all and all for one. By the end of this adventure, the viewers are left with very special and touching emotions, and realize that they experienced one of the most beautiful and realistic movies about growing up, moving on, and saying goodbye.<br/><br/>Bravo Disney, bravo Pixar, bravo American cinema!"

","When I saw Toy Sotry 3 last week I was astonished! I thought that it would be one of those movies where the first movie was great and would sink to the ground in a matter of time. Not with Toy Story 3! Ever since the beginning I was a fan of Toy Story. The characters in this movie were lively as ever.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did it again with their excellent chemistry as Woddy and Buzz. Of course Pixar increased the quality of the characters making them look more surreal. The movie would've been better if Jim Varney was around but I know he died in 2005 and got replaced.<br/><br/>If you're a Toy Story fan like me, go see it! As an 18 year old I found this movie thrilling and enjoyable.<br/><br/>To infinity and beyond!"
"Ostrumation","Null","4","6","19 June 2010"," A Grand Finale and Another Masterpiece from Pixar
","""Toy Story 3"", if anything, shows why Pixar is consistent and amazing. Sequels usually fall flat from time to time, and sometimes we get a sequel that's a masterpiece. ""Toy Story 2"" was that rare sequel that was just as good as the original, or possibly better. ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" seem hard to top. ""Toy Story 3"" is just as good as the first two. It is a phenomenal finale to the trilogy, and it did not disappoint in any way.<br/><br/>Taking place 10 years after the last one, Andy is now going to college in a couple of days. The toys are worried about what will happen to them. They desperately want to get played with, but garbage day comes and after some screw-ups, they end up on the curb as the garbage truck is on the way down the street. This sequence was beyond exciting, it had me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>After that debacle, the toys are convinced that Andy doesn't want them anymore. Woody knows that Andy was really trying to put them in the attic. Woody was supposed to go to college with Andy. The toys think it's a good idea to go to a daycare named Sunnyside. Woody objects to it, but he has no other choice when yet another incident happens.<br/><br/>At the daycare, Woody is not impressed. The new toys at the daycare, and their leader, Lotso-Huggin' Bear (Lotso for short), all seem like a welcoming bunch. Woody gets out and ends up with a little girl named Bonnie who goes to Sunnyside. The other toys realize that Sunnyside is not that great and they decide to leave. Excitement ensues.<br/><br/>The daycare escape scene is incredible, along with the following climax. There are several other great scenes in the film: The toys' experience with the daycare's rough little tykes, Woody's attempts at escaping Sunnyside and the daycare toys having a secret poker game in a vending machine. The film's opening sequence is a reminiscent of the opening scenes of the first two films, and awesome to top it off.<br/><br/>As for the humor, Ken definitely made this film funny. The film's humor is very witty like the first two films. A lot of jokes center on Mr. Potato Head, which worked well. The Buzz going Spanish thing was hilarious and it definitely worked. As for complaints over some toilet humor, well I thought it was subtle and not unnecessary. (I'm looking at you, DreamWorks) One other thing, there are several references to the first two films, a great reminder of the first two films.<br/><br/>Aside from ""Toy Story 3"" ultimately being a comedy-adventure, it was also a heartfelt film. The ending might have you in tears. But I will say that the ending was perfect for the series and I don't think it could've ended any better. This is film that will make you laugh, cry and be excited all at the same time. In all, ""Toy Story 3"" is a grand finale with great new characters, a very exciting plot with a lot unexpected twists and some teary elements. Don't let the ""3"" turn you off, it's one of the very rare ""3"" films that's actually great, if not phenomenal.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."
"bobsgrock","10","4","6","18 June 2010"," Wondrous, beautiful and something to remember.
","From the looks of it, it seems Pixar will never go out of style nor will they make a mediocre or bad film. Once again, going back to that wonderful cast of characters we all love that includes the cowboy Woody, the spaceman Buzz Lightyear, as well as Jessie, Bullseye, Rex, Ham, Slinky and many more, Pixar doesn't just recycle old clichés and story lines. Rather, they use what they have already done and build upon that foundation to create a brand-new, exciting and fantastic adventure.<br/><br/>Here we are, about 10 years after Toy Story 2 where we last left the toys saving Woody from being sold to Japan and adding a few new ones to the collection. Now, owner Andy is getting older and going away to college. The toys haven't changed, yet now begin to wonder what lies in their future. Will they be kept safe in the attic? Will they be donated and taken to a strange place? Or worse, will they be thrown out? What actually happens is so charming, fun, exciting and joyous to watch I can't even begin to spoil it for you. Let's just say that what follows consists of great jokes and sight-gags, beautifully animated set pieces and characters, and a huge amount of heart that practically no other animated film, or most films for that matter, can match.<br/><br/>The animation is stunning of course, but the voice-over acting is really wonderful as well. Since most of them aren't huge stars themselves, we accept them completely as the characters they play. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are probably the only major stars of the cast, yet are just as captivating and emotionally-tugging to listen to as the supporting cast. And as always, what truly gets me in the end is the amount of heart and soul put into every production. As I sat there welling up at the beauty of the final sequence, I couldn't help but wonder in amazement at the originality and passion that so obviously had gone into the production. I guarantee this film will have a huge opening weekend and should have consistent staying power since it resonates so well with so many. That is the mark of true genius; that is the mark of Pixar."
"ShiiStyle","2","34","95","14 July 2010"," This movie didn't have any characters.
","I'm not sure why nobody else has noticed that this movie had no characters. It was incredibly disappointing to walk out of the theater realizing that this is the best movie of the summer and there were no meaningful interactions between the characters. Strangely enough, the appeal of the first movie was inverted; in Toy Story, we were surprised and delighted to see toys have emotions like human beings, and in Toy Story 3, we are apparently satisfied (duped?) into enjoying allegedly human personalities thrown around as toys.<br/><br/>In the first movie, Woody is the hero and leader of the toys, then he meets Buzz and his personality is suddenly conflicted. Watching the tension between these characters build and break was legitimately interesting, a sort of Shakespearean kids' movie. It took the silly idea of animated toys and turned it into a real drama. Now, in the third movie, the drama is artificial and stupid; it comes from an outside evil force that has only a shallow personality and cannot be swayed. The main characters are only good people in a bad situation, which they need to get out of. THEY DID NOT DO ANYTHING TO GET INTO THIS SITUATION; their only duty is to escape. Nothing meaningful happens to them.<br/><br/>In the first movie, too, the cognitive dissonance between ""toys being played with"" and ""toys acting up when nobody sees them"" was very small. Woody was the same person whether or not there were kids in the room. In the third movie, somehow there is a complete disconnect between these two behaviors. Woody is not really a toy, but a sort of soul-infused plastic man who is forced to be a full-time actor, who performs ""improv"" for the kids and needs to be ""in character"". The deep, unexplained longing of the toys for children to come back and play with them is more than a little creepy.<br/><br/>In short, the metaphor of Toy Story is broken by this sequel, and no meaningful story is told. I would not show it to my kids. I'm sorry I watched it. Two stars for a decent ending scene."
"madisonasdff","10","5","9","18 June 2010"," A warm testament to everyone's fondest childhood memories
","I found Toy Story 3 to be, easily, one of the most touching movies I've ever seen. The series followed my generation; I grew up with Toy Story 1 and 2, and now as I myself am heading off to college, I couldn't have asked for a better, more poignant ending than Toy Story 3. The familiarity of the characters coupled with inevitable, generational continuity, creates one of Pixar's finest works. It speaks to the warm ache of nostalgia, to die-hard loyalty, to the acceptance of change. Of course, it wouldn't have been a true Pixar film if it didn't make the audience laugh out loud every few minutes. And when Andy played with his toys for the last time at the end of the movie... my god, I cried like a baby.<br/><br/>Cinematic, animated brilliance."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","4","7","28 December 2010"," To me, this is by far and large the best Pixar film to date!
","To me, Pixar have never yet made a bad film, even their weakest Cars is actually very good. Like a lot of people here, I grew up with and loved the first two Toy Story films and still love them. As is consistently the case with Pixar they are superbly animated, sophisticated and had great characters. Toy Story 3 somehow managed to do the seemingly impossible, while its Toy Storys 1 and 2 have a special place in my heart, this film was even better.<br/><br/>Perhaps Toy Story 3 isn't the most original of the trilogy or of the Pixar films, but that made little difference to me. While the darkest of the three, it still maintained the predecessors' heart and charm, and overall it was just an amazing film full-stop from start to finish, and easily one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>The animation is just superb here. Hardly a surprise though, as the animation was phenomenal also in Toy Storys 1 and 2, but to me it was just as sophisticated and as colourful here if not more so. I also loved the music, that said I don't think it is the best Pixar score(Up) or best score of the year, but it is almost certainly one of Randy Newman's better efforts and I liked the You've Got a Friend in Me repeat.<br/><br/>The pacing is just fine as well, and the story is tremendously engaging with plenty of humorous, tense, exciting and genuinely affecting scenes. The ending especially resonated with my entire family, especially my brother, while the scene in the dump is for me Pixar's most intense scene.<br/><br/>I was also delighted with the film's script. The dialogue was always witty and sharp, none of it felt forced in any way. There was the brilliantly judged humour- Buzz speaking Spanish was just one of the highlights and the beginning alone had about 5 or 6 laughs- and also the poignant parts that avoided being overly-sentimental and mawkish.<br/><br/>Another strength is in the characters. All the main characters are as likable as ever, Woody is still determined, Buzz is a sheer delight, Jessie(though I actually like her) is more tolerable here and Mr Potato Head is hilarious. But the new characters are just as wonderful, the baby is both creepy and cute and I felt for him at the end, the cymbal monkey especially for that shriek is one of Pixar's scariest characters, Lotso looks cuddly but is actually shady and bitter with an unrelenting past and Ken is cool without being bland or annoying.<br/><br/>As ever, the voice work is brilliant from all involved, not just from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen but also from Ned Beatty whose crusty demeanour fitted Lotso like a glove.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a truly brilliant film and a fitting conclusion to an amazing trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"hitchcockthelegend","8","4","7","13 September 2010"," They are back to say a fitting farewell as Pixar play safe and emotional in equal measure.
","As Andy prepares to go away to college, Woody, Buzz, and co, face an uncertain future. It seems that their options will be to either be thrown in the trash or stored away in the attic. When a mix up occurs, the toys find themselves at the Sunnyside Daycare Centre and think they have struck lucky after being welcomed by kindly Lotso Bear. However, as Woody frantically tries to convince the others that Andy has not deserted them, it comes to light that Sunnyside is far from the toy paradise they thought it was.<br/><br/>Already Toy Story 3 is breaking records left, right and centre. Boosted by a well earned reputation from the previous two film's in the series, and released in the now popular 3D format, Pixar's daddy was never going to struggle to get the punters into the cinema to see it. That fans have had to wait 11 years for this latest, and almost certainly the final, instalment, has also whetted the appetite considerably. Put simply, the film was guaranteed to rake in the cash before the ink was dry on the first critical reviews for it. The big question is if the Pixar team have managed to triumphantly close down this remarkable trilogy with a film to justify the record breaking.<br/><br/>The answer is yes, tho in truth it probably wasn't really in doubt. However, part 3 has endeared itself to most on account of the emotional pull of the story itself. There's certainly nothing new in the structure of the characters, the same themes exist; toys fret about being left, toys need rescuing, the same neuroses are again evident. Only this time its constructed around a prison-break plot; Toy Story does The Great Escape with a bit of Cool Hand Luke thrown in for good measure. Why Pixar gets away with the familiarity is due to the smooth introduction of new characters, and the afore mentioned emotional weight that pulls away at the old heart strings. The need to move on, retirement, acceptance and casting off ones bitterness are all given the ""adult"" touch as the ""kiddie"" friendly caper unfolds.<br/><br/>With that, part 3 is not as funny as what went before it. Yes it has its moments (Ken & Latino Buzz are high points), naturally, but they are never overtly hilarious moments. This is more about characters that we have grown up with, their humorous traits we already know about, its safe humour, Toy Story 3 is comfortable in more ways than one. But again Pixar get away with it (and we are happy to let them) because they have the balance right with the trilogy. Never too dark to alienate the youngsters (tho one sequence in the finale here brings mortality into question) and never too childish to send the adults to sleep, Pixar remain the governors of commercial family entertainment. The technical aspects remain first class, the animation is crisp and the action sequences continue to bounce off the screen. As for the 3D, this is not about flinging things at the audience, where the 3D works well for Toy Story 3 is that it lets the audience be on the same level as the toys. We are in their world, every nook and cranny enhanced, it's a fine world and one that further shows the genius at work by the Pixar mob.<br/><br/>Inducing tears of pleasure and sadness, Toy Story 3 is undoubtedly a lovely movie. The closure to one of the finest trilogies to have graced the screen. But its record breaking performances should not lend one to think that it's Pixar's masterpiece, because it's not even the masterpiece of its own trilogy. It is, however, one of the highlights of 2010 so far and sure to entertain for many years to come. 8/10"
"pc95","7","4","7","10 August 2010"," Pretty Good Pixar
","I liked the new Toy Story 3 fairly well although it's not quite up to par to many of the newer Pixar releases, and not as involving as the original Toy Story or as entertaining as the Toy Story 2. I'd rank it a little behind ""Up"" in terms of entertainment. It was a fun outing worth catching in the theater. Most (if not all) the original voice actors are back in action and do a satisfactory job of voice work. The underlying story is somewhat slow moving at times while there are a couple standout funny parts, and a good beginning and touching ending. I think it's about time to put this particular movie series to bed although it's original predecessor helped usher in the era for Pixar Movies for which I always have quite high expectations."
"OnlineMovieReview","7","4","7","29 July 2010"," Great Movie - But a Little Dark
","If there are parent reading this that want to take their very young ones to see Toy Story 3 , then I feel obliged to warn you that this movie may not be suitable for children four years of age and younger. Why? Because there are a couple of characters in this movie that are cutesy at times, but frighteningly creepy at other times. If you choose to take your small ones to see the film anyways, just be wary when Lotso and Big Baby are on the screen. Be especially wary of Big Baby. The way Disney uses that character can give nightmares for years.<br/><br/>I saw the first Toy Story movie and enjoyed it. I have not yet seen the second one. I do remember the first one missing that Disney darkness that all Disney productions seem to have. In most Disney movies you are left emotionally drained from the very high ups you are exposed to that lead to the very low downs. Characters die, people cry and the movie can be quite depressing.<br/><br/>But the first Toy Story movie lacked that darkness, and that may be why I was able to enjoy that movie. In Toy Story 3 the darkness is back, and this is one wild roller coaster ride of emotions. The overall theme of the movie is depressing, the action makes you feel helpless and the ending is less than satisfying. I will say that Tom Hanks is a great actor even when you cannot see him acting. The combination of Hanks and Tim Allen still has that magic and that helps bring the movie back around at the end. The problem is the two characters spend most of the movie apart, and the story misses out on that interaction.<br/><br/>I wish I could tell you that Toy Story 3 is a fun movie to just let the kids watch, but that isn't even true. The bad guys are creepy evil, and the sad scenes are drawn out to the point of making anyone depressed. Lighting is used to perfection here, but all it really does is cause a chill to go up your spine.<br/><br/>As an adult I enjoyed this movie. I can handle the emotional roller coaster it puts you on, and the nightmares went away for me within a day or two of seeing the movie. I worry about the kids that will flock to this movie and how long it will take them to recover. It is pretty obvious that Disney is using 3D to try and make the movie interesting rather that relying on the story itself. I don't see movies in 3D because I don't want to get sucked in by the novelty. In the case of this production, I am glad I missed out on the creepy 3D effects."
"nikibabs","10","4","7","29 June 2010"," A hilarious and exciting conclusion to a fantastic trilogy.
","Now, there are many movies out there that are turned into franchises just for a quick buck( Transformers, most horror movies), but every once in a while comes a franchise that actually comes together and shows that there are still movie makers out there who care about their movies. Toy Story is one of those franchises.<br/><br/>1995- this was the beginning of the computer- animation era when Toy Story was released into theaters. It was a technological and cinematic achievement that touched our hearts and entertained us in every way imaginable. It was the movie that introduced us to a whole cast of unforgettable characters that we'll remember for the years to come.<br/><br/>1999- exactly four years after the release of Toy Story 1, the second installment was brought to the big screen. At first planned to be a straight- to home video, everyone had worries for this film, I mean for crying out loud Pixar and Disney nearly broke up over this movie. However, audiences everywhere were profound and amazed at how Toy Story 2 recaptured the magic and heart of the first one.<br/><br/>2010- it's been a long eleven years since the second Toy Story was released and there wasn't a word of a third movie. Eventually, though Toy Story 3 came to theaters finally and I gotta say, it was an amazing experience. Toy Story 3 successfully captures the imagination and heart of the first two while still offering more things. The animation, as always, was top notch and beautiful to look at. The script was HILARIOUS and heartwarming. I'm not going to spoil the movie for you, but I have to say this is the darkest and most mature Pixar movie yet and it may scare younger viewers, so be warned. The last half- hour had me at the edge of my seat until I started to cry suddenly. Toy Story 3 is an amazing movie and if you haven't seen this yet, get up right now, stop reading this review and go see it now. Toy Story 3 is definitely my vote for best movie of the year so far. Simply incredible."

","My hands, no, my whole body is trembling with delight as I try to tap out my simple, jumbled excitement. TS3 has so thoroughly entertained me, it's seems kinda wrong to call it a sequel. While the majority of the fabulous characters are familiar returnees from the previous installments, it stands completely on its own as a triumph of artful, inspired story telling. I haven't sat in a theater in nearly a decade - the hassle, the cost, and the hype all turned me off from movie going. But remembering how magical and deeply moving were TS1 & TS2, I didn't hesitate when I was invited along with some friends.<br/><br/>If live action films could manage to express even half of the wonder and joy that this trilogy possesses, I might consider returning to the multiplex, but it's just not too likely. Today I'm more a fan of mature, serious films, that provoke thought and doubt and self reflection, but this remarkable franchise somehow manages to recharge my draining supply of patience with my fellow world citizens. At my age, 48, it's absurd to find such consolation and inspiration in an animated children's movie, but I'll take it wherever I can get it. (Wall-E, which I watched on cable, comes damn close with it's bittersweet comment on our seriously misdirected society.)

Don't worry, I'm not really fond of watching kid's movies, I'm also an emo who enjoys unhappy ending in many films. So when the 3rd part was released, I was really curious what will the ending be. What will the perfect 10 movie ends like? And how can Toy Story 1 & 2 can be surpassed by Toy story 3 when both already got a perfect 10? (In my book) Well, Toy story 3 answers all that question. It brings all justice to every toy in the 3rd film, Unlike parts 1 & 2, where Woody and Buzz would do all the hero part, All characters share their best job in part 3. They all showed their best to express their love to their respective owners. You won't be disappointed watching this. The adventure, villains, and friendship is still there. Have a great time."

","How long has it been, more than a decade? Woody and Buzz are among the founding members of my world of imagination. I looked at them as pioneers in my belief of boundaryless possibilities and optimism. Now the childhood heroes are finally back, a decade later, and it's absolutely worth the wait.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is just brilliant in every way. True to Pixar's glorious traditions- top-notch art design, animation, voice performance and score. But most of all, kudos to the writers (cheif writer Michael Arndt, Oscar winner for writing Little Miss Sunshine). What an intriguing, beautiful and uplifting story filled with loads of cracking ideas that simply wowed you from time to time with their ingenuity and originality!<br/><br/>Progressively strangled in the numbing professional life, a decade later, I am equally delighted and thankful to find a film that can help me pick up my fading passion for imagination, with laughs and with tears.<br/><br/>I can go on and on but I sense words just wouldn't do justice to such sheer brilliance. The toy stories are truly a trilogy that greatly stretches the imagination of a generation. I have to admit, the primary reason that I'm adding yet another ode on IMDb is I want to associate myself with simply the best animation film of our time.<br/><br/>I can't wait to have the entire trilogy on DVD and watch them all together again and show them to my future generations!"
"Jackpollins","10","4","7","23 June 2010"," A perfect end to a perfect trilogy
","It's very hard to keep a trilogy good for all three movies, or hell, damn near flawless for all three movies. That said, all 3 Toy Story films have been damn near flawless, and the third might even emerge as the best. In Toy Story 3, Andy's going to college, and he has to decide what to take to college, throw away, and put in the attic. Something goes wrong when Buzz, Woody, and all their toy friends get donated to Sunnyside Day Care Center. The day care center is run by Lotso (voice of Ned Beatty), a seemingly nice teddy bear with some evil plans. This Toy Story has everything you would want in a summer blockbuster-action, laughs, thrills, drama, and even moments where if you don't cry, you truly do not have a soul. I enjoyed the addition of Ken (voice of Michael Keaton) and his love for Barbie as well. All the voice actors do amazing jobs. The first 2 Toy Story films were flawless, and this still manages to out beat them. There's a kind of sweetness to all these films that make it so that both kids and adults can enjoy them. Even if you don't have kids, you still need to see Toy Story 3 because it is simply put it, by far the best film of the year so far."

","I noticed that most films in 3D today, wow audiences by usage of superb 3D effects. Here's the problem, movies are now so much based on fancy 3D, they loose focus of storyline and character personality / development.<br/><br/>In Toy Story, I noticed the focus on 3D was minimal, as they focused more on the story, and telling the story in a way that it will be special.<br/><br/>Essentially, the whole gang (with the exception of a few) is there, and you've got the classic scenario we all go through as kids, and that is that you eventually have to put away your toys, and face the fact that you are growing up. There is a special connection between Andy and his toys, namely Woody. A connection that many kids have with at least one toy.<br/><br/>The story has some jokes that adults understand, as well as ones kids understand. When you can have that in a story, you're obviously going to have a well put together plot with plenty of good jokes.<br/><br/>The balance of 3D and story was PERFECT. It had some nice 3D moments, but generally it's a movie you can enjoy equally as much in normal 2D view.<br/><br/>Toy Story is the only series I can say that I liked equally the same for ALL of the films. Each has superb writing, and each has a good cast as well as likable characters.<br/><br/>Sadly, all good things must end, way to go out with a bang."

","Toy Story 3 (1:42, G, Imax, 3-D) — Fantasy: Fairy Tales, biggie, sequel<br/><br/>""When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."" (1 Corinthians 13:11)<br/><br/>But did the childish things want to be put away? That's the question at the heart of Toy Story 3, in which Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks), space ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack), and the rest of the toy menagerie face an uncertain fate after years of being neglected while Andy (John Morris) went thru adolescence and graduated from high school. Now he's preparing to head off to college, and mom (Laurie Metcalf) has come up with her own form of triage: take the toys to college, store them in the attic, or dump 'em in a trash bag for disposal.<br/><br/>There's been a change in the cast of characters since last time. Bo Peep is gone (and we guess from a fleeting expression on Woody's face that there's an untold story there), but Andy's little sister has contributed her Barbie (Jodi Benson, whom I sure hope you all remember as the voice of The Little Mermaid) to the collection that Andy has, reluctantly, decided to donate to the Sunnyside Day Care Center. (The only one he's keeping is his old pal Woody, and this causes some conflicting emotions among the toys.)<br/><br/>There are already a lot of toys at Sunnyside, and they're all under the sway of Lotso (Ned Beatty), short for Lots o'Hugging Bear, a big, pink, furry, strawberry-scented mass of folksy joviality and (it turns out) cynicism. Lotso welcomes the newbies, but they soon discover that it's because he needs cannon fodder for the Caterpillar Room, where the manic toddlers abuse them horribly, so that he and his favored minions can remain safely in the Butterfly Room, where they're treated kindly by the slightly older kids. (The filmmakers at Pixar researched toy treatment at real day-care centers to provide verisimilitude to these scenes.) At night, when the humans are gone, Lotso and his enforcers — Big Baby, Ken, sparkly purple octopus, and the grinning monkey with the cymbals — turn the school into a literal prison, complete with guard towers, spotlights, and roving spotter vehicles.<br/><br/>After a series of misunderstandings and mishaps, Woody has reconnected with his old pals, and they determine to re-enact The Great Escape before they're all ripped to shreds. As always, the main reason a movie goes into detail over a plan of any kind is so you can see where it went wrong when it inevitably does.<br/><br/>I will say no more about the plot other than that there's lots of it, it's all consistent (given the initial premise), and it all works well. While there are some scary moments in the movie, and a few sad ones as well, it deserves its G rating as completely suitable for small children. The dominant feelings you're left with are positive. Loyalty is rewarded; friendship is celebrated; there are lots of laffs, chuckles, and grins; it has a splendid voice cast; the 25th most important character in the movie is as exquisitely rendered as the main ones; and it is a visually sumptuous delight from beginning to end. (I was particularly fond of the cameo appearance by a stuffed Totoro doll in a non-speaking role, a hat-tip to Hiyao Miyazaki from the creative team at Pixar, who are better qualified than anyone else on Earth to know animation genius when they see it.)<br/><br/>I saw Toy Story 3 in Imax and 3-D, because as a movie junkie I crave the most immersive movie-going experience I can get. Both were effective, neither was essential.<br/><br/>I gave Toy Story 2 a 9 (my highest rating), because it contained a couple of scenes that left me so choked up I literally couldn't speak, and that's the mark of a job done to near perfection. Toy Story 3 falls just a skosh short of that standard, but it left me both misty- eyed and smiling. A worthy conclusion to the trilogy. A dandy film. For my money, the best SF&F movie of 2010 so far."

","Every summer, there is always one movie I ask all my friends to see. Although it's only June, ""Toy Story 3"" is my selection for this year.<br/><br/>The story begins with Andy getting ready to go to college and the toys having to choose between abandonment or being donated. Like previous submissions, the toys go through an adventure and discovers that selfish wants are never truly satisfying and friendship is our most valuable possession. Not only was this a rite of passage for Woody and the gang, it was also a life lesson for Andy, the new toys, and everyone in the audience. In typical Pixar fashion, a beautifully emotional script was delivered with strategically-placed comic relief and everyone in the theater experience both tears and joy - Pixar filmmakers have reached the holy grail of cinema and produced one of the best films of this decade.<br/><br/>It will take more than ""The Hurt Locker"" to steal away a Best Picture Oscar from this one."
"Digory","10","4","7","19 June 2010"," Pixar holds nothing back in this final installment of our childhood movie.
","I've had a streak with mediocre and fairly entertaining movies this summer and thankfully Toy Story 3 ended it. This movie had the laughs, the thrills, and at the end of it all you'll be struggling to keep yourself from shedding tears. I don't care if I make it sound overrated or hyped up but what I saw was what I saw: A sequel that lives up to the franchise and so much more.<br/><br/>The voice acting is lively and even for a sequel that is darker compared to its predecessors, the vibrant new characters fill up the screen wonderfully. No longer did I think about Tom Hanks and Tim Allen and co. I was seeing Woody and Buzz and the gang playing out their parts, they all do a great job bringing our beloved friends to life.<br/><br/>I have to be honest, I didn't get teary-eyed by the movie's end but my heart just melted with the emotions. It is a worthy conclusion to my childhood favorite.<br/><br/>An early but very strong contender for the Best Animated Feature and, if things go the way we fans want it, Best Picture Oscar. Simply one of the best movies of this year."
"psofronas","10","5","10","4 January 2011"," Not G rated
","Toy Story was the first movie i ever saw in theaters back in 1996. I've waited 11 years for this to come out and its been a great disappointment. If you've seen any commercial for this movie (except for the Superbowl commercial) you know everything that's going to happen. You know that the toys are going to get donated, they day care seems nice, then the kids turn out to be destructive toddlers and the other toys are evil, woody turns away from everyone else like he does in every other movie. but several plot points in the movie are not appropriate for small children, which the movie is rated for. The movie revolves around how the toys try to escape a Nazi-esquire gang of toys who for some reason are bent on keeping toys from escaping daycare and all of their motives are never determined. Also some parts of the movie are things that fuel kids nightmares. The movie is very dark, grim, and suspenseful especially near the end. The chatter-monkey cymbal banging thing is a demon- like saw trap. He's loud, frightening, performs shock scenes, and his appearance can scare people. Also when woody is sneaking around outside and gets the babies' attention, it performs a silent hill worthy head turning scene like that of which you'd see in the exorcist. Also the baby itself is like Frankenstein because its face is scarred up. Finally the relationship between Barbie and ken has a lot of adult themes such as flirting and other not G rated stuff. Also, the way they portray ken makes him either gay or a transvestite. He acts extremely feminine and most of the other characters treat him like so. The movie itself is extremely obvious, and anyone can tell what's going to happen probably because its exactly like any other jail escape movie. I'm not saying don't see it, just try not to let anyone under the age of 10 see."
"mechwarrior1989","10","5","10","16 June 2010"," Absolutely Amazing movie, fits in perfectly with the first 2.
","I just finished watching this movie not more than an hour ago (released on the 16th in China, hence the 2 day head start on the US). I must say, it was an absolutely amazing film.<br/><br/>Granted, I haven't seen the other 2 toy story movies in years. Yet from my fond memories of them, I can say that this movie ties in quite well with the others. Another reviewer mentioned that the plot elements are similar to the second film, yes that's quite true, however what movies aren't similar when you break them down to the core now a days? The ending was great, it was an excellent way to wrap up the film, and the trilogy (if they do end it with this). Unlike most films, I didn't once stop to check the time or see if the movie was almost over. When it was over it was a very fulfilling ending. I think that's one of the things that pixar is good at. None of the other toy story movies have left off with a cliffhanger ending and yet their still able to tie each movie together perfectly.<br/><br/>As for the 3D effects, I honestly didn't really notice them. It does give some depth to the film but it seems like they just added it as a marketing tool more than anything. I didn't really notice any innovative or interesting uses of the 3D though that may just be because I'm thick.<br/><br/>If you're wavering on watching this film, then don't worry, you'll come out happy, satisfied and you'll laugh quite a bit along the way. (though the rest of the audience didn't laugh as much as me but I'll chock that up to the subtitles not being able to convey what can only be understood through understanding the English)"
"Lysandar","7","10","25","17 June 2010"," Not really for young children
","I note that most of these reviews (so far) have been from people who enjoyed the original Toy Story movies when kids, and who are now adults. For that group I completely agree that this is a great movie. It has grown along with them, and offers a deeper, darker and more emotional story. As an adult, I loved it.<br/><br/>For exactly the same reasons though, as a father of young children I was a bit disappointed. My 5 year old son has watched the first two Toy Story movies countless times, and adores the characters. They are as relevant to him now as they were to others when they first came out. That being said, it's clear that Toy Story 3 was not made for him.<br/><br/>First of all, it's scary. Not haw haw scary, but really scary. Be prepared to comfort a young child often. Secondly, a lot of the humour will go over a kid's head. It still has some great moments, but fewer than the first two films. There's a fairly long scene that involves subtitles, so kids who can't read yet are out of luck. Thirdly, it's long. At almost two hours there will likely be at least one bathroom break required.<br/><br/>I would say the overriding emotion is pathos. It's basically a farewell to much loved characters, but young kids who have just discovered them recently may not be ready to say farewell.<br/><br/>So it's a great movie, but possibly a misleading one for parents with young children. It's not as innocent as the first two, and may leave your kids more sad than happy. It's still worth taking your kids to, but maybe budget some ice cream for afterwards."
"leplatypus","4","8","19","29 October 2010"," Escape from Camp Deadly (3 days Screen Marathon)
","I thought i would have fun but this movie is a bit depressive: toys from our childhood discarded, torture camp for them, burning hell! It's very intense for a cartoon and it frightened indeed my five years old nephews. Thus, the people behind it failed their job.<br/><br/>As an adult, i don't agree with the starting point: when we grow up, we don't throw away our toys. Personally, those toys have built my identity and if they are actually locked, they are saved for my future children.<br/><br/>OK, you will say that this movie is not the point of view of the child but of its toys. But showing that they are discarded is actually a very sad, unhappy way to consider life. That's not the lesson i want to teach my children.<br/><br/>Life is a great joy foremost and the opening sequence of the movie is the only good moment I remember: Life is imagination and imagination is all and is best used with happy thoughts!"
"KenpachiNoPein","6","3","5","2 June 2015"," Predictable Toy Story 2 remake
","This movie has quite a lot in common with Toy Story 2 which I don't care for either. It starts out with the toys being taken away mistakenly (like woody had happen to him in TS2) and woody following. He finds out that they are under the impression that they were purposefully thrown away(like TS2). They are sent to a daycare that is appealing because they are wanted there(like TS2). Woody leaves the daycare only to be picked up by a friendly little girl.<br/><br/>He falls for the girl right away which made me guess that she was going to be their new owner by the end. They find out that the kind old toy who oversees the daycare, Lotso, was really jaded and manipulative(like TS2). This was predictable in TS2 and it is massively obvious here. Finally, this movie becomes its own thing. <br/><br/>Woody finds this out from a toy who, by the power of extreme coincidence, was a toy owned the same person who ""abandoned"" Lotso. He makes a decision to save his friends and begins a generic prison escape. They nearly escape when Lotso blocks their way. He acts like a complete imbecile though and they easily convince the baby character to throw Lotso in the trash but not before he grabs Woody. <br/><br/>They then tread back into TS2 territory. All of the toys end up coming down with woody. They end up at the dump and in peril. Lotso asks for help and the gang saves him. They are then in peril again(wow is this exhausting) as they are pulled toward an incinerator. Lotso sees a ""STOP"" button and the toys help him up to it. When he gets to the top, he leaves instead of stopping the machine(so surprising that the guy who doesn't trust anyone didn't save the people in his way)(also like TS2). <br/><br/>The toys are conveniently saved at the last second(and I thought that all the toys would just die *sarcasm*) and Lotso gets picked up by a horrible owner(just like Stinky Pete in TS2). The toys get home and Woody decides the fate of their whole group by writing a note, saying that the little girl from before would take good care of them. Andy delivers the toys to her and is sad to let them(Woody) go.<br/><br/>So, basically, what I dislike about this movie is: 1)Way too many similarities to TS2 which I didn't even like in TS2 2)Very predictable 3)The subplot of Andy having to accept that he's grown up and has to let his childish things go is a painful, forced message 4)Obvious Latino bait is obvious(I dislike pandering and this does it a lot) 5)I am not a fan of references to previous material(which it does quite a few times. 6) Ken was a shocking stereotype that I hadn't seen in a while 7) The movie treated every character but Woody like a toy(pun intended) 8) Buzz getting turned against them is like TS2 with the evil buzz but without any of the cleverness 9) None of the toys even sympathize with Lotso even though they all know the feeling of being abandoned which just makes them unrealistic"

","Being a big Pixar fan and having loved the previous two Toy Story movies, I went in expecting a fantastic film. All I can say is that I was definitely not disappointed. From the flashy opening scene to the tear jerking ending, this movie had it all. It made you laugh, it made you smile, and it made you cry. Especially as someone who is quickly facing ""the end of their childhood"", this movie really hit home for me. I don't know how Pixar manages to make all of these incredible films, but it definitely succeeded with this one. In addition, it really is a film for all ages, although it may be directed most to those around my age, those of us who grew up with the trilogy. In the theater, I was surrounded by young children laughing and old couples who went without their children, proving that this really is a universal film that can resonate with everyone. :)"

","The gang is back in Toy Story 3 in what may just be the final story. I can't believe it has been 12 years since we last saw Woody and all his pals. If this is the final Toy Story, then it is definitely a good send off. Andy is going off to college so the toys are put in a garbage bag and supposed to be put in the attic. All the toys that is except Woody who is put in Andy's College box to take with him. Mom thinks the bag of toys is garbage, so out they go on the curb. Woody of course saves his friends and eventually they all, even Woody, end up at Sunnyside Daycare Center which turns out to be the Daycare from Hell for toys! The toys are controlled by Lotso the purple stuffed bear who the gang thinks is nice at first. Lotso turns out to be a bitter evil toy who takes out his frustrations on other toys ever since he was abandoned by his owner. Instead of Woody and the gang being in a section with mature kids who take care of toys, they are put in the section where untamed children are their worst nightmare. This Toy Story is a little darker than the others but it is still funny and at times exciting when the toys try to plan their escape from Sunnyside which is anything but sunny. We also get to meet a whole new gang of characters that are a welcome addition to the old gang. Ken and Barbie have some good funny scenes together as well as Buzz and Jessie, the cowgirl. Buzz gets changed at some point into Spanish mode so he falls for Jessie and dances with her. Jessie likes the Spanish Buzz. She finds him to be romantic. The ending will have you on the edge of your seat and probably even cheering for Woody and the gang. And you really will wonder, is this the end for good for our friends? Pixar has a great imagination when it comes to these kind of movies. There are some classic one liners and moments that will even bring a tear to your eye. I plan on seeing this again in the cinema it was that much fun! Welcome Back Toys, and sadly, farewell.."
"tavm","10","3","5","21 June 2010"," Toy Story 3 is an excellent end to the iconic Disney/Pixar series
","Well, after the anticipation caused by the re-release of the first two Toy Story films last October in 3-D, Toy Story 3, in both 2-D and the other aforementioned format finally arrived last Friday. I just couldn't wait so today, my first day off since the weekend, I watched with my movie theatre-working friend who had previously seen it when it arrived and didn't mind rewatching it with me. Anyway, with Andy now grown up and on his way to college, it seemed he didn't need Woody, Buzz, or the others anymore but while he was going to take the cowboy with him, the others were going to the attic but there was a mix-up and somehow they all end up in a daycare center. I'll just stop there and just say I was laughing, crying, and a little scared all at the same time. It's that enjoyable especially with the way Buzz changes in many sequences. Of course, there has to be a villain and he comes in a teddy bear named Lotso, voiced by Ned Beatty. There's a few more surprises but I don't want to spoil them here (though I'm putting a spoiler warning anyway in case you didn't want to know what I just revealed in previous sentences). One more thing, it was nice to hear the return of the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Wallace Shawn, Don Rickles, Estelle Harris, and John Ratzenberger and that Blake Clark did a nice job of replacing the late Jim Varney as the Slinky Dog. Oh, and finding out the director, Teddy Newton, of the preceding short-Day & Night-is the voice of the talking Fisher-Price toy telephone is one of the nice things about reading the IMDb board. So on that note, Toy Story 3 is highly recommended. Oh, and I enjoyed seeing both this and Day & Night in 3-D."

Wishing the same for the Parisian one...). Despite the 3D which I would have put aside, the movie fits well with the above question: where are we ending as toys when our master grows up ? If Woody ends up with Andy going at College, will the rest survive the test of the Day Care Center where children play with toys carelessly, and ruled by a ""so-called lovable"" evil Teddy Bear ? It's up to Woody to think of a plan, or all may end up in a grisly fate...<br/><br/>Barbie and Ken also steals the show in this one.

"loccomotive2000","9","3","5","20 June 2010"," A wonderful way to say goodbye.
","The first Toy Story movie was a milestone in the history of film, being the first ever full-length CG film ever made. And with it's intriguing plot and terrific comedic delivery, coupled with all the elements needed for a great adventure, it was a box-office smash, as was it's sequel. Today, fifteen years later, Woody and co. have come back to the silver screen for one last hurray.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is set a few years after the events of the second film. Andy, the owner of the toys, is now a young man entering college and hasn't played with his old pals for years. After numerous attempts of getting his attention came to no avail, Woody, Buzz, and the remaining of the toys are resigned to the fact that they aren't going to be played with anymore. When only Woody is picked to follow Andy to college, the rest of the toys seek refuge as donations to Sunnyside Daycare, only to realize that there is more to the place than it seems. Now, Woody must help them escape and convince them that they still have a place in Andy's heart.<br/><br/>As with any other Pixar animated films so far, Toy Story 3 carries the same ingenious amount of slapstick comedy which leaves you in laughter and also in awe of it's creativity. The story progresses as a true adventure, as Woody, Buzz and friends maneuver past the countless obstacles with wit and hilarity. Lee Unkrich masterfully displays the imaginative appeal of the first two movies, taking the adventure from a vending machine to within a garbage truck.<br/><br/>TS3 boasts one of Pixar's most daring and laudable aspect in making family movies, in the way they shift the story into a darker tone. And this time, they have raised the stakes to unprecedented heights. While The Incredibles and Up play out the dark tones in a way less obvious to children, the theme of the toys being forsaken and forgotten here forgoes the subtlety, and we are shown the tragic back stories of the toys, and fear for their impending doom. There are a few scenes where the toys were faced with certain destruction. Immensely intense and gripping, it left me at the edge of my seat, having invested so much feelings in it.<br/><br/>Last but definitely not least is how this movie can affect any individual emotionally. Up till the end, the whole movie had been about having to let go of things, and by the final act, it was about learning to do it. Without revealing too much, let me say that the ending not only offers closure for Andy's emotional attachment, but is also a fitting send off for the icons we have come to know fifteen years ago. It brilliantly evokes a sense of nostalgia not only to the films, but to our very own childhood, where we had so much fun exploring the powers of the imagination to not just our toys, but the unventured world out there.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 maintains the form of the first two films, being a wonderful mix of comedy, adventure, and a message about life. It is an excellent and heartfelt tribute to a franchise that has not only earned a place in history, but a special place in the hearts of so many people. And wherever we go in life, when we look back at these movies, it will be with a smile, rekindling our very own childhood memories. <br/><br/>To Infinity and Beyond."

They made me crave Toy Story 3 unlike any other film this summer, and after seeing Pixar's creative output in the past few years, is there any reason to why I should not have been hyped? <br/><br/>Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen) and the gang (less a few members) are still in Andy's (John Morris) room despite having not been played with for years. Andy has gotten older, and has matured beyond his time playing with toys. They attempt to coax him into playing with them, but he has no time. He is moving away to college, and his mother wants him to pack what he is taking and get rid of the rest. She encourages donating the toys to a local daycare. While Woody is against the idea, everyone else is enthusiastic about being played with again. But after arriving at daycare (without Andy's knowledge), they change their minds quite quickly.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is just as simplistic as the previous two films, and has the same main goal (return to Andy), but it feels like a much more mature and accomplished work on the part of the filmmakers. It was a wise choice to set the film so many years after Toy Story 2, not just because it has been that long since the film came out, but because it resonates with the audience on a level so much greater than anyone could expect. I mentioned my initial nostalgia when I re-watched the first two films a few months back. All those emotions and feelings came flooding back the moment Toy Story 3 began, and never faded away once. It only became greater as the film went on. And having seen the film in a packed theatre of young adults who were old enough to have seen the original two films when they were kids, I doubt I was the only one who felt this way.<br/><br/>The film, much like last year's fantastically brilliant Up, is an adventure unlike any other. Pixar truly has the most creative minds working behind the scenes, and it shows in how wacky and imaginative this film is. It may play on similar themes from the past, but everything old manages to feel new again here. The film may not be as unique or wildly original as Up or WALL-E, but it still has the heart and charm these other Pixar films have. They really are the most consistent company currently making films, and it shows in their increasingly fascinating creative output.<br/><br/>What takes away from the greatness and legacy of Toy Story 3 are the jumping tones. This was a problem Up handled quite well in how immediate and focused it was. But with Toy Story 3's increasingly expanding stable of characters and development of new characters like Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty) and Ken (Michael Keaton), it becomes a little troublesome for the film's direction and tonal structure. It never becomes a distraction for the most part, but it comes off at times like Pixar is trying to cram too much into the film. I understand it is the last hurrah and the film that brings closure to this legendary series, but there could have been significantly more focus in some scenes. I have heard complaints about the nightmarish direction parts of the film takes, but this easily would not have been a problem had not begun weaving around in sections.<br/><br/>But any problems the film has are forgiven by one of the most beautiful and bittersweet endings ever put to the format. It is so emotionally charged and so wonderful that you instantly forget anything you had against the film. If we had to suffer through some less than great scenes, they are all made up for in the ending. It speaks volumes for the franchise, and is almost heartbreaking to watch. I want to say more, but I fear for spoiling it for anyone who has yet to see the film. It is hard to not forge an emotional response to the finale, and you may need to sit through the wildly entertaining credits to regain your composure afterwards.<br/><br/>As with every Pixar film, the voice acting and animation are incredible across the board. Listening to the likes of Hanks and Allen chatting again is like being in a room with old friends you have not seen in awhile, but have not changed at all since. New additions like Beatty, Keaton, Jeff Garlin and especially Timothy Dalton are all excellent as well. The animation is so precise and detailed to a level of perfection that only Pixar can give. The years away have only made these characters look even better than they ever have, and has given the backgrounds and human characters an even greater depth of realism. Not once does Pixar skimp on any detail in any instance.<br/><br/>It is not the perfect picture on the whole that I wanted it to be, but Toy Story 3 is a great finale to the series and another great entry in the Pixar canon. What disappointment there is is immediately taken away by a touchingly beautiful finale. This is not Pixar at its finest hour, but it only further cements their status as the best studio in the business of animation, and film-making in general.<br/><br/>9/10."
"Argemaluco","9","3","5","19 June 2010"," Toy Story 3 is a wonderful film
","With Cars and Wall-E, I saw a declination in the narrative quality of the studio Pixar.Do not misunderstand me...I liked them both, but I did not feel in them the charm from films like Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo or The Incredibles.After Wall-E, Pixar made the brilliant Up, which is in my humble opinion, one of the best movies made by the studio so far (I think the only ones which surpass it are Ratatouille and the previously mentioned The Incredibles).So, I did not know what to exactly expect from Toy Story 3...was it going to be made by the magic Pixar or the solid, but not highly memorable Pixar? Now, after having watched the movie, the answer is definitely the first one.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is a wonderful, very satisfactory and hugely entertaining film which is ideal to be watched by the whole family...and the best thing of all is that, at the difference of many contemporary animation films (like Madagascar or Planet 51), it never insults the audience's intelligence.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3's brilliant screenplay is enriched by deep subjects which are hidden behind the characters' adventures, jokes and rescues, which are the key element which distinguish it (along with all the other Pixar movies) from many hollow animation films.The voice acting is very solid, and the members who most stand out are Michael Keaton, Timothy Dalton and the great Ned Beatty.Another thing I liked very much is the animation, which respects the style from Toy Story 1 and 2.In films like Wall-E and Up, Pixar showed it can achieve extraordinary levels of realism on that field, but not because of that they felt obliged to take Toy Story 3 to those levels.Sure, the elements and the illumination feel more natural, and there are many visually impressive scenes; but the general look from the movie keeps the same tone and style from the first two parts from the trilogy.<br/><br/>The only fail I found on this movie is that a few narrative elements feel a bit out of place.But that is a minor fail which not in any way tarnished the great experience I had while watching this film.Needless to say I enthusiastically recommend it."

I have to say, this movie was very touching and just a wonderful movie overall. It really surprised me in a lot of places, and in a way I would never expect. It was deep.<br/><br/>Let me tell you, I grew up watching these movies. In fact, these movies were my whole childhood!

But last year, I could NOT believe the news!<br/><br/>I came to see this movie today with two of my good friends, and we both grew up with Toy Story. Throughout the movie, we came close laughed and came close to crying in some parts. Most of the movie, we were laughing, but at the furnace part , when they all held hands when they thought they were at their certain doom, we all felt a little sad. Our whole childhood was going down the drain. It made us all worry. But it was so deep.<br/><br/>Then at the end, when Andy was saying goodbye to his toys, you felt that sadness too.

","I won't play with words - Toy Story 3 is the best film I've watched in a long time. It may be the best movie I've ever watched, actually - I was amazed, blown away, driven to tears. I laughed, cheered, cried. It made me feel alive, like very few movies before it.<br/><br/>It's no secret - Pixar is the studio that cannot make a bad movie, even if they tried. But this movie goes far beyond anything they have ever done - they have made a CG movie that makes any live action one feel wooden and... fake.<br/><br/>The Toy Story Trilogy is a tribute to every single value that makes us human beings. It has love, friendship, values. It dares to explore the most complex of human emotions via a bunch of plastic toys. It goes places where adult movies rarely dare to go, because they don't have a worthy comment about anything in the end.<br/><br/>Pixar understands human nature, and makes us proud about it. Thank you, Pixar, for devoting your lives and souls to making movies. Thank you for Woody, Buzz, Hamm, Rex, and the rest. Thank you for making me laugh, cry, think and contemplate life. Your legacy will surely not be forgotten soon."

","Any sequel reflects the original and while I adore A New Hope over any of the other Star Wars, or Back to the Future part 1, or Godfather (obviously), I fell in love with Toy Story 3. I thought the first two were unbeatable but I stand corrected. Toy Story 3 packed such a punch, I laughed, I (almost!) cried, and I feel like I should break out my old toys and play with them for ol time's sake. The opening scene (hilarious) and the climax (Ahhh!) are what sold me. The story and writing alone is amazing; add the graphics and it is phenomenal. I am not the hugest fan of CG or 3D over the old school but you can't help but wander how long it takes to design hair or fur to wave like that in the breeze. Earlier complains have been that it is perhaps not best for small children. There are some innuendos and dark moments but Disney has always pushed the envelope on dark moments (e.g. Mufasa, Black Cauldron, Up's beginning heartbreaking montage) Will Disney/Pixar ever stop playing with my emotions?? Not with music like this. 10 out of 10: a must-see"
"RussMcClay","10","3","5","19 June 2010"," Simply Outstanding and Great Entertainment
","I've watched the first two Toy Story movies many many times.<br/><br/>I had few expectations when my 17 year-old daughter asked if we could take the whole family to go see Toy Story 3 for her 17th birthday. <br/><br/>This would be my first 3D movie in a theater and that is my only complaint about the film. I don't think 3D added much to the movie. I moved my glasses up a number of times and scenes where the characters were close were in focus and so much clearer and brighter. I would like to see it again in 2D. <br/><br/>In Toy Story 3 Andy is 17 and getting ready to go to college so he is packing everything up including all the old familiar toys. He finally decides to store all the toys in the attic except for Woody which he puts in a box marked ""College"". This then is the premise of the story: Woody doesn't want to leave his friends; but they are not happy with the idea of being put in an attic and not being played with. <br/><br/>Through a very clever set of events they all end up at a day care center which turns out to be a living hell for newly arrived toys. A hell which they want to escape as they realize the importance of their loyalty to Andy which Woody helped them to understand. <br/><br/>There are some very dark scenes at the day care center and for those that grew up with the previous installments it's OK, but I don't think very young children will have an easy time with it and that also holds true for much of the dialog. <br/><br/>Also, while it would be very helpful to have see either Toy Story or Toy Story 2 or both, Toy Story 3 could stand on its own and could be very much appreciated by someone who hasn't seen the previous two. <br/><br/>There are some truly funny scenes; for me the Spanish Buzz Lightyear was just hilarious! Mr and Mrs Potato Head had relatively large roles and were great. I'm happy to say I was quite impressed with Don Rickles contribution. <br/><br/>The main reason I felt compelled to write a review is that as a 55 year old man the last thing I expected to happen was that I cried towards the end of the film. Toy Story 3 is a masterpiece in storytelling and 3D animation, but also it reaches emotional depths. <br/><br/>I saw this today in a packed Taiwanese theater of mostly Taiwanese adults who had to rely on subtitles and there was every evidence that they were enjoying it as much as I was. <br/><br/>I am very much looking forward to seeing it again. In 2D though."

","Last night (technically, this morning) at 12:01 am, I was sitting next to my friends. We were all eager to see what was waiting for us. Pixar had our childhood in their hands, would they be able to deliver? Even though Pixar has never disappointed me, I still had some worries deep down in my heart.....<br/><br/>All of those worries were blown away by the first scene. If you were into Toy Story and could remember certain lines, you could catch a lot of references in that first scene alone.<br/><br/>As the story progressed, I quickly realized how much more emotional and darker it was then the other films...... it was something that I would not have understood as much if I watched as a kid..... I checked spoiler free, so I can not go into detail about this, but after seeing the film, you will have the same feeling I did.<br/><br/>That being said, even with the dark, emotional times, there was a lot of laughs. The jokes were hilarious, I was laughing from start to finish! By the time the ending credits rolled along, I got up on my feet, and clapped. I was joined by the entire theater. We were all thinking the same thing. This movie delivered. If I could rate this an 11, I would, believe me I would. Somehow, it surpassed the first film. It is Pixars greatest triumph. It is better then any animated movie made. Hell, it even jumped straight to #1 on my list of favorite movies in general! This movie was simply perfect. Crisp animation. Great laughs. Perfect Pathos. I was on the verge of tearing up at points of it, sometimes out of laughter, sometimes, out of sadness.<br/><br/>I KNOW that the people that are going to down rank this movie are going to do so on the fact that this movie are going to do so because of the emotional ride this film was, maybe not something kids would quite grasp..... but for people like me, who grew up with this film, this was perfect.<br/><br/>11/10."

"TheDirectorofFoo","8","3","5","18 June 2010"," The Toys are Back and Better Than Ever!
","Long ago in the middle of the crazy 90's, a totally unknown animation studio announced that an animated feature film named ""Toy Story"" would be released to the public. It was expected to fail, and the world didn't know much about Pixar at the time. But this film would lead on to become a full blown phenomenon, making toys based on it, video games, and a sequel that would be released 4 years later. That sequel would go on to be one of the most successful and greatest sequels of all time. Both received an almost impossible feat with 100% scores on a critic's website entitled Rotten Tomatoes. People were curious to whether the third would be a success, and they were shown as it itself received a 100% on the website as well.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" is the second follow up to the widely successful series of films. It shows Andy all grown up, heading out for college. The toys are frantic and worried, not knowing what to do. Andy plans to put all of the toys in the attic, but they accidentally get thrown into the trash. Luckily, they escape, but to the wrong box and are given to donations for the Sunnyside Dare Care. A seemingly happy, caring place for the loving toys. But as they discover there are a few things going on that could destroy them all, they plan to escape to get back to Andy.<br/><br/>Many things happen in ""Toy Story 3"" that make me proud to be a fan of the trilogy, such as Buzz turning to the Spanish language and theme, the toys planning to escape as if it were a prison, and a special cameo from the evil Sid from the first film (It's very small, look out for it, he's a garbage man).<br/><br/>The film and trilogy concludes with a nice, peaceful closing of the toy's adventures after a loud, intense, hilarious, and spastic series of events from the beloved toys. I will not tell you the ending, but I will warn you, bring a box of tissues. Those very sensitive in movies will choke up. (No, it isn't sad).<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" brings all that a Pixar lover would suspect. An original, funny, emotional, beautiful story about the travels of some of the funnest and loving characters ever written. The voice talents of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, John Ratzenburger and everyone else return to their original characters, as well as some new actors featuring Michael Keaton as Ken, Barbie's longtime lover. Screenwriters do it again as they deliver a quite good, but not quite as clever as the first film, screenplay and still deliver the laughs. But what quite caught me more than anything was the beautiful animation. Never has Pixar done better with their wonderful team to deliver the cleanest looking Pixar world ever. Every detail is filled. Wonderful.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Toy Story 3"" was an astounding film. Pixar has truly delivered the greatest trilogy of all time. After the exciting wait of over 11 years for the finale of the beloved series, it was definitely worth it as I emotionally watched the words ""Toy Story 3"" appear on the screen and as the camera showed the final shot of the beautiful clouds in the sky. 11 years is an extremely long wait, but it was worth it.<br/><br/>Pixar has done it again. And succeeded.<br/><br/>10/10"
"taylormorgan12","7","8","20","18 June 2010"," We Waited 11 years, and here it is!
","I just got back from a midnight showing and knew I must write my review, so here it is ladies, gentlemen and children of all ages...<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 has brought together all of our favorite characters once again in the last installment of the childhood film most of us have grown up on. While the 3-D effects are better than what I have seen in previous 3D movies this year, there was something a lot different about this film than the other.<br/><br/>It was dark, and lacked its 'gift' that Pixar always used to bring to us, which is the feeling of being a child again and smiling as we remember those days then when sometimes we wondered if our toys really did come alive. There are a few scenes (actually half the movie) is dark and definitely scary for a 4 year old. The humor is dry and I only laughed outloud 3 times, though everyone else was cracking up because of some drunk in the front row who constantly screamed.<br/><br/>I felt something was missing a well. Buzz Lightyear. No, he was in the movie. But he really did not make a ""Last""ing impression on me and wished there was more to see. Also, same with the alien guys, ""The claaaaaaaw!"" The ending was good though, aside from some scary bits and highly disturbing images for small children, it rounded off nicely and finally lightened up much like a depressed person taking a prozac. I also kept wondering whatever happened to Sid, the demonic kid down the street...<br/><br/>In all honestly, I don't think this film deserves the super high rating it has gotten because it lacks the spark its previous two films had. I give it a 7/10. It was decent, but not the best out of the 3. That would have to go to the original Toy Story."
"omelette-567-92656","6","4","8","25 January 2013"," Technially excellent, good storyline, but.....
","I have got to admit that I am constantly bemused by the way people rate movies.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is without doubt technically brilliant, has a good storyline and leaves the viewer with an adequate 'feel-good' factor having watched it. But come-on, after spending 200,000,000 on it, isn't this kind of expected?<br/><br/>For me, the most important contributing factor to how a movie should be rated has to do with its 're-watch-ability' - you do think you will re-watch a particular movie any time soon, and if so, what about more than once?<br/><br/>This is where Toy Story 3 bombs with me.<br/><br/>Having watched Toy Story 1 & 2 a single time, I can honestly say that I will also not be watching Toy Story 3 anytime soon.<br/><br/>Yet this movie rates higher, often much higher, than all of the following movies, all of which I have watched multiple times already and would readily re-watch again. So, off the top of my head, and with the 'best' first;<br/><br/>Terminator 1,2. Avatar. Matrix 1. Fight Club. Oh Brother Where Art Thou. Back To The Future 1,2,3. Blade Runner. The Fifth Element. As Good As It Gets. Moon. Inception. Zoolander.<br/><br/>That's a few that in my opinion are far better movies that Toy Story 3, yet the official IMDb stats here in no way reflect this."
"white-37","6","4","8","17 October 2010"," Toy Story 3 is not the breakout animated film of the year...
","How To Train Your Dragon is. I'll make it simple, as mystifying as my words may read. Toy Story was a good movie; not because it was original - The Brave Little Toaster has the honor of that. No, and not just because it's characters are memorable and the movie is entertaining, which are all true. But what is so special about Toy Story is that it is the first movie ever to be made entirely of CGI. It worked wonders with toys... not so much with human beings. Buzz and Woody's friendship is touching and their subplots through out the movie to return to Andy are inspiring. Good work Pixar, original - no. Worth the watch - definitely! <br/><br/>Toy Story 2 changes things up the second time out. The characters are all memorable - Jessie in particular has that tear - inspiring moment - and it's all good and entertaining like before. Continuing with Buzz and Woody's friendship is Buzz 'to the rescue' of his friend when he becomes disllusioned with himself and his true toy heritage (a lovely 50's homage with Sputnik thrown in for good measure; though done quite a bit better in The Iron Giant which was also released that year; 1999) and it all still carries the Pixar CGI to new levels.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3. It's been not ten years but eleven years. Andy's a bore, his dog's a snore and the toys have a reason to deplore. It's exactly like Spiderman 3. Good ideas but just no proper pacing. Woody and Buzz - who saw each other for short intervals in TS2 - have maybe two moments together and their unlikely teamwork was the birth of beauty that gave lift to TS1 and helped elevate TS2 up enough so that it didn't plummet. What could have been an emotional turn for one of the best scenes in animation was abruptly cut short... because the kiss up aliens had to 'save the day' and what was a sweet gesture at the end where Andy gives his toys away turns into an awkward play session.<br/><br/>No more, Pixar. No more."

","Toy Story one and two were very decent movies. The animation was excellent and the actual storyline was entertaining, even for the adult audience. Toy Story 3 maintains the excellent visual effects and Pixar's animation is excellent as always. But the story writers fell asleep at the pen and pad this time around. The battle of good and evil, the friends and foes was perhaps a little too intricate for the intended viewing audience. Children. Disturbingly enough for adults you were taken on this emotional roller coaster of loss, anxiety, fear, deceit, and just about everything else. How the writers bring this coaster to its finish was even more poor. This really wasn't the movie that I think many children would have learned anything from, let alone enjoyed. -Ravi Shanghavi, Ottawa"

This movie has just so much thought and depth into it it's incredible!<br/><br/>Let me take a step back... I grew up on Toy Story 1, I loved it, thought it had a great message to it, a lot of humor, and just an overall fantastic movie. Now, Toy Story 2 came out and I was so excited! But then I saw it, and became deeply disappointed. I didn't enjoy the new characters, I didn't enjoy the story line, everything from top to bottom i didn't enjoy. It was because Toy Story 1 left me with such a good feeling that I could never imagine a movie from the same creators to go bad. I'm sure most of you will disagree with me on this one, but I just was not a big fan of the 2nd installment. Once I heard that Pixar was making a 3rd Toy Story I got sad. I thought that they already killed it with the 2nd one and I didn't know why they would butcher it anymore. <br/><br/>Let me just be clear with all of you, I am such a big fan of Pixar and all of they're movies (other then Cars) and I get excited for every single one of they're movies, so I'm not a movie buff. I'm not just randomly criticizing, I'm being sincerely honest. <br/><br/>Now back to Toy Story 3... I saw a couple of trailers a year ago, thought it looked cute, still had it's humor, but I didn't believe it could bring back the 1st one. I was wrong. Toy Story 3 had it all. The heart. The moral. The friendships. The loyalty. And above all - the humor. It was by far one of the greatest Pixar movies created (let alone ANY movie created) and i believe it'll make it's way to the Oscars, and god willing win some. This movie not only kept me smiling the entire time, but brought my faith back into Toy Story. I'm sorry if this may surprise anyone, but I think that this Toy Story was as good as the 1st, or possibly even better.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if this wasn't the type of review you were looking for, but the reason why i didn't say too much about the film itself was because I do NOT want to ruin anything for you. I wish that all of you who read this go see this movie, whether your a 5 year old, or a 42 year old. It's enjoyable to all ages, and it'll never be forgotten."

Along the way, they meet interesting characters such as the cute, strawberry smelling bear that is not what he seems to be or the hilarious Ken or Big Baby. <br/><br/>The story is specially hilarious in the first 40 minutes before it humanizes the toys and gives them a human story. There are funny moments throughout but they are mostly replaced in the latter part by poignant story and decisions that have to be made. The ending is particularly poignant and bittersweet since it is the end of an era and the beginning of a new one.<br/><br/>I went with extremely high expectations and Pixar delivered. I'm undecided if this movie is better than the first one but it is definitely better than the second one.

Back in 2009 one night I watched a trailer for the movie and I was really pumped up,and boy was it worth it. I didn't know what to expect with the movie but the creativity from Pixar. It was darker than I think anyone expected, the villain was creepy, the plot was a masterpiece, and the ending was tear-jerking. I also think his is the movie that fully showed the strong relationship with Buzz and Jessie, thanks to this movie I ship them, the previous movie did good with them too but there was only a scene or two that showed that relationship. We'll just wait to see what the next movie brings and if it can top this movie (which I doubt)."
"sol-","Null","2","3","24 February 2017"," Falling with Style Part 3
","Convinced that a now college-aged Andy intended to throw them out, his toys take refuge at a daycare centre with unexpectedly rough kids in this third film in the ""falling with style"" franchise. The movie tackles slightly different ideas to what we have seen before with Andy torn between moving on and hanging onto the toys he once cherished. There is also a magnificent sequence in which are treated to the detailed insides of a landfill station. For the most part though, the plot of 'Toy Story 3' bares such a strong resemblance to Parts One and Two that it never quite feels like a motion picture of its own. Once again, the story is propelled by the toys not believing and trusting Woody (as per the first film) before meeting an antagonist who initially appears friendly and jolly, which then leads to them making a daring escape (as per the second film). The antagonists in both the second and third film even meet with similar fates! The themes and issues are also strikingly familiar with owners who move on and toys who find themselves no longer wanted. The film does have novelties up its sleeve though. The Mr. Tortilla Head scenes are delightfully zany and the parody of prison escape movies works quite well. There are also some great new toys - even if they do not get a whole lot of screen time. Capped off with an emotionally charged finale (watch for Andy's face and eyes), it is easy to see why many have been won over by the charm of 'Toy Story 3', even if it does not pull in anywhere near as many new directions as the previous films."

","For my money Toy Story could be as close to a perfect Trilogy as you will ever get. This third outing is on par with the brilliant last movie which I adored.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Set several years after the events of ""Toy Story 2"" Andy is now 17 and ready to head off to college, leaving Woody, Buzz, Jessie, and the rest of the toy-box gang to ponder their uncertain futures. He decides to take Woody with him, but Buzz and the gang are put in a black bag to go in the attic. When the toys are accidentally donated to the Sunnyside Daycare Center they're overjoyed to once again be played with, but their joy quickly gives way to horror as they learn the true nature of the establishment under the rule of the deceptively welcoming ""Lotso"" Huggin Bear. Now, all of the toys must band together in one final, crazy mission to escape their confines and return home before Andy leaves. <br/><br/>All the cast are again brilliant with Ned Beatty and Michael Keaton joining the fun this time around.<br/><br/>This is fantastic, funny, action packed, tension filled and heartbreaking all in equal measure. I'm not going to lie I shed a tear or twenty at the end. It's not giving too much away when I say, as the gang sat holding hands accepting their fate towards the finale, I had tears streaming down my face, and they remained till the final credits rolled."

","Toy Story 3 was the best out of the three. It had a bigger impact on audiences than the first two combined. It had an amazing story, many new characters, the original crew is back too! When I first saw the film, I thought is was going to suck. The commercials made it seem that the movie had way too much time and money put into it, but all of the time, money and energy put into it really paid off. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. It does have its flaws. I mean, it didn't have many of the characters featured in the previous movies, but there are more good things than bad. In conclusion, I think it raises the bar for great movies. I would recommend it for all ages."

","The main characters are toy who have will. Woody who is cow boy live in Andy's house. He is Andy's favorite toy. Andy always say that Woody is my best friend. This movie is about incidents about toys. We can easily sympathy with these toys. Because we see the world as toy's view. In TOY STORY 1, Andy is a child. However in TOY STORY 3, Andy becomes a university student. 1 and 2, we enjoy toy's adventure. However 3rd one describes the relationship Andy with Woody. The main remarkable point is that enemy is also toy. We can see a parting child with toy. Also we remember the time when we were children. This movie moves our heart. I strongly recommend it."

This is the movie guaranteed to make you cry, and I'm not the kind of person to cry during movies, but this one did! It's a must see movie,watch it by yourself, watch it with your family, watch it with your dog,watch it with your neighbor!!! You just need to see it!This is a must see movie!

"johndhuff","9","2","3","29 July 2014"," Toy Story 3 is a must see, with tons of laugh's and touching moments that everyone can relate too.This is by far one of the best endings to a trilogy that I've seen.
","In 1995 Toy Story first touched our lives introducing a wide cast of characters that we have grown to love. Toy Story 2 was released in 1999 and now in 2010 Toy Story 3. I was ten years old when Toy Story hit the screen. Now 15 years later I find myself still amazed and attached to the warm characters that have followed me into adulthood. <br/><br/>The demanding trials and the wonderful sense of love, and friendship that the characters have for each other another is what has made this trilogy a success. I've always enjoyed their hardships, always sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens next. The storyline for all three films share very similar themes with the constant fear of being abandoned, or the idea of being forgotten. This theme is even stronger in this third part of the story. The movie emphasizes the bonds of friendship and courage, while showing how the feeling of abandonment and loss can turn someone for the worse. With tons of laugh's and touching moments that everyone, young and old can relate too. It's a great experience to watch how their views of the world and concerns display the toy characters that they are. The relationship that the toys have with their owner has always been very interesting to me. <br/><br/>It's been 11 years since Toy Story 2 and the voice of John Morris now 23, plays Andy once again. Andy has outgrown his toys and is about to move to college. This is the fear that his toys have had for years. <br/><br/>As the plot unfolds the toys are fooled into thinking Andy has thrown them away. The toys frantically escape from the trash bag and end up in a nearby box in the garage labeled Sunnyside daycare. They're caught off guard by Andy's mother and accidentally donated to Sunnyside. <br/><br/>At Sunnyside we're introduced to many new toys. At first glance Sunnyside seems like heaven for Woody and the rest of the gang. There are always children to play with them and they no longer feel heartbroken or unwanted. However, the toys soon find out that Sunnyside is not quite what it seems. <br/><br/>There are many great scenes that make this move an eye wiper. There is a very mature scene for its targets audience involving a Lord of the Rings type feel. It is a very dark and dramatic moment. All the feelings of love and friendship are fully shown as the fate of the toys hang in the balance.<br/><br/>The movie comes to a close with one of the most impressive and well directed conclusions Pixar has come up with. Andy plays with his toys as a young adult one last time, remembering his childhood. It's a bitter sweet welcome of adulthood and the parting of childhood. This is the first time Woody, Buzz and the rest hear how Andy truly feels about them. He shows how much he appreciates that they have always been there for him and the friendship they given him through the years.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is a must see for everyone. It's a beautiful story about memories and the passing of time. How you treat the people in your life. It reaches out to the parents in the audience as they have watched their own children grow and learn about life through the toys they played with. It's a funny and touching farewell to the characters we've all come to know and love. One of the best endings of a trilogy I have seen to date."
"Vartiainen","Null","2","3","5 May 2014"," Fitting ending to a great trilogy
","It is refreshing to see a third movie in a trilogy that's just as good if not better than the previous ones.<br/><br/>Such is the case with Toy Story 3 that continues the story of Woody and Buzz and all their friends. Time has come for Andy to go to college and the toys are yet again faced with the crisis of abandonment. It amazes me that Pixar has managed to tell pretty much the exact same story three times now yet it always feels fresh. Because the story really is always the same. Something happens to the toys that makes them fear they're going to be cast aside or forgotten, this fear leads them to overreact, which causes complications, adventures happen and in the end they've learned a lesson and everything turns for the better. It's like clockwork, it's that predictable, but strangely I don't mind. The circumstances do change and the story always changes a little bit, but I still think it would have been annoying if not for the iron tight storytelling of Pixar's finest.<br/><br/>A large part of it is also the fact that Toy Story is a very heavily character-driven franchise. And the characters do evolve. From Buzz and Woody becoming friends to the addition of new characters to the loss of old ones, the characters grow up along with us. And that doesn't change here. This movie has some of the best character moments in the whole trilogy and it's a fitting conclusion to their saga. Pretty much all the voice actors reprise their roles and they're as great as always.<br/><br/>My only real gripe about this film is the ending. I know a lot of people love it, but I think most of those people are a bit younger than I am. I'm a 90s kid and I grew up with Disney. I only started watching these movies as an adult. Whereas those kids that grew up in the 00s and with Pixar have a much more nostalgic relationship with the Toy Story characters. So for them the ending is a real tearjerker. For me it's one of the corniest things I've ever seen. I know what they were going for and for their target audience it very well might have been the exact right call, but it still doesn't remove the fact that my jaw literally dropped when I saw Andy acting the way he did. No 17-year-old I have ever met, seen or heard of would act that way in real life. Yes, it's a movie and allowed to take liberties, but you see the problem I'm having, right?<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a great movie. At times it's surprisingly dark, but never in a way that feels threatening or unnecessary. And it's always warmhearted, gentle, mature and uplifting. It's the perfect way to end this story."
"myungjahigh","10","2","3","27 February 2012"," reminds me of my childhood
","Toy story 3 is definitely one of my favorite films ever. I watched toy story 1 and 2 when young, and i didn't have any practical concept about favorites at the time. Hence I would say that Toy story becomes my favorite quite recently. (but i am sure i enjoyed 1&2 a lot) Around the time when I am getting old and getting to forget about first and second series of toy story, i rushed into the theater right after hearing that toy story 3 is released. And some hours later, i found myself crying and this movie became actually one of my best. i must mention about the short but great story called 'day and night' shown before the movie. This brilliant idea and humanism Pixa makes always leads people to their childhood and purity even before the movie really starts. Such a great opening. While toy story 3 went, I could take lost parts of my childhood out to the real. It describes so well all the toys' feelings toward the process that one child who used to be the closest friend of them is actually moving on to a grown up who would not play with them anymore. And the fact that the process is a kind of destiny of human beings make it sadder. However, the film is not filled only with sadness. Of course on the one hand, it is quite tragic that toys got nothing but their human friends, and humans are destined not to take all of their toys to the society. On the other hand, however, it would suggest some ideas that we can possibly see the world in a different way. Toy Story 3 seems to change the trend and stereotype that toys only belong to children. As a genre, animation itself is usually considered as a child's one. but Toy Story 3 shows that grown ups actually can get impressed and enjoyed with all their hearts through animations. Toy Story 3 made me realize there were some moments I fell asleep hugging my toys and dolls. it was so nice and amazing to watch toy story again as an adult with the childhood memories. Another amazing fact! Toy story series itself has passed time and got old with us together. The producers, voice actors, and even the graphics. That might be a reason that people are moved more."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","3","24 December 2010"," Certainly Lives Up to Everything You've Heard
","Toy Story 3 (2010) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Andy is about to go to college so he must start cleaning out his room and packing up what he wants to take with him while everything else goes to the attic. His toys accidentally get put in the trash pile and soon wind up in a daycare where they think Andy has thrown them away but it's up to Woody to convince them that Andy still loves them. Hearing too much hype about a film can often lead a viewer to walk away disappointed as the hype usually gets in the way of one actually enjoying a film to its fullest level. I had heard so many great things about TOY STORY 3 that I was rather skeptical even though I enjoyed the first two movies. I'm glad to say this is one example where the film certainly lived up to the hype and actually managed to be better than everything I had heard. While I still think UP is a better movie this one here has a terrific story, a wonderful imagination and some truly great moments including the final twenty-minutes, which contain just about every type of emotion that you could hope for. At the same time I'd add that this movie is certainly more for adults than it is kids because I can imagine that the ending would have many young kids traumatized due to the suspenseful scene where the toys end up in the garbage and are about to fall into a burning pit of fire. The sequence is beautifully done and heartfelt but at the same time I had to remind myself that this was a kids movie but then again Spielberg's E.T. had this same type of drama and I viewed it as a child just like so many kids will be viewing this film. The final twenty-minutes, which I won't ruin, are downright brilliantly directed and you can't help but smile at how the film ends. The film is a beautiful tribute to the impact toys can have on a kids life and how one feels when they must finally give them up. I thought the screenplay did a terrific job at highlighting this but it also made the wise decision to have all the toys in the action. Woody, Buzz, the Potato Heads, Slinky Dog and the rest of the gang are back but we have several new toys including the bad bear with the voice of Ned Beatty. Hanks, Tim Allen and the rest of the gang do their typical great work but Beatty really does a marvelous job and nearly steals the film as one second he can be lovable but the next second downright evil. The visual effects keep getting better and better and the ones here are certainly the best I've seen to date. The opening sequence really puts you in the middle of the action and the gauntlet known as the day care was so perfectly done that you can't help but look at it in amazement. TOY STORY 3 has just about everything going for it and every simple thing is done with great detail and imagination. The movie is certainly the best of the trilogy and it ends the series in a perfect way."

It follows it's predecessors in honourable fashion and it is my absolute pleasure to say ""Amazing job Pixar!"" <br/><br/>The whole film is a well rounded, well thought out, well produced, well made masterpiece. Picture it as a painting. Years of hard work, sleepless nights, long working days, blood, sweat and tears all amount to this one object. Yet to us, the unsuspecting audience, it appears as an effortlessly constructed diamond. Every aspect of it is beautiful and once it has finally been pulled together it just 'works'.<br/><br/>The new scenarios the characters we all know and love are thrust into, the brand new cast that we don't know particularly well yet but soon will be like they have been our friends for many years and the spectacular ending that will make your eyes start to water and a big smile slowly make it's way across your face; all make it worth while paying for the DVD. But to be honest, I would extremely happily pay a large sum of money to see this film because it is a film that needs to be seen by every single person on the planet. If you are sitting at your desk reading this review and haven't see Toy Story 3 yet, then get yourself to the supermarket and buy this film now.<br/><br/>I can guarantee that you will enjoy this film. Toy Story 3 is brilliant in every way, go see it!"
"elanie_507","10","2","3","17 November 2010"," Growing up with Pixar
","The first Toy Story came out in '95 when I was only two. Of course I don't remember seeing it then but my father told me he took me to see it. Now the third movie is out and the character Andy is supposed to be seventeen, which is what age I am now. It makes me feel as if I grew up with him. At the end of the movie when Andy is giving up Woody, Buzz and the gang it resembles how I feel as well. It seems very hard for him to give his childhood up, just as it is for me. Both of us nearing eighteen and having to give up, or at least, put our childhood behind us. I'm sad that the trilogy is over, but if they made another I fear it would totally ruin everything. I didn't expect the movie to be as good as it was and I definitely didn't see it as a cartoon. I found myself caring for the characters and fearing for them in some parts. Pixar undoubtedly did an excellent job with this movie. Thank you very much Pixar; keep up the good work!"
"gigan-92","10","2","3","29 September 2010"," 2010's Greatest Acheivment!!
","With Toy Story 3 I had expected to see an all-right contender compared to the first two films. But damn was I wrong! This film will blow you away on many aspects. First off, just the transition of the animation since the first film back in the 1990s. It's simply beautiful and looks so epic and realistic I swore I was there in this Pixar film. Secondly, a screenplay so vivid and surprisingly smart that nothing is overdone, nothing is drawn out, it's just simply brings the trilogy to a climax. For example, in my humble opinion I believe ""The Incredibles"" ultimately tried too hard to be a real action flick when it should've stuck to the laughs. And ""Chicken Little"" was so downright not funny and overly childish it hurt to watch.<br/><br/>Here we get a rich story that truth be told is a little darker than the others but nothing a child can't handle. The story is adventurous and suspenseful at just the right mixture, with plenty of laugh-out-loud comedy. Thirdly, we get the majority of our characters back and let's not lie; by the end of the movie I guarantee you'll shed tears. It's just something you would not expect for Disney honestly, well for Pixar yes. ""Finding Nemo"", ""Wall-E"", and ""Up"" all serve as Class A films, but this film goes beyond that even. That's probably due to the fact that it's a trilogy and all, but a well done trilogy. This movie has done what most live-action trilogies have epically failed to do: present a good start with more than likable characters and a good story and actually keep that greatness going till the finish. And a highly captivating finish at that, with enough well-played drama, humor, and sadness blended together perfectly for people of all ages to enjoy. Once this film's successful run in theaters was up, I bought the damn bootleg to keep on enjoying. That's just how awed I was. And I know without a doubt none will find a single reason to dislike this film or even a single aspect to pick apart."
"asprettyasacarcrash_x","10","2","3","16 September 2010"," Awesome movie, even more so for 18 year olds :]
","I remember watching the first two movies in the cinema when I was younger and loving them. Then when I heard Toy Story 3 was coming out, I was surprised at how excited I was! I just couldn't wait. Although I thought it seem silly for someone of my age to be sitting in a cinema full of kids watching Toy Story I was still determined to go see it.<br/><br/>Turns out I wasn't the only one who has this idea, I'm sure there must have been more 17+ people than there were kids! Even though I was generally going to see it more out of tradition than thinking it would actually be a good movie for me to watch I loved it.<br/><br/>It is possibly the best kids movie I've seen in the past few years, maybe Up was on par with it but that's it.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 all the way."
"Hellmant","8","2","3","14 September 2010"," You've got to admire the heart that goes into making these movies and it's especially obvious in films like this!
","'TOY STORY 3': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Woody (once again voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and all of the rest of the gang are back for this third 'TOY STORY' adventure, eleven years after the last film. It once again rehashes the story of Woody and the others feeling threatened and unwanted by their owner Andy (once again voiced by John Morris) as he turns 17 and leaves for college. They're mistakenly dropped off at a daycare where tired older toys want them to be the sole victims of the wild and obnoxious children there. Only Woody knows they're truly wanted back home and does his best to rescue them and get them back to Andy.<br/><br/>The film is only co-written by the original two films' creator John Lasseter and is directed by Lee Unkrich, who served as a co-director on 'TOY STORY 2'. It does seem a little old and drawn out at times, early on, but then it really builds to a somewhat seriously suspenseful and emotional conclusion. Some of the drama and humor seems forced but some of it feels really genuine and funny as well, especially as the film goes on. I don't agree that this is the masterpiece that some are describing it but it's definitely a lot better than most other kids' films out there (as most Pixar films are).<br/><br/>The 'TOY STORY' movies aren't my favorites of the Pixar films; I really like 'THE INCREDIBLES' and 'WALL-E' the best, but they're definitely better than stuff like 'MONSTERS, INC.' and 'A BUG'S LIFE'. The thing you have to really admire about all of the Pixar films though is the effort and passion of the entire team of filmmakers that went into making them; this is definitely obvious on the screen. The greatest example of this is 'AVATAR' but all film really is the most collaborative art form there is and therefor, in my opinion, the most impressive one.

"sniffle_wiffle","10","2","3","18 August 2010"," This film should be called 'Cure for Depression'.
","Pixar is without doubt the most talented film studio ever. Not the past few years or since their debut in 1995, I mean EVER. Usually after this many string of commercial and (certainly) critical successes, you would expect the inevitable dip in quality will begin to surface as it does with most creative geniuses. But Pixar continues to defy the odds and the laws of the universe, by getting better and better with each new release. And I think now with 'Toy Story 3' this could well be the peak of their golden filmography. How does Pixar do it?! There must be a sorcerer locked away deep in their studio.<br/><br/>If this is the peak of their career (although I certainly hope not) then it is a fitting one, by returning to the films that started all of this. It has certainly been a rainbow coloured road for Pixar since the first 'Toy Story' 15 years ago, and now they exuberant such confidence and skill with each new film they make it seem easy. 'Toy Story 3' as you should know by now, is fittingly set 15 years after the first, and Andy the child that owns the ever lovable and loyal Woody and his gang, is now 17 and ready to move on from his play things and go onto college, much to the dismay of the toys. Woody is the only one that gets to go with Andy to college while the others are to be banished to the attic. I won't go too much into detail but there is a major fiasco, and the toys and Woody manage to wind themselves up at the Sunnyside daycare centre where another brilliant adventure awaits.<br/><br/>If you thought the previous 2 films had so many great characters, then this one is positively bursting the seams with them. There are too many to mention, but the stand-outs have to be Ken the hilariously shallow and fashion obsessive accessory to Barbie (a great return from Michael Keaton), and Lotso huggin bear the sweet on the outside but stone cold bitter on the inside bear, who runs the sinister events behind Sunnyside which is more like a prison from hell for Toys. This has to be the most fun out of the 3 films, there are so many hilarious moments in this film from Ken's fashion display to Barbie to Mr Potatoe Head sticking his body parts to a cucumber. The funniest bit had to be Buzz going into Spanish mode, which actually had me (and my family!) on the floor of the cinema in tears. The film just fires one brilliant moment after another at you, it never gets dull for a second, and it always reeks of charm and cleverness but somehow never appears pretentious. However while the majority of the film is ingenious fun, the climax is a whole different story. Taking place in a garbage disposal unit, there are no laughs here as the Toys become incredibly close to their ultimate destruction. There is such a sense of finality and desperation about it, it almost holds its own against the finale of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy.<br/><br/>To me this was the best of the trilogy, and the best of Pixar's streak of fantastic films. The film manages to balance the fun and sentimentality perfectly, and the pace never lets up. It creates a world of such charm and fun through the eyes of the toys, you will never want to leave. In a world of constant suffering and darkness, these films are like rays of light that shine every now and then, and let you (for a short while) come out of the real world and take you to a special place in your mind where you feel happy and young again. These films are not products, they are gifts, and I doubt that they unlike the toys will ever be forgotten or cast away. Thank you Pixar, simply thank you."
"HypersonicMan","10","2","3","8 August 2010"," One of Pixar's best
","I've been a Pixar fan since the original Toy Story came out in 1995, and they have yet to disappoint. Toy Story 3 is a joyous adventure, a heartfelt examination of what it means to leave childhood behind, and an existential meditation on fate and death. Not to mention a brilliant send up of prison break movies. Heady stuff for what is ostensibly a summer kids flick. But the movie never misses a beat, and never seems overburdened with its weighty subject matter. It's a Greek tragedy that doesn't take itself too seriously (the climax contains the most literal deus ex machina ever committed to film). There are some scary bits, like a ratty baby doll and an evil monkey toy that are the stuff of nightmares, not to mention a harrowing sequence at the end involving a city dump, so it may not be appropriate for very young children. The last ten minutes or of the film contain a similar emotional wallop as the first fifteen minutes of Up. Pixar knows how to jerk the tears."

"mothersworry","10","2","3","6 August 2010"," Why the hell am I even writing this????
","Hundreds have already written about this title and hundreds more will continue to write. So why do I feel compelled to write about it?? Simple really.........Its beautiful.<br/><br/>No real point going into the plot as you can read so many reviews giving you a broad picture of what the movie is about. I'm just going to tell you what the movie, and its 2 predecessors, mean to me.<br/><br/>I tend to watch sequels with the following frame of mind. Its like a big old comfy chair.....if you can get that same homely, satisfying, attention grabbing feeling from the new release as you got from the movies before it, then its doing its job. Sequels need to be able to take you straight back to the memories and feelings that made the films before them so special. This is NEVER an easy task, and many have failed so miserably trying to get there. Pixar, on the other hand, have somehow managed to put together probably THE GREATEST CINEMATIC TRILOGY OF ALL TIME. This is in no way an exaggeration. As Andy has has grown up and is now ready for college, so have the toys, so have Pixar and so have I. Pixar have moved in a different direction for the story's outlook and main themes with this movie and, in my eyes, there are two scenes which encompass everything that this movie is about, and which also had the tears rolling down my cheeks.<br/><br/>1) The scene where the toys are looking death in the face as they move closer to the huge incinerator at the rubbish dump. The toys all begin to stop fighting the inevitable and join hands, all looking to each other for comfort....whatever happens they will always be together.<br/><br/>2) The final play scene with Andy, Bonnie and the toys. An incredibly moving and touching piece of cinema, that even while I write, has me welling up.<br/><br/>It seems that a movie company that can deliver hit after hit after hit after hit would logically, at some point, hit the wall.....but Pixar don't, and it is a truly remarkable credit to all involved, that they can continue to break the mold. Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever after were both lessons which have been taught so many times.....how to ruin a franchise and a movie series. Pixar have the animators, the writers, the voice talent and the marketing to know when to stop and when to draw a line in the sand and say, ""That's wrapped that story up now, lets move on"".<br/><br/>Toy Story was the first of its kind, Toy Story 2 proved that the first was in no way a fluke and Toy Story 3 well and truly cements this movie series up there for all time. Every piece of the jigsaw slots together perfectly and leaves us with a collection of movies, stories and characters that will continue to bring joy, happiness, shocks, laughs and tears to any generation who wishes to enter their wonderful world.<br/><br/>I urge anyone who has not seen this movie yet to get out there and experience it. See it in 2D or 3D, or both!! The 3D is beautiful because, very simply, it is used how it should be used, to add richness, depth and fullness, whilst not getting intertwined with the main focus of the movie's point.<br/><br/>To, probably THE GREATEST CINEMATIC TRILOGY OF ALL TIME, to all at Pixar and to Walt Disney for realising the pure Gold which they have in Pixar, I salute you."

","In 1995 I saw my first ever film in a cinema. Now I find it hard to explain the wonder I felt at the age of 3 as I watched the adventures of Woody, Buzz and co. At the time Toy Story 2 was not, in my eyes, a worthy sequel (of course I wouldn't have put it like that at the time) but now I see it for what it is, an excellent addition to a wonderful series. Today I saw the third instalment to the masterpiece and I can honestly say that this is the best. Toy Story 3 is, to my knowledge, the only film which has moved me to tears, the atmosphere created is that believable, that heart-rending whilst also redeeming itself to bring me to the film to end on a beautiful high.<br/><br/>As expected of a film which is supposedly aimed primarily at children, the comedy is simple enough but still enjoyable. The heart of this film lies in the storytelling and the emotional connection which has been built over 15 of the 18 years of my life.<br/><br/>Ignoring all of this, this is truly my favourite film which I have seen this year. Take into consideration that in the past 6 months I have seen the first two Godfather films as well as several other classics. See this film now."

In the case of Toy Story 3, the obvious choice would be to make it a triple feature with the first two episodes; and I can think of few better ways to entertain myself than to spend 5 hours or so revisiting this trilogy. But here is another suggestion. Watch it as a double feature with Seabiscuit (2003) and see how both movies deal with the idea that when a thing gets beat up a little, you don't just throw it away.<br/><br/>Rejuvenation is the essential idea behind Toy Story 3, and that makes it as much a movie for aging baby boomers seeking new significance in the late maturity phase of their lives as it is for young ones seeking new thrills and adventure. For this aging boomer, Toy Story 3 massaged all of the critical emotions that go along with aging: the sense of uselessness, the boredom that goes along with being stashed away in the attic by my grown children, the realization that maybe my best days are behind me. The big payoff came at the movie's conclusion as it delivered hope and an avenue to rediscovering the joy of living.<br/><br/>Yes, it's that good.<br/><br/>For my money, Toy Story 3 is the best movie of the series, and that is saying a lot given that the first two installments were masterpieces. The plot takes off a bit later from where Toy Story 2 concludes. Young Andy is a bit older and getting ready to go off to college. His ragtag assemblage of toys is less important to him now. Most days, the playthings just collect dust on the shelf or wait endlessly in a dark corner of the toy chest for that rare moment when Andy might get the urge to play. The story's conflict concerns whether the toys should be stored up in the attic or given away to a day care center before Andy leaves home.<br/><br/>All of the characters from the previous episodes return for the finale, and some new interesting and colorful characters are introduced. There is plenty of fun and frolicking, as well as some scary close calls that might be upsetting to very young children. In the end, it's how the movie deals with its subject of renewal that makes it such a worthwhile investment of your time. <br/><br/>Fair warning. It packs an emotional wallop, and all but the most stone- hearted of viewers will be wiping away happy tears at the end."

","All Pixar movies have a way of being an instant classic and being entertaining for kids and adults alike, because of their many emotional layers. Toy Story 3 is no exception.<br/><br/>When I heard they were making a third, I had my doubts. Toy Story 1 and 2 were great movies, with humour and heart and a great story, surely, I thought, they can't do it again? I was very wrong. Toy Story 3 is just as great as the first two, maybe in some ways better. All our favourite characters are back for an amazingly funny, action packed animated ride.<br/><br/>The story is as follows: Andy is leaving for college, but can't seem to be able to let go of a select few of his toys, ones that have meant the most to him. However, all of the toys ends up being mistakenly donated to a daycare centre, therein lies the problem and they have to figure out a way to get back to Andy and back to where they belong.<br/><br/>The story is brilliant, with another dilemma around every corner, and lots of new characters. With high humour and high emotion at times, its a movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Sit back and enjoy this one, you will not be disappointed, there is not a possible way to flaw this movie, definitely a classic movie trilogy that is going to go down in history. It's not every day a trilogy is formed when each movie is flawless and special in its own way. An enjoyable movie for all the family, no disappointment to be found."
"jvandemerwe","10","2","3","1 August 2010"," Great movie for both parents and kids
","Yesterday I saw this movie for the second time. It was even more fun than the first time, because with the speed of this movie you seem to miss a lot of subtle details. I am surprised that some people think that this is not a movie for kids. My kids are 9, 12 and 16 years young and they loved it. It has enough in the story to talk about. The details are breathtaking and I don't know why people always want to see new things. John Wayne also played his role over and over again, but still is one of the main movie icons of all all time. I think that Woody is a great competition to become the animated counterpart of Mr. Wayne. Go and see this movie and just enjoy it. It is quality time."
"cosmorados","9","2","3","30 July 2010"," ""You would not believe the day I am having!"" How to make a successful trilogy
","The toys numbers are few. They are stored in a box, and there's little for them to do in there except go stir crazy as Andy grows up and heads for college, BUT, he has to sort out his room and his old toys, so what's his plan ...To put his best loved in the attack but take his best friend to college as a token of the youth he has now left behind, but who will go, Woody or Buzz, after deciding on Woody, he gets ready to put them in the attic, but things don't go to plan and the toys including Buzz are instead donated to a nursery, a place which looks like Paradise but is in fact no better than the boy next door's backyard. Will the toys escape from Sunnyside Prison nursery, will Woody get to go to college, will this film feel simply like a cashing-in add-on? <br/><br/>When I heard the plot initially I had to say yes to the final question, I mean Andy giving his prized toy away, I mean everyone has a special toy who they love the most, right? And there lies the magic, Pixar don't do contradictions like that in there films, and in this one they stay absolutely loyal to everything that has gone before. The film is exciting, funny, terrifying and charming from one second to the next. Lotso the bear, the leader of the nursery toys is one of the most terrifying villains created by Pixar, precisely because he appears so cute and cuddly, and while children won't register it, I personally found the scene where Buzz was, effectively tortured to be very upsetting, but that's because we love these characters so much. The animation is as usual first rate and you know off the bat immediately that you're watching a Pixar film, the voice work, particularly by Hanks is stunning and with him and Tim Allen you get the feeling that they know these characters so well, it makes it that much more real, sucking all of us into this completely make believe world. The direction is top-drawer and well ...well I'll just stop because if I go on I'll just start using the same phrases everyone else does.<br/><br/>I thought I might be watching a watered down version of Toy Story 2, I was wrong. Instead through these wonderful films we watched Andy grow up and all of us mourned the passing from children into adulthood with some brand new toys that will made us feel like kids all over again, for infinity and beyond.<br/><br/>awesome"
"lesleyharris30","10","2","3","26 July 2010"," An Unbelievablly Solid Third Instalment,
","Toy Story 3 is an outstanding movie with an immensely well developed plot and a stellar voice cast. Eleven years fans waited for this third installment of the beloved Pixar series, and I must say it does not disappoint one bit. Having the series work in real time, showing Andy growing up, was a terrific choice and made for a story certainly worth telling. It has a high octane, intense ""prison escape"" that is immensely well executed, it was clear that the writers did a lot of research on how to display this in a way that could feasibly work out with toys. <br/><br/>This film also has a lot of emotional depth, with the final twenty minutes leaving me in tears, and I was very happy a movie managed to make me feel this way. I was taken on a genuine journey with these characters that was overwhelming in spectacle, as well as grounded in rich character development and arch's, it is also a kids movie about toys, believe it or not. <br/><br/>The voice cast is as great as ever, the 11 year hiatus from these characters was clearly no big deal for them. Tom Hanks is phenomenal as always as Woody, it feels Tim Allen has never left Buzz, Joan Cusack is top notch still as Jesse and Don Rickles is as great as ever as Mr. Potato Head. Everyone is all around brilliant in their returning roles, and the new characters are also terrifically casted, fitting in to this universe nicely, such as Ned Beatty as the very layered Lotso, Michael Keaton as the very hilarious Ken and Timothy Dalton in an unexpected, pleasant role, as Mr. Pricklepants. <br/><br/>Truly unforgettable 90 minutes. Sweet and hilarious, fans of the series and family members of all ages will love Toy Story 3. <br/><br/>Andy is all grown up and plans to put the toys in to his attic before leaving for college, but they accidentally end up in a daycare center that they can not escape as a result of a ruthless teddy bear."
"Lemos","10","2","3","25 July 2010"," Wow! They've done it again.
","As a grown man the original Toy Story has always made it on on my personal Top 10 list. Our 2 kids, now teenagers, have grown up watching Toy Story as well, and it is great to see them admire and love them all, as they grow they seem to appreciate them even more and more, perhaps as they reflect on their own childhood. When Toy Story 2 came out, my own expectations were that it would probably be an okay, possibly good sequel, but it would never quite match the original. I was wrong - it was as good as the original. Toy Story 3 is the first film I have seen in this new era 3D (Imax 3D to be precise), so perhaps that has given it an extra little edge, but I was once again completely blown away by the rehash of the characters, the narrative, the fabulous story and imaginative script. It has comedy, drama, romance, thrilling frightening moments, real tear jerking stuff. Wow! They've pulled it off once again. Now how the hell do I fit the 3 Toy Story movies on my all-time Top ten list."
"brooksy241095","10","2","3","24 July 2010"," The Perfect Trilogy
","Toy Story 3 had BIG shoes to fill upon its release. The first two Toy Story films were incredible, but I never had any doubts about Toy Story 3 being just as good, and I wasn't disappointed, it was incredible.<br/><br/>I went to watch the film with a group of friends in its opening week, and we watched the 3D version. The 3D was impeccable, but watching the film in 3D was just a bonus, Toy Story 3 was something i'd been waiting 11 years for.<br/><br/>In the film, we see a 17 year old Andy going to college and moving on, but his toys are thrown away by mistake and they end up in a box donated to Sunnyside daycare. Upon there arrival, the toys are impressed by the daycare centre and the other toys that they meet there, but Woody is intent on going back to Andy, insisting that he still wants the other toys, but they find the daycare centre as a paradise, and so Woody leaves alone, only to be found and taken home by a little girl named Bonnie. Meanwhile, Buzz and the gang discover daycare isn't as pleasant as it seems, when the toys are put in with the toddlers. Woody begins to see the bright side of having a new owner like Bonnie, but discovers the truth about the daycare centre and so sets out to rescue his friends.<br/><br/>The plot becomes rapidly intense, full of twists and turns. In many ways, Toy Story 3 is different to its predecessors, but in a positive way. The film certainly has plenty of action, and also very emotional, especially the scene where the toys decide their fate and join hands ready to be destroyed.<br/><br/>Overall, I wasn't let down in the slightest by Toy Story 3 and in my opinion, it was just as good as the previous films. The perfect end to a perfect trilogy.<br/><br/>10/10"
"rooee","8","2","3","23 July 2010"," Pixar's toy box
","After a slightly slow and perhaps over-familiar opening sequence, Toy Story 3 develops into something more involving and complex than its predecessor - albeit one that lacks the jaw-dropping novelty of the original.<br/><br/>Typically, Toy Story 3 doesn't skimp on the grown-up themes: neglect, isolation, as well as growing up itself, of course. There are also bubbling subtexts, like Ned Beatty's Lotso coming across as some kind of manipulative Southern slave-owner, with a patriarchal ferocity born of the trauma of disempowerment. Then there's Jesse (Joan Cusack) - far from being the obedient monogamist of Old Disney, her affections aren't so much torn as shared equally. She was made to love Woody, but why not Buzz too? (Jeez, that's some sentence.) The sophistication doesn't stop there. At one point, the narrative breaks into three strands. And when Buzz breaks into 'Spanish Mode' (one of the film's funniest extended jokes), we're offered another rarity for a mainstream children's film: subtitles.<br/><br/>Equally successful - and the real draw for the target audience - is the slapstick. The action in part 3 is a step up from its predecessors. The escape from the sinister Sunnyside kindergarten is worthy of the greatest prison breakout movies. There is a brilliant visual gag involving Mr Potato Head and a pigeon. And finally, the ending feels like Lord of the Rings' Mount Doom, except with a less feathery deus ex machina.<br/><br/>There is a sneaking sense of overkill in terms of the sheer wealth of characters. But then for every underdeveloped Mr Pricklepants (Timothy Dalton) there's a hilariously conflicted Ken (Michael Keaton), so it's churlish to complain. And there are some truly weird creations amongst the cast: Chuckles (Bud Luckey) sidesteps the creepy clown cliché to come across as a wellspring of pathos, while Baby, with his superhuman strength and his lazy eye, is probably the most horrifying henchman since Richard Kiel opened his gleaming jaws.<br/><br/>Pixar may have made better films during their extraordinary existence; but this film, and the franchise as a whole, will always be their best toy box."
"jagmarky","8","2","3","15 July 2010"," By now we all know that we can trust Pixar.
","Toy Story 3, the third movie in the trilogy, is still filled with magic, love, and all that good stuff that you would expect from a Pixar film. If you ask me I think thats amazing! When I went to go see Toy Story 3 I was afraid that it was going to lag and be pretty bad, cause of my experience with past third movies, but oh was I wrong.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a very imaginative and impressive beginning. Andy is still a kid playing with his toys and we see what he is imagining, that comes out to look like a movie all itself with amazing effects. But thats not what the movie is about, so we travel through Andy's life with his toys (a very touching moment) and we stop at a time in his life where he is all grown up and going to college. With Woody, Buzz, and the whole gang (exept for Bo Peep and Wheezey, who were sold, how sad) trying to get Andy to play with them again or at least have him look at them. Because he hasn't played with them for years. The choice comes down to Andy to what he wants to do with his old pals; he chooses to bring Woody with him and put everybody else in the attic, but that didn't happen. He put them in a garbage bag and his mother mistakes it for trash, oh my god! Woody goes after them, they save themselves and the heartbroken toys jump into a box set to go to Sunnyside daycare in the back of Andy's mother's van with Woody, who tries to talk them out of it, but it was to late the mother closed the door and drove off. When the toys get to Sunnyside it looked beautiful, a toys dream, but everything that they thought would happen was totally the opposite. they get put into the smaller kids' side where they abuse their toys. Thats just the beginning! There's so much more adventure, twists, and love to be seen in this movie. Its just amazing. A wonderful movie for the whole family! I don't care what your age is, 4 to 102 you'll love Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>Pixar are artists and I will be seeing their artwork on display each year (hopefully) for years to come! <br/><br/>*** I will be editing this review later so stick around***<br/><br/>*I rated this film 9/10 stars (I never rate a movie 10 stars because no movie is that perfect)<br/><br/>* Help me help you, you can email me at jagmarkyreviews@yahoo.com to give me advice for further reviews or you can give me a movie suggestion for me to review next. <br/><br/>*If you don't see this under my review then its not apart of my official reviews."
"TylerNess","10","2","3","15 July 2010"," Toy Story 3: As good as it gets
","With Pixar delivering one masterpiece after another, you get your hopes high. I dare saying Toy Story 3 might be the most anticipated western animation movie of all time. Usually this kind of anticipation comes at the price of disappointment. So what about this movie? The Incredibles is probably my favorite Pixar movie. Mostly because i love the characters so much. For me Ratatouille was the best so far. It just captured that magical Disney feeling so well. Wall-E and Up were excellent, but the first half of these movies was so strong, the end just didn't make that much of an impact and was a little lost in the shadow. So where does Toy Story 3 fit in? Toy Story 3 just set another bar for perfection. There is simply not one thing to hate or even dislike about this movie. At the beginning it was obvious we're not just watching another animation movie, but a 200 million dollar Pixar heavy weight champ. The highly impressive action captures the audience immediately and the movie never lets it slip. I couldn't find a few minutes where the movie got boring, if only a little.<br/><br/>What i like the most about Pixar movies is deeper meaning and sense they always make. The story around the kid letting go its Toys was quite amazing. It's hard to explain what it really is, but its mostly very convincing. I might dare saying it's because the acting is actually very very good. And second, because the story makes a lot of sense. From the kid getting too old for its toys, to the little kids violating the toys and to the point where they end in the trashcan.<br/><br/>Now we all know Pixar movies are about the best looking possible. So how does Toy Story 3 hold up? To be honest, it got even better than I thought. The perspective of the toys in the huge world is better looking than ever. Combined with the lighting and setting it creates an astonishing ambiance. The adventure at the Sunny Day Care was at its darker moment almost creepy.<br/><br/>So what about the fun factor? The movie is hilarious! From the common subtle Pixar humor to the point your laughing you ass of with Ken's facial expressions or Buzz Lightyear's Spanish mode. There is hardly a lack of humor in this movie and its executed so well. I never becomes too obvious, simple and cheap like in every Shrek or Dreamworks movie. Its very well thought of.<br/><br/>And my favorite part of the movie was the thing I disliked the most about Wall-E and Up. Again with the bar set so high in the first half of the movie, I was worried for the second half. But it got even better! The moment the dolls embrace their fierce end and they hold hands, my body went stiff. I couldn't believe how convincing and intense the feeling of that scene was. Normally I only experience this level of emotion with Japanese Anime. But Toy Story 3 has proved that its not just a mere western animation movie that's entertaining, good looking, fun, extremely detailed, makes a lot of sense, but it can compete with the Japanese intense level of emotion.<br/><br/>I don't think I'll let The Incredibles go as my favorite Pixar movie, but there's no denying this is by far the best thing Pixar ever created. I can only look forward to what they come up with next."
"nikkibob222","10","2","3","10 July 2010"," Tragic yet a blissful new beginning.
","This movie was wonderful! I went to this movie expecting to be disappointed, the first two movies were so good and usually sequels disappoint. However this movie blew my expectations out of the water. It was funny, cute, it had very emotional and sad parts making it almost a tear jerker. Then it swings back in and kills with a beautiful ending. They stayed true to the first two movies and kept everything perfect. They new toys at the daycare bring a fun new twist to the plot. The toys have been alone for so long with only Jessie and Bulls Eye being added that the introduction of the new toys was crucial. Woody and Buzz and the whole gang's friendship is great and really makes the movie inspirational. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a feel good flick! :)"
"geniuskentyk-1","10","2","3","9 July 2010"," Toy Story 3 is pure genius
","Like everyone else, I would have to say ""Pixar has done it again!"" ""Toy Story 3,"" the SECOND sequel to Pixar's most famous work, ""Toy Story,"" does what most second-sequels would love do – live up to standards of the previous films! ""Toy Story 3″ heightens the emotion and the especially the danger from the previous two films. ""Toy Story 3″ is included in the ""Must-Watch"" film category – I'm sure of that. ""Toy Story 3″ is one of those films where you know it'll be worth watching, and where you know it'll live up to the hype. ""The Dark Knight"" was the ""must-watch"" film of 2008, ""Up,"" ""Avatar,"" and ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" were the ""must-watch"" films of 2009 (although ""Up"" was the only one that lived up to its hype), and now ""Toy Story 3″ is the ""must- watch"" film of 2010!<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3″ opens with a beautiful and creative scene, seen through the eyes of Andy. The opening shows us Andy's imagination and what he sees and thinks of as he plays with his beloved toys. After this amazing scene, the film goes through a short montage of Andy playing with his toys in the past. But then we realize that a long time has passed, and Andy hasn't played with the toys in years. When the film skips to present day, we find out that some of the toys from the previous two films are gone – they've either been donated or sold at yard sales. Learning this fact was sad to me, and most likely every other fan of the series, for all of the toys are a part of our past, and no longer seeing them is just depressing.<br/><br/>Through a series of mishaps, all of the main toys end up at a daycare center, called Sunnyside Daycare. Of course, a daycare seems like heaven for a bunch of toys since dozens of kids are there to play with them 5 days a week. When the toys first arrive at Sunnyside, we meet some of the main players at the daycare, including the Barbie-doll Ken, and the leader of Sunnyside, Lotso the lovable hugging bear! Of course, all of this seems too good to be true, and it is. Andy's toys received the bad end of the stick, for when they arrived at Sunnyside, they became the new toys for the youngest age group at the daycare. When Andy's toys asked to be moved to the older kids' room, we learn how Sunnyside is really run.<br/><br/>Then comes the part where the film turns into a prison-break movie. While Andy's toys are at Sunnyside and running into trouble, Woody is instead at one of the daycare kids' home, meeting a few more new toys, including a doll, unicorn, porcupine, triceratops, and peas-in-a-pod. When Woody meets another toy there, Chuckles the Clown, he learns of Sunnyside's true nature and of Lotso's dark past. Woody decides to go back to the daycare in order to help his fellow toys escape.<br/><br/>From that point on, the adventure truly begins. The feel of the movie turns dark and edgy, and it feels like another movie. It's amazing how the filmmakers made the daycare look a lot like a real Alcatraz-like prison at night. Andy's toys go through an elaborate escape plan, only to end up at gigantic trash dump, which is the most epic part of the movie. The third act, the last 20 or so minutes, is where the toys face their greatest threat yet, and are the closest to actual death. And the third act is the point where the tears come in.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3″ has the most dramatic and emotional scene in the series because of its third act, and the third act has two different emotional scenes, though I felt the first (the incinerator scene) was more effective. The ending of the movie is the second half, and is more optimistic and happy than sad to me, even though it is pretty sad – it's the good kind of sad.<br/><br/>The incinerator scene was the best part of the movie for me. The music was just perfect for the scene, and was in-sync with what was happening on screen. As the toys gave up and finally accepted their fate, they all held hands as the music was dramatic (the ""dun-dun"" part of the music at that scene was perfectly timed, and it added to the emotional effect of the scene). It was just one of the most emotional, dramatic scenes in any of the Pixar films. I truly felt scared – scared for the toys – and my heart was pumping quickly! The incinerator scene is definitely the most memorable part to me. The last-play-time scene was emotional, too, because we see for the last time how much Andy and his toys love one another, and how much history they've had.<br/><br/>The adventure in ""Toy Story 3″ was a great one. I'm grateful that Pixar allowed us to grow up with these characters and this series. The ""Toy Story"" trilogy was a joyful, heartfelt experience that will definitely never be forgotten. ""Toy story 3″ gave the series the perfect ending – I honestly didn't predict that the fate of the toys would be like the one ""Toy Story 3″ actually gave us for its ending. It's sad to see the series end, but like Andy, it's time to move on, but the memories will always be with us."

"silverwing-001","10","2","3","4 July 2010"," Gold, absolute movie genius
","Pixar has had really good films and OK films but as far as i know they've never had a bad film, so it was safe to assume Toy Story 3 was at least going to be OK. I was worried when i first heard of Toy Story 3 because after almost a decade since the last film i thought the film wouldn't really be relevant to the younger audience of today. And plus usually 3 is the cursed number when it comes to movie squeals. I am immensely happy to say all my assumptions were wrong.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 was absolutely wonderful. In my opinion its Pixars best by a landslide. First off id like to say I'm 21 years old and i laughed throughout almost the entire movie. Every joke was absolutely hilarious none however topping Buzz in Spanish mode. The Story was actually very not entirely simple for a kids movie. It covers some really good points about growing up and growing apart, friendships, sadness and heart break. I don't want to blow details but the ending was sad and happy at the same time very few movies pull that off with such excellence as Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>My last point is the action. There actually is good action in it. It capture how dangerous our world is when your less than a foot tall :). It succeeds in every aspect that 9 disappointed me in.<br/><br/>Watch this movie even if you are older and don't have kids. It is good for all ages, however some of the jokes you might not get if you haven't seen the previous two so you may want to rent them and brush up before seeing this. But its worth absolutely every penny and i highly recommend it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"themoviemavens","10","2","3","29 June 2010"," One of the best films to come along in a decade
","Toy Story 3 is one of those films that comes along once in a decade. It is truly one of the most clever, imaginative, special films I've seen in years.<br/><br/>It's been 11 years since the last Toy Story, and in this (ostensibly) final chapter of the trilogy, we find Andy all grown up and heading off to college. Why a high school senior would still have a toy box full of childhood relics anywhere in sight is puzzling, but for the sake of the story, I'll buy it.<br/><br/>The premise of the film lies in the fate of the toys now that they are no longer needed. Will they be shipped off to charity? Thrown away like trash? Or donated to the local daycare? The toys decide to take their fate into their own hands, and thus, our adventure begins.<br/><br/>They eventually find themselves in a magical daycare wonderland. They're surrounded by loving children who will give them what they've been missing for so long – the imagination of a child that makes any toy come alive. There's only one problem – they've been banished to the toddler room where childhood toys meet a fate worse than the attic. There, they're used, abused and misused. They're regularly manhandled and stripped of all dignity by these terrible two's. They soon realize they'd rather be hidden safely away at their former owner's home than left to the whims of this group of unruly barbarians.<br/><br/>Enter our faithful Woody to save the day. He is the only one Andy's chosen to bring to college with him, but he opts to risk being left at SunnySide with the rest of the toys to make sure his friends are freed from certain doom.<br/><br/>We all know 'certain doom' is not an option in a Disney/Pixar film, unless you're the villain, but they certainly had me going there for a moment. Director Lee Unkrich was able to keep me on the edge of my seat (literally) until the very end. Along the way, we're introduced to a new crop of daycare toys – among them, a strawberry-scented bear who isn't as pleasant as he first appears to be, a Ken and Barbie pair who find love at first sight – and a drone-like hench-baby who had me in stitches from it's first scene.<br/><br/>This is one of those films from which you'll come away preaching the gospel. Not once did I get the feeling the movie was condescending to children for the sake of cheap laughs or thrills. This was a film that proves you need not talk down to children to get their attention. It also proves that a film can be as entertaining for adults as it is for the under-ten set. I would imagine that since the first two films came out long ago, the majority of the children in the theater were much too young to have seen them – but they laughed and worried and winced and rejoiced in all the same places I did.<br/><br/>The only drawback from not having seen the first two films is that you will not be as emotionally attached to the characters, and may not appreciate the bittersweet ending like someone who has grown up with these films. That, however, should not detract one iota from the film's effectiveness as a stand-alone movie-going experience.<br/><br/>I tried very hard to come up with one solitary criticism for the film, and I honestly could not. It simply could not have been better-made. I rarely give a film I've just seen 5 out of 5 stars, but this film was as deserving of that extraordinary distinction as any great film I've seen – it's that good. I truly hate to over-sell a film, but with this one, honestly, I don't think that's possible. It had me from the word, 'go'.<br/><br/>Disney/Pixar have outdone themselves in terms of sheer cleverness, wit, charm, humor, ingenuity and fun. This wonderful masterpiece is a testament to the notion that one need not mindlessly insert fart jokes, crass humor, sexual situations and foul language into a film for it to appeal to today's cynical audiences. Toy Story is everything a great movie should be. It tugs at your heartstrings without pulling them completely from their mooring – it's cute without being syrupy – and it has that wonderful timeless quality that is entirely too rare given the massive budgets, and overflowing creative talent that most major studio releases tout.<br/><br/>At the risk of sounding like an old-fashioned prude, I'll say they just don't make them like this anymore. For my money, the entertainment world would be a much better place if they did.<br/><br/>Upsides: An engaging, engrossing, uplifting, funny, smart, entertaining, witty, polished, imaginative, hopeful, creative, optimistic, best $10.50 I've spent at the theater in years-movie going experience.<br/><br/>Downsides: Only that it spoils me to the inferior copy-cats that are surely in pre-production as I write.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** (Our of 5 *'s)"

","I have yet to see a Toy Story flick i hate. I mean they keep getting better and better and the ending had me teary eyed if you can believe that??? It's toys for god's sake!!! There are several items that make this franchise work...#1 Great writers over at Pixar loved all their stories aside from Ratatouillie #2 smart casting on the voice talent...were all time consumingly carefully selected. #3 Toy Story can never get boring due to the fact that they can always find different and older toys we haven't seen or used in centuries to add to the mix. All these make for the perfect family adventure. This story unfolds with the toys recollecting a moment in time during one of Andy's play time scenarios, Actually the opening scene in Toy Story 1 you remember.. Black Bart..little BO peep's sheep strapped to the railroad tracks??? And then our story turns to present time and we see the toys struggling with the fact that Andy who is now 18 is leaving for college. In a huge mistake a garbage bag of toys that were supposed to be headed for the attic get sent to the local daycare to unfold a whole new heap of adventures as once again Woody,Buzz and the rest of the gang try their best to get back to Andy before its too late. A good story with a touching ending that the whole family will love as the Kyle family did. To sum things up i say once again Bravo!!!Pixar!!!!"

","There's a law in moiveology, much like Isaac Newton's laws of motion. Well call this the law of sequels. It is stated: As a franchise accumulates sequels the value of each successive film approaches crap. However, as in all fields of science, when a movie arises that contradicts our laws and theories, no matter how well founded they may appear to be, we must revise our old ways of thinking in exchange for the new. This is one of those times.<br/><br/>Go see Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 contains some of the most powerful and emotionally resonate scenes of the Toy Story franchise, yet is also so funny that you may need to bring an extra pair of pants (and not just for the little ones). It has its flaws, although they detract little from the film. This rare sequel ties in so organically with the first two films that you'd be amazed to realize that the Toy Story franchise was never intended to be a trilogy."

","It has come to my attention that I write a lot of 10 star reviews. I hardly write any reviews for movies I hate! Why do I do this? The bad ones are far more fun to write! But, here we go again, another 10 star movie. Why do I bother? It is, by this point, a known fact that this movie is awesome. So why write about it? Because it is the very least I can do in order to express my gratitude to Pixar for sending off Woody, Buzz, and Andy with the very greatest third film in any trilogy ever. Pixar had to have sold their souls to the Devil. There is no way an animated film that is a second sequel can be this fresh and clever and charming and hilarious and nail-biting and awesome and perfect in every way. I grew up with Toy Story, like so many of the people who went to see it, and I love it, like EVERYONE who went to see it. I should never have doubted Pixar. They're geniuses, all of them.

","Great. Another funny and heartfelt animated adventure from Pixar. Throw it on the pile. <br/><br/>All sarcasm aside, ""Toy Story 3"" is the latest brilliant release from a studio whose creative Gatling gun has yet to fire a blank. Maybe not every cinematic shot they've taken has been a dead-center bullseye, but everything they touch falls somewhere on the gradient of good to great, which with eleven films under their belt, is certifiably ludicrous.<br/><br/>And since Pixar debuted its first feature, the original ""Toy Story,"" in 1995, its storytellers and artists have not only refined and mastered their craft, but they've done so without failing or having to repeat themselves. Sure, Disney forced their collective hand four years later into doing the follow-up, ""Toy Story 2,"" but now over a decade later, the studio is dropping its first voluntary sequel.<br/><br/>Maybe because ""Toy Story"" was such an important part of my childhood, and probably because I grew a lot in the four years separating it from its successor, I never shared the fondness I had for the first film with the second. That likely accounts for the pre-release uncertainty I felt towards this newest installment; I didn't want to risk the disappointment of another fun but frivolous caper. <br/><br/>Fortunately, ""Toy Story 3"" almost immediately dispelled my doubts. It combines the rock- solid dramatic core of the studio's recent work with the classic atmosphere of adventure and clever comedy the two prior ""Stories"" are known for. It's a match made in heaven, and though ""Toy Story 3"" feels slightly redundant of part two at its foundation, the added emotional weight of the toys' uncertainty that they even have a caring home to return to raises the stakes considerably.<br/><br/>Part three also benefits from feeling more intimate, and consequently, more focused than the trilogy's middle chapter. ""Toy Story 2"" was an addition to ""Toy Story"" in every respect; new protagonists, and more action at a larger scale. ""Toy Story 3"" begins by stripping away many of the series' established plastic personages because their owner, Andy (who has aged almost in real time between the releases of the three films), is preparing for college and has outgrown them. The cast is comprised of the best of the best (and Jesse, but whatever), though the narrative focuses squarely on Woody.<br/><br/>As such, not all of the toys' stories reach individually satisfying ends, but as a unit their curtain call is bittersweet and touching. It is, after all, a film about growing and letting go, a more melancholy motif than some might expect, though Pixar has famously refused to shy away from so-called 'darker' themes. What's genuinely surprising is that the studio made the third ""Toy Story"" film a vehicle for that ideal set. It's a thread that finds the gang donated to a local daycare (which eventually becomes a prison-break scenario), and making one last trip home.<br/><br/>Really, when the worst thing you can say about a film is that a few of its jokes fall flat, you likely have something pretty special on your hands. That ""Toy Story 3"" also concludes a trilogy in such fine form makes it all the more a standout. With it, Pixar have proved once again their unrivaled integrity as a production house not only capable of creating compelling stories, but of franchising those stories in a way that respects and complements the original work. ""Toy Story 3"" is arguably the best of the lot.<br/><br/>In the coming years, Pixar has at least two more sequels planned, first for ""Cars"" in 2011, and then for ""Monsters Inc."" the following year. If it was ever a concern that the studio was creatively stalling or financially motivated to revisit its established worlds, ""Toy Story 3"" should put those fears to rest. In fact, we better make more room in the pile."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Has there ever been a bad Pixar movie? Nope. And as many really good movies they have created, there are now two truly great ones: Toy Story and Toy Story 3. The first one (released 15 years ago) transformed the way animation is made and set the standard for kids' movies that parents can also enjoy. This third installment takes animated story telling to the next level.<br/><br/>Of course all the great voices are back: Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles, Estelle Harris), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Hamm (John Ratzenberger) and Sarge (R Lee Ermey). Imagine assembling that cast and then adding two fabulous new characters: Lotsa Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty), Ken (Michael Keaton; expanding Jodi Benson's Barbi to a key role, and re-vamping Slinky-dog with Blake Clark taking over for his deceased friend, the fabulous Jim Varney. This is major star power and an over-abundance of talent! <br/><br/>Then again, we have all seen stellar casts fall flat without a worthy script. Fear not as Pixar legend John Lasseter (Exec Producer here) has passed the reins again to director Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc.). This story is brilliant and engaging. I challenge anyone from age 5 to 95 to avoid being drawn in to the themes of separation, friendship, loyalty, and power.<br/><br/>There are some laugh outloud moments along with the usual wise cracks from Buzz and Potato head. This time we are also treated to some darker moments with Lotsa, a power-hungry stuffed bear, and his band of misfits that include a giant baby doll and Chuckles, the creepiest clown this side of Poltergeist, and especially the frightening/funny monkey working security.<br/><br/>Some Pixar touches include the voice of Andy is provided by the grown up voice actor who did Andy in the first, a couple of glimpses of the evil kid Sid (first Toy Story) who has grown up to be a garbage man (same shirt) and the re-use of Randy Newman's classic song ""You've Got a Friend in Me"". Too many other ""little"" moments to mention, but this is pure film genius and should not be missed."

","It's hard to believe it's been 15 years since Toy Story came out in theaters, you look at it now it feels like today. Toy Story was the first pixar animated film. Characters we grow to love, Woody(Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen), Mr and Mrs Potato Head(Don Rickeles and Estelle Harris), Rexx(Wallace Shawn), Hamm(John Ratzenberger), and Slinky Dogg(Jim Varney). And a sequel followed four years later, and it proved to be a bigger hit than part 1, and we were introduced to Jessi(Joan Cusack). The ending of part 2 left you wondering,will there be a Toy Story 3, well 11 years later you finally got that answer.<br/><br/>Andy is 18 years old, and is going off to college, and wants to take Woody with him, but he puts the other toys in a box, and attempts to put them in the basement, But Buzz and the gang are mistaken for trash, Woody tries to come to there rescue, they find themselves at a children's nursery called Sunnydale, they meet Ken doll(Michael Keaton), and others, the leader Lotto(Ned Beatty) a purple bear. Will this be good for them or not? <br/><br/>I liked this one, it puts one up on part 2, it's more adventurous. Sadly Jim Varney(Slinky Dog) passed away in 2000, so actor Blake Clarke takes over for him and they sound almost alike. Michael Keaton steals a few scenes as the voice of Ken. The animation is a thousand times better than ever. Please don't miss it."
"mechachan15","9","2","3","21 June 2010"," A powerful and moving conclusion to the beloved Toy Story.
","I've known and loved the Toy Story movies since the first one came out in 1995. I was just a little kid then and the first TS was one of my favorite movies growing up. The sequel was great too, but maybe not quite as classic as the first. Now, after SO many years..we get Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>Let me say that this movie..surprised me. From the previews I thought that the movie might be a little too ""gag"" heavy. The whole Spanish Buzz thing, combined with the Ken/Barbie stuff. I was a little skeptical. BUT I do know that Pixar rarely flubbs up on movies, so I went into the theater with pretty high expectations. I was quite impressed.<br/><br/>The story: For me, the story gets a 9/10. It was a very solid story and the plot moved along pretty well. There was one scene that seemed to drag a bit, but that's kind of nitpicking.<br/><br/>The humor: 8/10. I didn't laugh all /that/ much during the movie, but it did still have funny moments :) <br/><br/>Music: The music was fine. I was paying more attention to the story, not the music as much. I believe the music would also get a 9/10.<br/><br/>Emotional depth/quality: I do actually wish the movie had been a little more bold at certain points. I have to give Pixar props though for some of the scenes in the movie. This is the darkest Toy Story movie. If you thought that the climax of Toy Story 2 was intense..oh boy..you haven't seen nothing' yet! I'll give the emotional content a 9/10 as well.<br/><br/>Appropriate: This movie is for children, teens,adults..anybody. Anyone who has ever loved or lost a toy will like this movie. Some parts honestly creeped me out a bit..and I'm almost 20 yrs. old. Don't let that discourage you from taking your children to see the movie though. I would exercise a little caution if you're taking really young kids to the movie. If they scare really easily you might need to like..cover their eyes at a couple parts. 9/10.<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen and loved the first two Toy Story movies will enjoy this movie :) It was fun, intense, emotional..it had pretty much everything. I give the movie a final overall rating of 9/10. <br/><br/>Thank you Pixar, for influencing so many lives and allowing so many children to grow up with your characters.<br/><br/>So long, partner.<br/><br/>-Debbie"

","Good news: the new Toy Story movie is a sweet, charming coda to a endlessly endearing series. The dialog still crackles, the animation still sparkles, and the voice work still resonates. Well done all around.<br/><br/>It's been 15 years since the original feature, and in movie time that means that little Andy is about all grown up. Well, headed off to college, anyway. As the movie begins, he'll be leaving for higher education in a few days and needs to figure out what to do with his Woody and Buzz and Jessie and Hamm toys, and others - does he donate them to the local daycare center, or does he put them up in the attic for safekeeping? That's really the question at the heart of the movie. Are the toys better off with Andy, in college - or somewhere else? They realize he's growing up, but surely he hasn't forgotten them entirely. And sure enough, we come to learn just how much these toys mean to Andy. It's a coming-of-age movie disguised as a Playskool parable.<br/><br/>The gang's adventures lead them to the daycare center, where they meet up with a vast array of other toys, such as a Care Bear clone voiced by Ned Beatty, a Ken doll, and a Fisher-Price talking phone. One of the many hallmarks of this trilogy has been how well represented toys have been; obviously, Pixar (and Disney) spared no expense in getting the rights to some of these toys, which you have to admit is much better than the alternative: made-up toys no one cares about. That's a big reason the Toy Story movies work, of course, because they resonate with everyone. Each of us can see a piece of our childhood in the movie. That's why it bugs us when the evil neighbor kid or the evil toy collector do things to the toys, because they're not just toys to us - they're our toys, our lives, ourselves. To lay it on thickly.<br/><br/>Anyway, what this one's all about is togetherness. Should Woody go with Andy to college while the others go to the attic, or wherever? Or should they stick together? The humor from the first two movies doesn't slow a bit, with wickedly whip-fast banter from Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and John Ratzenberger as Hamm slicing the air with their barbs and trivia. There's even some mild character development - is that love I see between Buzz and Jessie? Another recurring theme in the series is that of abandonment. In TS2, Andy mistakenly put Woody in the family yard sale; here, the toys feel like they're similarly being put aside ""for later,"" knowing that there won't be a later with Andy all but grown up. There are also repeated friends-abandoning-friends scenes as well. And, it seems, each toy in these movies - well, the lead toys - has some kind of story about how their old owner loved them to pieces and then one day just abandoned them. That feeling of abandonment plays a huge part in this movie.<br/><br/>There's just so much to like about this. It's simply great to hear Tom Hanks and Tim Allen playing their famous characters again. In fact, there really are no slackers in the entire bunch of voice actors, especially Joan Cusack as Jessie. (And, thank goodness, we get only a couple of snippets of Randy Newman's ""You Got a Friend in Me."") There are some sad scenes, but for the most part they're obscured by some really fantastic 3D action scenes (see Woody escape daycare! See the rest of the gang elude the trash truck! Thrill to everyone avoiding the incinerator!). In fact, the only really sad scene, the one that'll be sure to yank the heart out of all adults and no kids, is the one in which Andy's mom sees her son off to college. She cries, and so will you. It's not only the end of Andy's childhood, it's the end to all our Toy Story laughs.<br/><br/>The third Toy Story movie is warm hearted and elegant, a end to the trilogy that will really make your heart soar. It's a beautiful, hilarious movie that should be required viewing for kids of all ages."
"zetes","9","2","3","20 June 2010"," Exceptional, of course.
","Pixar is unstoppable. Heck, I'm even anticipating Cars 2 (which they are making, alongside Monsters Inc. 2). About the only thing I didn't like too much was the film's villain, who is pretty much an echo of the villain from the previous Toy Story movie. He even suffers pretty much the same fate. Otherwise, this is just masterful. Andy, the toys' owner, is now 17 and about to head off for college. He is forced to decide what to do with his old toys. Throw them away, donate them to a local day care or store them away in the attic? He chooses the latter option (except for Woody, whom he chooses to take with him), but, through a series of misunderstandings, they get set on the curb. They narrowly escape, and decide to jump into the donation box. At first, the day care seems like heaven on Earth: it doesn't matter that these kids will grow up, because a whole new set of kids is always arriving. Unfortunately, there is a pretty cruel society between the toys that has been established at the day care. Buzz and Andy's other toys are left to be destroyed by toddlers who treat them roughly. The stuffed bear Lotso (Ned Beatty) and his minions rule from a room full of grade schoolers. Meanwhile, Woody, who got trapped in the car and ended up donated, as well, tries to make his way back. On his way, he discovers the truth about the day care and goes back to rescue them. The film contains the same feelings and themes of the previous movies, but it has a somewhat more somber tone to it. Of course, it's mainly an adventure film, and it's extremely exciting. The escape from the day care ranks among the great escape movies (unlike Chicken Run, which just feels like a cheap parody of them). At the end of the film's climax there is a bit that is so emotionally overwhelming that it'll probably be remembered as one of Pixar's best moments ever, right next to the Carl and Ellie sequence that opens Up, the final moment in Monsters Inc. or the space walk in Wall-E. In my mind, the whole relationship between Barbie (a donated toy that belonged to Andy's little sister) and the Ken doll she meets at the day care is one of the funniest things ever. The Ken character (voiced by Michael Keaton) is especially hilarious when putting on a fashion show for Barbie. He might well be my favorite character in the entire series."
"Reel_starz","9","2","3","20 June 2010"," In their third feature film, Woody, Buzz and friends reach to infinity and beyond
","Pixar has done it again. Eleven years have passed since the first sequel to their 1995 classic hit theaters, but the Toy Story franchise has lost none of its magic or charm. In preparation for the third installment, I got cozy on my couch, popped the first two movies into the DVD player and found myself fully immersed once again in the world Woody, Buzz and their friends inhabit, the world that represents a distinct part in the childhood years of an entire generation. With top-notch animation (at least for that time), clever dialogue, stories that mixed humor, action and emotion and nuanced, likable characters, it's obvious why Toy Story became the beloved icon it is, transforming Pixar from a fledgling company into the most trusted, reliable studio in Hollywood in less than a decade. As a result, Toy Story 3 had big shoes to fill and any skepticism in the months and years preceding its release are certainly understandable, yet any doubts can now be thrown out the window: the film has met, and for some even surpassed, expectations.<br/><br/>With a few exceptions (old friends like Bo Peep and Etch are missing this time around), the entire gang's back and after an engrossing opener that smartly hearkens back to an early scene in the first movie, it feels as though they've never left. In addition to the original cast, we're gradually introduced to a range of new characters: the insanely squishable Lots-o-Hugs Bear, voiced with sinister zest by Ned Beatty; Michael Keaton's Ken; a Lederhosen-attired hedgehog hilariously named Mr. Pricklepants; a more-than-slightly demented Baby; and other colorful individuals. While these new creatures are not quite as lovable as our old friends (in fact, many are downright menacing), they are still memorable and as fleshed-out as any live-action characters, and per usual, Pixar displays remarkable talent when it comes to voice-casting. Though there are many names that moviegoers will recognize, it is clear that all the actors were chosen because of how well they fit the role, not as a way of boosting the film's prestige - not that Pixar needs any of that.<br/><br/>After features like Wall-E and Up, Pixar has shown a lot of fortitude in its effort to turn its films, and animated flicks in general, into something that adults can see without needing a kid in tow as an excuse. In fact, one could argue that its recent movies are ones for grown-ups that kids can nevertheless enjoy, rather than the other way around, and the third Toy Story does little to buck this trend. Though younger children will no doubt delight in the bright visuals and the jokes scattered throughout, this latest installment is largely empty of the verbal puns and quips that characterized its predecessors, focusing less on humor and more on the dramatic elements of the story. Tackling themes of loss, sacrifice and even death, Toy Story 3 is surprisingly dark. Sunnyside Day Care, the place the toys are donated to now that Andy is headed toward college, turns into a prison with Lotso as its oppressive, totalitarian warden, and one of the daycare residents - a prototypical monkey with cymbals - manages to be the creepiest chimp in recent cinema. Though this is not necessarily a flaw, it does result in an overall tone that differs greatly from Toy Story 1 and 2.<br/><br/>Of course, you can't write a review of a Pixar film without mentioning the impeccable animation. The attention to detail is astounding, and though I was initially dubious, their decision to have Toy Story 3 in both 3D and IMAX pays off tremendously. Though the film will probably be successful regardless of the screen, only with one as big as an IMAX can you fully appreciate how truly incredible the visuals, which fill every inch of the screen with color and subtle touches, are. Even the ""Day and Night"" short that preceded the main feature was jaw-dropping. What's more, though Pixar has always been a master of animation, the progress that they've made within the past fifteen years is astounding.<br/><br/>Over the past decade and a half, John Lasseter and co. have become known simply as ""those geniuses at Pixar"". Though it is arguable whether or not their record is actually as spotless as many suggest (I personally didn't care for either A Bug's Life or Monster's Inc.), it is impossible to dispute their achievements. With gorgeous animation, sharp writing, flawless voice-casting and a cast of unforgettable characters, Toy Story 3 marks another high point in the studio's short but significant resume. Pixar has earned another gold star, and after a sluggish start that sent critics and studios into full-crisis mode, this summer has its first true hit."
"tstaton2","9","2","3","19 June 2010"," Toy Story 3,Heart warming and funny, definitely a classic
","The plot summary goes something like this. Andy is going off to college and is no longer interesting in playing with toys. He chooses to take Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) with him and leaves Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen), Jessie (voice of Joan Cusack), Mr. Potato Head (voice of Don Rickles), Mrs. Potato Head (voice of Estelle Harris), Rex (voice of Wallace Shawn), Barbie (voice of Jodie Benson), Aliens (voice of Jeff Pidgeon, Hamm (voice of John Ratzenberger), Slinky Dog (voice of Blake Clark), and Bullseye (non speaking) behind to be put in the attic. The attic toys mistakenly wind up going to a local daycare. They are thrilled about the move, because they are under the impression that Andy doesn't want them because of the mistaken voyage. But soon they find out it is not always greener on the other side. They are constantly abused by the younger children and they are soon under the power of the great Lotso (voice of Ned Beatty and his right hand man Ken (voice of Michael Keaton), followed by the giant, freakish, lazy eyed, non speaking toddler. They find themselves being held prisoner there and Woody must come to their rescue. Woody and the gang must race against time to free themselves from the evil Lotso and crew so that they can get home before Andy leaves for college.<br/><br/>The theme for Toy Story 3 is things aren't always what they seem and that you shouldn't jump to conclusions. Love is unconditional! Not that Andy is going away to college and the toys start feeling like they are useless, they find themselves having a hard time dealing with what they knew to be inevitable the whole time. They knew there would come a day where Andy would grow up and leave home and then they would be thrown out or store away somewhere. Woody was not pleased with what reality had in store for him but as a faithful toy he knew what he had to do. Andy's other toys (Buzzlightyear, Jessie, and Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head, Rex, Aliens, Hamm, Slinky Dog, Bullseye) and new member Barbie (Andy's sister's old toy) think that Andy doesn't care about them anymore and they want to move on. They are not content with being some old used toy that is going to wait around for Andy. They want to be loved and played with. They would not be happy just sitting in the attic to just be thrown out one day. They end up accidentally getting tossed into the garbage. They don't realize this is an accident and soon find them eager to be taken to a nearby orphanage to get dropped off. Woody tells them over and over again that it is all a mistake and that Andy loves them. Jessie insists that they are not loved and are looking forward to going to the day care. They realize that Woody was right and now they may never see Andy again.<br/><br/>Another example of theme would be once they get to the daycare; the kids are mean and play rough with them. There so called new friends that they meet there turn on them and things are way worse than they ever imagined. They knew that they should have listened to Woody and they wouldn't have been in this mess. They should have also trusted in their long time friend Andy.<br/><br/>I think that the lighting and angles of subjective view of the characters through the majority of the movie kept you involved and made you really feel what the characters felt. It heightened emotion and as embarrassing as it is to say that I cried over an animated movie, I must admit it. The dialogue and lighting used on the scene where Andy and his mother say their goodbyes and he assures her that he will always be with her no matter where they are in the world was really touching.<br/><br/>This movie is by far the best of all the other Toy Story movies and from my understanding may be the last. I strongly suggest you go see this movie. It has a good story line and is filled with suspense, action, drama, adult humor as well as all around humor, sadness and real life lessons. It is an all around great movie for any age and is terrific for families. It is also definitely worth the money to see it in the theater. I didn't see it in 3D because it was not an option and I hate wearing those glasses. I do think it is available in some places. Big thumbs up on this one!"
"cadillac20","9","2","3","19 June 2010"," A Truly Excellent Sequel
","All truly great sequels have one thing that makes them work extremely well, and that one thing is progression. It's why Spider Man 2 and X-men 2 were better than their prequels. And this is exactly what works so well with Toy Story 3. The film manages to maintain it's previous level of humor and excitement, while presenting a new story that fits perfectly with a series that some of us have grown up with. <br/><br/>Much like many of the children who have watched these films, our new Toy Story sees Andy all grown up and ready for college. And for Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang, that means that it's time to start moving on. Buzz isn't quite ready to give that life up yet, and he seems to be the only one that Andy is taking along. The rest of the gang eventually find themselves donated to a day care center, which turns out to be worse than the toys could have anticipated, and it's up to Woody to save the gang.<br/><br/>In it's first hour, the film drags a bit. The jokes aren't quite as funny as they could be, as I didn't laugh quite as much as I laughed during the first two films. But the film is still highly entertaining, and this is one G rated film that everyone should be able to get behind. The story of Andy growing up and moving on is also a perfect direction for the film. It not only speaks of these characters, but it speaks of everyone involved, both behind the film and the audience. It's one final goodbye to our friends in what is probably one of the most successful animation franchises ever. And it's this theme of growing up, moving on, and starting over that carries the second half into perfection. There are moments in this second half that had me on the verge of tears, and I rarely ever cry at a movie. <br/><br/>The plot beyond the themes is great, a homage to prison break movies, with the toys becoming prisoners of the day care center and the subsequent escape. And the new villain, Lotso, is a great sympathetic antagonist who is not without his reasons for who he is. The film is filled with entertaining set pieces, my particular favorite being a scene involving a tortilla that had me in tears of laughter. So, while the jokes are sometimes hit and miss (although mostly hit), there are times when the film is extremely funny. <br/><br/>The voice work here is as good as ever and it's hard to believe that the actors have been away for so long, because it feels like they never left these characters. I almost feel like they sometimes just sit around with each other and do a Toy Story roundabout every once in a while. <br/><br/>There isn't enough good praise that can be said about these characters. Sure, the film drags its feet a little and retreads previous territory, but these are very minor in the face of the glaringly excellent things it does so right. Where Iron Man 2 may be the summer's best blockbuster, this is the summer's first great film, and is everything we have been asking for from our movies since the start."

","Disney is the only one who can make these toys so vivid. I originally thought that the villain in the toy had experienced this life and death and would eventually be influenced. It seems that there is no. Just like in reality, there are also people who not only see death and not save, but still throw stones. It's probably the greatest mercy to hang it on the front of the car and mark it! And the, ""Take care, man. "" It is also the most affectionate farewell of the cowboy Woody to Andy. I like the last scene of the whole film.This inevitable ending is perfect, let the toys continue their mission, accompany another child who loves them to grow up, and it is suitable to end here. Woody watched Andy ' s car go away and cried."
"lewisgilber","8","1","1","9 August 2019"," It's great, but tries way too hard to be emotional!
","With Pixar returning to the toy box for a fourth time this summer, I felt it was worth looking back over the film that many still praise as the perfect end to the original Toy Story trilogy. Like a lot of audiences, I felt some very strong nostalgic vibes when first watching the third instalment in cinemas, and like many, I also got very emotional with the film's final scene. And overall, this film still holds up brilliantly... but it's not as good as the rest of the series.<br/><br/>The original Toy Story was the first film I ever watched as a child, and therefore the first two films hold a special place in my heart. Having already seen the fourth film, I can confirm that it is on par with the original two instalments in my eyes, taking the characters on a journey that many hadn't thought about until seeing the film for themselves. And overall, Toy Story 3 still delivers a heartwarming, thrilling and very entertaining film. The prison escape style narrative fits the drab and unwelcoming environment of Sunny-side Daycare, and the introduction of Lotso (Ned Beatty) is by far the best antagonist in the series to this date. Like the majority of the Toy Story antagonists, Lotso has a sympathetic past, which helps the audience understand what can drive a toy down the path he's on, while still having him be threatening, manipulative and down right barbaric at times.<br/><br/>The chemistry between our ensemble cast continues to grow from strength to strength, with the blossoming chemistry between Buzz (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack) being a primary highlight, thanks to the introduction of El Buzzo, which creates some genuinely funny moments to keep the audience laughing, while still developing the chemistry, without resorting to awkward humour or cheesy dialogue.
I also have to praise the whole animation team at Pixar, who continue to go to infinity and beyond, with the animating skills getting better with every new release. And to have this film still ageing well after 9 years is a great sign of how this film will fare in the future. Some of their best work comes when they can truly go wild with their imagination, such as the opening fantasy sequence, and the climax at the landfill. While there are plenty of animation studios to choose from, I can't think of a better team than those at Pixar. Even when the material is subpar, you know the animators will make the film look so good, you'll cry.<br/><br/>And after all the positives I talked about, it's really hard to say, but Toy Story 3 still remains my least favourite of the series. That's not to say this film is bad, far from it in reality! But since all four instalments of this saga are astoundingly good, something has to be at the bottom. And the reason part three's at the bottom? Simple, it tries hard to provoke an emotional reaction from it's audience. With an 11 year gap between this and Toy Story 2, (Lassetter, 1999) many fans expected the presumed finale would end off on a really emotional note. And at first glance, it does. But sadly, it's become clear to me through occasional re-watches, that the emotional moments are designed in a way that the singular reason some of them are there, is so the audience will have an emotional reaction.<br/><br/>Scenes such as the intense furnace scene aren't bad moments, but the way the scenes play out feel like the emotional response was more of a priority than fitting these moments into the narrative. The biggest flaw is how quickly the toys forget about how close they were to death in the furnace scene, as if it was no big deal. Even though they had literally just held each other's hands ready to face the end. The drama was set up brilliantly, and then quickly undercut before it could get too dark. Although, I'd argue that they couldn't go darker than nearly burning the characters alive.<br/><br/>Another prime example is the ending scene which generally leaves the audiences in floods of tears. And again, I was among that crowd upon first viewing, but 9 years down the line, and I find that scene extremely corny. Not the concept of Andy handing the toys on, the big problem apart from the cheesy nature of the scene, is because Andy's character has done a complete 180 turn in this scene. Andy hardly seems fussed about the toys baring Woody (Tom Hanks) for the majority of the film, then in the last few scenes, he acts like they were always special to him. Which is true from the opening scenes of him as a child. But I don't buy that he still feels like way when he referred to the same toys as ""junk"" a few days previously. Either establish Andy's connection to the toys as an adult more, or tone back the cheesiness of the final scene.<br/><br/>But in the long run, the over eagerness to provoke an emotional reaction doesn't harm Toy Story 3 a whole lot. It's still one of Pixar's finest films, with everything that makes their work great. And had they ended the series here, I would've been perfectly happy with it. I should reiterate that I do prefer the ending from the recent 4th film, which builds on this film's ending brilliantly, but nevertheless, as an end to Andy's involvement in this narrative, the toys had a brilliant end to their original trilogy.<br/><br/>Scores

Really?, and that's lazy on the part of the writers,
and the Spanish version of Buzz is very annoying, but well this thing starts look like i didn´t like the movie and it is not like that, i really liked, because to be a third part is so good, and the movie give you the message that life has many changes and you have to adapt to them,and I dare to say that this movie has one of the best endings in the history of movies.

"kevinthecritic","9","1","1","25 June 2019"," 3rd ""Toy Story"" Funnier than its Predecessors: Has more Heart
","Note: I was moronic in only giving this film 3.5 out of 5. I could not see (or maybe just didn't want to see) the darker, more mature elements at play in the film. I give the film 5 out of 5 stars today. It combines comedy, drama, thrills, and heart-wrenching moments into one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I despise the fact that a fourth installment is being made, and can only hope that it is worthy of this franchise. Please enjoy my review below.
Some film sagas and its characters you never forget. Shrek, Indiana Jones and Han Solo are a few of these characters. Oh yeah, and Harry Potter, too. Another set of these people are the ""Toy Story"" gang. Woody the headstrong cowboy (Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear space ranger (Tim Allen) are the heads of this wonderful group, which also includes Hamm, the piggy bank (John Ratzenberger), Jessie, the cowgirl (Joan Cusack), and Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles).<br/><br/>This time around, the toys' owner Andy is 17 and going off to college, meaning he hasn't played with his toys in some amount of time. Woody, however will be going with Andy to college. Everyone but Woody sees Andy's departure as him not caring for them anymore. So, when the toys see a box going to Sunnyside Day Care, they all hop in, to Woody's dismay. What they find there are new toys like Lotso (Ned Beatty, who's he?), Ken (Michael Keaton as Barbie's love interest), and many others. After Woody leaves the group to go back to Andy, the others soon discover these new friends may not be as friendly as they seemed originally.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" is the funniest of the trilogy. This is because they use dialogue as well as more visual jokes then in the previous installments. I almost cried at the end, which I never ever do in the movies. Whenever something bad happens to the toys, and bad things do happen to them here more then in the other two, you feel sad for them. The climax of the film may be scary to the very young child. I took two small kids to the movie with me and they weren't scared. Still, one or two scenes might frighten the youngest of kids. Some babies were crying at this point of the movie.<br/><br/>I am always impressed with Pixar films. They keep coming up with original ideas that nobody else could. Every one (except ""Wall-E"") has made me happy to see it. I expected this franchise to take the same route as ""Shrek The Third"" did, and I was enormously surprised to see Pixar can do the job for sequels and threquels.<br/><br/>Rated G for a Great Finale (P.S., Hopefully ""Cars 2"" will be good, stay tuned, or whatever)"
"florrieprocter","9","1","1","24 June 2019"," Perfect ending to a trilogy
","So many emotions go on in this movie. You will cry and laugh simultaneously. I believe the most complex emotion of all time is nostalgia and this is what the film specifically draws on. Whatever age you are this will make you feel something. I personally believe they should have ended this franchise here because it would have left it on a perfect, well-rounded storyline."
"Ryan_Barbakins","9","1","1","15 June 2019"," An incredible Ending to a Perfect Trilogy
","Wow. This film incredibly wraps the entire trilogy in an emotional bow that will leave you with tears.
The beginning sets the mood for this film as dark and unlike the others which were much more playful and exciting. Seeing Andy call his toys ""Junk"" at the beginning and then saying ""thanks guys"" at the end perfectly sums up the teenage attitude while keeping Andy's character.
This entire film happened because of the Toys' decision to go to sunny side and not believe Woody. I see why they wouldn't believe him but at the same time I think they should have given him the benefit of the doubt.
Lotso is an amazing Villain. They don't try to keep it too much of a secret that he is a villain by revealing it within the beginning of the 2nd act. This allowed the film to develop Lotso's evil side so at the end when we see him nearly murder everyone, we understand why. His motivations for taking over Sunny Side make sense because he wants to feel in control of something.
I love the ""Prison break"" scene. I guess it's just me, but seeing elaborate plans in action is really satisfying to me, and this plan was super creative so of course I enjoyed every second and was on the edge of my seat.
The ending is so sad. Not the part where they all almost die, but the part when Andy gives him toys away. Andy has realized that he can make someone else happy with Woody and he doesn't need to keep him for himself. Andy's character is almost a mirror of Woody's in the original. This ending is the perfect ending to this perfect trilogy.
However it isn't, because the 4th one is coming out in a week. I only hope that it has purpose and is a good film. All of the positive reviews I have seen of it give me hope that maybe the 4th one has something interesting to offer."

","Most movie series tend to suffer from fatigue or mediocre storytelling as the movies progress through the years, that is not the case for the Toy Story franchise. This movie brings the series into new and uncharted territory, but still seems familiar and maintains the heart and compassion that is apparent within each other film in this series.<br/><br/>I will have to put emphasis on the uncharted territory, as this movie does get a little dark and serious, but honestly, that is what gives this movie heart and soul.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the first two films in this series or have children, I would definitely recommend that you watch Toy Story 3 as it is arguably the best in the franchise."

"Min111","Null","1","1","26 September 2018"," This was about the Toys
","I'm a fan of Toy Story. I liked it from the moment I first saw it. When I first heard there will be a third movie (I wasn't surprised that there will be), I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the previous two, but I was totally wrong about that; in fact, many could argue to say that the third movie was the best, but I think Toy Story 2 was the best one. Maybe, you could have a vote to decide which one - it will be interesting to see the outcome of that.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 was very fun and entertaining to watch. You couldn't go much wrong with the plot, and I don't know what better of a script you could've come up with other than that. Also, the time it has taken to make a third one was astonishing, but it was worth it I guess otherwise the plot would not only have resulted differently, but also would've been a bad one too.<br/><br/>The great thing about Toy Story 3 was just how much it sets itself apart from Toy Story 1 and 2. If Toy Story was mainly surrounding Buzz, and Toy Story 2 mainly surrounding Woody, then you could say that Toy Story 3 was surrounding all of the characters. I say that because the movie was about every one of them, and they don't know where they may be heading to next because Andy is going to college soon, and he's grown out of these ""toys"". That's why the plot was very good, and what makes Toy Story 3 an epic conclusion.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure if a third one was in the works after Toy Story 2. If it wasn't, it would've made no sense considering the success and popularity of the Toy Story franchise.<br/><br/>Toy Story was meant to be a ""trilogy"", and not just a ""trilogy"", but one of the great ""trilogies"" out there today. This is what Toy Story 3 has done. Unlike most movie trilogies, where the third usually under performs, this can't be said with Toy Story, and is something the creators of Toy Story can be very proud.<br/><br/>I know there will a fourth movie, and possibly more, but the original will always hold true no matter how good the fourth one or more is. Whether Toy Story 3 should've been the end of the story or not, only time will tell because it's very hard to say until we see the next one."

So when the 3rd movie came out, I was pumped. I loved it. Then I re-watched it with a friend when I was about 16(I was almost 12 when this released) and realized it was not as appealing. looking back, it was mainly for the potty humor.""Watch out for puddles."" ""I don't think those were Lincoln Logs."" The escape from the bathroom scene. So that's why I give it an 8. But it still is a good movie and it is definitely worth watching!Fun Fact: This was nominated for Best Picture.

It's basically the final chapter (or so we thought until recently) that ties everything together and gives us some happy and sad moments. More new characters plus a prison camp plot that could give The Great Escape a run for its money. While some trilogies' third chapters got a little silly (look at Return of the Jedi), this makes for a better threequel, right up there with the third Lord of the Rings film. Most threequels come up wanting but this didn't. It's nice as a conclusion to the Toy Story saga."
"p-i-kazlou","9","1","1","7 January 2012"," Best part in trilogy, best (animation) film of last years
","I'll go straight on this: I didn't really like the second part of ""Toy Story"". Not that it was a bad movie, but in my opinion it had weak story. The problem portrayed in it was unimpressive and plot details often appeared far-fetched. It was just like ordinary second part of something, the thing which doesn't aim to deliver something new, but just to bring something old and present it again in a slightly new manner for an amazing and good time.<br/><br/>But when I've watched the third part I realized this was a completely another approach. How surprised I was to see the same team that created Toy Story 2 to change their ""set problem->get adventure"" algorithm to a something deeper and metaphorical, something that while being portrayed in toys can be easily seen in us, humans! This valuable ability of a movie about toys was there, in the first part, was almost ignored in the second part, and blossomed into brilliant drama in the third part.<br/><br/>Besides the drama, Toy story 3 still preserves its style of breathtaking adventure and wonderful humor. The things that are equally appealing to children and adults. And this is another wonderful notice about this film - you will have real fun while watching it, and yet have the things to think about when it ends.<br/><br/>It was hard for me not to cry at the end. There were several such strong moments in the film, but that last scene brought the main idea and feeling a toy story could bring to us, adults - that feeling of saying goodbye to your childhood."
"BenRittenhouse674","10","1","1","23 November 2011"," The greatest finale any trilogy could ask for
","Words can't describe my anticipation for Toy Story 3. I waited 10.5 years between the second and third films. I geeked out at the 3D re-release of the first two movies (giving me a chance to finally see every Pixar movie on the big screen). And the day finally came for the film to arrive. I wasn't too impressed by Day and Night; the short that precedes it. It just amused me at best, not among Pixar's best. That didn't bode well for the third Toy Story. Would it be great? Good? Average? Or even... terrible? Could it be Pixar's first complete stinker? Yet, all doubt of the film's quality slipped out of my mind after those first amazing seven-minutes, showing the joys and imagination of childhood at their best. The film really shows you how old we've gotten, through the technology, Molly, his mother, but mostly through Buster (he got a good laugh out of me).<br/><br/>The movie starts out melancholy, almost like it isn't a Pixar movie. The toys are sent to a daycare by mistake, and meet an eccentric teddy bear (Ned Beatty, playing one of the greatest Pixar antagonists, ranking up there with Hopper and Randall), as well as the film's funniest character Ken, Barbie's hunky boyfriend.<br/><br/>It switches to fun mode for a while when Woody escapes and goes to a little girl's house, where he befriends many toys, such as Mr. Pricklepants (very adorable and funny). But it all goes dark once someone goes bad. It becomes a G-rated, borderline PG heist/prison film. Woody heads back to save the day.<br/><br/>But after an 80 minute old-school Toy Story movie, it turns into dark modern Pixar for the last fifteen. It has some of the saddest things I have ever seen in animation, ranking up with the old-school Disney tearjerkers. But the last five minutes make even grown men cry. In the end, it's a great way to say goodbye to our childhood friends, as Toy Story has run its course. It sums up the themes better than any other last installment ever has, showing that growing up doesn't mean the end of friendship and that you will always have the memories.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend buying the DVD/Blu-Ray, and showing it to everyone you know, so that they too can love Toy Story 3, a film for the generations despite not winning Best Picture."

I thought the first one was alright, and I really enjoyed the second one, I used to watch it a lot when I was young, but this one is most likely the best out of the trilogy. It had some funny moments in, I enjoyed most scenes, and it was also quite sad at the end of the movie, but I'm not giving any spoilers away, for those who have not seen this awesome movie. And don't worry, you won't be offended by this, it is a perfect movie for kids of all ages, and me being, well, not too old, I still really enjoyed it and it's no wonder this movie is loved by so many people. I'm not really looking forward to another sequel, I thought the ending to this movie was perfect, (still not spoiling anything) but we'll see if the 4th one is as good as this one, which I highly doubt.

"lasttimeisaw","9","1","1","1 August 2011"," Toy Story 3
","My original plan was to have a Toy Story trilogy orgy thoroughly in one day because I am so ashamed that I haven't watched the first two films yet, then I kept postponing the project indefinitely as not enough time could be squeezed for such a feast. So the day before yesterday I incidentally watched the third one on TV, though discontinuously, it did prompt me to watch it last night. <br/><br/>As a sequel, TOY STORY 3 might be not as splendid or original as Pixar's recent mega-hits UP (2009) and WALL-E (2008), since in a world full of toys, there is not much room left for grandeur milieu. However the whole team behind is extraordinarily decisive and intelligent to mold every single character with respective personalities, even for the trivial sidekicks, which creatively leave indelible impressions on my mind.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, the mammoth success of the film is mainly the victory of a superb script from John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Michael Arndt and the director Lee Unkrich. It could effortlessly project an empathetic impact upon anyone as long as he/she could still recall his/her childhood memory, (for children of course no problem, and as for adults, the repercussions are even more vigorous, its positive messages of intrepid friendship and the soulful revelation of grow-up triumphantly moves everyone, regardless of the fact that if you have watched TOY STORY (1995) or TOY STORY 2 (1999).<br/><br/>For the fun part, the film has numerous wisecracks and innocuous gags all along the way, the prison-break set piece is adeptly maneuvered (the hand-in-hand resolution is as affectionate as unexpected), but the real epiphany comes near the end, it's a tear-jerking moment to wave goodbye to the past, especially those are composed of happiness and joy, we all grow up like Andy, and I do yearn for my old childhood toys (mainly cartoon books though).<br/><br/>The film is also perfect for its score (Randy Newman's We Belong Together has a fatal empathy when playing during the end credits), and all other technical aspects are arranged with Pixar- esque delicacy and accuracy (the editing and art direction particularly).<br/><br/>The voice cast contributes the minimum wage here, but Buzz Lightyear's Spanish mode is my favorite stunt in the film, invincibly hilarious all over the globe.<br/><br/>Ignoring this year's CARS 2, Pixar solidifies its status of representing the apex of the animation film field and what's is more precious is that they master the recipe of fabricating allegorical fairy tales which accommodate almost an entire demography and offer a perfect shelter for us, which we still can self-consciously engage ourselves into the miraculous web of contemporary films."

","Well, as always with Pixar, I expected something great. No disappointment. Absolutely none. And this is coming from a 15 year-old who enjoys action violence, Batman, Star Wars, Terminator, Bourne, and American Psycho. All that in mind, I can honestly say the Toy Story trilogy is one of my favorites. Yeah, I'll admit. <br/><br/>The opening was creative and perfect, drawing from memories and lines dating back to Toy Story's first installment. It was warm and really sets an innocent mood. The ""home film"" flashbacks were another layer of cozy memories, and then fading music fast forwarded us to a harsher time. Flawless. <br/><br/>Andy's age was the perfect way to explain (of sorts) the time lapse. I loved that they didn't try to just throw us back into the past. And now the gang was facing the impending doom Toy Story and Toy Story 2 warned them of. Again, flawless. <br/><br/>And things turned out well for our beloved characters. And new beloved characters were introduced along the way. <br/><br/>After I saw this film in theaters, what I could mainly focus on was the attention to detail. (What crisp animation!) If you've ever owned or had a child who owned one of those toy babies, then you know one eye ALWAYS starts to droop after a while. That made me laugh. Every scuff on a plastic surface, every graying of a stuffed animal, was convincing. <br/><br/>The plot was great! It hard serious comedic moments that had everyone in the theater laughing. And honestly... this movie had actual moments of suspense. I won't give anything away, but it was fantastic. At one point, I even think I was tearing up. <br/><br/>I would go ahead and say this movie, this whole trilogy, is EXCELLENT. Classic is more like it. The ONLY reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I can't quite put it up there with some of my favorites. No critique, simply personal.

He decides he can't be separated from Woody but the other toys are to be kept in the attic. Unfortunately his mother sees that he has put them in a bin bag so puts then to be thrown away. Woody rescues them but they believe they are unwanted so jump at the opportunity to be donated to a day-care centre where they believe they will be happy as they are played with all day long. Unfortunately they are allocated to a room full of wild children who keep damaging their toys and when they try to move to a different room Lotso, the cuddly toy, who decides which to goes where insists that the new toys get sacrificed to the younger children so he and his friends can have an easy life. Once again the toys must figure out a way to escape and get home; although they have no idea what they will do when they get there as Andy will still be going to college.<br/><br/>The story may be about toys but they are all fine characters who most viewers will have grown to care about over the course of the series; Woody and Buzz will always be the stars but cowgirl Jessie is almost as important and even minor characters like the strange green alien toys are a lot of fun. Lotso makes a great villain; I liked how he seems too nice and cuddly at first but was in fact bitter and twisted. The voice actors did a fine job; they all gave character to the toys without the viewer thinking 'that is so-and-so talking'. As one would expect from Pixar the animation was some of the best that I've seen and the story was full of thrills, laughs, a few genuinely scary moments and a bitter sweet ending that may induce tears from some viewers. If you have children I'd certainly recommend this unless they are very young and even if you don't it is more entertaining than most films for solely for adults."

","This is the best of the 3 in the Toy Story trilogy. It has plenty of laughs and, as destined, Andy is leaving for college. The beginning was nostalgic with the old wallpaper at Andy's old room. In the movie, there are plenty of new toys to meet. Too bad Bo Peep, Mr. Spell and Mike are omitted from the movie. I always loved Bo Peep, but Jesse or Bo for Woody is your pick. Of the antagonists in Toy Story, Sid, I hope, is no longer into torturing toys just for fun. Prospector Stinky Pete was charming at first, but was really stinky in his soul and Lotso I would only like as a cuddly toy, as he is tyrannical in the toy life.<br/><br/>Heartwarming conclusion to a heartwarming trilogy."

","With both of its predecessors receiving a 100% positive feedbacks on RottenTomatoes.com, Toy Story 3 is expected to reach the high standards. And it absolutely does. Toy Story 3 follows the 11 year absent of the two previous films and off the Andy going to college. The toys including Woody and Buzz Lightyear are being donated to a daycare center. The toys were ecstatic about it until they found out that the kids there are disgusting and there is a huge evil bear with a one-eyed baby doll guarding them. Adding adventure to the already interesting plot, Woody and the gang decided to humorously escape the center with great style. Director Lee Unkrich, who is not new at all to the Pixar directing department, he's been responsible for Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and co-director of Toy Story 2. So picking him for the job is not a bad idea. He brought something completely new to the table and turned the story around with twists and thrills. Lee Unkrich had done a decent job of directing this beloved film which had both adults and kids crying their hearts out. From the beginning where Andy's home videos are being played to the end where Andy was saying his final good-byes to the toys, Toy Story 3 is a must-see for all ages and it touched all of our hearts one way or the other.

I have really nothing else to say because it has been praised as much as it can be already. Oh, and that ending! Wow, that ending- this marks the 2nd time I have ever cried in the ending of a film, and I am not a cryer at all. I had not cried for anything in over three years, and this certainly did something out of the ordinary. <br/><br/>Great film, a classic already and perhaps Pixar's finest film to date.

So Andy is going to college, and the toys have two fates. The attic, or being given away to other children. However Woddy is excluded from this. That's when the action begins. Toy story is a movie that I would certainly buy. Barbie and Ken are awesome! Lottso, well even though he was a bad guy, you have to say you wish you had a teddy bear just like that.

","First off, I still remember seeing Toy Story the first time when I was two or three years old. I remember how I loved Woody and my brother loved Buzz, and I had a talking Woody doll with a drawstring. I remember when Toy Story 2 came out, and me and my brother got the game for the Nintendo 64 and could never get past the third level. Oh, I remember Toy Story all right- the laughs, the friendship, the pure joy of a movie about something so childlike.<br/><br/>Now I'm 17, and I remember earlier this year walking into the theater to see Toy Story 3. I had pink eye, but it was Father's Day and my 47 year old father wanted to see Toy Story 3 for Father's Day. I remember the fact that there were bunches and bunches of little kids in the theater, who probably weren't anticipating the movie as much as me and my 16 year old brother. This was the moment we'd been waiting for- here was a movie made as a sequel to a movie we'd both loved as a child, one that we still argue over because of Woody and Buzz. And when the start of the movie showed, I was grinning.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 has the same style as the first Toy Story movies. It has moments of comedy, and moments of happiness. It also has a very tension filled moment as the toys seem to face death. This movie had me in tears- every time I've seen it. I saw it twice in theaters.<br/><br/>I waited eleven years for a Toy Story 3, and although it's the only movie series Pixar has, Toy Story has managed to stay in most everyone's hearts. It's like how there's the Harry Potter generation of mostly teens now who've grown up reading the books and are waiting anxiously for the last movie. It's like how Star Wars had at least one movie spanning across three decades- A New Hope in '77, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in the 80s, Phantom Menace in '99, and the others in the 2000s. It's like Lord of the Rings, which my mom (who is 52) has told me were around when she was a kid, and recently they became movies. Every once in awhile, there is something that can capture the hearts of everyone, and it's worth the eleven years we all had to wait for the third Toy Story.<br/><br/>Now we just have to see how Pixar's next sequel movie does, considering Toy Story has been their only movie series so far..."

","I'm pretty sure this was shown in 3D in theaters, but I saw it in 2D via DVD in my own home theater.<br/><br/>This time the theme is Andy heading off to college, and obviously too old to keep playing with his toys, all the toys we have come to know in the first two Toy Story movies. So in last-minute packing and moving to school, except for Woody the toys bound for the attic are put into a black plastic garbage bag, which mom mistakenly believes is trash. That bag gets put out to the street, which Woody, back on the ""college"" box upstairs, notices and they barely manage to avoid the garbage truck.<br/><br/>But in a series of other occurrences the toys end up at a school, which they are initially happy about, being played with every day rather being in an attic. But the toys are really a gang, led by the fluffy stuffed bear Lotso, and Andy's toys effectively become prisoners. So it becomes up to Buzz Lightyear on the inside, and Woody on the outside getting in, to save the day.<br/><br/>The animation of course is superb, as we have become accustomed, but what makes this the best of the three is the quality and depth of the story. Definitely one to own and see periodically.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is back as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, and Joan Cusack as Jessie.

There's not much question of whether fans of the previous two movies will like it, or movie fans of any age. The story is amazing, humorous, thrilling, and bittersweet. There's more adventure, heart, and soul in this ""kids"" movie than in anything else you're likely to see anytime soon.

Not just from a technical standpoint, but as an achievement in artistic style that elevates it to the levels of visual appeal that had until this point been reached only by traditionally animated movies like Spirited Away and a few others.<br/><br/>I know that no movie has been (or ever will be) loved by absolutely everyone. But Toy Story 3 is as worthy of approaching that mark as any other movie I've seen. It's guaranteed to get some kind of genuine response from 99% of those watch it: be it a tear, a cheer, or just a big smile. See it.

","Toy Story 3 is a beautiful and affecting wrap-up of the Toy Story trilogy. Andy goes off to college, and unlike the girls in most Disney animated films, he actually has a living mother. She's the same age as all of us parents who took our children to the original Toy Story films when they were little. All the Toy Story films have been about the sense of time passing and the inevitable sense of loss that goes along with it. Andy's mom, a single mother is loosing her son and he's ambivalently moving away from her and his childhood, the childhood personified in his beloved toys, especially Woody. The first Toy Story film started with a shot of a cloud-patterned wallpaper in Andy's bedroom. Toy Story 3 begins film ends with the camera panning up into the sky (interestingly, Up ends the same way). The director mentioned during his commentary that this gives the film a ""storybook"" quality, but it also gives it a dimension of mystery and becomes a commentary on the transitory nature of life. It's this sense that gives these wonderful films their resonance and makes us able to watch them again and again. Director Lee Unkrich and Producer Darla Anderson's commentary was excellent; they really went out of their way to give credit to all the individual animators and the work done by everyone at Pixar on the film. Generosity like that must make Pixar a great place to work."
"theblacksuit3","10","1","1","5 November 2010"," A wonderful story of change of progress
","I have watched the Toy Story movies my whole life. The first one was my ultimate favorite when i was a kid, and nothing ever spoiled it, not even the extra 15 years of life. When i heard this movie was coming out i didn't get too excited because of the trilogies curse, but when i heard all the great reviews of it being the best trilogy in history, i had to watch it (even though i still wanted to watch it anyway).<br/><br/>The point of this movie is based on how Andy has gotten older and how the toys have to deal with that change. Change is not something easy to deal with, and the fantastic human imagery portrayed in the characters made it that much more real. No one actually thinks about the toys when they give them away or throw them out, and in this we see how they are affected, according to how we think they are at least. The adventure for this is much more mature, and more sinister than most pixar films.<br/><br/>The end was a very impactive scene when the toys were headed for the incinerator. I genuinely thought they would go in because it would have been an interesting end to their adventure, but since it's pixar i knew it wouldn't happen. But how they all joined hands and braced themselves to go out as a family really hit home for me. However, the actual end was beyond fantastic, and the perfect way to end a trilogy. This is literally the only trilogy that i fully love, film for film."

","Nothing is going to beat the first Toy Story, although Wall-E was extremely close, but Toy Story 3 is still a great action film, yes this is not a typo, this ""cartoon"" is one of the best action films ever! With the opening montage paying tribute to the first two movies in an awesome action piece and explaining why the toys needed an owner and have a need to be played with, they also embark on the adventure that the kid is imagining for them and I thought that was pure genius from Pixar, love the villain Lotso and personally I thought his flashback of why he was who he was was the sad part of the film and not the ending like many reviews said. The supposed ""sad"" ending was Andy's mom crying because her little boy is going to college and this in my opinion felt forced and reminded me of Transformers Revenge of the Fallen with the crazy mom crying over the baby booties and lost all credibility for me, besides the ending was a happy ending with the toys staying with Bonnie who is essentially another Andy instead of staying in the attic and of course Woody never abandoning his friends. Spanish Buzz was funny at first but Jessie being ""turned on"" was ehhh, look at her expression when she is dancing with him at the end credits, awkward. Anyways, these are obviously nitpicks since the movie is great and almost a masterpiece, especially the action pieces- also the return of classic Buzz (the scene where he is at demo mode) is always welcome)"
"Rizar","Null","1","1","3 November 2010"," Toy Story 3 (2010, G)
","""Toy Story 3"" has plenty of action, adventure, and fun once it gets going, but even better is the overall effect of nostalgia for the viewer. Comedy films like to make fun of these types of childhood experiences, and no doubt they do have a comical side especially through the perspective of adults; for example, Rick Moranis is memorable playing with action figure dolls in a scene in ""Spaceballs"". ""Toy Story 3"" gives playtime scenarios a positive and tear-jerking spin with high hopes of lifting them from comedy into important individual and educational experiences. However, the catch is that most of the movie is a parallel adventure played out by the toys themselves. Having the toys come to life is not quite as annoying as in other films. It actually makes sense from the perspective of a hypothetical game scenario that a kid would likely make up.<br/><br/>Andy, 17 years old now, is past playing such games and leaves his toys untouched in a toy box. He keeps the box around at his age mainly for the requirements of the plot, and we can imagine the writers had a difficult time figuring out how to begin the third of these ""Toy Story"" movies. They start with an flashback to Andy's toys in full lifelike visual effects, which seems right out of a segment for a modern video game. Andy lets some of the toy characters behave based on their inherent persona's, but some of them he creates himself, such as giving a piggy bank, Hamm (John Ratzenberger), an evil nature as the ultimate bad guy of his stories. Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), and associates are the main good guys.<br/><br/>But these are short lived events as we flash forward to Andy's grown up concerns about college. His toys quickly downgrade from a hope to play with him again to a hope that he will store them in the attic rather throw them in the trash. Is this a slight metaphor for keeping the fruits of our childhood visions alive? Well, the toys see their role as servants to any future need Andy might have for them, but an attic isn't very entertaining, so the toys get sent to Sunnyside daycare in the hopes they may be of interest to a new generation of kids. They won't. The toys get sent to a play room for toddlers, who have no imagination and only bang the toys into things and rip them apart. The kids might as well have a bunch of rocks to roll around since they certainly aren't getting any benefit out of elaborately designed toys.<br/><br/>Woody (Tom Hanks) tries to convince the rest of Andy's toys to break out of the place and to live in peace in Andy's attic, but they are skeptical. They think Andy was about to throw them in the trash and they want new kids to play with them. Woody escapes by himself, but a young girl, Bonnie, finds him and takes him to her house. Woody enjoys his games with her, but her toys (including a theater porcupine, Mr. Pricklepants, who shushes the other toys so he can stay in character) inform him that Sunnyside isn't sunny and his friends are in trouble. A big purple and strawberry smelling bear, named ""Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear"" or ""Lotso"" (Ned Beatty), who rides in the back of a toy truck and walks with a cane like Yoda, is actually a menacing warden over Sunnyside daycare. He loves to give hugs, but he also likes to send the newbies (toys, that is) to the toddler playroom (named Caterpillar Room) and keep them prisoner at night so they won't try to escape. He creates an oligarchy of toys in which his elderly elite get to play with the older kids (in the Butterfly Room), who actually use them as intended and imagine them in more sophisticated games.<br/><br/>The escape sequences are the most adventuresome and funny parts of the movie. Lotso marshals his forces to keep the new toys in line. His long time enforcer is Big Baby, but he also has Ken (Michael Keaton), an octopus (Whoopi Goldberg), and roving trucks on his side. His newest addition is Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who he reboots to a default military mode (stripping him of his former identity) by reading his instructional manual. At one point Buzz gets reset into Spanish mode, turning into a romantic. Ken entertains Barbie by modeling clothes. He has a soft spot for clothing as much as she does, perhaps from participating in so many games imagined by girls. Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris) have parts similar to a Transformer or certain Vampires – ears, eyes, and mouths function perfectly while detached. Mrs. Potato Head sees over long distances to her lost eye, and Mr. Potato Head attaches his parts to pita bread. Are their parts therefore nearly immortal?<br/><br/>It expands from this arch of a playful adventure to make a point about the value of play. It's a film about nostalgia for a boy's past experiences playing with toys as a sort of simulation or self-training for life. It might be a tear-jerker for many viewers, perhaps mostly adults, because many will relate to its message. The message is perhaps that Andy had a great deal to do with raising himself, but not entirely on his own. He also had the help of toys to manipulate and use as little pegs for his memories. These toys develop their own back story for him, some of which is inherent in the toys' characters but some of which is quite unique and invented by him. In this sense, his toys are external memories, storing a mini world of his past imaginings and mental experiments. It's important to him to pass these memories along."

","""Toy Story 3"" has the most touching ending of a movie in recent memory, delivered with such tenderness and sincerity that bring even big guys to tears. <br/><br/>Up until that moment, the story's toy heroes had gone through hell in order to belong, to find a home and fulfill their destiny, and now they've done it. But the scene belongs to their owner, Andy, who is at the crossroads of his life, ready to say goodbye not only to the comforts of home but also to the joys of childhood. Nostalgia, letting go, a rite of passage – for the boy as well as the audience, the blend is bittersweet.<br/><br/>Between ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Toy Story 3"", a number of good things happened. Animation master hatched the idea for the final sequel, Lee Unkrich honed his directorial gifts with three Pixar studio hits, and Michael Arndt found fame writing ""Little Miss Sunshine."" But negative things happened too, such as America's descent into a period of recession, making it a receptive ground for this movie's theme of usefulness and obsolescence. Until today, there are legions of employed people out there living in fear of the red slip or the rude jolt of restructuring. The plight of Andy's endangered toys is not much different from their own.<br/><br/>Once loved and appreciated, the toys (job description: give joy), find themselves literally being sacked. After a series of fateful errors, they end up under two new managements: Sunnyside day care center's destructive horde of 2-year-olds during the day, and at night, a strawberry-colored stuffed bear and his sinister band of thugs. <br/><br/>Lasseter, Unkrich, Arndt and their teams of animators then weave their magic, crafting a thrilling adventure story of the toys' escape from their prison which is as engrossing as the best action movies from any major studio. The difference is that these plastic and polyester stuffs have more heart than, say, Rambo (make no mistake, Rambo's full of it), and can act and ham it better than, say, Arnold – they're far more . . . animated. <br/><br/>It starts with the clear sketches of the toy characters, each one assigned its own dossier, quirks and emotional baggage. The mainstays such as Cowboy Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie the Cowgirl and the Potato Heads are joined by new ones such as godfather Lotso and, surprise, Barbie and Ken. The inclusion of Barbie is not an unlikely choice because after all, she is the collectible of collectibles. Every toy gets its turn to shine -- to be endearing, witty, plain silly or even menacing -- and when it does, so does the actor who lends the voice, with special mention to Ned Beatty as sadistic Lotso.<br/><br/>As ""Toy Story 3"" hurtles to its rousing finale, one can understand why in some movie theaters, audiences cheer and give it a standing ovation at the end. Pixar rules. Once again, it has won the hearts of viewers 10 years and above.<br/><br/>I really can't speak for those 10 and under. One possible pitfall of making animation feature films is the imperative to entertain both the kids and their parents. This multi-tasking can result in clever double entendres, humor that works on different levels and wonderful messages that can be grasped by either young or old or both.<br/><br/>But when it comes to imagery of the frightening kind, the studios may be treading on sensitive ground, because one need not be a psychologist to know that there are certain images that terrify children and haunt them even in their sleep.<br/><br/>One prototype of animation movie villains is the witch from ""The Wizard of Oz."" Some kids found her so frightening that they peed in their pants. Those were the 1940s, long before the villains of TV cartoons and computer games became regular household guests. Have preteen children evolved so much in seven decades that they now have very high tolerance for the abnormal and the grotesque?<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" contains a few images that could be terrifying for the youngest kids: an overgrown baby doll in diapers who is one of the thugs; a ghostly cymbal-clapping monkey straight from ""Phantom of the Opera""; and visions of hell in the form of gigantic toy shredders and seething incinerators. All in bigger-than-life 3D. Combine them with super- realistic effects and hard-edged storytelling and one wonders if the young 'un is really having fun.<br/><br/>Perhaps there should be a new rating system for the benefit of those under 10, or perhaps movie makers should remember a little girl's complaint to her dad one day at a theme park: ""Don't walk too fast, Daddy. I got small feet."""

The ending was so good, and it was an exciting movie to watch. It was not predictable and most appropriate. I think everyone should give this a watch, you will not be disappointed."

","TOY STORY 3 - CATCH IT ( A+ ) Every time I see Toy Story movie, I wonder what next the creators can have stored for us and to be honest I get stunned every time, it was very recently I saw Toy Story 1 & 2 in 2010, So, I was very excited for the Toy Story 3 and finally I got my hands on it. When it started I wonder what will they do now but trust me the creators know what they are going into and they give us what we want Toys on Big Adventure! Every moment from first till last a person keep wondering what will happened next? as the things take unexpected turn every other moment. The Toy Story trilogy have been as engaging as any thriller/adventure movie can be. I loved every part of it and can't wait for them to make another Toy Story because their story can be enjoyed by everyone whether kid, young, adult or old people."

","First things first: This is hands down the best 3-D picture I have seen to this day (that's towards the end of 2010). And I have seen quite a few 3-D pictures! From Horror (Valentine, Final Destination) to Fantasy (Journey to...) and animation (Shrek 4). Ice Age (3-D) was almost equally enjoyable (for me), but Toy Story 3(-D) is just top notch! <br/><br/>And all comes down to the fact, that you have a movie at the core. A story that will move you, a ride that will take you with it. And it works even if you have never heard of the characters before (or seen them for that matter). Of course there are a few inside jokes, that you will only get if you have seen the prior entries into the series (another but not the only reason to check out the other Toy Story movies).<br/><br/>It's difficult to put your finger into, why Pixar is able to make movies for adults and children alike, that have a high quality too. It is not a coincidence, that Pixar waited until they had their story for the part 3, before they went ahead to make it. If rumors are true of some other story ideas (Disney almost developed the third part), than you can only be glad, they waited and made it just now.<br/><br/>The story is so rich and the movie was one of the few times, I actually went to the cinemas a second time, to watch it again. I can only say: Thank you Pixar!"

","Like millions of others, I was a little kid when I saw the first ""Toy Story"" in theaters. I loved it. <br/><br/>A few years later, I saw the second one, and I was not impressed. I did not plan to see this movie for I believe that every great original follows terrible sequels. With friends who kept telling me to see this movie, I finally gave in. I just finished watching it and I was blown away. I should say that 3d animation films have become a common thing, yet somehow the animation seems to be getting better and better. As a student pursuing a potential career in 3d modeling, I was flabbergasted by not only the detail in all of the characters but also how the animators added personality to them in their walks, mannerisms, and specifically with their facial expressions. This movie probably would not have been possible back in the release of the original ""Toy Story"". The characters are easy to love (and some are easy to despise) and the voice talent is superb—I can never get tired of the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. <br/><br/>But what I really love about this animated feature is the story. To sum it up briefly, Andy is going away to college and the toys accidentally end up in a daycare, which is hell in a handbag. The remainder of the story is made up of them trying to get back home. It sounds simple enough for an animated film, but like the last two films done by Pixar, there is an underlying, emotional feel beneath it.<br/><br/>Watching this movie, I can't help but think back to my childhood—playing with my toys, letting my imagination run wild. This movie brings back old memories—as it does with the character Andy. I can relate a lot to his character, and at the very end (not trying to give too much away), he passes the mantel on to another child. For the first time with an animated feature, I actually cried. Not with sadness, but with an inner happiness. Like Andy, I can never go back to my childhood. This film has also fueled my imagination to continue my goal into getting a career 3d modeling.<br/><br/>Pixar has made another triumphant feature. Toy Story 3 is funny, action-packed, suspenseful, and for some, it will bring tears. Who thought that toys could bring tears? Apparently this is the magic of Pixar.<br/><br/>4/4"

The gang find themselves, by default, in the ownership of a day care centre, which is in the grip of the seemingly kindly Lotso Lovin' Bear (Ned Beatty) who secretly runs a tyrannical control over everything there. Woody, Buzz and his love interest Jessie (Joan Cusack), must work together to save the day and say goodbye to Andy before it's too late.<br/><br/>All good things seem to come in threes, and certainly, it would seem the best film franchises need to have a perfect three o to make themselves complete- Terminator, Godfather, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (?!?)...some even spoil it by veering into foursies- Lethal Weapon, Alien, Rambo...but three, as De La Soul once said, certainly seems to be the magic number. And, the third part to Toy Story has certainly kept a novelty in the bag...by making it a 3D experience, with the chance to see it in 3D glasses that hardly bring everything out right in front of your eyes, but illuminate it enough so that it stands out from any of the other films. Luckily, though, the more superficial stuff like that doesn't override the same charm and good writing that made the last two as bearable for adults as fun for kids.<br/><br/>Not a massive lot really stands out, formula wise, from the other two films, other than perhaps a slightly veering slant towards less of a happy ending than a conclusion to what could either be a brilliant trilogy or a never-ending, soulless stream of sequels. As it does, it goes for a more darker, human edge to the characters and story, drawing us towards a genuinely thrilling, seat edge conclusion, that at first seems a cheeky homage to Arnie's demise at the end of Terminator 2, but in fact comes to stand alone perfectly as it's own great ending, before a sentimental, gushy final part that if it doesn't round the story off, at least sets it in stead for a new chapter.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the animation/graphics are all brilliant as ever, and that the geniuses at Disney/Pixar have done their thing to great effect once again. Truly, whatever they've already done and whatever they will do in the future, the Toy Story series will stand alone as one of, if not their best, achievement ever. *****"

"MovieLad26","10","1","1","17 September 2010"," Beautiful final entry into the popular ""Toy Story"" series of films
","First off, I grew up with Toy Story. Being born in 1990, I was quite young when I first saw ""Toy Story"" on VHS. At first, I was stunned. What an amazing movie it was! The voice acting was superb, the animation and comedy were the calling cards for such a wonderful start for the Disney/Pixar collaborations. Toy Story 2 was, at first, even better. But having watched the original, I can honestly say that nothing beats the first.<br/><br/>Finally, after years of rumours circulating around what the third entry would have, ""Toy Story 3"" is finally here! I did something I usually don't do, and bought into the hype. It paid off nicely, as I was overwhelmed with excitement and sadness that this would be the final chapter for our friends, Woody and Buzz. But none the less, it was a finely crafted masterpiece that will forever be a milestone in sequel history.<br/><br/>As I'm sure you're aware, Andy is now 18 years old in the film, and the toys are not being played with like they used to; and after a misunderstanding, the toys are sent to a daycare centre where things are not as they seem. Immediately, the toys are separated from Woody, and our story picks up. Without revealing anymore, I'll just say that from the first time we see our old friends, to the tear-jerking au revoir, ""Toy Story 3"" is again, a beautiful film that'll warm the hearts of children for years to come. And if you don't like seeing Andy as a teenager, then you can always whip out the old' VCR, and watch the original.<br/><br/>10/10!"
"peah90","9","1","1","11 September 2010"," A really nice animated feel-good movie
","Toy Story 3 tells a emotional, loyal and devoted story around Andy's old toys, which accidentally land in a kindergarten of cruelty. Briefly after the beginning of the movie, the audience experience that Andy is going to the college, no good place for toys like a sheriff, a outer space hero and potato heads, therefore Andy decides to put them on the attic, but due to a mistake they get to a kindergarten. On the first sight this kindergarten makes a nice impression, but after a few hours it's clear to the toys: It's a pure horror.<br/><br/>Woody is able to escape from the kindergarten, without knowing about his luck and finds a little girl named Bonnie, who really plays with her stuff and cares about their toys. A really paradise for toys. Woody meets a clown there, who tells him the truth about the kindergarten and its leader. For Woody, the brave sheriff, there is only one possible solution: He has to go back and save his friends from Lotso, the evil softbaer. After Woody and his friends worked out a clever plan to escape the highly monitored toy prison, they are stopped in the last second by Lotso. Now the tide turns for Andy's toys. Woody reveals Lotso's dark past and his lies. The other toys are now longer listening to Lotso, who has been dumped by his former allies. After all the adventures Andy's toys are able to get back to their ""child"". But due to the suggestion of Woody, Andy decides to give all of them away. Even Woody. But fortunately, this time, they get into the hands of the little girl mentioned above.<br/><br/>Altogether Toy Story 3 is a really great movie. The story is sweeping and you really care about the characters. In addition to Toy Story 1 & 2 the characters evolved and made reasonable decisions. Furthermore the movie really had some stereotypical (in a good way) and funny moments, for example the whole, superficial and hilarious relationship between Barbie and Ken or the passionate relationship between the two potatoes. Even Buzz fells in love with the cowgirl after he is switched to Spanish mode. :D But the greatest relationship is the one between Woody and Andy. Even if this relationship is only one dimensional, it's truly devoted. Woody would do and did anything to stay with Andy, to fulfil Andy's will. Moreover Woody is pretty selfless, he always cared about the other toys, even though he is Andy's all time favorite toy. Woody had more than one chance to let the others their destiny. But he always cared for them and made sure that the family stays together.<br/><br/>I rate this movie with 9 points, for it's sweeping story, it's heart and last but not least the comedy, which is appropriate for children and adults."

","It seems many third instalments often fail to live up to the standards of the first two. Examples according to me: X-men: the last stand, Spider-man 3 and Terminator 3. Not so with Toy Story, after years of rumors, hope and despair Pixar finally returns and delivers all I wanted and dared to hope for. It has been a couple years and one really sees that technology moves forward and it's not just the 3D. <br/><br/>Toy Story 3 has it all: the humor, parody(Star Wars, Jurassic Park), animated action that succeeds to even thrill. But the thing that Pixar are so good at and especially in the Toy Story movies is that they manage to create such a relation between you and the characters. Some may say but it's a children's movie, but it doesn't matter because if you've grown up with the series you want to know what will happen to Woody, Buzz and the gang. Not just is it the characters so deep but the plot is so well done, it has such substance. I found myself starting to chew over the relations between toys and an owner and how this change when grown up. The plot is so smart and really touches ones feelings. The ending so sad and at the same time just as hopeful. How an animated children's movie about toys brought me to the brink of crying I don't know, the next time I see it I wont be able to hold it back. Amazingly impressive Pixar. Not made just for money but because there is a good story to be told. So funny, thrilling, even thought provoking, visual outstanding and so sad. A movie to see again, again and again. Everyone should see it.<br/><br/>This is not just one of the best animated movies I've ever seen, not just the best threequel (sorry Return of the king), but even one of the best movies. Without doubt the best movie of the 2010s so far, it will be hard to beat.<br/><br/>Should there be a Toy Story 4? I'm very divided."
"MisterMxyzptlk","8","1","1","31 August 2010"," Toy Story 3.
","Here's a wonderful completion to Pixar's flagship. The film does exactly what it aims to do and is strong enough on it's own to be recognized outside of the pack. However, the lying problems to me were two fold. The use of 3D hindered my enjoyment. The tool is useful when applied properly and perhaps for limited viewing. But I couldn't help but feel a wall between me and the film. The final moments with Andy could have been richer for me without this distraction. I wanted to well up inside. I wanted to shed tears for a story a cared very deeply about, but I couldn't move past the awkwardness. Still, a great fitting end to a wonderful series."

","First of all might i say, well done to the Pixar staff for once again giving the world another masterpiece. Its hard to believe but until today i hadn't had the time to see this movie but luckily i got to see a screening today at my local theatre. It blew me away! the detail was so refreshing, the plot was genius, it reminded me of just how awful Shrek 4 was. To be honest i was a bit worried for this movie because i wasn't sure if Pixar could pull off another great sequel since they've only made 2 including toy story 3. The first time i heard that they were making toy story 3 i got excited and worried at the same time, but when i heard all the good reviews and talk about it was my ambition to see it! it was just so.. well.. it couldn't have been better. a true masterpiece. and plus it was the third instalment which is quite tricky to make a good movie out of, even a sequel is hard, let alone a third. but thanks to toy story 3, i have faith in Pixar's future and cars 2! i was totally against the sequel at first but now i think it could be great! The 3d for toy story 3 was fine, nothing gimmicky or rubbish, although it didn't need it, it gave the movie more depth and emotion. The characters are all fun, even the new ones. This movie is entertaining for all ages. It ended the trilogy in the best possible way and if they were to make a 4th, that would be so stupid because it ended the series so perfectly! My overall rating is a 10/10. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys being happy."
"joose90","9","1","1","30 August 2010"," ""They're making Toy Story 3? You're kidding, right?""
","If you're like me, you still remember being totally captivated by Toy Story when it came out in 1995. The animation, the characters, the plot, everything. Toy Story 2 I really don't have an opinion on. It was an above average animated movie as I recall, but it couldn't match its predecessor's awesomeness. Now, in 2010, I hear Toy Story 3 is coming out. First reaction: ""Aw sh*t, not again..""<br/><br/>Regardless of my prejudice towards Toy Story 3, I saw it. Mostly because of all the hype. I didn't want to be left out of the loop. Having seen it, do I think it's the 12th best movie ever, in the history of film? Better than Casablanca, Fight Club and Memento for example? No, not really. While it's a very good movie in my opinion, I still think it's slightly overrated.<br/><br/>That said, the reason I'm giving it a 9/10 is simply that while the plot, the character progression and the witty dialog would earn it an 8/10 in my books, Pixar has been able to do something that no other company has ever done. They've made the Toy Story brand so strong that they can still make a grown man cry like a baby, watching some fictional goddamn toys! The last quarter of the movie was like Schindler's list all over again (crying-wise. You get the point), except this time the movie wasn't a true story about a man putting his life on the line saving total strangers from certain death, it was about toys escaping from a freaking kindergarten!<br/><br/>Pixar has, once again, shown the world why they're the best at what they do, and set the bar pretty high for all the competition. Toy Story 3 has all the qualities a great animated movie should have, and while I don't think it deserves the 12th spot on the top 250 movies -list, I think it's one of the best animated movies I've seen, with only Toy Story in all it's nostalgia, and WALL-E as it's main competitors.<br/><br/>Pixar, I salute thee.. Again."
"scardin17","9","1","1","28 August 2010"," Pixar did it again!
","I was extremely nervous when I first found out about Pixar coming out with Toy Story 3. I basically grew up with the first two movies, which were amazing. The thought of Pixar making a trilogy out of Toy Story was nerve-racking. After leaving the theater, all doubts that I could ever have had about Pixar and their capability were gone. Pixar, once again, had demonstrated their ability to overcome expectations. Toy Story 3 was one of the best sad comedies that I have ever seen. I love how mostly everyone can relate to it. At some point of everyone's lives, one has to move on and leave behind the toys that he/she really cared about. I can relate to the character Andy because I, also, had to put toys away before leaving for college. It is a love/hate relationship because you know that you need to move on, but at the same time the thought of leaving them behind can scare anyone.<br/><br/>I really have nothing bad to say about the movie. Toy Story 3 was simply amazing. I guess that the only thing that made my experience kind of weird was that I went to the theater with my ten-year – old sister. It made me feel really old because Toy Story is more of my generation, not hers. I had to go home right after and show her the first Toy Story.<br/><br/>Out of the trilogy, I definitely have to rate Toy Story 3 second, right after Toy Story. I was not really a fan of the second one, but yet again, I usually don't like sequels. I feel like Toy Story 2 did not really have a point to it. Toy Story 3 definitely brought me back to my childhood with Toy Story. Just seeing all the familiar faces gave me Goosebumps. Pixar did it once again!"

The plot was pretty good, the characters were great, and the animation was so beautiful it just blows you away. The only thing that I was disappointed about was replacing Jim Varney with Blake Clark which I don't think Pixar should of done. They should of written Slinky Dog out but that's just my opinion.

"wryterz","10","1","1","25 August 2010"," This actually is Pixar's best. Seriously.
","Whether you like, love or detest Pixar's films, the fact is, that they are very good story tellers and globally, their films will always receive rave reviews, as did this potentially final instalment of the film that first made them famous. The expectations were high and though they have never made a dud film, I feel that since the Incredibles, Pixar films have lacked in the entertainment department, if only so slightly.<br/><br/>What works for this film is that it has all the lovable characters we've come to enjoy on the big screen. From Woody, Buzz, Rex and Mr. Potato to Bulls-Eye, Jessie and Buster, there are a whole host of them to enjoy and of course we are introduced to a bundle of fantastic new characters, the picks of which are Ken, Big Baby and Lots-O-Huggin' Bear.<br/><br/>Andy has grown now and is on his way to college. He hasn't played with his toys in a very long time and the toys themselves are feeling neglected. When he begins to clear his room and stumbles upon them, he decides to put them all in the attic except Woody, who he is taking to college with him. But as one thing leads to another, Andy's mom, accidentally thinking it's a bag filled with garbage, throws the plastic bin liner out for the garbage truck. Though the toys escape, they believe that Andy was going to get rid of them so the toys, much to Woody's dismay, end up going to a day care centre where they meet up with other toys.<br/><br/>Firstly, lets congratulate Pixar on coming up with a very unique storyline. This could have been a really terrible film and a money-making scheme gone wrong, as so many sequels usually are. But right from the very start, the team have put together a strong film with lots of emotional content. <br/><br/>The animation is obviously incredible and the expression on each and every single toy is too good to describe. Every emotion is captured so perfectly that it is as though the toys are actually alive and you can feel everything they convey, Woody being particularly exquisite.<br/><br/>Another plus point for this film, visually and emotionally aside is the mood of the film. Yes, there is emotion, which I will come to in a moment, but there is also huge amounts of laughter and it allows the film, which has lots of dark moments, to be broken up nicely. Ken's clothes show and Buzz's Spanish session are two moments that stand out immensely. <br/><br/>My four year old son loved Toy Story 1 and 2, yet there were times when his mind wondered because the story gets so deep at times that there are portions where the action lacks, and this is unfortunate for children under six. But that is not a bad thing. Especially when you consider that the previous two instalments had a lot of mature contents in them too.<br/><br/>This film is definitely darker as well, which proves that Pixar are very bold and daring. They've given us a lot to ponder over in the past but Toy Story 3 gives us much more to think about. Not only is this film very sinister (my son jumped twice) but like I mentioned before, it has a very emotional message to it, and when the final credits begin to roll, you cannot help but feel sad, and that in itself is impressive for an animated film about toys.<br/><br/>The actors are obviously excellent and the new additions, Michael Keaton's Ken and Ned Betty's Bear especially are superb additions to an array of fantastic characters. Some of these however have very little to do and if it wasn't for a little bit of research, I may not have known who the voices belonged to; Whoopi Goldberg and Bonnie Hunt being two big names that had little to say.<br/><br/>There are moments of predictability in this, but that is expected, otherwise the film may have been far too complicated for many youngsters to follow. The more I think about the film however, the more I realise how good it is. Yes, to compare oneself to any of the previous two Toy Story films is not an easy thing to do, but after careful consideration, I will be brave enough to say that this is the best in the trilogy and possibly Pixar's best film of all time.<br/><br/>BEST SCENE: The entire finale; I honestly couldn't predict if they were going to succeed in their mission or be betrayed or fail or a number of things. Shiver.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: There is no other possible way this could have concluded. Emotional, dark and riveting, Toy Story 3 surpasses both its predecessors in almost every way. This is definitely a fantastic film and now it's a fantastic trilogy.<br/><br/>10/10 – Un-miss-able"
"x_chem","9","1","1","21 August 2010"," Wow!
","I'm only 16 and like most other people my age, I grew up watching Toy Story 1 & 2, and when I heard that they were going to make a 3rd Toy Story film I'll be honest, I wasn't actually that excited I was a little disappointed in fact because I thought they would go and ruin a great film franchise by making another film just to make money just like they did with the Godfather series. That said I still went to see it because there is obviously no better place to watch a film than in the cinema I didn't want to miss the opportunity. I was quite simply amazed and I can't understand why I ever thought Toy Story 3 might not be that good.<br/><br/>When I walked into the screening room it was virtually packed of people of all ages; there were people my age, parents with their kids and even adults without kids in there which proves anyone of any can enjoy Toy Story and the best part was that when the credits rolled and they were showing the extra clips at the end of the movie virtually the whole audience remained in their seats to watch the final clips which I guess shows how much they all enjoyed it.<br/><br/>To those who haven't seen the movie yet you definitely should, no question. You've probably also heard that this movie is very sad if you haven't seen it yet, and that's true it is sad at times but it's also very funny at others and I even found it thrilling in some parts as well. How Pixar managed to make adults cry over a group of toys that don't even exist I'll never know- but that's the genius behind the movie."

","Pixar have made another brilliant film , and its a worthy addition to the previous Toy Story films. All the lovable characters are back and the film has the right balance of humour mixed with a tinge of sadness. Some scenes were very sad and effective for example the ending when Andy gives the toys to the little girl Bonnie , it nearly made me cry and I consider myself quite a tough cookie! Also the part when the toys hold hands when they think they are about to be burnt and die , in the tip. The humour was strong throughout the film, I particularly liked Spanish Buzz Lightyear and the Ken doll was exactly how i would imagine him if the doll came to life. The animation and visuals were great , as expected from Pixar. The toys looked so real I felt like I could actually reach out and feel the texture on the toys.

But when the toys are accidentally donated to the Sunnyside Daycare they are all very happy to be played with again, except of course Woody who believes that the donation was a mistake. Soon after the toys are comfortable at their new home, they begin to uncover the true nature of the toys that live in the Sunnyside Daycare. Now, all the toys must team up together again to escape the daycare, and return home.<br/><br/>Walking out of the theater for Toy Story 3 I was shocked. I had heard that the movie was very good, but in no way did I believe that a second sequel like this one could be that good, and oh how I was wrong. In my opinion, Toy Story 3 is proof that Pixar is probably the best maker of animation today. This movie was terribly sad at the end, and it had such a fantastic ending that I believe many people will cry in, which is not easy to do with an animated movie. The animation was beautiful, and Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have done it again. They were superb. Even though I believe that Toy Story 3 was not quite as good as the originals, everyone who loves movies should watch this. It is one of Pixar's best yet."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","1","21 August 2010"," So Long...
","""Toy Story 3"" is one the best movies of the year. Pixar, John Lassiter, and company have done it again—crafted a visually captivating movie and a sentimental story with heart. I saw ""Toy Story 3"" when it first came out over a month ago. I waited until now to write a comment—not really compelled to generate something quickly. Tom Hank's beloved cowboy toy Woody stares off to the distance and says, ""So long partner."" I got a lump in my throat. For me Woody is really saying, ""I will always love you, partner."" However, this catharsis of unconditional love and legacy does not seem to culminate from the chaos of the Daycare Center, the chases, and crises. Wonder if we could have arrived at the same space, otherwise. I recalled the eloquence of ""Toy Story 2"" with Sarah McLachlan singing ""When Somebody Loved Me"" over 10 years ago. I remember that fondly to this day, and being profoundly moved and inspired. <br/><br/>I think ""Toy Story 3"" is great, but falls short of ""Toy Story 2"". Props to Director Lee Unkrich and Writers John Lassiter and Andrew Stanton for completing the trilogy in satisfying style. The animation is amazing and breathtaking. I loved the return of all the great character toys including Ken (Michael Keaton) and Barbie (Jodie Benson). However, I was puzzled by some of the darker narrative elements. <br/><br/>In the story, Andy (John Morris) prepares to leave for college. He must decide what to do with his old toys. Obviously, he can't take them all with him—aside from perhaps Woody (Hanks). In a mix up the bulk of the toys including Buzz Lightyear (hysterical Tim Allen) end up as donations to Sunnyside Daycare. On the surface this may be new life for the toys—they will be loved by new children all over again. The subtext is unexpectedly menacing. So it is Woody to the rescue.<br/><br/>The seemingly jolly teddy bear Lotso (folksy charming Ned Beatty) is so off. We get the creepiness factor which grows exponentially as the story unfolds. Also his partner is the hideously scary Baby Doll missing an eye. This is kind of a weird throw back to old school Disney movies which routinely and bizarrely incorporated evil narrative elements into children's stories. Even Lassiter and Stanton's back story on Lotso doesn't generate any authentic compassion or sympathy.<br/><br/>The chases are fun, and the story lines about Buzz speaking Spanish are distracting escapist genius. However, all that and the final visually stunning conflict are not required to connect the dots to the point of the story which resonates with everyone. The point seems that as much as Andy loved Woody, Buzz, and company, they loved him back, too. Life continues on, always changing and evolving, and so does love. Unkrich seamlessly threads this in the beginning as Andy's Mom (solid Laurie Metcalf) is really heartbroken that Andy is all grown up, and starting a new stage in life, as well as herself. She raised Andy to be a good man, and she will always love him. And still there is a sense of loss in this. Unkrich and Lassiter suggest that much the same can be said of Woody and Buzz. You need not fret over their legacy, as well. Andy says of Woody, ""He'll never give up on you ever. He'll be there for you, no matter what."" That is also what a loving parent does. <br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" is the state of art in animation. And like all great Pixar movies ""Toy Story 3"" resonates with great heart and moves us. Whatever, narrative glitches and lively distractions occur in Act 2, Unkrich and Lassiter circle back and touchingly complete this life story. Life continues on-- we will always love those dear to us, and that too may be unrecognizable. That's just life."
"honorhorror","10","1","1","16 August 2010"," Identity Crisis: Toy Story 3.
","What if somebody come up and tell you, ""hey, I need to tell you that all your life up to today is just a series of unhealthy obsessions""? For me, that might just be the case, which gave me a perfect reason to see Toy Story 3, a masterpiece of identity crisis.<br/><br/>In Toy Story, Buzz Light-year needed to cope with the fact that he was made to pretend to be a space ranger to entertain kids, though he personally believed he's really a space ranger. In Toy Story 2, Woody and his new friends needed to decide whether to stay with Andy though they fully realized what would happen when Andy's done with them. Toy Story 3 has a strong premise that this day actually came. It's even worse that Andy's mom pushed Andy to make a tough final decision about his beloved toys. Andy struggled, and decides to take only Woody to the university as a monument for all his toys and childhood times. He packed the rest of toys in a bag and decided to put them aside in the attic, yet the reality took another road right into the most menacing adventure the toys ever faced. Not knowing which toy will meet his/her demise in this last episode in a trilogy, we laughed, and we sobbed through the movie. And will they make it home? I will let you to find out in theater if you haven't seen the movie yet. Spoilers alert.<br/><br/>Granted that Pixar has this magic to make a bunch of CGI plastics talk and act so lively that, we feel they are more alive than our daily lives. Granted also is the suspension of disbelief, when you can actually hug and play with these characters in human sizes in Disneyland. It should be cool to shake hands with Woody, telling him ""you are one of the sheriffs I admired"". Disney has made these dreams come true over the years when kids cried upon the send-off of their beloved cartoon hero/heroine. However, after Toy Story 3, you should be clam that your kids learn to accept what was coming so peacefully. That's how intrinsically satisfying Toy Story 3 was. I don't have kids yet, but I pretty much grew up with this series (Toy Story was released when I was 9). Believe me that I am grateful to see such a grand, deep send-off, so heartfelt.<br/><br/>Though experienced movie-goers probably can recognize Losto as the villain within the first looks, I still think about his causes. I want to know how he actually felt. I'd like to know if put into his shoes would I do any better? See, Losto was abandoned so casually by the family he was in, that after quite a heck of journey through the wildness he only found out he's ""replaced"" by an identical bear. Suppose toys really have hearts and feelings, this agonizing pain would be unbearable. Though I doubt the same situation would ever happen to me (which was described in ""The Sixth Day""), I definitely can see the trend that the definition of a ""good man"" is rapidly collapsing into good worker, good husband, etc. And even the definition of a ""good worker"" is collapsing into efficiency, accuracy, etc. In 10 years, the measure of a ""good man"" will never be the same again. The point is, mass-manufacturing of desirable skills and traits had seen their successes, yet something important about human is lost in translation. The toys, in any era, are disposable. Today with mass-production, toys are naturally considered highly substitutable. Toys' lives only last until that particular owner is done with them. If that's the way this world works, then toys are only pitiful shadows of another flawed species, us.<br/><br/>In my opinion, that's why we'd better believe we have souls rather than just a series of complex chemical reactions in brains (according to Watson and Crick). Otherwise, we are just more complicated toys with better mechanics, which function until the day of breaking. And, that's the way Lotso looks at his kind. What Lotso has inside him instead of a ""soul"", as I see, is an angry ""ghost"", or something different, unspeakable to Woody and his friends. That's probably why the joker toy described Lotso as a ""monster"". In fact, by believing he and his kind is nothing more than mechanic trash, one like Lotso can really become so. C.S. Lewis once said in his book ""The Problem of Pain"" that souls exist in relationships, like we only get a grasp of an animal's soul when we are its human masters. For toys, you'd believe toys have souls because they have a heartfelt relationship with Andy. For us however, everyone needs a relationship with his or her creator, who made sure in the beginning of this world, that we are not disposable mechanics, but living humans in the image of him.<br/><br/>In the end, yes, we may face our demises in many ways, be it in furnace or in soil, on sickbeds or streets. Yes, we may not find every sentimental value, every romantic relationship everlasting. But beyond all the present ugliness and darkness there is a purpose made for us. A great man once said, ""To truly love a person is to look on him/her in the way God has ever wanted."" Beyond Andy's needs of toys, beyond Molly's needs of toys, beyond Lotso's hierarchy of toys, beyond Stinky Pete's version of hygiene eternal lifein a gallery, and even beyond mom's eagerness to see her boy growing up, Andy made this deliver once and for all, thus delivered our beloved toys out of their seemingly destined ways of getting loved and dumped again. They won't last forever, but they won't lose faith in each other again. We won't live forever either, but are we ready to look on ourselves in God's way? You know, right now, he is smiling at you from somewhere."
"horlicksng","8","1","1","15 August 2010"," Think twice before you throw away your old toys.
","My Score: 8.3/10 Toy story, what a big name for the kids who grew up in the 80s and 90s. Indeed I haven't watched Toy Story 1 and 2 previously, but I had a little book of Toy Story 1 in which my mom bought me when I was small (and the book was in Chinese!). The 3D technology at that time was such a break through for animation story telling on a public wide screen.<br/><br/>So back to this movie, now our little Andy has grown up after all those years and ready to go to college. It was time for him to decide how to deal with his toys: to keep them, donate them or throw them all away? After some incidents, Andy's toys were accidentally donated to a Daycare center called Sunnyside and welcomed by a deceptive hugging bear ""Lotso"" and his companions. The story went on with the toys' adventure to go back to their master before he departed for college.<br/><br/>Personally this movie is brilliantly produced, with a simple plot but many funny and touching moments. Toy Story 1 was launched on the theaters in 1995, after 15 years the once kids have already become mature grown-ups. We have grown up along with Andy, and this created much sentimentals as we watch the movie. What have we done over the past 15 years? Pixar might have given us a little reminder on that.<br/><br/>Also after watching the movie, you may want to reconsider throwing away your old toys! Highly recommended movie."
"LbFilmFanatic","10","1","1","13 August 2010"," The movie to convey Pixar's timing and greatness is in ""Toy Story 3""!
","Reminiscently, this movie banks a lot of that for me, personally, as I grew up with the first set of Toy Story movies. But to see it again at the age I am now was just fantastic.<br/><br/>Pixar just knows how to make their movies golden, in terms of legacy. Toy story, however justifies this. The movie takes place with Andy going to college. It's sad to see this happening, but yes, that's the story line it's based on. So the toys are going to be obsolete and unused for all of eternity (so they think). When Andy places Woody in his bag preparing for college, he leaves his other toys (Jessie, Rex, Hamm, Buzz and all the other toys), but places them near the attic so they can be put up there.<br/><br/>The way everything clashes together is really tense. How Andy's mum mistakes the toys for garbage, then throws them away. But everything's blown out of proportion when Woody tries to save them, then they get taken to Daycare, that the toys prepare for intentionally as they think that they are better of at least being used, than being garbage (but that has a twist that they never realized).<br/><br/>It's said that Lot'so Bear was a prototype for Pixar that the company were building up for, especially for this movie. Well he's brilliant! And everything works so well. Especially what secrets hides behind the Daycare as well as kids! It's hilarious also with the Spanish Buzz, Ken (Michael Keaton) getting mocked as a Girl's play doll accessory! Amazing stuff. I loved the nostalgic factor more than anything. The story, the voice cast, the laughs, the new toys... And admittedly this movie is very sad. Everything works so well, and for that it deserves 10/10!"
"weronews","10","1","1","8 August 2010"," The Toy-est Story Ever Told
","The third and final installment opens with a bang and never lets go. Brilliant doesn't even begin to describe the emotional treasure trove that is ""Toy Story 3."" When he's off to college, intending to take Sheriff Woody with him, Andy wants to move the other toys to the attic but they eventually land at a children's daycare center where trouble awaits. What follows is a rousing, hilarious, heartwarming tale of friendship, reliability, and the fact that childhood - like it or not - will always be an intrinsic part of our being. Newly introduced characters blend seamlessly with the cuddly bunch we've come to know so well for the last fifteen years. Told with panache and a light hand for side gags that will please kids and grown-ups alike, especially - but not necessarily - in 3D. The wizards at Pixar did it again, bringing their most beloved film series to a gratifying conclusion with no loose ends and a finale that will leave you reaching for your handkerchiefs."
"freemantle_uk","10","1","1","8 August 2010"," A fitting end to a perfect trilogy
","Pixar do not normally make sequels, with Toy Story being the only film that has had a sequel. Originally Disney very nearly made a direct-to-video sequel to Toy Story 2 after a bitter battle Pixar but luckily got to make it (reluctantly). They have now made one of the best film trilogies ever.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is now set 10 years after the events of Toy Story 2: Andy (John Morris) is now 17, about to go to university and obviously not interested in playing with his toys anymore. Most of his toys are gone: only Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Bulleye the horse, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Slink (Blake Clark), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and Hamm (John Ratzenberger) remind. After a misunderstand Andy's toys, along with Molly's Barbie (Jodi Benson) are donated to Sunnyside Daycare and meet a group of toys, including Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear, AKA Lotso (Ned Beatty) and Ken (Michael Keaton). At first it seems that Sunnyside is a paradise but it quickly turns out that there are really a prison, with Lotso as the dictator. The toys have to escape and get back to Andy, but it is going to be difficult, with Lotso running a police state.<br/><br/>Pixar have a simple philosophy, story comes first. It sounds so basic but it can easily be lost in most studios only thinking about what's marketable. But Pixar have shown time and again that people are willing pay for quality. With Toy Story 3 it is a film with characters we already know and love, a simple drive, getting back to Andy. There is a brilliant script, with a simple story and setting, with the theme of what do your toys get up to when you are not around, toys running the risk of being abandonment and the idea of growing up and putting childish things behind them. We get to see all the characters as they despair over their situation and trying to escape from Sunnyside. It is a story about moving on as well, the wonders of childhood and we get to see move of Andy who is now a man. We get to see the imagination of a child, from what Andy would have show, to physical actions of Bonnie (Emily Hahn), a shy child with a big imagination. With a simple story the writers are able to fit a lot in.<br/><br/>Because it's a family film there is a lot of physical humour, such as Buster the dog now being old, fat and lazy and not wanting to help Woody. But there are clever verbal jokes as well, like when Barbie arguing political theory and philosophy. Spanish Buzz is also a great comic creation. Because the characters and the story is so engaging that they do not need to rely on referencing after film scenes and any film references are much more subtle. Plus Ken is a great creation for Toy Story.<br/><br/>Lee Unkrich directs a fast paced film, focusing on the characters and the story. There is action, drama, comedy and even a little horror, with the threat of big baby. Everything about this film was well handled and shows all the strengths of Pixar. Unkrich also shows that no toys is truly evil and that some event normally drives them to it. It also fun that established actors were like Timothy Dalton and Whoopi Goldberg were willing to voice very minor roles.<br/><br/>The ending was fitting for the series and emotional for the characters and the audience. It is a perfect end and there is no way a sequel can be made without the series repeating itself. A perfect family film."

"MartianOctocretr5","10","1","1","5 August 2010"," Clever, innovative, touching, sweet; a triumph on every level
","Marvelous on every level; Toy Story 3 exemplifies the true spirit of movie making. Just a joy to watch, and a pleasant gem to think and talk about afterword. The Toy Story franchise is arguably the best at maintaining its freshness. Same concept, story arc, and characters, but each chapter has its own personality and theme.<br/><br/>This film's sentiment reminded me of a piece of poetry I read as a child I've never forgotten; it spoke of the plight of some abandoned toys in a child's bedroom. With heart-wrenching warmth, it described each toy's faithful and longing vigil as they all awaited the return of the child who had once made their lives so joyful, but who had ""one day, disappeared."" Had the child died? In a way; the child was gone forever, having made that inevitable passage to adulthood. In the same way, Andy, no longer the little boy who once took Buzz and Woody on wild fantasy adventures, is moving on to his adult life (college).<br/><br/>There is a very healthy mixture of all the elements that have made the Toy Story characters so endearing. The topical humor is still top-notch caliber, but they also capture your heart this time with heart felt sentimentality. They show a deep caring for one another that is not only refreshing to see, but believably and sweetly presented. More than once, characters stick their necks out to help one another. Big Baby was a wonderful addition to the group; anybody who doesn't feel anything during Baby's cries of anguish needs to get a heart transplant.<br/><br/>It's a spectacular collaboration of vivid artwork, exquisite visuals, ingenious plot development, penetrating emotion, and excellent voice talent. Fine movies always have memorable moments, and this film has plenty: The back-stories are tenderly told. The toxic dump sequence is an astounding grand finale of emotion, action, and suspense. The scene featuring Andy and Bonnie is inspired. The final image is deeply moving. This film not only lives up to the lofty standards the franchise has already established for itself, it even exceeds them. The best art is that which paints an image of the human condition with truth and beauty. Toy Story is all that and more.<br/><br/>Recommended for anyone. This is the kind of movie that you stay in the theater after it's over for a few moments, hoping for more."
"hazel-752-685975","10","1","1","31 July 2010"," Good as the first 2 films and better!
","This film has everything! It has the comedy (of nearly anything in the film), it has the thriller of the escape, it has the villain's back story, it's got the romance between Buzz and Jessie, it's got a brilliant general plot, I could go on forever. I particularly loved Spanish Buzz. It lived up to my expectations fantastically and made the other 2 films seem almost pathetic in comparison. I looked the previous 2 films up on here and both the ratings were gradually going up by 1, the first was 7 the second was 8 and this is a 9. My only query is to why it was done in 3D, half the time I barely noticed being so distracted by everything else going on in it."
"the-showman","9","1","1","31 July 2010"," Funny, compassionate, heart-warming... and dark.
","This was, bluntly speaking, brilliant. Most definitely better than the first, and certainly on par with the second – Toy Story 3 has it all: it's heart-warming, funny, iconic and actually somewhat scary in some places.<br/><br/>It got off to a slow start, but it was necessary exposition – Andy being all grown-up and ready to move to college, and the toys being accidentally donated by Andy's mom to the Sunnyside Day Care Centre. Even when the Day Care Centre Toys introduced themselves and Ken showed them round, I was left sitting in the cinema thinking ""But where can the film go from here? It can't just be Woody arguing with the others about going back to Andy to live in the loft for eternity.""<br/><br/>Then, as playtime was drawing near, and all the toys hid and cowered in fear, that was when I knew that the film was beginning. But that was a good half hour in. The slow start is, in my opinion, the only thing that lets the film down.<br/><br/>That said, what followed was fantastic, and... incredibly dark. Yikes, Pixar! A Day Care Centre run as a prison, ""run by an evil bear that smelt of strawberries""? The climax where the toys face their impending doom? The baby with the dodgy eye? And the monkey... that monkey! It made three kids cry in the cinema I watched it at. That monkey's shrieks were the scariest sounds I've ever heard in a Pixar film. No wonder it's classified as a PG!<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend Toy Story 3 to anyone and everyone though. While it's certainly a darker tale compared to the other two, it also has incredibly heart-warming moments, and the comedy is the best of the three (I'd like to say now though that Ham and Slinky were under-used). Overall: Excellent!<br/><br/>P.S: Beware that monkey. It's shrieks emit from the darkest depths of Hell."

","I grew up with the TOY STORY series, and I've always been looking forward to this one, ever since 1999. I've always has such a great fondness for the characters, and I'm happy to say that this is no exception. As soon as the movie started, all of my childhood memories came flooding back to me. My fondness of the series never really disappeared, but I do admit that I haven't really revisited the first two movies that much. I've been looking forward to the third installment for ages, but it was only until recently that my true love for the series returned, which was due mainly to anticipation. I'm sure that during TOY STORY 3, the smile never really left my face. It was so magical to see these characters back on the big screen again. As I was watching, all I could think about was how much I've missed these characters over the past 11 years. I feel so connected to this series, which was why I was fighting back tears on several occasions. I'm so glad I didn't cry, because I wouldn't have stopped. I'm proud of myself for keeping it together. <br/><br/>The TOY STORY series has been there ever since I was 5 years old, and I've grown up with it. This film has seriously tugged at my heart strings. I found myself filling up at both sorrow, and happiness. I can't actually describe how brilliant the feeling was during watching this. To put is plainly, this film is absolutely beautiful. I adored everything about it. <br/><br/>No word of a lie, this film is a perfect ending to one of the best trilogies of all time. I'm in two minds about the idea of a sequel. I would love to see the characters again, but on the other hand, the ending fits perfectly. I think it's best to leave it there. I'm just full of praise for this, it's near perfect. <br/><br/>I only have one minor gripe about TOY STORY 3, and it's really minor. I wish Timothy Dalton was used more. That's it. The rest of the film is fantastic. I'm so happy that Pixar haven't messed this up. They've delivered a truly beautiful film."

","I went to see this film yesterday and I couldn't get over just how fantastic it was. Pixer has once again managed to out do itself. It's well written, there are many laughs in it. The two moments that spring to mind for me are Woody calling the dog in at the start and the fighting monkey who is the security camera watcher at the day care.<br/><br/>But the scene that is most touching as I am sure most of you will all agree with, is at the end when Andy gives the Toys away. They thought that Andy didn't want them but he actually did. Time just passed and he took other interests as we all do. But what made it extra touching was the fact that he played with them one last time before going off to start a new chapter in his life. This also was the start for a new life for the toys who found new life and a new friend in Bonnie and her Toys.<br/><br/>This draws to a close a trilogy that has lasted for 15 years and is in my opinion possibly one of the best trilogies. It also shows the quality of Disney Pixar who manage to keep making touching astonishing film after film.<br/><br/>Anyone who has not seen it yet should make it their business to go and see it. 10/10"

"gameking53","10","1","1","27 July 2010"," Toy Story 3 Review
","Toy Story 3 is a 2010 CGI animated film and the third installment to the Toy Story trilogy. It is the first film in the series since the excellent Toy Story 2 in 1999, and stars Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack and Ned Beatty and features voice talents from other notable actors like Michael Keaton and Timothy Dalton. The film was released on 18th June 2010 in America and 19th July 2010 in the UK. It grossed over $700 million only a month after release.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Woody, Buzz Lightyear and all of the toys belonging to Andy. Now a 17 year old student ready to leave for college, Andy packs up his old toys and donates them to Sunnyside Day Care Centre. Initially happy with the idea, the toys soon realize that the day care is a brutal place for toys and is treated as a prison by Lotso Huggin Bear, the films antagonist. The toys make it their mission to flee from the day care and return to Andy before he departs for college.<br/><br/>The film, like all Pixar films, boasts beautiful animation, with vibrant colours, great detailed landscapes and fluid, professional character animation. It really is a beautiful film, and although it's not as mind blowing as the original, it still shows how far Pixar have come in terms of their animation quality. The film is viewable in Disney Digital 3D, and sadly it's a waste of money. The trailer for the film said ""the film 3D was made for"". This is flat out false. The 3D doesn't add to the experience in any way, and instead the film just has more depth. The 3D is not used in any exciting way and it wastes your money. However, whether you watch the film in 2D or 3D, you still get an incredible animated piece of cinema.<br/><br/>There is no way that this is a cheap way to cash in on the popularity of this awesome franchise. Unlike Shrek Forever After, Toy Story 3 is a work of art. The effort put into the movie by the writers, voice actors and the animators is clearly shown. The story is full of many moments of sadness that actually feel like true emotion, and it makes you forget that you're weeping at a piece of plastic and stuffing. Truly, the film does not use endless amounts of comedy to entertain viewers. It tells a well structured, fluid story. However, it still has the Pixar comedy charm, and there are many moments where you'll be laughing with everyone else in the cinema. The films ending had many in tears, and I have to say I was deeply touched by it. But, I can't give it away...<br/><br/>The voice acting was amazing. The actors did a good job at sounding comedic and emotional, and the new voice for Slinky Dog (Blake Clark) sounds so much like Jim Varney that you'll find it hard to believe he's a different actor. Timothy Dalton was a bit underused, but his lines were very funny and utterly eccentric. Ned Beatty was my favourite of the whole cast. His voice for Lotso sounded wise and evil, and he gave Lotso an insane personality which was incredibly convincing. Lotso is the best villain of the three films, and probably my favourite Toy Story character.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is a rare movie. A second sequel that doesn't feel lazy, rushed or a cheap cash in on the franchise. Instead, it's a deeply moving, entertaining and very professional piece of animation, and will have many fans of the original two movies in tears of sadness and joy. It completes the fantastic story of the trilogy, and builds a whole moral of love and how leaving our childhoods behind can hurt. I think this is where the series should end, as more sequels would feel like spin offs as the main story is complete. <br/><br/>A masterpiece in almost every way, Toy Story 3 is easily the best Pixar film to date. I recommend this incredible film to anyone of any age, as it will have you laughing, crying and admiring the talents of the creators. Just be sure to save money and watch it in 2D. Nevertheless, see this excellent movie.<br/><br/>I give this film a 10/10!"
"MarcusJ13","10","1","1","27 July 2010"," Just as good, no brilliant as the predecessors.
","After seeing all the hype and good press about this film I thought this was going to be brilliant as Toy Story is what Pixar have done best in my view. In Toy Story 2 we got a very ominous piece of dialogue about how Andy is growing up and there is nothing Woody can do about it. I loved that they went with this approach with the next film as they could have just played it safe and have Andy as an excitable child again for the third act but it all comes full circle and we finally see Andy as young man going off for pastures new leaving his childhood behind. Without meaning to sound too deep and meaningful this is something we can all relate to as we've all had that feeling of having to leave our most precious of memories behind. As an 18 year old I can relate to it now. <br/><br/>This was an ambitious but fantastic way to round off a story that has been brilliant from start to finish. Andy is conflicted when thinking what to do with his childhood toys and a mix up makes the toys go out to the trash. After avoiding that doom they find themselves in daycare all the while Woody remains loyal to Andy as he tries to think of a way to get back to his owner and join him at college. The toys eventually find out it isn't as good as they would have liked. A theme that we saw in the first film but felt just as fresh right here and now. Again just like the other two films it is brilliantly written with many references in this case especially to prison escape films and many more to mention. We also have new characters to which the highlight is Barbie's love interest Ken to the credit of the makers made some fantastic jokes both subtle and in your face about the character. We see plenty from all the characters involved and it never escalated into farce which is something that the Toy Story films have always managed to avoid. The story also goes in a darker direction as we get some slightly more sinister characters playing the villains in this film which again is a testament to how well it is written and we also get some very emotional scenes, I won't give anymore away but if you have any emotion you'll be gripped by it! The film also avoids dragging too long and I found myself wanting more even though it gave me everything I could possibly want from the film. This is the first review in which I have given a 10 and I am completely justified as it is the most fun actual fun not just enjoyment I have gotten out of a film in a long time. Plus it gives a great sense of nostalgia and will make you want to see the other two films again."
"Jakemcclake","8","1","1","23 July 2010"," High Intensity - But Still a Good Movie
","Possible Spoilers This movie follows much in the formula that Pixar laid out in the Toy Story 2. If you saw that movie, you've seen much of this movie. That said, Toy Story 3 was more intense, which will appeal to some of the audience, but not to all. It has a more pronounced set of bad guys, than any other Toy Stories and some might feel they were not good for the target audience, but they served to make the movie more intense. It presents some of the same themes that were introduced in the prior Toy Stories, but the movie also answers a nagging question that has come up throughout all of these Toy Story movies - What happens when Andy (The Toys' owner) grows up? All in All it was a good movie experience."
"neil-476","10","1","1","22 July 2010"," Excellent, but not entirely for children
","Let me start by saying that, as expected, Toy Story 3 is a wonderful film. In the company of the characters we have come to know and love over the previous two movies, together with some new ones, we embark on one last adventure which is full of thrills, excitement, humour, scary bits, and tearful emotion before arriving at a moment which brings the Toy Story films to an entirely appropriate conclusion. The story is predicated on the problem of what to do with Andy's toys now that he is going to college, and the plot involves the complications which ensue when most, but not all, of the toys are donated to a daycare centre - the central section is effectively an extended prison break caper.<br/><br/>Having said that, and having had a few hours to let things settle down in my mind, I find myself thinking that Toy Story 3 isn't a children's film at all, although it will undoubtedly be greatly enjoyed by children. The themes are, as always, entirely adult - the importance of family, ageing, the inevitability of separation, letting go and so on - but Pixar (and Disney historically) have never felt it necessary to shie away from adult themes in kids' films, so that isn't really a factor in my speculation.<br/><br/>There are two things which make me say that Toy Story 3 is predominantly an adult film.<br/><br/>One, it is much - much! - darker in tone than the previous films. Sid was a disadvantaged kid given to mistreating toys with no conception of the consequences of his actions, and the Collector meant toys no harm. But in TS3 we have, for the only time in the Toy Story films, a character who makes a deliberate choice to act in a way which is entirely evil. We also have the characters facing their deaths in a way that even young children can understand. Adult themes are one thing, the reality of an unpleasant death is something entirely different.<br/><br/>And, two, while the movie works as a standalone movie, it acquires a richness when watched as the third part of a trilogy by an audience which has aged at the same rate as the characters in the film, and this is perhaps reflected best by the fact that the entire story rests on Andy standing on the threshold of adulthood - issues of maturity have replaced simple childhood playing, and this is understood by an audience which identifies with where Andy now finds himself. This is the same sort of thing which Jo Rowling has gone for in the Harry Potter books.<br/><br/>None of this in any way diminishes what a fine film this is, though - if anything, it enhances it, and shows once more how effectively Pixar make movies which work on multiple levels.<br/><br/>While I'm at it, a quick word of praise for the accompanying short Night And Day, an astonishingly clever work of visual imagination."
"mv_310","10","1","1","21 July 2010"," And yet another masterpiece for Pixar!
","I cannot give Toy Story 3 any rating below 10 - amazing! It is not often these days when I leave the theater touched and eager to see a film again, an animated film no less. However, Woody and the gang delivered yet again.<br/><br/>Although a film suitable for the tots, I was completely enthralled. The plot was suspenseful and exciting to the very end, especially the climax where even my teenage brother got teared up. Not to mention, the comedy had great timing, and some comedic moments, while obviously appropriate for young children, could be taken as having a more adult sentiment without going too far - the film did a fantastic job at reaching all audiences.<br/><br/>As this film rounds out the Toy Story trilogy, it definitely offers a few glimpses into the past, while simultaneously giving a fresh, new spin on the storyline.<br/><br/>A must-see!"
"studioAT","10","1","1","21 July 2010"," One final playtime
","Toy Story 3 proves that the third film of a series does not have to be the weakest and that it can sometimes even be the strongest. Toy Story 3 is just as magical as the first two offerings and the quality of the animation is second to none. Dreamworks and Blue Sky should take notes from Pixar because they are the true masters of animation.<br/><br/>All your favourite characters are back for one final adventure and we really do feel for them as they try to make it back to the owner who loves them. From Tom Hanks and Tim Allen right down to Jodi Benson the voice cast is strong and the script is filled with the same heart and humour that made the first two films in the series so loved. <br/><br/>The final scene is the perfect way to end the film and the series. Although it is sad it is also hopeful because like the toys we know that by growing up bigger adventures lie ahead.<br/><br/>Overall Toy Story 3 is a fantastic film filled with magic moments, strong characters and visuals that only Pixar can produce."
"daryl42-1","9","1","1","20 July 2010"," Although not as groundbreaking as the original, it is still worth watching due to its excellent characters.
","9.1<br/><br/>The original Toy Story was a special release for many reasons. First of all, it was the first full length CGI film. Secondly, it was the first Disney movie to break the mold. In fact, it wasn't even a Disney movie, but it sure had the production values and the overall quality of one. The original Toy Story came together really well, and when you look back, it's easy to see its place in animated film history. 14 years later, Pixar is releasing Toy Story 3, making the series a trilogy. Was this needed? Or was this just a check that needs to be cashed?<br/><br/>The answer I think, is both. 11 years is a long time to wait for another Toy Story sequel, the second one having been released in 1999. Still, I feel that this movie was released just to make another Toy Story movie. To date, Pixar has no other sequels. Sure, Toy Story is what made them famous, and it has a special place in their and our hearts, but did we really need another one?<br/><br/>Thankfully, Toy Story 3 is actually really good. Of course, you didn't expect it to be bad, but being the third entry in the series one might have been suspecting a weaker film. The nostalgia is handled well, with the plot being that Andy is now growing up and on his way to college. Most of the people who saw the first movie in theaters are now either on their way to college or in college. A lot of the people who will see Toy Story 3 are the ones who saw the first one back when it was released.<br/><br/>Once again, the characters (although already established) and voice acting, or digital acting, is excellent in Toy Story 3. Easily the strength of the movie, the characters drive the movie home. There is basically no other reason to watch the movie. The plot itself isn't that great, and some of the new characters aren't that great either. The bear, while a good character, is just a nuisance on-screen. Ken is a welcome addition and both him and Barbie take up a lot of screen time, but he isn't exactly original. The other toys are completely forgettable. The only one that is a pleasure to watch is the monkey.<br/><br/>Still, Pixar's crisp humor is still intact. One of the pillars of the first film, the animation and visual quality, is not exactly this film's strongest suit. It's great, but it isn't as impressive as most other Pixar films were at the time of their release. The 3D effect is not necessary, but it was the most comfortable 3D experience I've had yet. Visually, just like Up!, it seems that Pixar has decided to put every single basic and bright color on the screen at once. Like if we were in a candy shop. Uh...<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 was made for the fans. And by fans I mean, those of us who saw the original when it came out, and are now college age. Once again, it's a tight production with excellent (despite old) characters and great voice acting. The plot isn't great, and honestly the movie itself isn't as good as everyone else says. Once the nostalgia is over, you may be able to see it for what it truly is. Still, it's worth revisiting and definitely one of the better animated films of recent time."
"TheUnseenMovieLover","10","1","1","20 July 2010"," An Incredible Conclusion to A Classic Trilogy
","Fifteen years ago, Toy Story was released. It was an instant classic, brimming with wit, warmth, humour and genuine emotions. Toy Story 2 was even better, upping the ante on thrills and laughs whilst telling a beautiful story. I've grown up with these movies, and I love them now as much as I did the first time I saw them.<br/><br/>I have been waiting for Toy Story 3 for the past ten years. I'm ecstatically pleased to say that this is not only on the same level as its predecessors, it is the best of the trilogy. It is also my favourite Pixar film to date, taking the known and loved Pixar hallmarks and taking them up another notch. I could not be more satisfied with this conclusion to what is, after Lord of the Rings, the best trilogy ever made. High praise, but these movies more than deserve it.<br/><br/>Ten years after the events of Toy Story 3, Andy (voice of John Morris) has grown up and is going off to college. The toys we know and love, Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), Buzz (voice of Tim Allen), Jessie (voice of Joan Cusack), Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (voices of Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Hamm (voice of John Ratzenberger), Rex (voice of Wallace Shawn), Slinky (voiced by Blake Clark, replacing the late Jim Varney), Bullseye and the aliens, are all contemplating their fates. Will they go to the attic, daycare or the garbage? Andy means to put them in the attic, but through a series of circumstances, the toys end up at Sunnyside daycare, lorded over by an apparently kindly strawberry-scented bear called Lotso (voice of Ned Beatty). The toys think that they've struck gold, but their joy turns to horror when they realise that they've been assigned to the Caterpillar room, a room full of youngsters who equal a wrecking ball for the toys. Realising that life in the attic would be better than remaining at the daycare centre, the toys launch an escape plan. However, Lotso and the other toys at the daycare aren't going to make it easy.<br/><br/>Like Toy Story 2, this is very much a story about the end of childhood. However, Toy Story 2 only contemplated the end of Andy's childhood and the repercussions this could have for the toys. Here, D-Day has finally arrived, and the anguish felt by the toys is palpable. The final 30 minutes, in particular, exhibit that message beautifully. There are two scenes at the end of the movie which show how the trilogy has built in maturity and emotional power. The first scene is easily the scariest of the trilogy, but it also delivers a thunderous emotional punch through our love for the characters and the love they have for each other. This scene questions the mortality of the main characters, and brings the survival of the characters into question. It is, without a doubt, the best scene in the trilogy, and it is one of the most hellish, chilling yet poignant moments that I have ever seen in a movie. The second scene is just as powerful, a truly beautiful send-off for the characters and a powerful reminder of how, even though we may not know it, these characters have a strong place in our hearts.<br/><br/>The vocal acting, as in the other two entries, is top-notch. Hanks, Allen, Cusack, Rickles, Harris, Shawn, Ratzenberger, Morris and Laurie Metcalf (as Andy's mother) all return, and do exceptional work. It's been years, but they return to the roles like it was only yesterday. I had a similar experience; even though it's been years since I sat in a cinema and was utterly transported by Toy Story 2, it feels like only yesterday. The immediacy of Toy Story 3 is one of the movie's quintessential strengths; there is a sense of nostalgia, but even those younger members of the audience can quickly jump into the story and be swept away by the magic of it all. The new vocal talent is also brilliant. Ned Beatty is stunning as Lotso, friendly one minute and menacing the next. The sepia-coloured flashback detailing Lotso's sinister transformation is one of the movie's highlights. Michael Keaton is hilarious as Ken, who immediately hits it off with Barbie (voice of Jodi Benson, The Little Mermaid), who he's never met and vice versa. A musical montage set to ""Le Freak"" as Ken tries on different clothes is a comedic blast. Blake Clark, Timothy Dalton, Jeff Garlin, Kristin Schaal, Bonnie Hunt and Whoopi Goldberg are all strong, Dalton a particular delight as Mr. Pricklepants, a British thespian hedgehog in lederhosen.<br/><br/>As expected, the animation is gorgeous. Each frame is jam-packed with detail, to the point where you will want to see it again just to see what visuals you missed out the first time. I went to watch Toy Story 3 in 2D, and the animation was still some of the best I have ever seen. As I haven't seen the 3D version, I can't say if the 3D detracts from the movie. However, if you're strapped for cash, the 2D presentation is delectable.<br/><br/>If I described Toy Story 3 in one word, I'd say; perfection. The wonderful vocal work, the gorgeous animation, the compelling screenplay (written by Little Miss Sunshine's Michael Arndt), the assured direction of Lee Unkrich (taking over from John Lasseter, who helmed Toy Story and Toy Story 2) and the transcendent score by Randy Newman; all are flawless. Toy Story 3, whilst delivering the familiar pleasures of the first two movies, takes the characters in new, exciting directions, and finds the perfect conclusion for their journey. By the time the credits roll, you'll have cried (both from sadness and from laughter), you'll have been on the edge of your seat and you'll have had a smile on your face the whole way through. What is this condition? Sheer cinematic joy."
"98nurdinm-1","8","1","1","20 July 2010"," ""Toy Story 3""
","The problem with three-quals, in particular the more recent three-quals, is that they usually run out of steam halfway through Part 2. One can also understand how an audience could grow to be ever so slightly cynical, that studios make these films for the sake of big bucks alone.<br/><br/>That has never been a criticism one can throw at Pixar. Throughout their history they have kept on redefining what it is to be a truly fantastic movie for every single person, save for one or two slight hiccoughs along the way (""Cars"" in particular). The fact that they were able to not only pull off a worthy sequel to ""Toy Story"" back in 2000 but to also make it an infinitely more superior film to its predecessor, in a way already fills you with confidence that they know what they're doing. This isn't going to be one of the Shrek films. This is going to have a message and, more importantly, a heart.<br/><br/>Though the beginning is perhaps slightly hampered by a rather lacklustre pre-film short, you're very quickly thrown back into the world of Woody, Buzz and co as if it were only yesterday. A fantastic voyage into the imagination of young Andy develops into a sweet little montage, the familiar strains of Randy Newman's ""You've Got A Friend In Me"" backing it. But then the music fades away, and so does the warmth. We're thrown into the present day - for the toys, it's a time of uncertainty and loneliness, stuffed away in a toy chest in the teenage Andy's room, anxious about their future with his impending journey to college.<br/><br/>This is truly where the film sweeps the rug from under your feet. It proves to be a somewhat different film than anyone really expects. There are some immensely dark moments peppered throughout, be they provided by the sense of loss and fear of being forgotten or the rather scary baby doll who patrols the floors of the Day Care Centre that the toys mistakenly end up in. A word of warning here; this is NOT a film for the very young. If the baby doesn't freak you out, the security cymbal-playing monkey almost certainly will.<br/><br/>The script is excellent, and the darkness is broken up by moments of great light and laugh-out-loud humour, most of which is provided by the hilarious John Ratzenberger as Hamm. Two other stand out parts include a jailbreak where Mr Potato Head (Don Rickles) becomes an altogether different vegetable, and a reset button on Buzz that gives director Lee Unkrich the chance to make this film probably the first animated film to ever have subtitles.<br/><br/>New characters that are introduced don't feel crowded, the handy plot device of Andy's growing up meaning several familiar faces don't appear in this movie. Barbie finally gets her Ken (a very funny Michael Keaton), and the main antagonist, a purple bear who is wonderfully played by Ned Beatty, helps to add to the film's sense of melancholy. Despite these new characters, and the fact that technology has moved on a lot in ten years, our old toys still look and sound the same, and kudos to Tom Hanks and Tim Allen for taking the film as seriously as any other dramatic part, the only way it could possibly work.<br/><br/>The final third of the film is full of twists and turns, and several moments that had me choking up and blubbering like a baby. You don't feel cheated at all - you really get a sense that this is the last part of a fantastic three-qual. One certainly hopes so, though one cannot help but be a little nervous as to what the Disney executives could do in Direct-To-DVD mode when all they see is big dollar signs. This is the best ending anyone could ever give the toys. They are redeemed and, in a way, reborn.<br/><br/>Strange short aside, and even though it's perhaps not a patch on Number 2 (nor on ""Wall-E"" or ""Up""), this is certainly a brilliant film, and is guaranteed to win at least one Oscar next year.<br/><br/>8/10"
"extreme_salomon01","10","1","1","20 July 2010"," Truly AMAZING!! End of an era and done in style!!
","The wait is over, and after 10 years of wait Toy Story 3 has finally come out. This movie was somewhat special to me as even at the age of 20, I have grown up with Woody, Buzz and the gang and was just as, if not even more excited for this installment.<br/><br/>Being an avid movie lover, I have seen plenty of films over the past 20 years. Having an older brother helped with all the classics we have seen to this day, but Toy Story was one that was brought out for my generation. Out of the hundreds, maybe even thousand of movies I have seen, the Toy Story series would be right up there in my top 5 and didn't want this one to let the series down. This was NO way a let down as I never thought it would but is the best of the 3.<br/><br/>From start to finish, this movie will keep you entertained and instantly a must watch again as the way I rate a 'good' movie is one you can watch over and over without getting bored.<br/><br/>As I watched one of the later showings at the cinema, my thought was that 'it will be OK, I'm sure many people will not be excited,' and boy I was wrong. The screen was packed full of adults and the queue was the longest I have seen at the cinema for a long time.<br/><br/>One big thing I have to say is that this is NOT just a kids movie. From watching previous Toy Stories you think that you are a little bit too old for the gags, but this was not true as this screen, packed out by people mainly 18+ was as loud as any. In this film there were plenty of 'laugh out loud' moments, bringing in plenty of old gags into new and slipping them in tremendously, bringing you back to when we were younger when we were pointing and laughing whilst watching the first two in the cinemas.<br/><br/>This movie does not get stale in any part and keeps you at the edge of your seat with like the first two 'a great escape' feel to it which will keep you at the edge of your seat regardless of your age. Like any other, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and the crew, even though only voicing it, still know how to make the movie as good as it is and paired with there characters you can just feel the relationship between the two doing a great job behind the scenes.<br/><br/>Not only will this movie leave you excited or screaming with laughter but you have to remember that this is an ending to the Toy Story series and never have I left a movie so close to tears and I am not scared to admit it.<br/><br/>Like any pixar the story just sticks together and no matter how weird or wacky the story is, it works like a charm. How do you get a bunch of toys that come alive whenever they want, being mistakenly taken away or lost, to fight there way back home to there owner..............3 times and make each one an instant classic. The people at pixar are plain and simple geniuses who add something that no other movies do. There is not one bad pixar film out there and it shows who's the leader of the pack as Toy Story was the first sequel pixar had done, they had to do another one.<br/><br/>To the sad part, not many films have excitement, laughter and tears all in one movie, but Toy Story plays with your emotions more than any. The most heart breaking thing is that this is an end of an era, even though John Lasseter and Lee Unkrich have announced they would like to keep the characters alive (whether its a fourth or just putting them in for cameos) the importance of these characters are shown in the director, producer and writers reactions and how they do not want to forget any of the bright and funfilled toys. This was a great way to end this film series and wow they have executed it brilliantly. I truly believe this is a tear jerker so I think you should bring some tissues, as Toy Story is going out with a complete BANG!! This movie brings childhood to back to you and makes you remember when you were younger and how you use to be. This is a MUST SEE by single person out there as you will NOT be disappointed. I have not left a cinema with a massive smile on my face in a long time and this was the film to do it.<br/><br/>This is truly and end of an era and am sad to see Toy story come to an end, but what a way to go out."

I enjoyed Toy Story 1 & 2, but none grips your emotion quite like this, I am a 26 year old Male and I cried like a baby at the end and so did my friend. Whilst been a continuation its very different TO 1 & 2. This film is very emotional with an amazingly written script and with very well thought out characters.

"anirudhjaura","9","1","1","19 July 2010"," Toy Story 3 delivers...to infinity & beyond!!!
","This signature line from Buzz Lightyear, alone is enough to bring a smile and perhaps a nostalgic flash of the preceding two installments of this heartwarming saga but Toy Story 3 delivers a lot more than just that. From the first frame itself, the movie sets into sublime motion with one scene simply flowing into the other. The audience gets introduced to all the old familiar faces - the Potato Heads, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy bank, the aliens, Slinky the dog, Jesse and of course, Woody and Buzz Lightyear. Andy's all grown up now and headed to college and the Toys are left guessing as to their fate now that Andy won't be interested in playing with them anymore. Woody, always the loyal one, tries his best to convince them that Andy won't discard them, but the others don't believe him. What follows is another typical 'Toy Story' adventure with the toys experiencing the supposed thrills and chills of being toys to kids in a Day Care, imprisoned in what they believed to be their new wonderland and Woody, as always, is there to save the day. Toy Story 3 also brings to the fore a host of new characters including Barbie, Ken, Lotso and Big Baby to name a few.<br/><br/>On the downside, the 3D of the movie..well let's just say it isn't there. After the magic that Avatar has created, the benchmark is probably set so high now that one wonders if any other movie would even come close to creating that level of realism. To expect that from an animation movie, no less, would be harsh but the sad truth is Toy Story 3 doesn't even attempt to impress in that department. One may as well watch the movie in 2D because the true magic of the movie is in the story and characters rather than the effects. Another disappointing factor was the dearth of humor in the movie..though, a couple of scenes do make you chuckle and smile.<br/><br/>However, what really warms your heart towards Toy Story 3 is not the beginning, the action but really, the end. Knowing that Andy is now, indeed, too grown up to play with his old toys the movie ends on the best possible note, leaving perhaps a touch of sadness that this marks the end of a one-of-a-kind saga<br/><br/>For those who are still trying to make up their mind, I'd say if you found anything good about the previous two installments don't bother your heads on this one - just go watch it. If you loved toys when you were younger, I bet this movie will remind you of your favorite ones, the good times you had with them and possibly a touch of regret if they aren't in the best of shape any longer.<br/><br/>So go ahead, remember the good ol' days and bid farewell to one of the few trilogies that have lived up to the expectation...and beyond"
"filmbantha","9","1","1","19 July 2010"," Pixar never fail to amaze
","When it comes to kids films I'm usually the last in line but the prospect of a new Toy Story was a chance I couldn't miss, Pixar have mastered the difficult task of creating films that entertain all generations, and I had been eagerly anticipating a third film since the credits rolled on Toy Story 2 back in 1999. The first one hit the big screens when i was just eight years old and I have grown up with Andy, watching his toys run amok every time he closed his bedroom door, and becoming completely absorbed in the crazy situations they have encountered.<br/><br/>We join Woody and Co. a few days before Andy packs up his belongings and heads off to college, misplacing his toys who end up donated to a children's daycentre instead of being packed away in the attic. It is down to Woody to convince the toys they haven't been abandoned and return them safely back home whilst avoiding crazy children, tyrannical toys and terrifying trash compactors along the way.<br/><br/>Whilst the story remains fairly similar to the previous films, the introduction of a wealth of new characters (along with everyone's old favourites) adds to the enjoyment with comic characters such as an eccentric hedgehog, Mr Pricklepants, and the introduction of a hilarious romance between Barbie and Ken fleshing out the storyline with a healthy dose of humour. The eagle-eyed amongst you may even spot a character from one of Miyazakis movies appearing in a young girls bedroom, a subtle nod to one of the greatest animators of all time.<br/><br/>One of the highlights of the film arrives after the credits have rolled with an alternative rendition of a memorable song from the first Toy Story, making it essential to stay in your seat right until the lights come up. It is also imperative that you arrive on time, as is usual with Pixar films you are treated to a short animation before the main feature and 'Night and Day' is definitely up there with the best of them, giving the audience a taster of the sheer brilliance they are about to behold.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is an emotional ride; much like in Pixars recent releases Up and Wall-E, it is surprising how affecting a cartoon can be, with a number of poignant moments that will overwhelm even the most cynical of viewers. Even though the human characters only have minor roles in the story, the few lines they do have will resound deeply with everyone, and the mixture of characters at different points in their lives means that there will be a part of the story that relates directly to you on a personal level. It's not just about throwing out the old toys anymore, its about the process of growing up and those that have followed the story from its first incarnation will be saddened by the reminder that their own childhood has passed.<br/><br/>Captivating from start to finish, Toy Story 3 is a triumphant reminder of Pixar's ability to blow all your expectations out of the water and in doing so they have delivered what could possibly be considered their greatest film to date. Essential viewing for everyone, Toy Story 3 is an unmissable extravaganza that is almost guaranteed a best picture nomination at next year's Oscars ceremony. Book your tickets right now, you would be a fool to pass up the chance to catch the final part of the trilogy in its full cinematic glory."

I like their movies because they have some dramatic and touching moments mixed with humor . After really great movies from franchise this one was again complicated and what is more important it is following formula of previous successes . All toys are here and some new which really completed good story . Woody and Buzz are again leaders of great entertainment . 3D is really great invention for animated movies because it is making better experience . It attracted watchers . I think this movie entertaining masterpiece and real example of great cartoons ."

","In this day and age in the world of film, more often than not, sequels and trilogies end in massive disappointment, and sad efforts to stretch the profit of the preceding ""hit"" movies they once were. But, this movie IS the exception to that time. This movie, undoubtedly to its viewers, stands the test of time for possibly the greatest animation movie, not to mention trilogy, of all time.<br/><br/>With the profit and well execution of the the original Toy Story, which in itself deserves monumental note, and the well added Toy Story 2, the third and final chapter of this beloved story was inevitable. The question arose, as it always does, ""will this movie be as good as the rest?"" or ""will this ruin the other two?"" But the answer to those questions were answered with the exact opposite of their expectations. This movie made them BETTER. After two screenings (one in 3D and 2D), and the reviewing of the rest, I stood a movie lover of all genres, giving respects to Disney and Pixar in gaining my respect as one of the best executed film franchises, ever. For so many reasons.<br/><br/>People who see these movies and who consider the ""greats"" of all time to be the groundbreaking classic films such as ""Shawshank Redemption"", the Godfather series, Apocalypse Now,and so on, movies with built in audiences or movies that just break the norm of the films at that time. But when breaking down the classic movie goals, hitting all ages and audiences, providing multi-genre platforms, and in the end the heart and love and meaning that all films should posses, this movie conquered them all. Movies that take the approach of the tear-jerking, emotional endings to add purpose to the movies message, are in no way deserve disrespect or demeaning; many films execute this well. Toy Story 3 executed it with perfection. Sense I do not believe in spoilers and wont go into deep detail, this movies approach to that concept was one that once again, ALL can relate to, all can be moved by, and isn't that what movies are all about? Taking you on a journey to find something or some meaning in life's impossibly foreseen antics? And at the same time, enjoy it, laugh with it, and take it as it is. Woody and the gang will do that for you, as they have time and time again. If there is one thing that I urge with the purpose of this review, is for those who fade away from such seemingly child based movies for there supposed childly audience and performance, to ""reach for the sky!"" to step down from that position. Open your mind and heart to the love and world of imagination and the world of love that this movie has considerably. For anyone who has ever had to leave something they love behind, for anyone who had to grow up when they didn't want to, for anyone who has ever had to fight for something they loved and believed in, and for anyone who needs happiness to shine once again; you need to enjoy this historic and without a doubt one of my favorite films and trilogies of all time- Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>And remember-<br/><br/>No matter where you go in life, you'll always have your best friend."
"Thunderbuck","9","1","1","16 July 2010"," An evening with old friends...
","Toy Story 3 will go down in history as being one of the (very) rare sequels that genuinely builds on the story of its original.<br/><br/>The original Toy Story is an iconic movie, the way The Wizard of Oz was in the thirties. It took a medium that few of us had much faith in, and proved it could be used to tell a fun, involving story.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 wound up taking an interesting turn, becoming a kind of contemplation on the difference between being loved and being revered. Fortunately, the characters stayed true, and the sense of fun remained.<br/><br/>While TS3 extends that sense of fun (particularly with new characters like the Ken doll), there is a mournful quality to it that adults will recognize as a sense of mortality. As the movie starts, the toys make an ingenious but ultimately pathetic bid for their owner's attention; they know they are being left behind and possibly discarded. The story is really driven by the toys' efforts to come to terms with that change.<br/><br/>It is, at times, fun, inventive, and even thrilling. It says something about the relationship we've had with these characters that when they face certain peril at the climax of the story, their simple response is surprisingly moving.<br/><br/>It's that relationship that makes this such a great sequel. Since the original Toy Story was released in 1995, CGI animation has become an important segment of the industry, and the source of some of my favourite films of the past 15 years. I left the theatre thinking about how far the medium has come in that time, and that this movie felt like an evening with old friends.<br/><br/>While Disney/Pixar hasn't declared this to be the ""last"" of the series, the story arc closes so gracefully that you'd hate to see it embellished simply for the sake of box-office receipts."

"chaaa","9","1","1","12 July 2010"," An emotional roller-coaster
","There's something about the Toy Story franchise that is universally emotive. Presumably that ""something"" is the fact that everyone had toys as a child. Toys taught us how to love. Not loving someone because they are related to us, or because they live on our street and happen to be our age, but because we feel a connection to them. Now, as grown-ups, we all know that toys are only toys and our love is wasted on them. I suppose that's what is so haunting about these films. They remind us all of that part of ourselves that left us many years ago, and dredge up guilty feelings about old Rebecca the Christmas Bear who now sits, dusty in the attic somewhere...if she's lucky. Toy Story 3 deals with just that idea. It is about what happens to the toys when Andy grows up. The film begins with the toys in a typically epic adventure. It is complex, it involves teamwork and it could be dangerous. As it turns out, the toys are plotting a very complicated ploy to get Andy to play with them. He is 19 now, and headed off to college. The toys have been sitting in their chest for years now, without being played with at all. When a chain of events see the toys accidentally donated to a day-care facility, the race is on for the toys to be reunited with their owner before he leaves for college. If the first film was sci-fi, the second was a western then this is a prison movie. Their ""great escape"" is just as exciting and fresh as the previous two outings and certainly just as hilarious. However, what makes this film special is that it balances heartbreak and loss with warm-hearted sentiment so it never feels depressing, but certainly has a sense of tragedy looming throughout. We know there can be no happy ending and that whatever comes our way in the third act will make us sad, but the journey there is so joyous that the tone never gets too blue. Writing about Toy Story 3 is difficult because it is not about the little bits of clever writing and brilliantly realised characters or perfectly balance sense of humour. This film is so much more than the sum of its parts. It accomplishes what so few children's films can. It gives equal pleasure to children and grown-ups. It manages to entertain but also make the audience feel truly invested in the fate of these characters...these toys! No easy task! This is perfect popcorn viewing for all the family and I dare you to sit through this film without at least a small lump in your throat. If this film doesn't make your heart simultaneously jump for joy and burst with emotion, you're made of stone!"

"southerlandmar","8","1","1","7 July 2010"," Toy Story 3: Finally, the Third Time's a Charm
","Pixar has never failed to deliver a worthwhile movie-going experience. Everything Pixar has done is better than anything Dreamworks has done, and that includes Shrek, because Pixar movies have story, and heart, and a respect for the audience. All this said, I was afraid to see Toy Story 3, because it is a sequel to a sequel, something Hollywood has never done well. Take the Godfather saga—Godfathers 1 and 2 are the iconic American story; Godfather 3 is mess made long after the others and starring the director's daughter. Or take the blatant case of ""I have no ideas left, but can still make some money""—Back to the Future 3. Like Godfather 2, Back to the Future 2 worked hard to explain the cause and effect behind the original. In Back to the Future 3, they had Michael J. Fox for a couple extra months, so they put a cowboy hat on him and waited for the money to roll in. To their great credit, Pixar has created a Toy Story 3 that is true to the original, but that has its own story, one that expands on the earlier films with a new message of not living in the past. I knew Pixar had not failed when the opening scene—a spectacular action sequence reminiscent of Back to the Future 3—was quickly left behind and supplanted with a real human story."
"KrazzyDJ","8","1","1","4 July 2010"," It's time we bowed down to Pixar and stopped slamming their films as Children's flicks
","Pixar, it seems, have seriously become a force to reckon with. It all started with Toy Story in 1995 and since then, they've consecutively delivered masterpieces after another as if to virtually remove all doubt that Toy Story was a fluke (and no, it wasn't one). The next in line is Toy Story 3 which, quite easily, joins the ranks of Pixar's finest movies (though I'm now struggling to recollect which one wasn't).<br/><br/>In Toy Story 3, we see that Andy is about to move to college. He has to pack up his toys in the attic, donate them, or trash them (that's the choices he has). While he decides to go to the first option, the toys, through a series of misadventures land up in Sunnyside - a place where they'll have plenty of kids to play with them. But all is not as well as it seems since the kids are far from what Andy was when he played with the toys - they thrash them, mercilessly pound them and mess the toys up - enough to make the toys decide to go home.<br/><br/>The best thing about Pixar movies (despite the fact that they're animated movies) has been the characters - something which other movie makers need to learn. Although Toy Story 3 excels in almost every department, the characters are never lost in the background. We still care about the likes of Woody, Buzz and Jessie which is surprising considering that we know they're just pieces of toys. And the voice acting is just incredible. I thought Tom Hanks would have lost his form after all these years and was wondering whether, despite aging 10 years, he'd be able to voice Woody with the same enthusiasm he did back in the previous two Toy Story movies. However, he does a brilliant job at it and so does the rest of the voice cast. It'll make you feel as if the voice recording for the movie was done 10 years ago.<br/><br/>Technically, the film features CGI which is amazingly impressive. There are times when you simply forget that this is an animation movie you're watching. In fact, just like in WALL·E, the only times the CGI looks CGI is when humans show up (which is perfectly understandable given that it's incredibly difficult to make human CGI). Watch the opening sequence to get what I say, it alone is enough to convince anyone of the visual superiority of this movie. Cinematography and Editing are also flawless, the movie never slows down and it feels that there's something constantly happening in the movie. Humor is again good - especially the scene in which Buzz turns into Spanish mode. Hilarious !!<br/><br/>Just like it's predecessors, the most amazing feat of Toy Story 3 according to me is how it makes you emotional and sad towards it's end. It's a perfect example of directorial triumph. And this happens at a time when the characters in the movie just exchange glances at each other, they don't even speak much in that portion of the movie. It's strange to realize you'd become sad by just looking at toys without they saying anything. Without revealing anything all I can say is that the first thing you're likely to do after watching this movie is go home and check out your old toys. You're surely going to miss them - at least I did.<br/><br/>My only gripes with the movie - I'd have loved to see more of Rex, Hamm and Slinky Dog. Rex's lack of confidence is something which came across as wonderfully in the first two movies. That is something that I missed. Also, the humor is less stronger as compared to the first two movies and so are the dialogues. Those are my thoughts. These tiny nitpicks shouldn't deter anyone from watching this movie. And yes, the 3D was simply pointless. I actually wanted to watch the movie in 2D but couldn't since all major movie screens are showing it in 3D. That made it clear that the 3D was more for the purposes of generating revenue than for anything else.<br/><br/>And yes, it's time we accepted that these movies are NOT movies for Kids. They can be enjoyed equally by Adults as well - in fact more so. It's high time people stopped slamming these movies as movies for the kids and skipped them. If you're one of them, you're missing out on something really important here - something you'll regret 10 years from now for sure. Watch this Pixar !!!<br/><br/>Score: 8.5 / 10"
"ptodegaard","8","1","1","28 June 2010"," A movie about toys that can truly offer something meaningful to everyone.
","First and foremost Toy Story 3 is about toys, as deftly explained in the title. However, Pixar has managed to create a movie that can offer humor and emotion, and I mean honest and heartfelt emotion and witty humor, to a person of any age.<br/><br/>In Toy Story 3 toys are used as metaphors for loss and inevitability, but also redemption, and of course, being toys, for humor. Andy, our half-protagonist, has grown up and is leaving for college. Andy's childhood toys are becoming more uncertain of the future, and what will happen to them after Andy is gone.<br/><br/>Something that has always bugged me about Pixar movies is that the main problem that is overcome is always created by an accident that leaves mistaken assumptions within the main characters who then act to return to the way things were on those assumptions. I'm happy that Toy Story 3 has managed to have that same occurrence without it being the motivation behind the whole story.<br/><br/>The evil villain is a teddy bear suffering from rejection. The evil in Toy Story 3 is the result of a toy's loss and rejection by replacement. Without being preachy Toy Story 3 shows that most evil isn't because a person, or toy, is evil at heart, it's because someone is suffering from rejection or loss, and that suffering has led to darker and more hateful actions.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is one of the not so rare but rarely wonderful movies that attempts to pull off being both comical and serious, with neither one overshadowing the other. Toy Story 3 pulls this of fantastically. Humor is there, and it's always funny without being cheesy and without being one-sided, which is something I've always admired about Pixar's films. The humor is humorous for people of all ages without loss to one age demographic or another.<br/><br/>I have to mention the way Pixar crafted the unique personality of each and every toy. There aren't any stereotypes here, and if there are they were meant to be stereotypical. Each toy that speaks is a deep and complex character, and that character is suited to how the toy is apparent in real life. Ken and Barbie are hilarious, the villain's Henchmen aren't just evil figures but have personalities, and the villainous teddy bear himself isn't just straight evil for the purpose of having a villain. All the characters seem like real thinking people, real thinking toys.<br/><br/>In the end, Toy Story 3 manages to be entertaining, heartfelt, deep, and hilarious, all from a story about kids toys. However Pixar does what it does, it's done very, very well."

","After an eleven-year absence, those lovable toys return for more in this latest sequel from Pixar. Woody, Buzz, et al have their greatest fears realized when their beloved owner Andy—now grown-up—prepares to depart for college. Facing new obstacles and adversaries after being taken to a day-care center, it's a race against time for the toys as they try desperately to escape and keep their tight-knit group together. Considering the length of time it took for the project to come together some rust was bound to show, but as always there are a talented cast of voices, remarkable animation, genuine humor, and some truly poignant moments. Slow at first but only gets better as it goes along, building up to an emotional and heartwarming finale. Not quite as compelling as its predecessors but still very entertaining, though not surprisingly the three-dimensional effects don't add much to the proceedings. ***"
"Troy_Campbell","8","1","1","26 June 2010"," A delightful tale that touches children and adults alike.
","It would be easy to say that once again Pixar has proved they are the best at what they do and other animation companies pale in comparison, because, well frankly, it's true. There's an unfussiness in how they make their movies, an effortlessness that allows the story to drive the visuals and not the other way around. Toy Story 3 is no exception. At its heart is a delightful tale that touches children and adults alike, utilising humour, drama and action to take us on an emotional, but by no means heavy-handed, roller-coaster ride that started way back in 1995.<br/><br/>Whereas a lot of family flicks can be simply defined into the broader genres – comedy, adventure, etc – this trilogy closer isn't such a neat fit; it'll have you laughing, crying, scared, adrenaline-pumped and all without feeling uneven or unnatural. Pixar's expert balance between gags for the kids – the Spanish Buzz is downright hilarious – and knowing winks to the adults – the Cool Hand Luke homage is superb – is once again a highlight whilst the opening scene is a wonderfully clever one. A minor blip: the penultimate finale is a touch too frightening, the consequences are more malevolent than the rocket-blasting in Story 1 and the airplane-escaping in Story 2 earning an unwanted atmosphere of dread.<br/><br/>These characters have affected audiences like so few can achieve. They've endeared themselves to us at such a high level that even in 2010, when the youngest fans of the first Story would be at least 20 y.o. today, there's still an enthusiasm and excitement to see old friends that is rarely encountered in the cinematic world. To the screenwriters' and filmmaker's credit, they don't just rely on the iconicity of Woody and Buzz to hold the picture together, instead taking the bold route of introducing new players – Lots-o-Hugs Bear, Barbie's Ken, Mr Pricklepants to name but a few – and not featuring previous characters such as Mr Wheezy, Zurg, Bo Peep and Etch-a-Sketch. The mix-up of focus and priority – Woody and Buzz share their majority portion of screen time with Lotso, Barbie arguably features more prominently than Jessie the Cowgirl – keeps the audience guessing whilst adding another level of freshness to the franchise.<br/><br/>Not quite as flawless as the first film, this convivial instalment is still a must-see thanks to its winning screenplay, pin-sharp 3D animation and a tremendous voice cast that drive their highly-watchable characters.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","I love animation and get a kick out of the vast amount of difference between the films. And I enjoyed myself at Toy Story 3 but I felt it was one of the weakest of the trilogy mainly for how much it relied on Pixar's past success. It begins with now a seemingly new Pixar staple. A quick intro and then a ""heart-felt"" montage ala Up. I am not arguing that it wasn't touching but rather that it started me feeling like I have seen this movie before. This happened again numerous times throughout the movie. Most notably when Buzz is set to ""Demo mode"". I like Ham sighed because they yet again went to the same barrel as BOTH the other Toy Stories. That being said it was a great movie with some good laughs (though a lot more targeted at adults only then I am used to in a Pixar movie)and some touching scenes. The tone of the movie is much darker than the first two, probably with the realization that the series original target audience is now much older. The movie is definitely worth seeing but I am not clamoring out to go see it again. Great movie but not a instant classic masterpiece in my opinion."

This movie is way too sappy. It tries to pull your emotional strings. It is very obvious. Why don't they just tell the story without trying so hard to win the audience over. It goes out of its way to try to make you cry and piles it on thick. There's too much of everything in this one. Too many plots, too many gimmicks and too much loud sound. I hope this is the end of the Toy Story saga, because they are going downhill. The first two were winners. 5/10"
"eternities22","6","4","9","9 April 2015"," A huge disappointment - a very overrated movie
","The first Toy Story left me totally delighted, and Toy Story 2 is, in my opinion, the greatest film possible, so flawless that nothing can be done to improve it. And that is why Toy Story 3 is, for me, such a huge disappointment. I cannot understand how so many people can praise this movie to such extreme levels. To me, this movie gets a very large number of things wrong, to the point where I can't even watch it anymore. I've tried to let it grow on me, but each viewing only makes me hate it even more.<br/><br/>First of all, let's look at the positives. The animation is great, the voice acting works fine, a couple of early scenes are fun and enjoyable, Lotso's a rather good villain, and the other main characters are also witty in short bursts. However, this is all faint praise, and none of it makes up for the movie's many immense failings. The bad aspects of the movie, unfortunately, are so glaring that they are simply unforgivable. The film's most prominent flaw is this: it's way too dark for its own good. Whereas the first two Toy Story films were able to balance the dark and the light satisfactorily, Toy Story 3 is a depressing, maddening, constantly gloomy bore. <br/><br/>Instead of being a varied and joyful movie, Toy Story 3 frequently shoves ugly and often painful images - such as destructive, screaming toddlers, a very creepy baby doll, a depressed clown doll and an extremely obnoxious, sociopathic cymbal-banging monkey toy - right into your face. The movie seems to have just two colour schemes - saccharine rainbow colours during the daytime scenes and cold, shadowy blues and blacks during night-time ones. As you watch the film, you too fill trapped in Sunnyside, the film's tedious and ugly central location which I wanted to leave almost as soon as its inner hellishness is revealed. It's a prison escape movie with toys, and it just doesn't work in my book. And when it tries to not be a prison escape movie, it comes across as dishonest and inconsistent.<br/><br/>Indeed, the movie frequently tries - and fails - to lighten up the proceedings with a few sporadic jokes. However, almost every joke in this movie hits a brick wall. Watching the toys get battered by Sunnyside's manic toddlers was not like a circus of slapstick comedy, but an excruciating experience that resembles an uncomfortable mixture of child abuse and sexual fetishes. Any wisecracks from the toys as they discuss what they can do to escape feel half-baked and completely out-of-place. Even ""Spanish Buzz"", one of the funnier aspects of the movie, does very little to make the movie any more charming. The film also suffers from disconcerting jumps in tone; one minute, we are at Bonnie's house where the film is sickly-sweet and syrupy, the next, we're once again drowned in Sunnyside's morose atmosphere and have to look at more scenes of toys being treated like prison inmates.<br/><br/>And when the movie isn't overwhelming the audience with images like these, it recycles previous Toy Story quotes and themes ad nauseum. Hearing a few lines from the first two movies is amusing it first, but it starts to come off as condescending and frivolous, inserted into the movie merely to remind the audience that they are indeed watching a Toy Story movie. And as for the themes in Toy Story 3? They were already explored 100% better in Toy Story 1 and of course the solid-gold opus Toy Story 2. For example, I found Lotso's miserable back-story far less affecting than Jessie's enchantingly poignant one. Toy Story 1 and 2 were constantly intriguing and involving and had plenty of lessons to teach without whacking you over the head with them. Toy Story 3 reuses these lessons and shoves them down your throat like a strict old schoolteacher setting her class an excessive amount of homework. The many side-characters, such as Lotso's goons and Bonnie's toys, are also totally forgettable, with little personality or interesting lines; it's very hard to care about any of them. There's just so little to take away from this movie. It's so overly pretentious and self-serious that it comes off as impassive and reluctant to take the audience on an actual adventure.<br/><br/>And just when the film can't get any more shamelessly pompous, we get treated to a spectacularly overblown climax, one which many fans adore, but I personally detest. It's a scene where the toys are nearly melted in an incinerator, but the film milks it for all it is worth despite the fact that it's utterly self-evident that they are going to survive their supposed doom. It's a repulsively manipulative scene that tests the audience's connection to these characters. And yes, the scene shortly afterwards where the toys are given to Bonnie? I'll admit it's kind of sweet and nice. But it's also cheesy and, much like the incinerator scene, only put in the movie to manipulate the emotions of nostalgic adults who miss their childhood toys and regret throwing or giving them away.<br/><br/>I'm sorry guys, but I just cannot enjoy this movie. It's dark, hideous, icy, limited in its goals, constantly pretentious and just not fun. It's a dull, slow-paced movie about toys trapped and tortured in a dystopian daycare centre. Toy Story 1 and 2 were imbued with copious amounts of joy, wit, intelligence, humour, charm, innovation, messages and memorable scenes. Toy Story 3 makes a few weak attempts at being like its predecessors, and at least in my opinion, doesn't get at all close to being even half as good as them. Toy Story 3 may be considered a masterpiece to some, but to me, it's a largely heartless, lazy, slipshod product with hardly anything captivating, inventive or original in it."

","So I just got back from the 'advanced' screening of Toy Story 3 in China. Somehow we managed to show it 2 days before the 'Official' release. Anyways, I've waited 11 years for this moment, and its finally here. And I have to say, Toy Story 3 surprised me. In a good way. I never knew that an animation movie can consist such emotions, and still be child friendly. I would have to say, Toy Story 3 is way more mature than the first two movies, so little kids won't understand the more mature feeling Toy Story 3 provides. However, this movie still has the old Toy Story atmosphere, the personalities of the different toys. This movie is actually amazingly funny, too, my friends and I were bursting into laughter at Ken's letter. So for all you people out there, this is not the movie you would want to miss. In fact, watch this movie 2 - 3 times, because I know I'm going to do that."

He decides to leave some of his toys like Buzz Lightyear (Voiced by Tim Allen), and Jessie (Joan Cusack), in the attic where they'll be safe, and take Woody (Voiced by Tom Hanks) to college with him. However, the toys to be placed in the attic are mistaken for trash, and placed on the curb. Feeling betrayed and unwanted, the toys, along with Woody trying to convince the toys it was all a mistake, all climb into a box to be donated to Sunny Side day care. They meet up with the head toy Lotso-Huggin Bear (Voiced by Ned Beatty), who sets them up in the ""caterpillar"" room for toddlers. Woody breaks out to find Andy, but gets picked up by the daughter of a woman who works there, while the rest of the toys decide to stay. But, things get a little out of hand, and Woody must travel back to help the other toys break out.<br/><br/>Now, the film isn't EXACTLY the same kind of feel as the first two. The film is directed by Lee Unkrich, taking over the helm from John Lasseter. Unkrich though, keeps the story going at a wonderful pace, and the film still features the same fantastic type of humor, action, and emotional heart to it. Be sure to bring plenty of Kleenexes for the third act.<br/><br/>The voiceovers, as always, are brilliant. Hanks, Allen, Cusack, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Estelle Harris, and John Ratzenberger are all fantastic in their returning roles. And there are also fantastic newcomers such as Michael Keaton, Timothy Dalton, Kristen Schaal, and Jeff Garlin, as well as others. I also want to give major kudos to Ned Beatty for his standout performance.<br/><br/>The animation as always, FANTASTIC. It's absolutely gorgeous work, helped out by marvelous sound design from Tom Myers of Up, and Cars. The 3-D though, not that marvelous. I think I definitely could have lived without it. But, it doesn't hinder the movie whatsoever.<br/><br/>It's a charming, hilarious, emotional, and satisfyingly worthy conclusion to a trilogy that quite literally has only gotten better with each new installment.<br/><br/>All of these reasons are why I simply CAN'T give the movie anything less than an enthusiastic, **** out of ****"
"nintendohero-1","10","3","6","21 June 2010"," Have never cried so hard.
","I'm a 16 year old boy, I'm not a crier at all. I'm not saying that to sound tough, it's just something I never did a lot. I grew up on Toy Story and Toy Story 2 and both where and still are amazing movies that are very loved by me. <br/><br/>I went in saw this one by myself with medium expectations... Mainly because the trailers really didn't get me too excited. Everyone has been talking about how they cried at certain scenes.. I knew I wasn't going to cry.... Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>I have never actually have had the full relief feeling of crying until I saw this movie. Not only did it deliver the nostalgia feeling that I miss so much, but it also was just an amazing movie with a great story and such great scenes.<br/><br/>The humor had me laughing so much, I felt like I was 6 years old again. The characters where just as they should have been. I loved every minute of them. The new characters where awesome too, especially Ken. He made me laugh so much sometimes. <br/><br/>So through most of the movie I was laughing. Then towards the end, there is one very intense scene where I was on the edge of my seat the entire time worrying and was afraid i might bust into tears. So, once the scene was over, I sat back to watch the ending of the movie.. Thinking, well at least I didn't cry. <br/><br/>Then came the last scene..<br/><br/>I lost it. I put my hand over my mouth and began to cry. Tears of Joy/Happiness. Then as the scene was almost over, I busted into a waterfall. I didn't care what anyone thought, I was about to fall on my knees and cry. <br/><br/>I think it was just the nostalgia over flow and the love that is shown in the scene. It was just such an emotional roller coaster for me.<br/><br/>The voice acting is fantastic. The story is great, it fits so perfectly with the other Toy Story movies. It's just a lot more tear jerking. I don't care how old you are, how tough you think you are, you will at least shed one tear.<br/><br/>This is a MUST see. <br/><br/>10/10."

Not just a silly way to spend about two hours of your life like all the other movies but something you won't never forget, something you'll bring with you until being buried. Because are characters like Buzz and Woody who make our lives special. When I'll think of my early life I won't remember stupid things that boys of my own age often do, I won't remember any idiot girlfriend, I won't remember how difficult school could be, but I'll remember the trilogy that made me dream, the trilogy in which I found my real friends.<br/><br/>I think it would be idiot talking about this movie homing in on graphic or plot and so on. Because Toy Story has stopped to be just a movie for me eleven years ago. Then it's like if I'm talking about a friend or even something more. Just a few words to express my thoughts: One of the best things I've ever seen in my whole life. Here is the magic of life. Here life can be surprising. The magic which makes adults become children again. Disney Pixar showed us how magic life can be. I'm proud of acting like a child even if I'm already 19. But who cares...I prefer being a 12 years-old-minded boy rather than being an adult if this is the price to pay.<br/><br/>It's the perfect moment to release this movie for me because this is my last year of high school and next year I'll go to university. Toy Story 3 is for me the metaphor of abandoning all my childish world, that actually I won't never abandon because my heart won't never be able to say g'bye to what changed my life forever.<br/><br/>The movie's perfect in all its aspects, starting from graphics and arriving to screenplay and direction.

"moviewizguy","10","3","6","19 June 2010"," No toy gets left behind.
","Toy Story 3 is a comical new adventure in Disney Digital 3D that lands the toys in a room full of untamed tots who can't wait to get their sticky little fingers on these ""new"" toys. It's pandemonium as they try to stay together, ensuring ""no toy gets left behind."" Meanwhile, Barbie comes face to plastic face with Ken (yes, that Ken). (Disney, Pixar)<br/><br/>The third movie curse. Time and time again have shown us that the third film of every trilogy is always the weakest of the bunch, and it's usually true. However, since this is PIXAR we're talking about, TOY STORY 3 is a huge exception (emphasis on the word ""huge""). In fact, I'll go further and say that TOY STORY 3 is the best in the trilogy, by far. Unlike most PIXAR films, the first two Toy Story films never try to be profound. They have always been about it's lovable, plastic, toy characters portraying true, human emotions and that's what makes them so brilliant to begin with!<br/><br/>TOY STORY 3 is no different. We see our beloved characters return to the silver screen again for their last adventure, and it's a big one. The story also carries more weight. Like SHREK FOREVER AFTER, there's a lot at stake compared to the previous films, so much so that the characters' lives are at risk, which is appropriate, considering this is the last film and all. Although the darkest of the bunch (you'd be surprised how much PIXAR could squeeze into this G-rated flick), the film manages to perfectly blend the dark moments with light-hearted moments. In fact, TOY STORY 3 is hilarious, filled with witty jokes and perfect comedic timing from the toys! The toys!<br/><br/>The story is well written, thanks to Michael Arndt, who also wrote the script for LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. It's different from the previous PIXAR films in a way that there is a lot of suspense and excitement going on. In fact, there's a sequence in the third act that had me on the edge of my seats and crying at the same time! How that sequence alone could pass the MPAA's G-rated standards is beyond my knowledge. The film also gets its try at the horror genre, and I have to admit, they are legitimately scary.<br/><br/>As said before, most of our characters return, although some, most notably Bo Peep, are not to be seen, which is kinda depressing for me. However, we get to meet some new characters along the way, my favorite being Ken, Barbie's love interest. He's such a fantastic, colorful character and he provides most of the film's funniest jokes. I also liked Trixie, the new dinosaur, although she was underused in the film. Oh, and I loved what the filmmakers did to Buzz Lightyear. I'm not going to spoil it but it's very funny.<br/><br/>What brings this film on a level far greater than the first two films is the theme of being able to let go, which us movie goers will also have to go through when watching the film and because of this, it reaches a deeper emotional depth than ever before. I guarantee that you will cry in this film and if you don't, you might as well be a robot. The animation is also substantially better than the previous two films' already impeccable animation, showing how far even Pixar's technology has advanced.<br/><br/>As a send off to the series, TOY STORY 3 can't be any more perfect, especially the last scene. The opening sequence alone is worth the price of admission just because it brings back the nostalgia from the two previous films. The film is filled with suspense, romance, adventure, horror, comedy, and, let's not forget, heart. While other movie studios try to release good films (yeah, right), PIXAR is the only movie studio that has gotten all 100% of their films right. See this film not because it's the last time we may see these characters. See it because it's a cinematic masterpiece, an end of a golden era. It's the best film of the year so far. Let's hope a TOY STORY film finally receives the Oscar it deserved fifteen years ago.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that the short that appears before this film, DAY & NIGHT, is bloody brilliant. The short is so original, so wonderful, so mind blowing that it's an obvious Oscar contender for Best Short. I'm still awestruck at how original the short is."
"voxhumana","10","3","6","18 June 2010"," Yet another masterpiece (!)
","This film is a masterpiece. Truly. It is easily the best film of the year of any genre and will definitely take it's place alongside Bambi, Snow White, Fantasia and (insert other Pixar title here) in the Pantheon of immortal animated classics.<br/><br/>TS3 is hilarious, touching, thought-provoking and relentlessly entertaining. The film is also very deep, even in comparison to the last three Pixar films (Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up). <br/><br/>Between the high and low brow gags, TS3 manages to be a profound morality study on the purpose of life, connection and disconnection, consumerism, the transition into adulthood, the wonder of imagination, and on death and renewal. As that wasn't enough, there is a brief (but profound) dissertation on the origins of political power (borrowed directly from the great philosophers of the Enlightenment), given by the most unlikely character (I'll let you find out who, but it left me howling with laughter.)<br/><br/>The comedy content is razor-sharp. Spanish Buzz is a scene-stealer and the gender-identity confused Ken is pure gold. However TS3 is certainly darker in theme and content that its predecessors and I sincerely question the G rating (If ""The Incredibles"" was PG then this certainly must be). <br/><br/>But Pixar don't issue the ratings and regardless, there are moments of such aching beauty that your heart will damn near burst. Pixar kindly provided some delightful sequences over the end credits to let grown men such as myself wipe away the tears before entering the lobby.<br/><br/>Does it have a flaw? Yes - it is at least an hour too short(!) I wanted more of the familiar characters and much, much more of the new ones, particularly Bonnie's toys. (BTW - Look out for a delightful homage to Hayao Miyazaki at Bonnie's place).<br/><br/>But ignoring my pettiness, all I can say is this is a triumph in every regard. It is easily the best of the Toy Story series (an astonishing achievement in itself) and many will declare it Pixar's finest effort to date. A clear candidate for a Best Picture nod and a strong contender for the screenplay Oscar."

","Going back to 1999, i was 9 years old. when the prospector spoke of toy story 3, i was chomping at the bit waiting for it to come out. it finally arrived tonight. I was psyched like a little girl to see this movie.<br/><br/>The producers aimed it at my generation, because i'm 20 now and people at my age grew up with the original toy story. but the producers were also trying to aim the movie at children (it is a children's movie, after all) but trying to aim at 2 different age groups is tough.<br/><br/>The years have gone by and Andy is now 17 years old and on his way to college. The years have also taken their toll on the toys, as many of them have gone. Bo peep, Wheezy, Andy's room is near empty of children's toys. He has 3 choices for the remaining toys; They either end up in the attic, donated, or in the trash. They end up in an orphanage after a strange chain of events, and what leads is Cliffhanger after cliffhanger, with laughs in some places along the way.<br/><br/>The Newspaper review said this movie was in one word, ""Bittersweet"" and that is true. While it is toy story and it's meant to make children laugh, there is a sob story written in that i wished wasn't there. the whole movie could've been funnier, and still include the ending with the moral of letting go. Again, the movie might be aimed at children, but the moral is really about growing up and letting go of your childhood. it's something Andy had to do, and it's something all of us older fans need to do at some point in our lives.<br/><br/>8/10"

","When Rex mistakenly sees daylight and he's corrected by Woody about what's really going on, the music takes a sinister turn. You see the expressions on the characters faces grow more worried. At that point, I heard kids in the theater yell out sympathetic worries for the gang. But the adults seemed confidently silent that they'd find their way out of things, as always.<br/><br/>When the villain of the movie invokes the popular internet meme/bible verse by yelling out ""Where is your God now!"" (God == Kid, so don't worry about cursing) and the gang is in a situation that is all but impossible for Andy or any other person to save them, it was the adults in the theater who seemed to gasp in panic... probably with thoughts like ""I don't believe Pixar has done this to me; I'll never be able to explain an ending like this to my kids."" But the beauty of the scene isn't really in how it was resolved. It was in what can be learned from it. The themes of strength in friendship, endurance through hardship, and, ultimately, the peace of acceptance when there is no other way out. Those are hard lessons to frame in any fictional setting, but the success of it in this movie was done very well.<br/><br/>The rewards for watching these lessons are great, but don't go into this movie with the youngest of children who will only remember the trauma and the challenges. If your child is mature enough to keep their attention to the end, they will be rewarded. The events in the film end on an upbeat note. Don't worry about toilet humor, sexual situations, or cuss words (very, very mild) but if you question your child's emotional maturity, you should preview it before hand.<br/><br/>Adults will love it compared to almost anything else out yet this year."

","I am a 42 year old father of 2 and have seen the last 2 TS movies(and loving them)and knew that the 3rd installment was going to be just as good. This movie exceeded my expectations, and the 3D version was amazing because Pixar didn't present it in the typical ""3D poke you in the face to lean back way,"" but in a way that made sense and was easy on the eyes. <br/><br/>All of our favorites are back, and combined with a variety of new ones who have prominent roles in the plot, make for an excellent story which makes sense if you have seen the last two movies. It's like Woody, Buzz, Rex and Potato head never left, but have been inside a locked toy box and are older(Two characters in particular) and wiser.<br/><br/>The lady at the theater ticket counter asked me if the ticket was for me...now I have gray hair and look 42, and I didn't get her point at first, but I can only surmise it's because she wasn't around for the last two and can't appreciate the brilliance of Pixar. <br/><br/>In summary,round up the kids, neighbors, and even Grandma and go watch 100 minutes of pure entertainment, with several LAUGH OUT LOUD moments.

Let me tell you this... the story was perfect, the ideas, the humor, the dramatic characters, everything about this film was spot on.

Disney somehow took this warm feeling that i have for these characters, and they made the whole movie about those feelings. I've looked away from the screen because certain movies are too scary or too violent; but this is the first movie where i looked away from the screen to stop myself from crying. No joke.

","Although there were some funny parts in this film, I was terribly disappointed. This movie was very scary for young children - and it was excessive. I can handle a scary scene here and there, but for young children to endure half an hour of perilous scenes where the toys are almost crushed, incinerated and the like is just too much. Probably the most disappointing part in the film, was the fact that Pixar has now placed the idea into the heads of millions of children, that one day a mother might choose to not love their child anymore, and perhaps never did. Thanks for that one Pixar - brilliant move.<br/><br/>It is very obvious that whoever developed the concept for this film and carried out the writing of it was not interested in how it might affect young children - their target audience. I have been quite the fan of Pixar, but have lost trust in their film-making. I am sure my son will be having nightmares. I wish we had never gone to see it, and if I had known it would be so far from the brilliant mark of the first two, I would not have."

","There are other reviews which cover specific issues around scary characters etc, so I will not repeat. What I wanted to add was that from the outset the film has an uncomfortable feeling which soon turns to being actually sinister, with adult themes played out by kids characters.<br/><br/>The short animation before the film began had my nearly-5-year-old son giggling loudly - but once the actual movie began, it wasn't long before he crawled onto my lap for comfort and after around an hour he actually asked to go home, around the time the scary monkey appeared. I understand that older kids may be able to handle more adult themes, but am at a loss to understand why we would want to subject kids to these themes, as if it was not possible to make a good movie without them.<br/><br/>The toys go through threat of being crushed and incinerated, the Sunnyside toys are run by a cartel who oppress, bully and imprison the other toys, Lotso is finally more or less depicted as being consigned to hell and in the end of it all kids are essentially left with a feeling that it would be better to give their old toys to some other kid who has plenty already rather than pass them on to a daycare centre or somewhere where underprivileged kids might benefit from them instead. Just bizarre that we would consider this good entertainment for children!"

Seems to me the writers ran out of ideas and rehashed almost the same plot (the toys need rescuing) from the previous movie, only this time involved more times riding in a garbage truck, involved a scary, crushing, fiery furnace, and and evil bear who in my opinion was a borderline racist casting (started off southern black-friendly and ended up sounding like a black thug)! and let's not forget to mention the disturbing and demented ""Big Baby"" dragging off beloved Mr. Potato Head to ""teach him a lesson"".

","When I saw this movie win an award on national TV as opposed to other movies, I was vehemently angry. I saw this in the theater when I was like, 12, and I hated then. I am in my late teens now and hate this movie even more. I hate just about everything about this movie.<br/><br/>First off, who thought that a crybaby Barbie, or as I say, ""CryBARBIE,"" would be a good idea? You ever watch a movie and see that one whiny character that you just wanna smack in the face and tell them ""Boo freakin' hoo! We all have problems!"" That's what this character is for me. I'd rather watch the upcoming live-action Barbie movie (which is real, by the way). I also hate the whole cliché that this film recycles from other 3D animated films, in which the seemingly good character turns out to be evil; in this case it's Lotso Huggin' Bear. This concept is so trite it's like I expect it in every kid movie nowadays.<br/><br/>Also, what was with the gag of Buzz Lightyear being accidentally put into Spanish mode and treating Barbie like his girlfriend? See, that actually could've been funny. But it wasn't. It was just stupid. In addition to this flaw, there's the creepy baby doll character. Was I supposed to find that cute? Because I didn't. I hate babies already to begin with, so I did not like this character in the least.<br/><br/>I notice that Totoro from My Neighbor Totoro (1988) is in this movie. I was so happy that he was in it, and I expected a funny line from him at some point. But does he speak at all throughout the movie? No. Not even once. Not that Totoro can talk in the first place, but still. I thought that since he was made into a toy here, they'd bend the rules just a little.<br/><br/>Finally, this film is needlessly a tear-jerker. I've heard of people that cry at this movie, when really, how can I feel sorry here? Just give the girl your damn toys and leave! Plus, if they were that important to you, don't get rid of them, Andy! Geez.<br/><br/>Overall, Toy Story 3 gives me a headache and makes me cringe.

I respect part 1 and even part two but as a trilogy I say poor form, the innovation in graphics is not represented in storyline.

I will discuss that shortly. The original voice cast was brought back, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Wallace Shawn and Don Rickles. The story structures were kept intact, toys escaping from concrete areas. Since Pixar's technology has really developed, so have the environments and you will experience them in 3D pretty well.

","You're probably wondering if Toy Story 3 can possibly hold up against its nearly perfect predecessors. I wonder the same thing as I walked into the theater. Now, while the third movie in a trilogy is never good (with few exceptions) the wizards at Pixar have puled yet another winner out of their hat. Never have I been more entertained, touched, or learned more from an animated movie. This is the movie which not only all animated adventures be judged against, but all family movies. Toy Story 3 is a remarkable movie that will make you laugh and perhaps even cry. The script is extremely witty for the most parts, most of it aimed at adults. The voice cast is fabulous and the new characters fit in like a fish to water. All of the ""core characters"" (Woody, Buzz, etc.) complete their ""character arc"" becoming some of the most dynamic characters in recent memory. The actual animations have received a major overhaul, and are now some of the most beautiful computer-generated graphics ever. Using the lush, glow seen in Ratatouille and much darker, shadowy lighting that you would expect in the Godfather, Toy Story 3 generates as much tension as possible. Toy Story was is one of the most beloved movies ever. Toy Story 2 matched the original in all regards. Toy Story 3 however leaves them all behind. This is the most beautifully crafted movies of all time.<br/><br/>Characters: 3/3<br/><br/>Script: 2/3<br/><br/>Story: 2/2<br/><br/>Technical/Misc.: 2/2"

","so my brother can't see me cry like a girl. No words can describe this movie. It was just simply brilliant. From the story to the animation, it was amazing. It has been 15 years since the first movie. I loved all the toy story movies, it has been a part of my childhood. And i love Pixar films, since the first Pixar film to the latest one, i loved it and toy story 3 is definitely in my top 3 best Pixar films. It's so refreshing to see the characters again, and with the animation they look so much better. Toy story 3 has set the bar high, it is emotional (especially at the end). The ending part is totally my favorite (i cried like a baby). This movie is about friendship and letting go of things that are important to us. So for anyone who is looking for a film that will touch your heart, definitely watch this! it will not disappoint you. Pixar makes the best movies out there! I recommend this film to everybody! 10/10 stars!"

The movie is for all ages from babies to seniors. Everyone laughs and Buzz is extravagant! <br/><br/>If I could give this movie a 1082374128410924, I definitely would!

","hi all,<br/><br/>when the Toy Story3 released, as usual we read the reviews from IMDb and then booked the ticket for it. To say frankly this movie is <br/><br/>not SO great like others reviewing about this. The story, animation, characterization, music and even 3d effect also very normal and it has <br/><br/>no surprise turning in story. More or less it is not equal or more when comparing with movies like Avatar, up, even ""Day & Night"" also has some new concept to entertain us.<br/><br/>Sorry folks this movie isn't great to pay for.

","This movie is overflown with grim/gloom/scary messages and situations, not suitable for kids till at least age of 10-12, when they may actually start appreciating some of the dark humor. I would estimate it at least 75% being like that, with couple of characters - direct candidates for younger kids nightmares. I'm merely astonished by glorious reviews!.. I can accept the fact that it might be somewhat amusing for older (even adults) audience, but why would it be rated G then?! Sorry, this was not fun, neither for me nor for my seven year old. Not even for the most people at the theater, who were watching it with us. Makes me wonder if (obviously adult) reviewers even asked their kids opinions, as it's supposed to be kids movie, isn't it?"
"deathiscoming-1","6","4","11","12 July 2010"," A fun and cutesy but unfortunately sleep inducing movie, unsuitable for kids
","A formula is great thing, it helps you solve complex problems in a simplistic, time efficient manner but unfortunately the same is not true for movie making and once again Pixar has used the same old Toy Story formula of ""save my plastic back(side)"" in this movie too. A movie which starts pleasantly dims off to a sleep inducing monotone by the end and you find yourself scratching your head thinking ""déjà vu"" by the middle but because you're in a cinema you keep quiet and lull yourself off into a numb surrender instead.<br/><br/>The movie entrées with the toys all warring with each other and before you gasp in horror and disbelief or question why you realise it's just Andy playing with his toys, probably for the last time since he's going to college soon. The sequence is creative and playful and forces out a chuckle or two, but as soon as it's over things go pear shaped. Queue the separation sequence. Whereas in previous Toys Stories it's one toy lost, everybody save, it seems the bigger budget and new technology has helped Pixar to think outside their box a little, but still only just far enough to keep them still sitting in its shadow. Instead of one toy lost, it's now many toys lost and instead of everybody helps to save one toy lost, it's now one toy saves the playground (so to speak) and hey presto you have your classic Hollywood ""one man saves the world"" movie, but with toys instead.<br/><br/>The classic characters are all still ""real"" and believable and no one is missing (which is good), the new toys are also very well done, funny and how you would probably imagine them to be if they were really alive (how cool would that be!). The voiceovers are great and the humans are surprisingly well done too, unlike TS1 and TS2 where detail to them was cunningly skimmed over.<br/><br/>Again, things turn nasty with the introduction of Mr Hitler pink teddy! A predictably kind and wise old ring leader with evil eugenically inspired intentions, the textbook villain for our hero toys to escape from and all the while wholly inappropriate for the young in the auditorium! A quick glance at my neighbours qualified the fact that if this sequence had gone on any longer we would have had a few crying kids on our hands. And the terminator Chucky doll didn't exactly help roses bloom in my heart! <br/><br/>Basically, Pixar has pulled an offensive hand gesture to their target audience on this one and just regurgitated and older toy story with 3D effects. Which on further inspection was shamefully weak and uninspiring anyway; as I have had said before, I don't want to be sitting with my face melting in my hand during a 3D movie, get the audience moving, ducking and dodging! I for one would expect the medium of animation as one which can truly stretch this technology to its limits (again, go watch the 3D show at Thorpe park), seems like Hollywood is fresh out of revolutionaries and there are now none to the likes of the Wachowski Brothers left.<br/><br/>My advice and closing comment, if you are ten or less, you'll be crying watching this so get mummy or daddy to fast forward the scary bits and if you're a parent your nippers will be crying, so fast forward the scary bits, if you're a teenager or anything else you'll probably enjoy this movie, more so if you're tipsy or have an IQ <100."

","This awful movie is not worthy of being ranked #26 on the IMDb top 250 movies. It was obviously just a popularity contest because this was by far the worst Toy Story movie made. Idiots who gave this movie a 10 rating are stupid simpletons who wouldn't be able to appreciate a movie that is actually good. I saw this movie at the theater and was looking forward to it, but when the credits rolled and Buzz Lightyear and Jessie started dancing, I was the first person to leave, I was so glad it was over. I like the first two, but this one sucked, that's why it pisses me off that it's #26 and even outranks the first two. I don't even think it deserves a spot in the top 250 period. So if you agree with me please rank this movie a 1. I did, because that's what it deserves."
"karina_daisyjane","9","2","4","18 November 2014"," My heart! :(
","Wow is the first word that comes to my head. How does Pixar do it? <br/><br/>This sweet, little, adorable film has completely stolen my heart and broken it at the same time. I've always loved Toy story one and two, but I was skeptical of the third. Really, how can Pixar pull off making a third Toy Story, that we're all going to love as much as the first and the second? Well, I don't know how they blew us away but they did, and we possibly loved it more. <br/><br/>The film shows the toys encountering some serious challenges, there is a deep sense of love and camaraderie which is so heart warming, no hope is lost.<br/><br/>It is a film for children to laugh at because they love the characters, but the clever part is that the adults understand it on a deeper level. We feel the emotional side of the story in a way that children simply will not understand until they're adults. Both demographics are successfully reached.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is hilarious, ever so cute and intensely action filled. The dialogue and emotions are expressed so profoundly that we feel the struggles and desires of the characters as if they are our own. So effective, that it took me four days to stop feeling sad about it.<br/><br/>A beautiful compelling story of love, strength, fear, friendship, and the courage to accept what we cannot change.<br/><br/>Gorgeous movie.

"derangedxzombie","10","2","4","20 March 2013"," Does something most sequels fail to!
","I was probably about 8 when I first saw Toy Story, and like everyone I loved it, the same with Toy Story 2, they were somehow really enjoyable whether kid or adult. <br/><br/>As time went one I'd wondered if they'd ever make a 3rd, and thankfully Pixar did. As everyone knows, sequels usually tend to go stale and never live up to their predecessors, Terminator 1 & the height being 2 for instance before Terminator 3 and 4 were okay at best. But Toy Story 3 somehow manages to be, perhaps better than the last two! And after more than 10 years this is a very good thing. Pixar are wonderful because not only do they manage to create things that appeal to both kids and adults, but they genuinely care about what they create, they aren't like EA or Apple, don't rush out poor creations due to greed greed, and this isn't more apparent than in Toy Story 3. Though a bench mark back in the late 90's, the animation now is better of course, a lot more colourful and vibrant, and despite being a animation it is at times more emotion evoking than most films. <br/><br/>If for some reason you've not seen it yet, then what are you waiting for! If you haven't seen any of the three for some crazy reason, watch them all."
"illbebackreviews","10","2","4","9 January 2013"," And so, this masterpiece Pixar film ends one of the greatest trilogies ever made...Or are the rumors of Toy Story 4 true?
","Toy Story is simply one of the greatest movies ever made. Kids and adults all love and grow up with this movie. The first Toy Story began a revolutionary new art of film making and since then Pixar have conjured up many classics such as Monsters Inc, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo and the list goes ever on and on! <br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is nothing less than a complete masterpiece not only in the genre of animation but as a movie itself! Toy Story 3, when I first watched it, did not fall short of my expectations. It exceeded my expectations which were high after seeing how good the first two were. This movie, if anything, is as good if not better than both the other Toy Story films<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are livelier and funnier than they've ever been. Its also a more adventurous and ""EPIC"" movie than the first two, which both got EASY 10/10's from me! The characters have more screen time and just make you laugh more in this film.<br/><br/>The story itself, I believe, is the best of the three. Not only does this feel the most emotional, its just the strongest and most entertaining of the trilogy. The story actually feels much more darker and keeps us more excited all the way through. I don't know, there's just something that tells me the story in the third installment is just more enjoyable to watch. <br/><br/>The visual animations are something that I need NOT mention when it comes to Pixar movies! The voice acting is nothing but just magnificent. Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as beloved Buzz are just absolutely brilliant. The writing of the film is intelligent and entertaining with many jokes thrown all over the place that ACTUALLY DO NOT slow down the film! <br/><br/>The villain in this movie is also more interesting than Al or Sid who both didn't seem that evil in spirit and desire. Lotso and the baby clearly added a much darker side to Toy Story and Demo-ed Buzz was just awesome! <br/><br/>The new characters that we are introduced to in this film are just brilliant! The monkey and Lotso were both great and the last 30 minutes or so were extremely emotional, seeing truly one of the greatest trilogies come to what seems a most respectable ending!"
"jfgibson73","10","2","4","21 March 2012"," Changed my mind about so many things
","Toy Story 3 blew me away. I wasn't a fan of the series before; now, I love all the movies and characters. The animation is so beautiful to look at that you couldn't give anything less than a perfect grade in that aspect. The voicework/acting is almost as impressive. It seems like such a miracle that anyone was able to assemble a cast where every player is able to make so much out of their characters. No one falls flat or disappoints. If I have one criticism, it's that it's a little too action-based and busy. There aren't really any moments like in Wall-E where you're just watching things happen--every moment is pushing the story along, explaining things, and moving to the next obstacle. I also thought there were too many scenes of toys finding ways to break out of places. I understand it is basically a prison-escape movie, but there were so many sequences like this, it felt overdone. I can't let these nitpicks affect my overall rating, however, because this movie does something so amazing with the final goodbye sequence, it makes up for all of it. I think that for me, it is the most special moment in any movie I've ever seen. I only wish I could have watched this movie in theater as a fan of the series already. And then all the extra stuff during the credits just adds a tremendous amount of more storytelling. It's so totally satisfying that this almost instantly became one of the movies that I care about so much that I don't want to watch it too often, so that it remains as affecting as possible. Put all this together along with the short cartoon ""Hawaiin Vacation,"" which continues the story, and I am begging for a fourth Toy Story. The filmmakers pulled off a number of miracles, but think about how staggering this is: not only does this movie build upon the characters and their choices over the previous two movies, not only is it more rewarding for culminating all the themes and emotional payoffs in the first two, but even after wrapping it all up with the most beautiful resolution possible--maybe the greatest movie ending ever--it also sets up a new beginning that is just as rich for exploring. Even more than Andy, I want to see what life is like for the toys with Bonnie. I would buy a movie of just Bonnie playing with the toys for an hour and a half. I wish I could let everyone who worked on this know how much it means to me and how inspiring it is. Awesome."
"bob the moo","Null","2","4","22 August 2010"," Not hilarious but just an excellent all-round film with poignancy, adventure, comedy and drama in one wonderfully animated package
","It was during a recent trip back home to Northern Ireland to see my parents that I ended up seeing Toy Story 3 – a film I had been looking forward to seeing for a while. This meant that the film was in 2D (which I was fine with – not a big 3D fan) but also on a smaller than average screen, which irritated me a little given that it was in combination with my parents desire to sit far from the screen. During the trailers I was a bit annoyed by this as I felt the film was a mile away and I thought this would contribute to me feeling remote from the film itself.<br/><br/>This worry failed to materialise because very quickly I was thoroughly engaged with enjoying the main feature. It has been years since I saw either of the first two films but I remember them being very strong indeed and this second sequel offers more of the same in terms of quality storytelling and production. I seem to remember the other two films having more big laughs and more rapid fire comedy to them, but this might just be my memory. TS3 is not as hilarious as I had expected it to be, but it does still manage to be funny with plenty to laugh at in the detail, the ideas and the dialogue. More than comedy though the story is the all and it is not only very well written but also very well realised and delivered.<br/><br/>Although I did not cry (as many critics claim to have done) I did find the film to contain just the right amount of poignancy and for it to be done in the right way so that it is touching and personal without becoming obvious or cloying. Aside from this though the main thrust of the film is an adventure with moments of thrills, genuinely dramatic moments and one specific scene (in the incinerator) which is incredibly dark considering this is a child's film (dark in a good way, not disturbing or bad). It is impossible to put I on one thing but it is telling that, considering the sheer technological feat that is your average Pixar film, one almost forgets the animation simply because of how good the story and storytelling are.<br/><br/>Of course the animation should not be forgotten because it is excellent. Not only is it technically impressive but it is rich in detail and done in a way that deserves awards for cinematography, lighting and set design if it was not for the fact it is all animated. In fact both the animation and storytelling compliment each other perfectly simply because the animation is so good it allows the viewer to totally accept the world of the narrative while the narrative is strong enough to prevent us being focused on the technical aspects. Within all this it would be equally easy to forget the voice cast simply because so much of the performance is done on the faces and body language of the characters (which is back to the animation again). Hanks, Allen, Cusack, Harris, Rickles, Shawn, Ratzenberger and all the usual cast do great work yet again to deliver the emotions as well as the wit, Hanks in particular is great as he has to carry a lot of that. Keaton and Beatty are the standouts from the new voices but the use of Dalton, Goldberg, Garlin and others is also welcome.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is yet another triumph from Pixar – a stable that makes it look easy almost every time. At a time when film franchises are make a third film simply so they can make a 3D film, the Toy Story series do not let the standard drop even slightly and produce a very strong film across the board, from technical to storytelling. Who would have thought that one of the best film trilogies made would be a family cartoon about toys that come to life when the humans leave the room?"

","""You've got a friend in me, When the road looks rough ahead...""OK, OK I will stop there, but you can't fault me for singing along, after all it is Toy Story time again, and for Woody, Buzz and the gang, the road really is looking rough ahead.<br/><br/>Back in 1995 we all remember sitting down at the cinema or in front of the TV watching a fresh faced Andy playing with his toys and Woody being brought up along Andy's bed to save the day; from that moment we were drawn into the excitement and love of Toy Story.<br/><br/>From Toy Story 1 to Toy Story 2 in 1999, the whole love affair with the Toys growing once more. The critics being divided, some saying it was better than the first others saying not a good as the first but still highly rated and excitable as ever. The one Woody's round up gang, you know the rest. Both films sitting proudly in the top 250 on the IMDb with Toy Story 1 above its sequel but now in comes Toy Story 3, the question is does it disappoint or is it? The film starts off with Andy's mother video recording the past, Andy playing with his toys and his little sister doing what all little sisters do and that's to come in and wreck everything, we then see flashbacks as Andy starts to grow as years pass by. 'Andy's going to college, can you believe?' Says his happy mum, then the question comes of what is he going to do with his old toys, the attic seems to be the destined place for Woody and Co, but a mix up by Andy's mother sees them go elsewhere.<br/><br/>Welcome to Sunnyside, a place where the toys will feel loved again, where they will be played with and where they will be happy, or will they? Sunnydale is ran by Lotso, a pink bear that smells like strawberries. He introduces the toys to the older toys already at Sunnyside, he seems friendly and loving but not all seems right. Woody and Co. are given a quick tour of the place hosted by Ken who believe it or not has never seen a Barbie before. The end of recess draws close and Lotso and the older toys leave to go into another classroom leaving Buzz and everyone on their own just as the children come in and cause mayhem. What happens here is hysterical, Mr Potato Head loses his parts into a kids mount and up the kid's nose and Hamm having glitter glued to him just a sample of what happens. By the end of the day the toys plan come up with a plan, they have to escape. But it won't be easy.<br/><br/>As with the previous films getting the plan executed doesn't go to plan, something always comes up and disrupts their plans, Toy Story 3 in no exception, getting into Sunnydale is easy, getting out is hard, especially when some of the older toys are not as nice as first thought, but Buzz and Co. won't give up that easily. The film is hilarious on so many levels, from old over-sized Buster (Andy's dog) squashing Woody to the funny one liners from the toys, (Hamm)'come on let's see how much we're going for on eBay.' But the problem with continuing a successful franchise is to keep up the standard already set; does Toy Story 3 do this? No it doesn't, it goes that one step further to make it a truly exciting film, a film that deserves to claim best picture at the Oscars because as far as animation films go, this one is one of the best. But don't just take my view on it, already in at number 6 on IMDb this film is impressing film goers all over."
"fedepresti","7","2","4","4 July 2010"," It's definitely worth your time and money
","Well, I've seen that most of the criticism towards this film is that it might be too scary for young children. This of course are made by people who see these children as the movie's target audience. WELL, IT'S NOT! Toy story one came out in 1995 and it was marketed for young children (ages 4 or 5 to 12 I would say), and this movie, released 15 years later, I think it tries to appeal the same audiences that grew up with the original Toy Story. I saw it today, and most of the people at the cinema were in their 20s and over. -yes there were some children.<br/><br/>Anyway, beside this, the movie is worth it... I don't think the 3D was necessary, except for a few scenes, but it kept me very entertained the whole time... I got very emotional by the end (someone a little more sensitive than I might cry) and there are some very lovable new characters. Yes, the bad guy is REALLY bad, there's not even the slightest hint of humanity in him... in that way I think this is kind of a western movie, with a truly unselfish and extremely brave hero and a terribly mean bad guy, it's a little square in that sense but the context makes up for it.<br/><br/>Good job Disney/Pixar"

"robehr101","10","2","4","29 June 2010"," The conclusion to a trilogy that will last for years to come
","Walking up to the theater for the 11:59 showing of Toy Story 3, my sister and I went to the ticketing machines and got our prepaid tickets. We were soon joined by a group of friends, all eager to see the movie. When we got into the theater and found our seats I was, admittedly, not feeling all that excited. Still, I had no doubts that it would be amazing; it's PIXAR, after all, and I had been following the movie closely basically since it was announced and had seen no reason to believe otherwise. Yet the excitement was still lacking. As I watched people begin to fill the theater, the thrill slowly began to wash over me, but it wasn't until I saw three girls walk in, each holding a different toy from Toy Story that it really hit me. Besides being terribly jealous of the girls toys, I was finally feeling excited for the movie.<br/><br/>Not long after, the lights dimmed, and the previews began. To be honest, I was a bit thrown out of mood by the trailer for a certain other movie I've been anticipating, but once I saw that Pixar lamp jumping over to the ""I"" on the logo, I was right back in the mood again. Then the movie started. It's amazing how a single shot of a film can say so much; The fluffy white clouds perfectly laid against a gentle blue backdrop. It was the exact same thing we saw 15 years ago in the opening of Toy Story 1.<br/><br/>The whole beginning of the film was utter blissfulness for me. ""Nostalgia"" would probably be the best word I could use to describe it. I enjoyed every minute of it, and I can't think of what better I can say about it than that. It was funny, sweet and yes, even heartbreaking. When Rex added to the list of toys who had been disposed of ""Bo-peep"" my eyes nearly welled up. It was one of those ""oh no!"" moments that only Pixar can do. It was the same feeling I got in Up when Ellie and Carl lost their baby. Both were only small moments, but I've come to realize that Pixar can say more with their little moments than most companies can say with their entire films.<br/><br/>I suppose it would be a good time to mention that this movie is hilarious. You'll laugh, believe me, but you'll be on the edge of your seat too. As the film moves on, the stakes get pretty high for our toy heros; They couldn't be much higher, really. They simply HAVE to escape Sunnyside daycare, or they risk being torn to pieces by the out of control toddlers there. The way they escape is just plan cool, but also terribly witty. I read that the filmmakers watched many classic prison escape movies so they could get this part just right, and it really shows. I fact, this is just as good as any prison escape movie, and probably better than most. Super fun, and very thrilling! Then we come to the climax of the film; The most desperate situation the toys have been in yet. Probably the most true statement I can make about this scene is that it's intense...very intense. As the toys try to climb their way up the mountain of trash to escape their fiery fate, you can't keep your heart from pounding in your chest. They accept their fate, clutching each others hands in their last few moments. They slip closer and closer to their doom. There's just no way out of this one! No wait...it's ""THE CLAAAAW!"" The claw chooses who will go and who will stay, and it's never been truer than now. As it pulls our friends from the furnace you can't help but be very relieved through your laughter.<br/><br/>Now we come to the end of the film and oh what and ending it is. I've had several people tell me it was the perfect ending, and while I'm not sure anything can ever be perfect, this is just about as darn close as anyone's ever going to get. As Andy reluctantly turns over each and every toy to the adorable little Bonnie, their is only one word that can describe the emotions; bittersweet. This scene is bittersweet to the end. The most poignant moment comes when Bonnie exclaims ""There's a snake in my boot!"" and reaches for Andy's old woody doll. Andy pulls back out of instinct, to protect his favorite sheriff. Then, carefully describing Woody's characteristics to Bonnie, Andy hands him over forever to his new ""favorite deputy."" The final scenes are those of Andy playing with Bonnie and the toys in the front yard. Some will smile, some will cry, and some will do both (and certainly it is deserving of both) but all will come away effected by this film in way one or another.<br/><br/>As Andy says his final goodbye, and the camera pulls away to the sky, we see again the classic shot that began this journey fifteen years ago and we are forced to say our final goodbye as well."

","This Toy Story is filled with emotion and touching moments, then hits you right with an absolutely hilarious gag. Once again, Tom Hanks brilliantly brings Woody to life, with the same holding true to Tim Allen and all the other voices for the toys. ***SPOILER*** Now, when the Toys accept ""death"" and all hold hands going into the incinerator, this touches you in the heart. Then they are saved by ""the Claaawwww"" (As the green aliens call it). When I was watching a sold out showing of this movie, the entire crowd erupted in applause and laughter. Never, EVER in my movie watching experience have I seen a crowd SO into a movie that they applaud when a character is saved. This shows the Pixar Artistry at work. Even in the incredible UP, (2009) no one applauded for Carl when he saved Russel. Enough said, GO SEE IT NOW"
"Shanetmims","10","2","4","28 June 2010"," An excellent,emotionally-satisfying,hilarious,final chapter!
","In 1995,Disney and Pixar released their first film,Toy Story,a revolutionary new animated film that combine stunning visuals,a terrific storyline,and a unforgettable group of characters,voiced by some extremely talented actors. Needless to say,it was a well-deserved hit,and it put Pixar on the map.Nine films followed:A Bug's Life in 1998,Toy Story 2 in 1999,Monsters Inc. in 2001,Finding Nemo in 2003,The Incredibles in 2004,Cars in 2006,Ratatouille in 2007,Wall-E in 2008.,and last year we received Up.All of these films are classics,and deservedly so,combining visuals,story,and characters to create some of the greatest films of not only their genres,but of all time! With Toy Story 3,we can add another classic to the list,in what is probably their best film yet! <br/><br/>At the end of Toy Story 2,Woody and Buzz were talking about what would happen when Andy,their owner,would grow up. What would become of them? Although Woody said he wasn't worried,and was just interested in making the fun times last,the other toys expressed no concern,as they had nothing to worry about. Andy still was young,and they were still being played with. After a amazing opening sequence that shows Andy,6 years old,playing with his toys,we then see Andy as a now seventeen year-old young man who is about to go college. The toys,who are now just Woody,Buzz,Jessie,Bullseye,Mr and Mrs. Potato Head,Hamm,Rex,and the three aliens,haven't been played with in years, and are now concerned about their future. Most of the toys from the first two are long gone,most notably Bo Peep,having been sold or thrown out,and the others are afraid they will receive a similar fate.<br/><br/>When Andy begins to put the toys away,he puts the others in a trash bag intended to be in the attic,while Woody is put in his college box. Sadly,he leaves the bag,lying around,and Andy's mom throws it out as trash.The toys escape the bag,as Woody leaves the box and makes it outside,and decided to go in a box labeled Sunnyside,the daycare center where they will be donated to kids who will play with them and where they will always be loved.Woody tries to convince them Andy still cares for them,but they refuse to listen.Along with Andy's sister's Barbie doll,the toys think they have found heaven....until they are actually played with by young toddlers who treat them with reckless attention. The toys realize they have made a horrible mistake,but when they try to leave,the head toy,a strawberry-scented bear with a cane,named Lotso,traps them,and runs the daycare as a prison.It will now take all their efforts in order to escape Sunnyside and return to Andy,but will it be possible?<br/><br/>Usually,third films suck compared to the previous films,and so many trilogies fall victim to this. There are a few third parts that are better than the first two(Return of the King,Bourne Ultimatum,Mission:Impossible III),or at least equal to,but there are few in number. I am happy to report that Toy Story 3 is not as good as part one and two,it surpassed them. The story this time is so much more poignant,not only because of the first two,but on its own merit.If you thought the characters were strong in the first,and engaging in the second,you heart will break for them here,as they have been given more depth than ever before. And if you love Pixar's animation style in their previous ten films,they have outdone themselves here,giving so much detail to everything. It is so striking to see how far they have come.<br/><br/>I knew going in to this chapter,it would be good,but I did not expect the all the emotional moments in this film. I actually cried during the last fifteen minutes,and that is some of the best moments you will ever see in cinema,animation or not.<br/><br/>Pixar has gone to ""infinity and beyond"" with this final chapter that delight young and old,fans and newcomers,and will have people,even knowing this is the last chapter,wanting to see these incredible characters again.<br/><br/>That is the mark of this,and all the other Pixar films:They are masterpieces. See it!"
"carlosleonrendon","10","2","4","28 June 2010"," Pixar at their best!
","The minute I saw the trailer for Toy story 3 I was blown away and it brought back so many memories that the past year has been just waiting anxiously for it to come out. Then the movies came out on blu-ray, what better way to prepare for this amazing adventure that Pixar gave us. I have to say, when I saw Wall-E I was just surprised to see how they could get people of all ages to get so emotional with such unusual characters. That lovely robot that changed the fate of mankind and had us laughing for quite a while, to that 80 year old grumpy man. By the way, with Up, they made people fall in love with a character within 10 minutes. I think some people don't realize that for some movies, it takes the writers 2 hours to make people identify with the characters. Without doubt, The Pixar people know that when they are making a movie, they are making THE movie of the year. I grew up with Toy story, as many other reviewers here. I still laugh with the same movies and still get my heart a LITTLE broken every time I see that part in the first Toy Story with the song ""I Will Go Sailing No More"". The night I went to watch this movie I was with a few friends from the US (I'm from Mexico and we only get the dubbed version which is pretty awesome too, and I don't generally like dubbed movies). Their Spanish is not great so some parts were a little hard for them to understand. It was not necessary for them to get every single line, and I think it made them focus on the expressions of the toys, the music, the lighting and they too were crying as well as most people in the room, I can't wait for them to watch it in English and then watch it with a completely different perspective. Although it is a movie for kids, it is the darker of the three, the second time I saw it I was with a couple of little kids and they were really scared in some parts. Ever since Wall-E I came to realize how universal their movies are, so little dialogue, so many emotions. I guess this is probably not a great review of the movie, it is more like the experience you are probably gonna get. It's a movie in which you will laugh, cry, get scared, angry and who knows how many other things. So many life lessons that about friendship and love. I felt like I was 8 years old again, nothing mattered but the great stories I made up with all my toys, I didn't want to grow up (I still think some part of me didn't and that is why I enjoy this movies so much), but somehow, this movie showed a different side of the script and story that you don't get when you are a kid. **SPOILER for Finding Nemo** It was like that part in Finding Nemo when they are hanging to the whales tongue and Dory says: It's time to let go! Marlin: How do you know, how do you know something bad isn't gonna happen?! Dory: I don't! A kid would just probably get plain lines without special meaning. Just ask a parent if they got the same simple lines. Dreamworks' Shrek made the same thing with adult jokes. Don't get me wrong, Shrek is a great movie, I guess if I had to choose to watch a movie over and over again between these two... Toy story... always Toy Story<br/><br/>Music: 10 CGI:10 Story: 10 Heart:10"
"fterh","10","2","4","23 June 2010"," Possibly the best movie of 2010
","An excellent movie, highly recommended for kids, teens and adults alike. The plot is captivating and not at all predictable, unlike some movies which you already know the ending halfway through. 3D is great, but not worth the extra charge of S$3 (in Singapore).<br/><br/>So the plot is filled with magic and pure entertainment, and TS3 has its funny, sad and touching moments. I've watched many movies and I dare say this is one of the best ones I've ever watched. I could never guess what was going to happen next, which is one of the best things about this movie in my opinion. TS3 was able to make the audience burst out laughing without the usage of crude humor, which is quite rare nowadays.<br/><br/>:)"

"merrimac290","10","2","4","21 June 2010"," Don't let the ""3"" in the title worry you in the slightest. This is such an approachable film for children and adults alike.
","Because it had been 11 years since we last saw Woody and Buzz on the big screen and the first two films were so awesome, this was to be the runt of the trilogy. Probably good entertainment for two hours but obviously a ploy by Pixar to squeeze as much money possible from their most beloved franchise while they still could. Now that I've seen Toy Story 3 I'm both happy and humbled to report that I was wrong.<br/><br/>Like Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3 begins with a bang. Those who remember how the first two Toy Story movies begin should be able to tell immediately what's going on. After a little bit of fun lighthearted drama, we see a series of flashbacks through old videos and images of Andy playing with his toys through the years. We see that gradually he's growing up and when the camera ends and darkness comes we are brought to the present day. He is now 17 and about to go to college. Andy has outgrown his toys and while they have gotten used to staying in boxes they still desperately yearn for any kind of attention from him. Even being held briefly by him is now a moment to be cherished. These are bleak times for the toys and Woody, the unofficial leader of the group, tries to keep everyone's spirits up by clinging to any type of positive thinking that can be mustered. Only a handful of the toys from the first two films are still with Andy (many of them have been sold at yard sales and others donated). Despite being ignored, they still have a loyalty to Andy because he's kept them and are content with staying in the attic if that's what he wants. Woody points out that someday Andy might have kids and they might get played with again. However, a misunderstanding convinces all of them (save Woody) that Andy no longer wants them and they seek to be donated to the local daycare center. At Sunny Side day care center, these ""NEW TOYS!"" are pleased with their first impressions of everything. The toys seem nice. The kids seem nice. And the idea of not having an owner appeals to them. However, first impressions can be misleading...<br/><br/>That's all of the plot I'm willing to reveal. Let me say that this is easily my favorite Pixar movie since the original Toy Story in 1995. It made me laugh which is not always easy. Ken is a welcome addition to the Toy Story family and, alongside Barbie, share many of the most memorable scenes in the movie. And Spanish speaking Buzz is even funnier than I could have imagined from the commercials.<br/><br/>The villain of this movie is in some respects the most evil of all the Toy Story villains like Sid, Sid's dog, Al the toy collector, Stinky Pete, and even evil emperor Zerg! And towards the end there is one particular moment where his wickedness is fully revealed. Who knew that such evil could be in the form of a teddy bear that smells like strawberries! For a movie that took over a decade to get to the screen, it's amazing how relevant and integral it is to this trilogy. In retrospect it even kind of seems like Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were mere stepping stones to this movie where the big questions about children's relationship with toys would finally be tackled.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3, in contrast to what a lot of critics suggest, won't make everyone cry. It won't even make most people cry. But it's guaranteed to melt the coldest hearts, make the sternest face smile, and, yes, make a few people sob. The ending was, for me, the best ending to a Pixar movie (even though it was borderline cheesy) and is probably my favorite ending to any movie since Shawshank Redemption's ending. Many people will say they were sad but I was happy because I knew it had to happen. The ending also makes this trilogy complete and, though a Toy Story 4 is not impossible, it seemed like the creators were saying to the audience that this is the final curtain call. Of course, if this movie makes a lot of money the executives might reconsider but for the moment I don't think there are any plans to do a ""4"".<br/><br/>And if the day ever comes when they decide to go back into the attic and dust off these old toys for one more adventure, I'll be lining up to see it and expect nothing less than an awesome movie. If you haven't seen this movie, stop reading these reviews and go see it right now."
"prillyisyourfriend","10","2","4","20 June 2010"," Best Toy Story movie
","I cried twice in this movie. And I don't cry easily in movies.<br/><br/>Before the movie even started, I was hooked on the Pixar Short: Day and Night. One word: brilliant. <br/><br/>Then begins the movie which started off typically: flashback to Andy playing with the toys; we find out Andy's going to college; toys get freaked out about being left behind and forgotten or worse, thrown away; and from one little mistake, the toys get sent to Sunnyside daycare. Woody however, is determined to get back to Andy but ends up getting whisked away by a little girl named Bonnie. After finding out that some of the old toys in the daycare aren't all that nice, Woody heads back to the daycare to save his friends.<br/><br/>This movie has it all. Funny (e.g. Mr. Potato Head's body parts on the tortilla, Spanish-speaking Buzz), exciting (e.g. escaping the daycare, trying to get out of the landfill), and of course, touching (the last 10-15 minutes of the movie). <br/><br/>First scene that made me cry: when they all got dumped into the fiery pit. I mean, I knew that it wasn't gonna end that way but seeing all the toys hold hands and whatnot really got to me.<br/><br/>The other scene that made me (and probably everyone else) cry the hardest: when Andy is giving the toys away to little Bonnie. I started tearing up as he was giving each toy away, but when he got to Woody, I started bawling and couldn't stop it. Thank goodness I was wearing those 3D glasses to somewhat hide the waterworks. <br/><br/>Like all Disney/Pixar movies, it has so many morals and themes that everyone can relate to it and it really hits a soft spot. My older sister, who is 26, cried because it reminded her of her childhood; how we all have to grow up at some point. And for me, and I'm 20, it was about letting that things you love go because it's for the best. <br/><br/>I. Love. This. Movie. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and go see it. If you've already seen it, watch it again."
"musicday1094","10","2","4","20 June 2010"," Toy Story 3 will be remembered
","When I first learned of a third entry to the Toy Story series, I was on IMDb looking up some information from one of the earlier Toy Story titles. When looking up either Toy Story or Toy Story 2, my eyes saw a link to a Toy Story 3 page, set for 2010. When I saw this, I was both excited and a bit worried. I would once again see my favorite toys up on the big screen in an all new adventure, however I was skeptical as to how well this could be pulled off. Even though it was Pixar working on the film, I had trouble seeing just how a good third Toy Story could be made. Take the Shrek franchise for instance; Shrek the Third was not only unnecessary, but also not a very good movie in the first place. Well, the years went by and I finally saw a trailer for the Pixar film; it nearly moved me to tears. The idea that Andy was moving away, leaving the Toys behind was enough to make me pre-order my tickets. I thought it was a great story line. However, as the date for the moving got closer and closer, I was a bit upset with how they revealed much of the plot through their YouTube page. They talked about how the day-care was not what the toys originally thought it was going to be, and how there was going to be a prison escape. Then I actually saw the film, and was blown away. Pixar did not reveal an eighth of the story as I had feared they did. The animation, the story, and so much more all come together to make not only the perfect third entry to a franchise, but the perfect ending of a trilogy. The Toy Story trilogy is now complete, and it feels that way. This movie will be remembered, and it deserves not only the 9.4/10 that it currently stands on IMDb, but the 100% it hold at RT. I applaud Pixar for this amazing film, and can not wait to see what they do next."

"griffolyon12","10","2","4","20 June 2010"," Thematically Dense, yet Hilarious at the Same Time
","For those of us who grew up with the Toy Story films, we, like Andy, have left behind our toys to venture out into adulthood, but we all still hold that fondness for the things from when we were children. Toy Story 3 is the full summation of fifteen years of growing up, from childhood to adulthood. I was five when the first Toy Story hit theaters, now I am twenty and Toy Story 3 is here.<br/><br/>In between that time, Andy has grown to be seventeen and leaving for college, and he is faced with the dilemma as to what to do with his old toys, Woody, Buzz, and the whole gang. All these once cheerful toys want is to be played with, but now their in the doldrums from not having any playtime in years. One thing leads to another and the toys accidentally wind up at a Daycare Center. At first it seems like a magical resort for toys, but it in fact winds up being a prison. The Center is enforced by a big teddy bear named Lotso who utilizes his crazy cymbal, clanking monkey for security to keep toys in line. The film really takes off though with the the toys' determination to return to Andy's house before Andy leaves for college. This is where the movie has it's real fun as the toys try to escape the almost impenetrable Daycare Center.<br/><br/>In a way, Toy Story 3's ending has all the more emotional resonance because I have grown up with these characters and it is hard to leave them behind. I think that is why Toy Story 3 is such a fascinating film. The film is about life, and one's contemplations, albeit it's about a bunch of hunks of plastic. You feel for these characters, you even feel for Andy and his conflictions as to what to do with these toys that he still loves so much. But what the film is all about, is about not trying to hold onto one's past, but learning how to move on. This is, thematically, Pixar's heaviest film that they've ever done, and I don't think that there is any dispute about that. You walk out of the theater at the end, both wanting to cry and smile.<br/><br/>Director Lee Unkrich's directorial debut is well done, channeling John Lasseter's fascinating work on the first two installments, while layering the film with a very appetizing visual flare, but Unkrich's direction soars thanks to Academy Award-winner Michael Arndt's funny, yet increasingly moving screenplay that has surprises around every turn. All of the voice cast returns and delivers pitch perfect performances, I mean, you can't really beat Tom Hanks as Woody, but Tim Allen's Buzz Lightyear comes close. Michael Keaton's Ken is the most fun new addition to the cast, but Kristen Schaal (Mel from Flight of the Conchords) makes the most of her limited time as Trixie the Triceratops.<br/><br/>Like every third installment, the film feels as if it has thirty climaxes, but each one is played to maximum perfection. Like the first two films, Toy Story 3 is filled with pint-sized adventure and much hilarity, but it's the heart that ultimately wins you over, and it's the heart that makes one remember.<br/><br/>I give Toy Story 3 a 10 out of 10!"
"MetalDuck","10","2","4","20 June 2010"," Toy Story 3 goes to infinity- and beyond!
","If there's one movie I could watch forever and ever, it'd be the original Toy Story. The first ever animated film was released in 1995, and still has charm to this very day. The film had so much success in the box office, and with fans, that a sequel, Toy Story 2 was released in 1999. It's rare that a sequel is as good or better than it's follower, but that is exactly the case with Toy Story 2. Disney and Pixar proved that animation isn't a genre or a type of film, but rather a simple medium for creating movies with deep heart, and a deep story.<br/><br/>So the success of the first two films leads to this. Toy Story 3. The first ever 3D film in the franchise, released June 18th, has been building hype since the end of Toy Story 2, when viewer's thought, ""What's next?"". The day is finally here. Toy Story 3 is out. So does it live up to its hype? Yes. It does. It goes to infinity- and beyond.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 starts with a nostalgic collection of video tapes that Andy's mom recorded in Andy's childhood. Exciting action and funny moments start the film before it really starts. The opening animated sequence indulges you so much into the story that you don't necessarily think that this is part of an old type of Andy playing with his toys. After that nice sequence, we learn that Andy is a grown 17 year old, ready to depart to college. He must find out what to do with his old toys. So he puts everyone in a trash bag intended to be later put and stored away in the attic, but Andy's mom finds the trash bag sitting on the ground (as the attic latter Andy opened accidentally closed), so she takes the bag out to the trash. A funny instance I enjoyed was when Andy called Buster to go save the toys. Buster was very slow and old, and the audience chuckled at seeing that. So after that, the toys end up in a box going to Sunnyside Daycare. They think life there will be awesome soon upon their arrival. They meet many new toys, and the 'leader' of the daycare. Lotso. The strawberry scented purple teddy bear looks so kind, the toys think living in this daycare and getting played with every day will be great. Lotso introduced the toys around, they meet more toys, and then they are put into where they will be 'staying'. This then brings up the best chaos scene in a film ever. Dozens of toddlers burst into the room, absolutely tormenting the toys. After getting thrown, bitten, and bounced around, Buzz goes to ask Lotso if they can be moved to the Butterfly room. This is one of my favorite scenes in the whole film. Buzz finds that Lotso's evil gang gamble up in the vending machine at night. Buzz is caught, and then tied up and reset. We now know Lotso is an evil villain, and we wonder what could be next.<br/><br/>So now we know that Lotso doesn't want anyone to escape. In the meantime, Woody is at a girl named Bonnie's house, after he tried escaping, but got caught in a tree and taken away by the cute little girl. Woody then says he has to get back home, but he wants to rescue the toys first. He tells the new toys he met he wants to go rescue his friends at Sunnyside, but that's when Chuckles The Clown tells him about Lotso and how he used to be with him. Lotso treats Sunnyside like a prison, so Woody needs to help get the toys out. So Woody talks to an old veteran of Sunnyside, Chatter Telephone. Chatter tells Woody all the secrets of the place. Doors locked, Monkey manning the security cameras, Lotso has guards set everywhere, etc. Woody then tells his friends a plan, and they make a run for it. They make it to where they are supposed to be, the dump, when Lotso finds them. They then turn against Lotso, and Big Baby chucks him in the trash. But as the toys escape, a green alien is stuck in the garbage bin, and Woody grabs him when Lotso jumps out. They then end in up in the trash and they will be killed if they don't grab onto something metal. Luckily they do, but Woody saves Lotso as well. Then Lotso tried to hit the emergency brake on the belt leading to the incinerator, but he turns his back and runs away, sending the toys into the burning pile of trash. The Aliens man the claw, luckily saving the toys as they knew they were about to die. They then make it home, and Andy donates the toys to Bonnie, a very emotional ending.<br/><br/>So does this movie hit a home run? No. It hits a grand slam. The story is the best yet, and with over 300 characters, good humor, and a lot of unique, dark scenes, some say this is the best Toy Story yet, and I couldn't disagree."
"ciscokid1970","10","2","4","20 June 2010"," Funny Heartwarming Family Fun...Outstanding!!
","Just as good as the first two. Outstanding family movie, funny for kids with bits that adults will love. It is amazing how Pixar/Disney finds new way to keep the story fresh. It has been 15 years since the first Toy Story, and they found a way to work that into the movie.<br/><br/>We saw it in 3Dthe 3D did not add many items flying at your face. So save some money watch the regular version, in fact avoid the 3D glasses eye strain. <br/><br/>I do not want to give anything away, but I have to point out some of my favorite parts. The part of Andy growing up and outgrowing his toys, reminds me of my own kids who are growing up and loosing their childhood ways. And the ""Buzz Lightyear Spanish mode"" was brilliant. And the extra music done by the Gypsy Kings was fantastic.<br/><br/>It is amazing how many great actors lend their voices to these movies, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Joan Cusak, Michael Keaton, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenburger and others. Ned Beatty did a brilliant job of voice acting for Lotso, he reminded me of Phil Harris (Baloo, Jungle book). Blake Clark did a great job on Slinky Dog paying homage to the late Jim Varney. <br/><br/>Worth watching in the theater with family, and definitely worth buying."
"nikiburgoyne71","10","2","4","20 June 2010"," Capturing the hearts of young and old
","Toy Story is one of the best, if not the best children's/family movies of all time. The children are captivated with the most fascinating toys coming to life while the parents/adults feel like kids again. It brings back the memories of your childhood toys. Since then there was Toy Story 2 which brought all your favourites back to life once again and a few more. But I have to say Toy Story 3 was on a whole new level where those children who's seen the first movies are now grown too and the parent's feel that sense of your child growing up and moving on to life of their own. It was an extremely sentimental movie to me, but still managed to bring many laughs. I can honestly say that I loved this movie and the whole Toy Story trilogy. So, grab you children, teenagers too and don't forget your Kleenex as you watch the years enfold before your eyes. Great Job Disney Pixar. It will always hold a special place in my heart."

""Toy Story 3"" successfully continues the Pixar tradition of excellence in animation and film story-telling that began 15 years ago with the first ""Toy Story."" <br/><br/>I don't know how they do it but the excellent screenwriters was able to shake up the old ""Toy Story"" themes of abandonment, friendship and loyalty into this wonderful script bursting with fresh humor, exciting action and above all, rich and heart-warming emotion. Never mind that we were watching toys on screen, but these characters were as real as people we hold dear. We are drawn into their dilemmas and we root for them to find their salvation.<br/><br/>That hyper-exciting nail-biting scene in the garbage-disposal facility is a masterpiece in suspense. I was in awe at the vivid and highly complex sequence of animation on screen. When I looked at my 8 year old son beside me, he too was in total awe. It was amazing.<br/><br/>If the last Pixar film ""Up"" made us cry in the first 10 minutes, I think there was no dry eye in the theater (especially adults) in the last 10 minutes of ""Toy Story 3"". The sincerity of the dialogue and the highly charged execution was beautiful. Even that final catch in Andy's breath as he finally drove off to college was so intense with emotion.<br/><br/>The voice acting was pitch perfect, especially Tom Hanks and Tim Allen who got Woody and Buzz down pat. The new duo of Ken (voiced by Michael ""Batman"" Keaton) and Barbie (voiced by Jodi ""Little Mermaid"" Benson) was very funny.<br/><br/>What more superlatives can I write to convince you to watch this special film? It is a contender for the top spot in many a fan's Pixar favorite lists. It will surely be in contention for the Oscar (even for Best Picture) at year's end. DO NOT MISS THIS PIXAR MASTERPIECE!"
"msv-96","10","2","4","19 June 2010"," This Movie Goes Infinity And Beyond!
","This movie is absolutely amazing, really. 11 years of waiting were worthwhile. I went to the movie with BIG expectations, and they were accomplished.I was really excited. My other friends that went to watch this movie after me, told me i was going cry over and over at the end, and truly, i did. Its quite sad that Andy is leaving his toys. The little preschooler was really cute All the public was laughing at different parts of the movie. It is really enjoyable. I think this movie is more for grown-ups that really know the story. Little kids that haven't seen the movie may think it is a little boring. <br/><br/>This is a MUST-SEE, really. I will go again to watch it, and DEFINITELY i will buy it in DVD to watch it over and over. <br/><br/>A well-deserved 10/10"
"jay632","10","2","4","19 June 2010"," Impressed, the high ratings on IMDb was warranted.
","For some reason, I just can't get into Pixar films. Haven't enjoyed one since ratatouille. But this one somehow got by my critique of their films and I actually enjoyed it. While only downside I see to this film was the 3D, didn't add much to the film for me. The intro where they showed the short film day and night was pretty awesome.<br/><br/>This movie did a excellent job, after countless years off the screen, they still managed to make me care about the characters. I must admit, I didn't really like part 1 and part 2, but this film felt fulfilling and plot advancing instead of running in circles.<br/><br/>The reason why I liked this movie so much was because they had a good plot, kept me interested, I must say from start to finish. And that is pretty tough to do for an adult, my kids loved the movie, but that was expected, I was surprised I would enjoy it too. You know, I barely notice the cast, sure Tom Hanks voice is noticeable, but after a brief period, you forget its even him and you thinking its Woody, and that's how it should be. There is even extra scenes during the credit, can't remember the last time I sat through the credits. This film hit the right spots and did the right thing, good job Pixar.<br/><br/>Highly recommend you go see this."
"GuyCC","10","2","4","19 June 2010"," Pixar Goes Past The Heart, And Straight For The Soul.
","It's been a long time since a recent movie has made me think.<br/><br/>How can they, really? Mainstream movies have become all about marketing ploys with characters designed to adorn a Taco Bell cup, and rehashing of ideas and franchises we've already seen from the last few decades. We're stuck with movies that cost no less than $12 on a good day, and are using 3D as a means to keep us in the theaters and away from our home theaters. Is it little wonder why people have grown cynical? Doesn't a ""Part 3"" mean that we're just getting more of the same, even with a pedigree as strong as Pixar's? No. It doesn't. And that's where something very different sets in.<br/><br/>The most jarring realization is that Toy Story 3 is set in real-time. It's not the animated character that remains ageless. Andy has grown up with us, and like us, has become an adult as well. He's even voiced by his (also grown) original voice actor, and it puts it even more into perspective.<br/><br/>But toys don't age. Sure, Woody, Buzz and the gang have a few paint scuffs here and there, but they remain true to themselves. But times have changed. Andy's toy room is paired down to the surviving ""favorites"" who made the cut past the garage sales or getting lost or broken. Some old friends are gone and briefly twinge sadly upon the character's memories when the names are said, but there's something more. All they want is to be played with and simply feel their human friend's touch after years of neglect.<br/><br/>If Toy Story 3 sounds like a depressing film, it isn't. There are some wonderful characters. The old toys are still as vibrant and funny as ever, the new toys (such as a fabulously metrosexual Ken doll and a creepy cymbal monkey) are hilarious new additions to the cast, and as bitter as a stuffed bear can be for an enemy, there's a real level of sympathy for what made him the way he is.<br/><br/>And that's the thing about Toy Story 3. It's a love story. And a coming of age story. And a story about the fears of losing someone, or being rejected or abandoned, and the need to be useful and loved by someone. And it's a story about friends sticking together, because in this world, that's all they have.<br/><br/>The beginning aspect of the story is standard for Toy Story 3 is a familiar ""The toys get separated from Andy and must find their way home"" story, but it's the journey there that's different, and of all the characters, Woody has matured the most.<br/><br/>Gone is the spoiled, jealous ""favorite"" who retains a conscience, and later loses sight of his priorities and duties to be there for Andy. He's older, and wiser. He understands that he not only has to be there for his human friend, but his toy friends as well.<br/><br/>Buzz is no different. From delusional hero to realizing what he is, becoming comfortable with that, and providing his unwavering support, Buzz shows a new side as well. He's certainly funny, and hits his prime in this film, but he's content in what he is, and finally loosens up.<br/><br/>From potatoes to piggy banks to dinosaurs and restaurant squeak toys, the gang has seen a lot together, and in the final act, in easily their worst predicament yet, it struck me how ""real"" they had become. Like Andy, these toys were friends that I grew up with over the last 15 years. It's a powerful testament to Pixar that these little toys had dreams and deep emotions, and unwavering loyalty. Of course, you know nothing bad is going to happen to them, but the sincerity of one shared moment in the garbage dump was an amazing testament to a very pure moment of love and loyalty, and proving that how you live your life is just as important as how you prepare for your end. A day later, I still find myself pondering the implications of what I've taken from this film.<br/><br/>Again, this film is not a ""downer"" movie by any means. The ending is earned and well-deserved. Like the rest of the film, it's bittersweet and very ""real"", and I found myself simultaneously smiling and choking up with its resolution, and a yearning for my own stuffed and plastic friends long gone.<br/><br/>Pixar has again broken the mold with a brand of storytelling that can reach out to children and the child still in adults. Other films could learn a lot about Pixar's philosophy, animated or otherwise, and tell a story that comes from the heart, and not designed to promote a website or soda.<br/><br/>It doesn't get much better than this. Especially these days."
"cinemastupid","10","2","4","19 June 2010"," Toy Story 3: The Completion of My Childhood.
","I wasn't born when Toy Story came out back in 1995. I didn't have the pleasure to go see it in theaters and experience it truly. I was barely two when Toy Story 2 hit cinemas. I wasn't taken to that film. However, because I was born in 1997, I did have the advantage of VCR's. I remember the old tapes of Toy Story and Toy Story 2. Those were some of my favorite films. In fact, those were the only few films I actually enjoyed, or even saw. These films were an important part of my childhood.<br/><br/>Now, I had Toy Story everything. I had Woody dolls. I had Buzz dolls. I had Mr. Potato Heads, Rex's, Slinky Dogs, Hamms, Jesses, you name it. I had a Toy Story backpack at one point, I believe. I had talking interactive Jesse and Woody dolls. I even had a copy of the god awful Buzz Light Year of Star Command: The Adventure Begins. I even ate the cereal and watched the cartoon, which I hated also. Toy Story was my life. 'Twas the ""good old' pop in the tape and shut the hell up"" scenario. Not that my parents made me shut up, I just did it as if the films took the breath right out of me. I expected a Toy Story 3 sometime soon in the future. I waited so long. So very long...<br/><br/>About a year ago, I saw the trailer. Sure it was the teaser, but it kept me eager. I maturely thought I should see it, for nostalgia purposes. I secretly could not wait. While I waited, I heard the original Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were being converted into Disney Digital 3-D. Not being too excited for the 3-D, I went to the closest IMAX theater. (An Hour Drive Away).<br/><br/>While I was watching the reissues, which were conveniently shown as a double-feature, I saw an official, 3-D trailer for Toy Story 3. Again, I felt hyped. But for now, let me tell you about the actual experience, seeing these movies on the big screen for the first time. The theater was packed with little kids. Really little kids. So little, when the original began, the famous opening with Andy playing, the image of Mr. Potato Head made a girl scream. Real loud. And she cried. The oldest person there that wasn't a parent or a guardian was some 9 year old. Oh, well.<br/><br/>Well, today I saw Toy Story 3. Was it good? No. Was it great? No. Was it the best film of 2010? Yes. Was it one of the greatest motion pictures of all time? Yes. Was it one of the best films I've seen in a theater? Yes. Is it up there in the top ten best films of all time? Yes. Very much so.<br/><br/>I went to the theater about three hours ago. Almost everybody there was either a really little kid, a parent/grandparent, or a high school/ college student. There was a couple about in college, romancing it up while watching the film. And also rudely playing around with their cell phones during the film. There was a family behind me with a young girl. But I think all of this enhanced the experience.<br/><br/>The film started out as pretty much the opening for Toy Story, just with some of the cast of Toy Story 2. Only this is what you would have saw if you were Andy. It turns out to be a home movie, but anyways, this opening made my cheeks ache, for my smile was incredibly wide. I really, really got pepped.<br/><br/>Now, Andy is going to college, just like many people who grew up with these films. The older audience really related to him. I felt slightly like them. Because of this, there is a mix up, and instead of going to the attic, the main cast of toys and a Barbie doll gets accidentally sent to a day care center, called Sunny Side. Woody tags along, instead of going to college with Andy. This place is paradise, it's ran by old timer, veteran toy Lotso Huggin' Bear. Lotso introduces Barbie to Ken, who I honestly thought was kind of on the Smithers side, if you catch my drift.<br/><br/>Lotso isn't the nicest bear. In fact, he's the main villain. He's an eight ounce pile of strawberry scented evil. Another new character was Bonnie, who was like a younger, female version of Andy. She has similar adventures with toys compared to Andy. You learn more about Lotso's past, through another toy, Chuckles. My memory is kind of blank because of pure excitement, but the next paragraph will be my most important, and major spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>The toys escape, and along with Lotso, are taken to the Tri-County land fill. They are in the compacter, and what not, and are to be incinerated. There is much action in this scene, however, it is painful to watch for me. No bad jokes, just Buzz and Jesse hold hands. Hamm and Rex hold hands. Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head hold hands, until everyone is. They have been through a lot with each other, and so has the audience with them. They were to go, they were doomed, but they were to be doomed eternally, together. This really, really had me, well, crying hard on the inside. I held it in because I am a male. Any ways, something similar made me feel that way, when Andy gives the toys to Bonnie, and they were also together, for a very long time. Never before have I felt so much closure. To make another movie would be a travesty, the series is over, no matter what. The toys will be together, forever. The End, as I regret to say this, but good bye, Toy Story franchise, you are now complete, and so is my childhood."
"RCWjr","10","2","4","19 June 2010"," Toy Story saga given a fitting end
","The rule of thumb has been the 3rd film of any franchise ends up bloated and overall, lacking the magic of the first two films. Not this time. As Disney/Pixar have proved time and again, Toy Story 3 doesn't suffer from bloat nor does it lack the magic. It is as fun, magical and heartfelt as the previous films.<br/><br/>It would have seemed with Toy Story 2, the saga was completed. However, there was the overriding sense that there was one more story to tell. What happened when Andy eventually moved on. That is the crux of Toy Story 3; moving on.<br/><br/>Our favorite toys start out looking like they will end up in the attic, but through the course of events, they end up going to a day-care. All would seem to be great, but as always is the case, looks are deceiving.<br/><br/>We end up being introduced to some new characters. One of the biggest voice talent surprises is Michael Keaton as Ken. Keaton is fantastic and a big surprise. Ned Beaty is also wonderful in the role of Lotso. These two add considerably to the goings on. Hanks, Allen, Cusak, Rickles, Ratzenberg and company once again deliver fantastic character work. <br/><br/>This film has plenty of what made the first two films some of the most beloved animated stories ever. Toy Story 3 adds a golden feather to the cap of the series and proves once again, Disney/Pixar are fantastic story tellers."
"cheryllynecox-1","10","2","4","19 June 2010"," Smart Barbie and Beyond
","While I think I've been ripped-off recently with other 3-D experiences, (Alice in Wonderland especially), I knew that Pixar Studios wouldn't disappoint. Preceded by an absolutely charming confection, I was perfectly primed for the epic adventures of Buzz, Woody, and company. Andy is finally leaving home for the next phase of his life--one that won't include his plastic posse. His edited toys, sans Woody at first, are joined by Molly's Barbie for a trip to a strange new land. Part prison movie, part disaster film, the outrageous stakes have rarely been higher, and each act supported a clearly delineated narrative.<br/><br/>Other new characters include the creepiest doll since Chuckie, a strawberry scented purple bear whose southern graciousness conceals a machiavellian desire for power and control. Ken, another iconic character, is as much of a surprise as the scary mechanical monkey is delightfully disturbing.<br/><br/>I adored this elegant final chapter in the Toy Story Trilogy, and think some of the tears I shamelessly shed reflected the bittersweet feelings I have about most farewells. Never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, no."
"papadodgio","10","2","4","19 June 2010"," Toy Story 3 is Pixar's best movie to date!
","Toy Story 3 was my most anticipated movie of the year. I have loved Toy Story since its original release. Toy Story 3 surpasses all of my expectations and stays true to what makes these movies great, they make you feel like a kid again. This movie is considerably darker than the previous two but not in a bad way. The whole movie put you on an emotional roller-coaster filled with laughter and tears. Some scenes are genuinely intense and might frighten younger children. When watching this movie you can tell that it was written for an older audience but kids will definitely enjoy it too.<br/><br/>I won't talk about the story because most people know what this movie is about, but the trailer doesn't give anything away. There are plenty of surprises in Toy Story 3. It has been 11 years since we've seen a new Toy Story and Pixar has created a movie that feels like we haven't been without these characters for this long, the viewer still cares about these characters and what happens to them throughout the story. I'd say that this movie has the best storyline out of the trilogy and has a story that will always be relevant.<br/><br/>The animation is incredible. Pixar always pays careful attention to detail and it definitely shows in this movie. All of the animation moves flawlessly and how you would think these toys would move in real life.<br/><br/>The humor, as in every Pixar movie, is enjoyable for both kids and adults. There are jokes that kids will laugh at and subtle jokes that adults will understand but told in a way that kids will still laugh. In my opinion, this is the funniest Toy Story to date.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing Toy Story 3 as soon as you can. This is by far my favorite movie of the year and maybe even of the last couple of years. It will be tough for any movie this year to be better than Toy Story 3. 10/10"
"allymarie94","10","2","4","18 June 2010"," Maybe I'm a bit biased but...
","this was the best movie i've seen in a long time. I'm sixteen and have been waiting for this film for quite some time, so i had high expectations(woody and buzz pretty much raised me), and let me say that it exceeded them. Disney has not done well with sequels in the past, but the toy story movies keep getting better! Both the kids and the adults in the movie were laughing and(at some points) almost being brought to tears. The movie contained plenty of plot twists and surprises that it keeps you on the edge of your seat while making you feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. There's plenty of ""adult"" humour sprinkled throughout, so no one in the theater was bored. the only problem is that there were so many small children running about, it was hard to concentrate(but i did pay to see a children's movie). this film is great for all ages and maturity levels!"
"khalifshirad","10","2","4","18 June 2010"," An amazing movie... One of the best Toy Story series
","I don't know why i cried at the end of the movie. It's such an amazing movie. This is the best toy story series EVER!!! You'll be LOL while you watch this movie. It's about Andy 17 years old going to college not playing with his toys again and went to donate it to daycare (well, you'll be surprised when you watch this movie). They was miserable. OK, you'll know the rest when you watch this movie. The movie's storyline was great. Nothing was cheesy. If you want to watch with your family for a summer fun, watch it. Your kids will love it. If you want to watch it with more special effect, watch it in 3-D. i'll give it 10/10. Very recommended for all ages!!!"
"TheDeadMayTasteBad","10","2","4","18 June 2010"," It doesn't matter if you're young or ""old;"" whether you grew up with the films or are new to them; Toy Story 3 is movie magic at its finest and a winner across the board.
","I must first ask my fellow IMDb'ers to excuse my abundance of sentimentality in this review, but as a twenty-something child whom has just returned from seeing this film, many emotions are coming to the surface.<br/><br/>Like many whom probably rushed out to see Toy Story 3 on opening weekend, I grew up with the first two films. Toy Story came out during the perfect time in my life, while my connection with my own toys was at its most personal and passionate. The film touched me then in a way that not many animated films have since, or at least until Toy Story 2 came along in 1999 and warmed my heart once again. Now I'm 11 years older and have grown somewhat, physically and mentally, over that time.<br/><br/>Despite Pixar's consistency to outshine any other studio in the animation department, I still found myself doubtful as to whether or not Toy Story 3 would appeal to me now the same way the first two films did when I was younger. I clicked ""Like"" to ""Move out of the way children I've been waiting 11 years to see Toy Story 3"" on Facebook, but I still wondered whether I would be moved. Yet once I found myself in a packed theater with some strangers and some of my best friends whom I've grown up with over the course of my childhood, I couldn't help but transport back to that same kid I was in 1995.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is movie magic at its finest. Unlike many animated sequels that come out today (I'm looking at you, Shrek), this third chapter retains all of the charm and intellect from the previous films without ever coming off as cheesy or cheap. Almost all of the characters from the previous films return and although Jim Varney sadly isn't filling Slinky Dog's shoes anymore, Blake Clark does a great job of bringing the character back in a way that would make Varney proud.<br/><br/>Pixar has stated before that they don't make sequels to their films unless they have a story that is on par with their predecessors and that's proved through Toy Story 3. There are moments in the film that will make you laugh, smile, cheer, and (yes) even tear up. It doesn't matter if you're young or ""old;"" whether you grew up with the films or are new to them; Toy Story 3 is a winner across the board.<br/><br/>Pixar has certainly done it again, against all odds. If the past decade has been any indication, they'll only continue to captivate us with their cinematic magic. To infinity and beyond!

","I have many subjects to go on about this movie....But I would love to shorten them out a little. As for a 19, I still love the previous two that were released 11-15 years ago. I grew up on them, and I didn't think they were going to make a third. My dreams came true as this movie was released. Pixar absolutely knows how to touch our hearts with their movies. And that's what Toy Story 3 did. It's humorous, suspenseful, and emotional. Not to mention the Nostalgic Music they still kept from the previous two movies. This goes to show that movies don't need to be vulgar, and gory to be epic as this movie was. I don't want to spoil the movie (I won't) So, I'll just say this movie topped my favorite Disney's Pixar Studio movie list. EVERYONE should love this movie. There is nothing bad about it. It is kid friendly, AND adult friendly. Really worth the money you pay. I enjoyed this movie to the max.<br/><br/>10/10"
"silly_willyizzy22","10","2","4","18 June 2010"," I've waited 11 years.
","I cannot say how truly excited I was to see this movie. I grew up watching Toy Story over and over and over again. I watched them back to back on Disney Channel (no matter how much I dislike that channel) and was sitting in my childhood again.<br/><br/>That being said, I loved TS3. I keep hearing how it isn't for little children, and it really isn't. They haven't seen the first two. They wouldn't understand. And Pixar was smart to add in some darker stuff, because a lot of teenagers are going to see this. They grew up on it, just as I did. I found myself angry when a baby started to cry in the theater. Just because it's Toy Story 3, doesn't mean it's for the littluns.<br/><br/>I think that, as far as series goes, Toy Story hasn't failed me yet and Toy Story 3 had me in tears at how wonderful it was. The ending made me as happy as could be, and now I want to sit with all of my stuff animals from my childhood and play with them as I used to. It might be odd, as I'm 16 now.<br/><br/>All in all, Toy Story 3 was wonderful. Just what I expected."
"TOMNEL","10","2","4","18 June 2010"," Just as good as the other two Toy Story films, and that's saying a lot!
","Since Pixar made the first Toy Story film in 1995, they have been consistently making beautiful and deep animated pictures, but in the last three or so years, they've really hit their stride. They've gotten down the emotion and the humor better than ever and Toy Story 3 just shows how brilliant the team at Pixar is, and how they've learned from their very few mistakes. Really a brilliant film company, and a lovely animated feature.<br/><br/>Andy is now seventeen, and the toys are being neglected. In order to still be loved, all of them but Woody decide to be donated to day care. Woody escapes and ends up in a little girl's room, while the rest of the gang is tormented by the horrors of daycare and the scrutiny of the very evil ruler, Lotso Bear. A crime prison flick ensues.<br/><br/>This movie, more so than any other Pixar film, jumps from genre to genre so flawlessly, and humorously. Drama, to comedy, to horror, and for a large chunk it was a prison escape film, and it was just as gripping and suspenseful as any live action prison escape film I've seen. Along with amusing dialogue and a captivating plot, the seamless genre jumping that Pixar knows how to work with makes their films never boring. And this film is really good at playing on every emotion. When it wants to be funny, it's funny, when it wants to be action packed and suspenseful, it is. The drama is on high too when it wants to be, and though this may not be as tear inducing as Pixar's last two outings, it'll choke you up all the same.<br/><br/>The direction on this thing is fantastic. Each shot seems to be so expertly laid out, and depending on what the shot is, the scene is played a different way. Obviously this is true with any competent film, but it's noticeable here. To go with the direction, the animation is fantastic and the 3-D, which normally just adds a level of gimmickry, instead makes the animation all the more vibrant and the danger in the film all the more real seeming.<br/><br/>Climaxes are always a difficult aspect of the film, because some people will feel it's too light a climax, some might feel the characters were never in any danger. This movie has a fantastic climax, where the danger feels as real as in any other film. The emotions are high, and the animation again makes this scene so beautiful, in both the surroundings and the character acting.<br/><br/>Overall, Pixar has yet again made a masterpiece. They are so experienced at playing on real emotions and making things sad without being hokey, along with being funny and pacing a film. This is one more notch on their belt of perfection, and yet another destined classic!<br/><br/>My rating: **** out of ****. 109 mins. Rated G."
"deathscythe_42","10","2","4","18 June 2010"," You've got a friend in Toy Story 3
","When Pixar released Toy Story in 1995, the first in the studio's remarkable line of superior animated movies, not to mention the first fully computer animated film to ever hit the silver screen, I was five years old. Roughly the same age as the film's character Andy, the fun-loving and imaginative owner of the toys we have all grown to love. Now, after a triumphant sequel and several other wonderful Pixar adventures, Andy is seventeen years old and on his way to college. I myself am now twenty, and heading towards my junior year of college. It suddenly struck me just how personal the Toy Story saga was to me when i was sitting in the theater watching Toy Story 3 this afternoon. Woody, Buzz, and all of their plastic pals have been with Andy for as long as he can remember, and I realized that they have been with me for as long as I can remember as well. Needless to say this movie needed that extra personal touch to really deliver, and let me tell you that it did not disappoint. It is clear that Woody, Buzz, and Andy mean just as much to the Pixar crew as they do to you and I, and while Pixar has had several other masterpieces, this one may just define the Toy Story Trilogy as their crowning achievement.<br/><br/>Like the first two films, Toy Story 3 pulls you into a world of pure imagination. The adventures these toys go on represent the fantasies of every five year old child. Ironically, it reminds us what it's truly like to be a kid again, even while the central conflict of the movie is the issue of growing up. And at the films core is a set of real life emotions and themes, touching strongly on the subjects of friendship, loyalty, and of course keeping that kid inside of you alive.<br/><br/>The script of the film is hilarious, filled with gut-busting scenes that may have you rolling on the floors with laughter. But of course, Pixar never lets its audiences slide through a movie without introducing an intense level of adversity, and this movie delivers a level of suspense and drama that any adult film fanatic should be able to appreciate. To top it all off, the ending of the movie brought me very near to tears.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this is the film to see this summer. It's hilarious, exciting, adventurous, suspenseful, imaginative, heart-warming, and above all it reminds us never to let our imaginations die. 10/10"

","Rarely has a movie so impressed me that its scenes are indelibly printed in my mind. Toy Story 3 is such an experience. The characters are so humane, kind and loving they touched me in a way I have only been a few times before. Of course, the visuals and animation are state of the art stunning, but without an ability to create people we love, the visuals mean nothing. Fortunately, Pixar and Bob Lasseter are truly gifted at such, and provide a heart-felt experience from beginning to end. And the entertainment quality. The opening sequence is nothing short of genius. Such imagination! Such a brilliant way to introduce the characters. Such visuals, colors and use of 3D. And the comedy. The humor in some scenes is so original I found myself laughing uncontrollably, along with the rest of the delighted audience. There is a scene of a Ken doll trying on different outfits for Barbie that is so hilarious it is worth the price of admission. I will never forget that scene! And the ending. Even though I am a middle aged man, I found my eyes tearing up, so moved was I by the character's actions, and the film maker's respect for the human spirit. It takes true genius to create animation with such heart, and when it does, it is that magical experience we all wish for when we go to the movies. This one has it in spades. 11/10."

Everyone knows that no sequel ever matches up to its predecessor, and that being said, I would like to say that while I enjoyed it more than Toy Story 2, it wasn't as good as Toy Story. But it was a very close call. I loved this movie. Even as a teen, I still felt for the toys. And while I must admit that Lotso the evil mastermind bear, the monkey security guard, the baby doll, and even the clown toy (I've always been afraid of clowns) scared me, but all Disney movies have to have a villain. I have to say, after a few people in the audience started to clap, I started clapping too. Soon the whole theater was erupting in cheer. It was then that I knew, and after wards when a lady behind me called her friend to tell her that she just HAD to see the movie, that Toy Story 3 would be a great hit and widely renowned. Roger Ebert, from the Chicago Sun Times, even gave the movie three stars, and I must say, he is a pretty hard critic to impress. Now while I love when he trashes movies (he's my go-to critic, normally, even though I don't live in Chicago, and when he trashes a movie it can be hilarious), I liked to see that this movie did well on his scale. Because I knew then also that it would be liked. And I think I was correct. Now let me bore you with the plot of this kid-attracting movie. Basically Andy is all grown up now, and he's going off to college. His mom (y'know, I never really liked her) guilted him into putting his old toys away in the attic. Except for Woody, who, lucky him, gets to go to college with Andy. But there's just one little problem. The toys, like most, I would expect, are selfish and just want to be loved and played with again, so after a close call with a trash truck, they decide to put themselves in a box of old toys up for donation at Sunnyside Day Care Center. Oh, if only they knew. Well, Sunnyside is run by the huggable bear Lotso, who turns out to be not-so-lovable, as we learn later on. Woody decides he belongs to Andy, and he won't desert him, so he leaves the toys at the day care. Oh, if only he knew, too. Now, I won't reveal the end to you, or the rest of plot. Of course, since this is a children's movie, and only rated PG, it has a happy ending. Since I'm not going to tell you, well, you'll just have to see it for yourself. And believe me, after wards, you'll be glad you took my advice and saw it. Trust me."
"ncoviell","10","2","4","18 June 2010"," To be a kid for one more day
","Everyone who is a member of Facebook knows about fan pages. Most fan pages are bullshit. Yet, there is one page that holds truths on so many different levels: ""move out of the way children, I've been waiting 11 years to see Toy Story 3."" Seriously, kids, we're not joking. Move. And if you don't move then at least do the impossible and shut up for an hour and 45 minutes. Honestly, that's how good Toy Story 3 is. You don't want to miss a single second.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3, coming 11 years after its predecessor Toy Story 2, picks up the story of Woody, Buzz, Jessie and co. around 5-7 years later. Times have changed for the toys as their beloved owner, Andy, has grown up and is soon going off to college. The toys believe their two options are either being thrown out or placed in the attic, but receive what at first seems to be a pleasant surprise when they're brought to a local daycare center and donated. Soon enough, the toys find out that the daycare center, Sunnyside, isn't as happy and peaceful as a place as it's made up to be. In a nutshell, the toys face vast uncertainties and struggle to find where their place now lies.<br/><br/>Anyone who even slightly knows about film can appreciate how difficult it is to create a masterpiece, never mind two. Yet, the staff over at Pixar seems to put them out left and right. Back in 1995, Toy Story became Pixar's first masterpiece. In 1999, Toy Story 2 became another and also one of the most well-received sequels of all-time. Fast forward to 2010, Pixar completes their trilogy masterpiece with the highly intelligent, sophisticated, energetic, emotional and fun Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>On the foundation of the most recent masterpiece are the earthly themes which give the story its life. Toy Story 3's plot may be simplistic, but its subject matter challenges the viewer to connect with the characters. The toy characters (and the human characters) are given complex problems that the audience cannot help but get sucked right into. Built on themes such as togetherness and learning when to let go, Toy Story 3 is properly rated, but at the same time offers a ridiculous amount of maturity that's injected right into the heart and minds of its characters. <br/><br/>The most impressive aspect of Toy Story 3, without a doubt, is its ability to pick up where it left off in terms of its plastic characters. Although each character is handled with delicacy, it's Woody who takes center stage with his near-human connection that he has with Andy. It is astounding how a simple animated film can produce such feeling of sheer love between a child (or young adult) and his toys. While Woody handles the brunt of the emotional load, Woody's supporting cast brings an enormous amount of life to the film and while it's obvious they've grown, they haven't changed. Audiences will also be treated to the introduction of several new characters, but none steal the show quite like Lotso, whose story is so complex and unnerving that it's hard to hold much resentment towards him and Ken, who, opposite of Barbie, more than fills the movie with humor.<br/><br/>Ultimately, those who have grown up and stuck with Toy Story throughout are bound to love it. Toy Story 3 keeps its base characters the same and more than pays homage to its original. The film is rich in human emotion and those who are around the same age as Andy will have a hard time not relating to his feelings. The movie is an emotional roller-coaster and its final 20 minutes alone could be another to give this masterpiece its fresh rating. The ending of childhood is a bittersweet experience, but it's a movie like Toy Story 3 that understands. It's a movie like Toy Story 3 that gives people like me, 20 years old and in college, an excuse to toss aside any troubles and feel like a kid again, even if it's for less than two hours."

Listening the song ''You've Got A Friend In Me'' again was beautiful, and saw Buzz in Spanish, i was laughing to death. The detail was amazing, i missed Betty on this movie, poor Woody that make me sad for him :( There was so many funny scenes, like when Ken & Barbie met or when the disastrous kids play with the toys or when Barbie make confess Ken to say hoy fix Buzz. Sad moments too: - Wheeze and the phone are gone, also Betty. - When Andy delivers Woody to the girl at the end. - When Andy goes to the university without Woody. Angry moments: - The Lotzo bear betrays Woody and friends, when he was saved (Damn it!) Good that at the end...

","I just got through watching Toy Story 3 and it is the greatest Pixar movie ever! Though the story was just like the other two films, the new characters such as Lotso, Big Baby, Ken, Buttercup, and Trixie make Toy Story 3 the sequel that it is. The ending almost made me cry because I knew that this was the last in the series since Andy departed off to college and Woody and the gang became fit with Bonnie's toys as a family. There is one thing I'll admit and it was the big baby-s face. In a way, it looked like a Chucky doll without hair. But that's the only thing I slightly didn't like about a character of the movie. Other than that, everything about Toy Story 3 is infinity and beyond with excellence and animation."

","I was 6 years old when the first Toy Story came out and I remember it so clearly because I automatically fell in love. The story, the characters, the dialogue, the animation, all had me enthralled. I was about 10 when Toy Story two came out, following many disappointing sequels from Disney. It surpassed any expectation I had, bringing a new adventure to my beloved characters and staying loyal to the original.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is just as loyal but still manages enough change and originality that you get sucked in once again, loving every minute. Now, at 20 years of age, I once again found myself caught up in the story of the characters I grew up with. It was crazy to be in the theater with all these young kids that didn't have quite the same sentimental value attached to the show. They loved it but the novelty of it wasn't there for them. Toy Story was the first of it's kind when I saw it and I found myself trying to keep from crying at a couple moments near the end not just because the movie itself was moving but because it was the end of something so great. And I don't tear up that easily :)<br/><br/>i thought it ended on the perfect bittersweet note. As the plot began to unfold, I was a bit worried that the ending would be hard to accept but with a short time left I realized that Pixar had figured out an ending that would satisfy anyone. In short, I loved it. There is nothing that disappointed me in any way.<br/><br/>Thanks for this wonderful trilogy Pixar!"
"cameron-679-209278","10","2","4","18 June 2010"," To be 9 again - Toy Story 3 Review.
","As a 24 year old I grew up with the Toy Story movies, and they had a big impact on my childhood. I remember going to burger king many times getting all the Toy Story toys. So when I went to see the new movie, needless to say I had extremely HIGH expectations.<br/><br/>The second the movie started, I didn't feel like there had been a 15 year gap between the movies. I felt right at home with all the toys again. It feels like the same movies that I grew up with, with some graphical improvements. All the old characters we know and love make a comeback, as well as some new ones, which feel like they were part of the story all along. Pixar did an absolutely brilliant job giving toys emotion. I found myself falling in love with all the old, and even some new characters all over again.<br/><br/>The actual story line is brilliant. If it took 15 years to think up this perfect story line than it was well worth the wait. As I said my expectations were extremely high going into this movie, and they were surpassed and then some. Even though I am a grown up now, the movie took me back to an age of innocence and an let me be my 9 year old self for just a moment which is a truly magical feeling. Pixar is brilliant at creating a story line that both adults and children will love. They still sneak in moments that only adults will understand. My favorite example of this is a Cool Hand Luke reference. I won't say exactly what happens so as not to spoil anything, but someone intimates the warden perfectly. I found myself a couple of moments in the movie holding back tears to the point where my throat starts hurting. I just had to keep telling myself ""I'm not going to be the guy that cries at a Toy Story movie."" Lets take a moment to talk about the animation. In an article in Wired magazine, the creators of Toy Story 3 said each frame takes anywhere from 6-12 hours to render depending on the complexity of the scene. There are 60 frames in every second so lets do some quick math. It takes about 540 hours of rendering to produce one second of this movie. 32,400 hours to produce a minute. If you keep going and figure out how many hours the entire movie took, well you get a really really big number. The result is toys with more human characteristics, realistic looking fur, scenes with so much attention to detail you could watch the scene 100 times and still look at something new each time.<br/><br/>The 3D effects weren't mind blowing or revolutionary. But hey this is a cartoon, and what better way to experience this movie than in 3D. There aren't any gimmicky moments (thank god). The best use of 3D was actually during the short before the movie called Night and Day. This short will just blow your mind I promise. But back to Toy Story 3there were some scenes that I can't talk about that really showed the capability of 3D and made you feel like you were right there with the toys.<br/><br/>Is the movie worth the money? Yes. Is it as good as the old movies? It's better.<br/><br/>You will laugh, you will cry, you will get an overwhelming scenes of nostalgia. Pixar knows how to bring an end to an epicly huge Trilogy. Thank you for the memories and the experience Pixar!"

","I'm nineteen and I wasn't as enthusiastic about going to see this as I was when I was eight years old.<br/><br/>I entered the theatre; the lights went out, the movie began, and after the first twenty seconds I was a child again. The laughter came often and natural. The story was even better then the previous two combined.<br/><br/>I went to go see this with my seven year old nephew and if I laughed that much when I was his age I know I had a good childhood.

I'm sure if you shut off your emotions you could see a fault of two but when it comes to an animated trilogy this is by far the most enjoyable time you can spend in a theatre...

"krational66","7","0","0","26 April 2020"," Goodbye, toys.
","It is a sad story. Even if it is dotted with a variety of laugh points, a variety of childhood joy scenes and ""everyone together"" warm scenes, and even ""prison break"" such a comic heavy play, but also can not hide the trace of melancholy breath. Like a glass of red wine to add more sugar, aftertaste also have astringency, never become grape juice. Sadness was the troubled look before Andy drove away, sadness was the lonely expression when he looked into the distance on the steps of the new owner's house in the evening on Woody, sadness changed after the passing of time, sadness was lost, forgotten, replaced and forgotten that everyone had experienced.<br/><br/>
Maybe it is a little conceited, but I do think that the person who can fully understand the feelings conveyed by Toy Story 3 is not a child who is still ignorant, nor an adult who has already had an accident. It is a person like me who is clinging to the tail of youth. A nearly complete capacity for feeling and thinking, but ignorant of this society, at most a vague impression, like a glimpse of the leopard to see a spot; Start thinking about your future, but occasionally get sentimental.<br/><br/>
When Toy Story 3 began to show the darkness behind the initial politeness and kindness of the sunny kindergarten, I was really surprised and depressed. Is it necessary? I want to. Animation is the animation after all, it's necessary in I spent a few bucks for a dream in the theater when a told me: ""see ~ over the years, waiting for you to leave home and school, enter the society, is faced with such a situation, blending a group of early earlier than your qualifications, you are a new person waiting to do the most bitter and tired of living, waiting to be bullied, intentionally or unintentionally wait even in the face of psychopathic Boss""?
The children are indifferent and have no idea; Grown-ups, laugh it off. It's normal.
Fortunately, the main characters soon start to rebel against the established system, and there is even a scene in which the pros and cons argue about the system even across the dustbin, with phrases like ""harmony"", ""stability"" and ""the system should not be built on violence"". Even if it's just a slap in the face of reality, and even if Pixar's intentions for the awards are stark, I'm still thrilled that Toy Story 3 has a scene like this. It does at least a lot of things that Chinese films can't.<br/><br/>Speaking of the villain, the reason why the big bear became the villain of that paragraph, let me not quite moved. I even think it is the most beautiful part of the film, from the warm sunshine at the beginning to the despair of the cold wind and lightning, there is a kind of decisive dramatic beauty.
Feeling abandoned, displaced, unloved, and doubting their worth -- this is the path that most of the toys in Toy Story 3 take, and the bear is just the most extreme. In fact, many people have experienced such a period, at least I have experienced it, and still remember the pain. It's because I understand the sadness and despair of being abandoned that I resent the writers for ruining bear's last chance at redemption. It also occurred to me that some people who went to extremes a long time ago, maybe if someone helped them, now it would be a different situation. Kids don't understand this feeling, because they haven't experienced it yet, so maybe they just think of the bear as a bad guy.<br/><br/>The emotional surge begins with the incinerator scene, ""death together,"" and ends with the film sobbing several times. As a child, I did not experience much friendship, I really envy those toys, never give up, life and death. When Andy finally left after cleaning up his room, all his feelings of departure before he left for college came flooding back to him. As Woody stared at Andy's childhood photo with him and buzz lightyear, my off-screen self and he had mixed feelings. About those memories of childhood, has become a fragment, left behind, just that lingering feeling of sadness. Andy finally gave the toys to the little girl in the neighborhood, which seemed like a perfect inheritance. Andy grew up and didn't need the toys anymore; And the toys in the little girl, but also someone to play with, someone to love, a happy life.
However, from time to time Woody would stare in the direction Andy was driving away.<br/><br/>Some people, some things, can not say where good, but always how can not replace.<br/><br/>
However, the movie will eventually end, the dream will wake up, whether we want to or not, we still have to grow up, or grow old.
1995-2010: Toy Story's 15-year saga begins to end. Fifteen years ago, I was playing with my favorite toys just like Andy. Fifteen years later, I watched Andy say goodbye to his good friends, say goodbye to the old days, and step into a new life. In my good friends do not know where the situation, can borrow the story of others to relive the old dream, is not not a happy thing.<br/><br/>Goodbye, old days.
Goodbye, toys."

","Toy Story 3 picks up 11 years after its predecessor Toy Story 2 from 1999 and 15 years after the original Toy Story film, and as a result of this over a decade long gap between these two films, the human characters that we saw in the previous films are also older.<br/><br/>So the plot revolves around Andy's time with the toys he once cherished and loved as a little boy ending as a result of him being 17 years old and leaving his mother's house to go to college. Woody, Buzz, Jessie and the rest of the original gang (there's not that much of them left) are uncertain about what Andy will do with them until a miscommunication between him and his mother results in them getting accidentally thrown out and donated to a day care center. Then the rest of the film is pretty much another mission to figure out a way to get out of there and get back home to Andy before it's too late.<br/><br/>This is also jam packed with a lot of funny moments : Barbie and Ken flirting with each other, Buzz Lightyear reverting to being a Space Ranger again and then gets stuck in Spanish mode, the kids at the day care torturing the toys and you also have Buzz dancing around Jessie while in his Spanish mode etc.<br/><br/>Of course the darker moments include obviously the day care center being turned into a prison ruled by the evil pink teddy bear who is the villain of the film, the garbage dump scenes and the part that everyone talks about : The incinerator scene.<br/><br/>Along the way we get introduced to a girl named Bonnie who ends up replacing Andy as the new owner of his toys so that was a great way to end the series (or so I thought).

","As we grew up, toys gradually left our lives, leaving our homes, and time was spent learning, not having time to play with toys. I'm very happy that toys can have new owners, treat them well and cherish their owners. Andy is really a good host. It's a waste to put it in the attic, let Bonnie help take care of them. There are new friends. Sunshine kindergarten is not sunny at all, and children do not know how to cherish toys and destroy them. The pink bear didn't expect to be so obsessed, the hatred was too deep, people saved you, but you avenged the hatred and deserved it. When it was clear that the button could be pressed but not pressed, I was really disappointed and disheartened. It vented its dissatisfaction with its owner on other toys, engaged in unfair class rule, and cheated on the doll. It is too selfish to let other toys go back, and it is difficult to imagine how much hardship they have experienced before returning home, only to find that the owner has found a new toy. The prison break of Sunshine Kindergarten is very exciting, and the seemingly beautiful places are also oppressive and dark. The period of changing clothes between Barbie and the male doll is very interesting. It reminds me that I particularly like to change clothes for the baby when I was young. The life and death of the junkyard, the three alien dolls are awesome, Buzz Lightyear matches Tracy as well, and Spanish Buzz is also interesting. Woody is smart and open-minded. When everyone was holding hands together to face the fire, they felt particularly tragic and not so afraid. This is the power of group unity. The friendship between toys is much deeper than I thought. I really hope that each of my toys is conscious and can choose its own owner or life. I have n't played with toys for a long time. At most, I hugged the dolls by the bed. My childhood is farther and farther away from me. My childlike hope is still there. I use children's imagination to give toys special meaning."

We all know another kid would get bored or outgrow the toys so here is how I think it should have ended personally.<br/><br/>After Lotso's reign, the toys all decided to work together and tag in and out of play in the daycare. So I would have liked to see the toys go back to daycare for the enjoyment of other children and to be played with. Granted after watching Toy Story 4, I understand that for whatever reason, Woody's conquest became finding Bo Peep (Bo) and taking care of a resembled suicidal toy. I feel that there could have been a way that Woody would be off in the world and found Bo and went onto his happily ever after OR ended with Woody and Buzz as the best friends they are. I know Bo was never Andy's toy but nonetheless he still played with her. I could just have seen this franchise taking a different story line rather than trying to resolve the issues with a new kid and then later creating a new movie that ends with Woody leaving his friends with another kid all to endure the same heartbreak yet again. I am sure there are loops I am missing about why the direction was taken the way it was but Toy Story 4 makes me more upset about Toy Story 3 and I loved that movie."

","Review:
'Toy Story 3' is a computer-animated comedy film directed by Lee Unkrich. It is the third installment in Pixar's 'Toy Story' series.
Pretending that 'Toy Story 4' doesn't exist for a moment, this series could have gone down in history as one of the best Trilogies of all-time. I've seen 'Toy Story 4', it's good and will post a review for that movie in the future, but this movie is special to me.
The plot focuses on Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), and Andy's other remaining toys accidentally being donated to a day care center, while Andy, now 17 years old, is preparing to leave for college, and their ensuing race to get home before Andy leaves.
After 10 years of not seeing or hearing from these characters we all know and love, the actors portraying these characters don't miss a beat lending their voices brilliantly to bring them back to life. Ned Beatty and Michael Keaton were great addition to the already loveable cast and seemed welcomed.
This is an amazing film, and a would have been fitting end to a wonderful film series that started in 1995 with the first 'Toy Story'. The animation has come a long way from the original bringing the colors more to life.
Overall, there isn't anything I dislike about this movie. It's fun, funny and has heart all throughout. It shows us that things are meant to change and that's not always bad.
5/5"

","For the children born in the late 90s and early 00s, Pixar was what Disney had been for many of the earlier generations. A milestone of their childhood, a teacher of morals, one of their best friends even. A constant companion.<br/><br/>I was personally born in the late 80s. As such, I can only imagine what thse children must have felt like watching this film and realizing that even an almost literal representation of their childhood had to grow up at some point. In Toy Story 3, Andy is heading to college. He has very little time for his toys anymore, most of them having gone years without being played with. So, what's a toy to do in such a situation?<br/><br/>What amazes me the most about these three movies is how eerily similar they are on the surface level, but how different they feel. Because once again the toys get separated and find themselves in a strange environment. Once again they meet new toys with very different ideas about belonging to a child or getting played with. You could summarize all these movie with the exact same words, if you wanted. But they still talk about different subjects and they feel unique.<br/><br/>Case in point, Toy Story 3 talks to a much more mature audience than its two predecessors. Sure, you can still watch it as a five-year-old, but its primary message is clearly aimed at those who were five years old when the original Toy Story came out. It wonders what it is like to grow up and look back at your childhood. It wonders what relevance or meaning your earliest memories have on you when you're an adult.<br/><br/>And while it's doing that, we get a very good overall adventure, with great locations, fantastic animation, imaginative characters both heroes and villains alike, and some real tearjerker scenes. The ending, for example, which I personally find quite corny and unreal, but then again I wasn't a child when these movies came out. The ending cannot have the same impact on me.<br/><br/>A very good movie and it would have been a fitting ending to this particular saga. It turns out it wasn't the ending we thought it was, but then that's show business for you."

","Toy Story 3 was directed by Lee Unkrich, screenplay by Michael Arndt and starring the same cast from the previous 2 movies, alongside with Ned Beatty and Michael Keaton.<br/><br/>This time the toys are mistakenly delivered to a day-care center instead of the attic right before Andy leaves for college, and it's up to Woody to convince the other toys that they weren't abandoned and to return home.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is not only one of the best animated movies ever made, it's also one of the best movies ever made in general! I'm not surprised that it got nominated to the Best Motion Picture of the Year at the Oscars back in 2010!<br/><br/>This movie is absolutely a blast from start to finish, the minute the movie started and you feel invested. And the movie did pay off to every single one who had a slight anticipation for this movie, and it's of course the best of the franchise, including TS4! Actually, TS3 is my favorite Pixar movie so far, not only because of the beautiful animation or the blending comedy, it also has got heart in it, it's full of honest emotions mixed with a great adventure with our beloved characters!<br/><br/>It's very rare to find an animated franchise that works in that perfect way, actually the Toy Story franchise is my favorite animated franchise of all time, it just keeps getting better every time they release a new TS movie!<br/><br/>The animation is flawless, it's so eye-pleasure! The sense of humor is once again hilarious, works for kids and adults. I really don't need to talk about the characters or the actors, they are amazing once more! And all the new characters are so welcome, they all did a great job, and their actors also were fascinating, especially Michael Keaton as Kin.
The movie is so entertaining for all ages, I mean it has one of the best prison breaks ever made, and they are just toys in an animated movie, but you can feel something towards them, and that's an achievement actually, to make us care so much about toys! Thanks goes to the amazing casting choices, the amazing production, the perfect build up to the characters and of course to the amazing plot and the flawless screenplay!<br/><br/>The plot is so rich and full of great messages for ALL ages, literally! I watched it when I was 9, and I got some great values, and I watched it over and over again till I was 17, and I was impressed of how it touched me so deep, anyone could actually related to some of the decision that some characters made during the movie. The movie also has a perfect ending, with so much heart in it, I guess everyone cried so hard, myself included!<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 found a way to be an amazing movie, not only in its franchise or its genre, but in general, TS3 is definitely one of the best movies ever made, and credit goes to everyone who participated in that amazing movie!<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 of course gets an A+! If you haven't seen this movie before, or the whole franchise, do yourself a favor, and go watch them, they are really worth your time.<br/><br/>Thank you guys, for reading another review of mine, if you liked this, click on my name up above and see all my reviews, look forward to more reviews really soon.

","Toy Story 3 came out a decade after the second film, and was the Pixar sequel that many people wanted and it was a big success.<br/><br/>Andy, now grown up, is going to be moving to college. Woody is supposed to be going to college with him, and Buzz and the rest of the gang were supposed to end up in the attic, but instead wind up on the curb with the trash. Woody tags along with them and then they end up in a donation box and are now in a day care and meet a lot of new toys that are led by a teddy bear named Lotso (played by Ned Beatty). Woody escapes to get back to Andy but ends up being taken by a little girl, Bonnie, and he meets some of her toys at her house. The toys at the daycare are being tortured by the kids and want to leave, but Lotso and his crew have them imprisioned. Woody then finds out about the truth of Lotso, so now he needs to help rescue his friends and make it back to Andy's house before he leaves.<br/><br/>I felt this film was the perfect to wrap-up the Toy Story series. It had an emotional ending, and was great to see these characters for one last time. The animation was beautiful, the voice cast and their performances were astounding, the story was very well developed, pacing was great, and the film overall was perfectly flawless.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Toy Story 3 is a outstanding sequel and is close to being as great as the second Toy Story."

","Capping a trilogy 15 years after its first film is a daunting task. As the unchallenged master of animated films, Pixar successfully ends the franchise which started the line of 3-d animation.

"parrot007","9","0","0","7 July 2019"," Best in the Series
","This is a rare franchise where, to me, each sequel is better than the previous, except for TS4. This movie builds on the strong themes of 1 and 2, and also introduces some new ones that fit perfectly into this world and expand upon those same ideas. The way the Toys come to terms with Andy growing up, the class based governmental structure of sunnyside, the toys accepting their mortality at the dump, and their transition to a new owner at the end, spell themes of coping with rejection, acceptance, and hope, along with some light political themes with the Daycare. Lotso is a properly done villan who's behavior really sells the way he feels about what he and other toys are. It's difficult to design a villan character who the audience can dislike, but still understand in a way. The balance of new and old characters is perfect, something I can't say for TS4. I loved this adventure they went on and really felt the way it made these characters appreciate what they have. One of my favorite movies of all time in general, doing justice to it's predecessors and being outstanding by itself."

","Where Toy Story 2 relied on humor and characters, Toy Story 3 asks some deeper questions of loyalty and has a mix of dystopian ideas and an adventure escape. The big question of the movie is: to what extent should you be loyal to people of your past versus moving on and doing what's best for the individuals? In the end, Toy Story 3 falls somewhere in the middle, as the toys realize they should not have doubted Andy, but at the end Andy accepts that he's ready to move on and give them to a new owner who will love them. Along the way, we have a dark day care hierarchy and a fun heist-style escape from the center. Friendship wins out once again, and the ending both with all the garbage drama and with Andy giving Bonnie his toys was excellent. I'm not sure I enjoyed the plot quite as much as the previous movie, but the wonderful ending makes up for it and keeps Toy Story 3 fresh and right in line with the excellence the series has proven time and time and now time again."

Toy Story 3 makes for what may be Pixar's most adult film to date, that still caters towards children in the best comedic ways. Lotso is an unsettlingly cold bear controlling the daycare that Woody & gang get stuck at.

","'Toy Story 3 (2010)' doesn't necessarily have the humour of its predecessors, but it certainly has the heart. Once again, the film delivers a very strong central character arc and is dipped, from head to toe, in theme. It's this thematic resonance that really gives it its impact, even more so than in prior entries. There's not as much comedy, despite the odd chuckle, and things don't really get 'fun' until the flick dives into prison-break territory. Still, it's a satisfying story in and of itself, as well as being a pitch-perfect conclusion (yes, conclusion) to a fifteen-year-old franchise. It truly nails its ending, earning every drop of its audience's inevitable, bittersweet tears. Overall, the piece is entertaining, energetic and emotional. It's, essentially, as well a crafted an experience as Pixar has ever put together - even if the comeuppance given to its downright despicable villain is frustratingly tame. 9/10"

The movie has the theme of growing up in Andy and the movie's own release date. The movie's release happened more than ten years after the second movie. The movie definitely kept this in mind and crafted the themes this way. It contributes a lot to the enjoyment by adults. There are still lots of things for the younger audiences.<br/><br/>Ned Beatty plays Lotso the bear. This villain is played perfectly by the actor and directed wall. This villain does an awesome job being the tyrant of Sunnyside. The movie introduces the toys of Sunnyside incredibly well. The movie creates this new and dangerous world well.

","All Time animated film favorite It remembers everyone the time when they were kids too like Andy which we have been seeing grow for 3 movies and know he has grown up and left his toys behind, his best friends in life: Woody and Buzz, this film is incredible it may be the end of their adventure together but it has also a very good plot and a very good story with laughs, scary scenes, fun scenes but beyond that it shows how everyone grows up and the ending of this movie will leave you crying"

","The only Disney movie I cried in was Lion King. The other Disney film that came close was Pixar's WALL E. I did not cry during Toy Story 3. I went home walked into my room a realized that my Optimus Prime is not at the foot of my door, my Sylvester the Cat stuffed toy was not on my bed, and my McDonald's Sonic the Hedgehog toy was not on my shelf. My conner only housed my stack of video games. I asked myself why did my mother give away my toys without my permission? At THAT moment is when I thought about the last 30 minutes of Toy Story 3 I started to cry. This film was a carelessly thoughtful stoke of genius! It keeps both children and adults entertained. Lots of drama, lots suspense, and lots of toys! Disney and Pixar outdid themselves with this one. Toy Story was a smash hit when it first hit the screens. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, was not as good as its first installment but it was a film that almost never hit theaters so I'll give them the benefit of doubt. But Toy Story 3 set the bar ""to infinity and beyond!"" The VA cast was pheNOMenal. The visuals were stunning! The script was enjoyable! This movie reached all corners of film greatness (and its a kid's movie). I have no idea how Disney and Pixar knock out great movies like this (they make it look easy). I related to Andy in this film just as I did in Toy Story 3. The ending was so tough to watch without sniffling because if you watched Toy Story at around Andy's age during the time and you watch Toy Story 3 around Andy's age now (he was 17 and I am 22 and went through roughly the same hassle as he did when he was moving out for college), you would feel a wallop of emotion. Toy Story 3 is a MUST SEE. If you don't have children to take to go see this film then take friends who saw the first two films."

","This was one of the most emotional movies I have ever seen. As a fan of the franchise since around the time I was born, I wasn't expecting it to be so emotional! The scene with the incinerator when Lotso said ""Where's you're kid now, sheriff?"" hit me hard. I actually cried when Andy left. I was also left a bit confused. Will Andy take his toys back after college? Either way, this movie was awesome, and lived up to the other two Toy Story films. I can't wait for Toy Story 4!!!"
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","0","0","19 May 2019"," 8 times more beautiful than the original.
","According to Moore's Law, the computing power used to create this film is almost 8 times greater than in 1995 when ""Toy Story"" broke through and created the CGI full-length animated film category. Needless to say, ""Toy Story 3"" is 8 times more beautiful than its 90's predecessor.<br/><br/>Let's start off with the short that ran beforehand: brilliant. Fusing the worlds of CGI and classical animation has never looked so good or held so apt a message.<br/><br/>The opening sequence to ""Toy Story 3"" was mind bogglingly excellent. I was laughing the entire time because of the almost verbatim re-hash of a segment from the first movie. I also enjoyed the obvious nod to Miazaki's films with the inclusion of a stuffed Totoro, indicating the acceptance of anime as a form of animated art on par with many animated films today.<br/><br/>My only qualm with this film is that the plot and sub-plots were good, but a lot of the movie was spent in ""SWAT Ninja mode"", where the characters are running around doing very sneaky ""Great Escape"" type action. While looking cool, this has little substance. In fact, every time Woody would run, I couldn't resist laughing, because his running style is incredibly goofy (guess I just noticed it this time around).<br/><br/>Also, this film is considerably darker than its predecessors. This was especially evident when the toys seemed to have accepted their fate in the most dire situation they've ever been in. Plus, the prison motif tends to be dark, no mater how you package it (and that monkey was just freaky).<br/><br/>However, I think the fact that this franchise has been around for 15 years and that I have grown up with it really hit me square in the heartstrings at the conclusion. I was crying so much that I was literally on the edge of breaking down and openly sobbing. The collar of my T-shirt is still wet from the tears while I write this review. Within their last two or three movies, Pixar has really figured out how to get even the most stoic viewer to give in and cry a little.<br/><br/>The 3-D is still somewhat of a gimmick to me and I continue to have the ""focus"" issue with it, but the visuals still remain stunning. There's almost too much detail, there's so much of it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film brought some very good closure to the saga and is definitely a fine example why I will pay full price on a movie ticket to see a Pixar film."

"mitsubishizero","10","0","0","17 April 2019"," The greatest long awaited sequel made.
","Pixar's done it again! As someone who grew up watching both movies I wasn't disappointed like a lot of other people. I knew that it was going to be a great movie. Most of the actors reprise their roles with the exception of Jim Varney who passed away a decade before this movie was released and Annie Potts who's character is only seen briefly and mentioned. This's the movie we all wanted to see. It brings closure to the franchise (at least for now) and gives us a great payoff.<br/><br/>The story's about Woody and his friends trying to survive a daycare they accidentally get dropped off at instead of the attic due to Andy being grown up and preparing for college. As they arrive at the daycare they're greeted by the toys that live there who help them adjust to their new home. At first things start out well but after realizing how rough little kids are with toys they plan their escape after the leader of the toys Lotso (Ned Beatty) refuses their request to transfer to another classroom. As they try to make their way back to Andy they realize the daycare has a few skeletons in its closet than their new friends are willing to let on.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Woody gets separated by the group after he tries to leave the daycare first and has to reunite with them. Along the way he meets other toys such as Trixie(Kirsten Schaal), Peas-in-a-pod, Chatter Telephone(Terry Newman) and Chuckles(Bud Luckey) who help him reveal what really goes on behind the scenes. You've heard this story before but to be fair they put a twist. There's not much to say other than the characters and their chemistry's believable. When they get mad or happy it's understandable. They also play really well off each other in terms of jokes which's another thing:<br/><br/>The jokes are funny and as always with Pixar there's something for everyone. There's a scene where Mr. Potato Head mentions being imprisoned in the sandbox outside with nothing but ""lincoln logs"" The writing's clever yet heartfelt. There's a balance between light and dark scenes. When it needs to be quiet and sad it's quiet and sad, when it needs to be happy it's happy and it feels natural. The animation's much improved. The characters move much smoother and the people actually look like people instead of dolls like the previous 2 movies. There's not much to say about this movie at this point other than it's a great send off to the franchise. Fans won't be disappointed when they watch this movie and neither will you. When you get the chance see it for yourself."

","1 October 2010. This third installment has much the same (the nice but not quite what it seems scenario), a bit different, a quite funny lines, an intense climatic movement sequence, and perhaps one more emotional twist, coming of age, and the passing on of time and generations. While the story seems a bit thin by this time, there is enough new and fresh that keeps the story moving. Compared to a story like UP (2009) though there seems this still franchise seems to have stayed the same and the balance of comedy and drama doesn't quite have the impact that it once had while movies such as CORALINE (2009), UP (2009), WALL*E (2008) seems to have a more fleshed sense of both underlying depth that captures both young and old.

"TheMovieDiorama","9","0","0","24 February 2018"," Toy Story 3 proves that some acclaimed films deserve sequels.
","This. THIS. This is what I wanted, and boy...I got it. At first I was worried Pixar may have milked this series just for a quick cash grab, but they continue to surprise me. This really was magnificent. Woody and the gang are now stored away, no longer played with due to Andy now grown up and moving to college. They accidentally get donated to a local daycare centre which is ruled by a ""cute but not so cute"" huggable bear. So the toys try to escape and return to Andy. Now this film is a prime example why child-friendly animations can be just as entertaining and emotionally captivating for the mature audiences. Especially those like me who grew up with the previous 'Toy Story' films, and Pixar know this better than anyone else. There is an ever present underlying sense of nostalgia riddled throughout this animated feature. Rehashed quotes and catchphrases, flashbacks, call back humour and even visual Easter eggs. It's just a pleasure to watch really. It's a story about growing up, having to part with objects and memories that have accumulated a sense of sentimentality. Making the difficult choice to let go and move on. It's beautifully told, both in the script and animation. It's breathtakingly vibrant and highlights what this franchise has done, not just for Pixar, but for CGI animation it its entirety. The characters were full of life, the new additions were memorable enough albeit had very limited screen time unfortunately. The inner dynamics between the group of toys were fully expressed where both conflict and cooperation were explored. A few goofy scenes for younger audiences, like Buzz dancing the flamenco whilst in Spanish mode, to ensure laughter is had all round. One scene though...actually make it two, just poured pure emotion. When the toys are holding hands, and when Andy departs. It's so simple yet incredibly effective. It never ceases to amaze me, but 'Toy Story' may just be the best animated franchise of all time. Please Pixar, do not make anymore...you risk spoiling its legacy."

","Toy Story 3 has a lot of important characters to know. First, there is Andy who is a high school graduate. Andy is voiced by John Morris. The main characters in the film are Woody, a cowboy, voiced by Tom Hanks., Buzz Lightyear, a space action figure, voiced by Tim Allen, Lotso, a giant teddy bear, voiced by Ned Beatty, and Ken, a doll, voiced by Michael Keaton. Other minor characters include Mr. Potato Head who is voiced by Don Rickles, Jessie, a cowgirl, who is voiced by Joan Cusack, and Rex, a dinosaur, voiced by Wallace Shawn. <br/><br/>The movie, Toy Story 3, is about Andy and his toys. Andy, who is now a high school graduate getting ready to move on to his next chapter, college, is forced to clean out his room. While packing and separating his items, he places his toys in a trash bag meaning to place the toys up in the attic. While in the process of the transfer Andy gets a distraction from his little sister causing him to leave the toys laying by themselves. Andy's mom accidentally takes the toys away. The toys end up at a day care where they not only have to fight to return back to Andy but also to defeat Lotso the bear and his gang of other left behind toys. While Woody is on his own adventure he returns back to the gang to help save them from Lotso and helps returns the toys and himself back to Andy. <br/><br/>Overall the movie has a lot of emotions for an animated film. It brings in a theme of the difficulties it is to move on from things that meant the most to you at a time in your life. Throughout the movie we see the theme appearing in a few scenes. To point out a few, we see the theme first appearing when Andy is packing the toys up. The toys are worried and hurt when they realize they have been placed with trash. The theme reappears in the movie when the viewers realize why Lotso the bear is the way he is which is because he can't let go that his recent owner, Daisy, has left him behind and moved on without him. As a viewer we can relate to the toys due to the angles the director uses. Editors and other film members has created the film in such an angle that we can better relate being small with the toys and the urge to hide when humans are around. The director also does a fantastic job using motif to consistently bring up how these toys have been left behind from their owners so viewers can emotionally become attached to the story line. <br/><br/>Being a 22 year old college student I was able to really connect with this film. Not only did I grow up with the original Toy Story films but it felt realistic to me because not long ago did I have to clean out my room and decide what I wanted to do with all of my old belongings and toys. Great film, was really emotionally attached!"

","Just like virtually every child born in the 90's, I obviously saw the first two Toy Story, however I was never a ""hardcore"" fan of the movies, I always found it very cool, but it was not super fan, so much so that in 2010 when Toy Story came out, I at the height of my thirteenth year did not even want to know about watching the movie in theaters (I still had not learned to appreciate a good film work). 7 years later I finally saw Toy Story 3 and... GOSH! It's AMAZING!<br/><br/>The story can go from moments when you get really tense, to others extremely funny or super exciting! This is definitely one of Pixar's greatest assets, they have revolutionized animation films in such a way, and even today they are miles ahead of their competitors, with animations that still are made for children but may well be appreciated by all the ages.<br/><br/>The script of the film may at times be ""predictable"" (you know, they will not all die in the end), but still the story surprises you in many ways and in small points that at first seem only ""thrown"" in the plot that you really realize the genius of what they are doing.<br/><br/>Just to give an example, I'll list some of them:<br/><br/>(1) Woody being found by the little girl we initially saw in the nursery. <br/><br/>(2) Woody be taken to the little house and see the address of it. <br/><br/>(3) Woody just know that the daycare bear is bad because he went to her house. <br/><br/>(4) And when we finally think that little bow is no longer useful, Woody writes the little girl's determination on paper for Andy, so they are donated to her. ... <br/><br/>(5) And one more. Because she spent a night and played with him, she shows that she wants Woody, and only then does Andy accept giving he to her, without which Woody would eventually go to college with Andy and not stay with her friends at the end.<br/><br/>In addition to all this, especially for those who grew up watching the franchise's films, the end of the film is wonderful and sentimental, representing in a certain way the public itself, given the 15 years that separate ""Toy Story"" from ""Toy Story 3"", the audience of the first films grew up with Andy and it's even cooler to think that a child who was taken to the movies by his parents in 1995 can bring his own son in 2010! It's really amazing.<br/><br/>In summary, Toy Story 3 is a masterpiece of Pixar, closing with gold key this great trilogy of films. After seeing it, I even wanted to review the other two films, I have not seen it in a long time!<br/><br/>P.s: The Brazillian Soundtrack is AMAZING! (I didn't see the original)."

","Roll the last fifteen minutes of film. It became clearly obvious that the figurative tables have been turned, because a good number of the adults in the audience (including myself) were sniffling and teary-eyed, while the kids were looking up, likely thinking ""jeez mom and dad, they're just toys, get over it"".<br/><br/>Wasn't it conventional wisdom that just the kids get emotional over losing plastic playthings? With ""Toy Story 3"", Pixar has shown us one of the greatest magic tricks in modern showbiz history, likely not to be outdone or duplicated, that we all have very real and deep connections to our childhoods and to the things and people that allowed us as kids to be free, and innocent, and pure, and most importantly, to dream. This, to me, is a life lesson worth remembering, to infinity and beyond."

","It's been a while since I watched the other two Toy Story movies so I wasn't expecting much from this one. For the first hour I was thinking that the third instalment was a bit of let down but the last 45 minutes really make up for that.<br/><br/>The toys owner, Andy, is going to college and doesn't seem interested in his collection of toys anymore. Most of them end up in a daycare centre for wild kids but with some persuasion by Woody they decide the best thing is to make it back to their old house to be there for Andy is he ever needs them.<br/><br/>This is where the movie really gets going, with escapes, near misses and a really bad ""baddy"". The pace of the movie is frenetic at this point but this makes it all the more enjoyable.<br/><br/>There is a sentimental but satisfying ending that causes one to reflect on the importance of friendship.<br/><br/>As with the other movies the animation is superb.

The movie references a couple characters who have passed on in Toy Story and Toy Story 2, which made me smile at the fact that I could actually remember the characters from back then. Toy Story was my favorite childhood movie growing up, and watching the movie as a 14 year old boy in the theaters still made me feel like a little kid. I laughed, I cried, I smiled.

","The toys are mistakenly delivered to a day-care center instead of the attic right before Andy leaves for college, and it's up to Woody to convince the other toys that they weren't abandoned and to return home.<br/><br/>Toy story 1 has changed animation like never before. It inspires, it creates, and it makes us want more. It was a masterpiece of animation history. Toy story 2 changed us all. Throughout it's course, it touches our deepest place: our soul. And throughout these films itself, no one can doubt that they are cinematic-fantastic. Then, in 2010, comes along Toy Story 3. Yes, we may all become a little skeptical over this, almost knowing that nothing can touch what the other two have done. But after semi-low expectations, I can come out with a double-reassuring YES that Toy Story 3 succeeds in almost ALL levels possible. Everything has improved, from the animation all the way down to the acting. Also growing skeptical about being placed in a day care, things don't seem like they sound. Toy Story 3 is most possibly the most adult animated movie ever; fantastic! In fact, the movie slowly starts with a back flash, rolls into modern times, and takes us into the action with a assured attitude that we will not be disappointed. First off, Toy Story 3's message. Before describing the excessive points of acting and animation, Toy Story 3's message shines throughout. The last 15 minutes might bring tear to your eyes. How possibly can a movie do this to you, let alone an animation? It touches hidden adult themes, that of course every Pixar film will do. Aside, the animation has improved greatly, well of course! Released 11 years after the prequel, Toy Story 3 actually gives us more and more. I absolutely adore this movie. Then of course, we have the comedy. In my previous reviews of the previous movies, I never got into the humor. Pixar has very intelligent humor, not depending on toilet humor to make your kids satisfied. Note: Buzz's transformation into a French-speaking desperado, Mr. Potato Head's transformation into a cucumber, or even that hidden humor they love to slide in. Then we continue onto Toy Story 3's score. Although not groundbreaking, the score is very.. adventurous. I had to point this out because throughout, I found myself endured in this adventure with toys. It really is something... That about wraps it. Even hearing these rumors about ANOTHER Toy Story, I mustn't complain. The ending left me hungry for more Toy Story, and I am sure that Pixar could pull off another magical film like this. But if not, Toy Story 3 does make one hell of a finale for this trilogy. In fact, the Toy Story trilogy tops up there with the grand trilogies such as the Godfather. And while you may be laughing over there, find some piece of mind and watch this with an open mind. Then report back to me and tell me if you shed a tear ONCE. All in all, Toy Story 3 is fantastic. It's hard choosing between this or the second, but whatever it is, Toy Story is one of the best movie trilogies ever. 10/10."
"jwatetowahhigh","10","0","0","18 October 2011"," Best animated film of all time
","To avoid sounding as outlandish and over emotional as the title, Toy Story 3 is a masterpiece. I will leave it at that and explain why. All these years, kid's born and raised in the 1990's cherished Toy Story as sort of ""their"" movies (every generation has one), and in 2010 they were all grown up. Pixar couldn't have timed the release any better after making poignant classics like Finding Nemo and Up, so they decided to add another chapter to this great story where Andy is grown up and the nightmare from Part 2 comes true when he is headed off to college. This leads to another adventure, escape, and eventually a new life with a young girl, which was the most ideal ending for the series to answer Part 2's cliffhanger. I know that a lot of people who like the 1987 classic Brave Little Toaster dislike this film, but I can't really understand why except for the junkyard scene. Both scenes in both movies had their strengths, and despite no musical number, this one is probably more heart pumping. 10/10 Undoubtedly a classic and one of the greatest if not the greatest second sequel of all time."
"itamarscomix","9","0","0","23 September 2011"," A fantastic conclusion to the series
","Toy Story 2 felt like a half-hearted, though entertaining, rehash of the first; this third installment, coming 11 years after part 2 and 15 years after part 1, is anything but, and it's not only much better than the previous film but manages to regain the spark and novelty of the original, yet in a completely different way. Toy Story 3 is darker, more sober and more mature - the film and its motifs intentionally grew up with its viewers, just like Andy did, and for anyone in my age group - anyone who was a kid when the first film came out and is now in their 20's - it's very relevant and extremely effective, not to say that it's not also whimsical and hysterically funny. The animation too is some of the best Pixar created yet, and watching it back-to-back with the first two Toy Stories is really stunning in showing how much CGI had developed since its early days."

","The first Toy Story is my favorite animated movie of all time, the second Toy Story is a great film, and now, Toy Story 3 has come, and even though I still like the first movie more, this film is probably the most well made of the three.<br/><br/>Let's get the technical stuff out of the way. The animation is beautiful, easily some of the best I've ever seen. The voice acting is top notch, and the direction is great.<br/><br/>Now for the story, Andy has grown up and is heading off for college, due to a mishap, most of the toys end up in Sunny Side daycare, and Woody is taken home by a little girl from that same Daycare. As Woody tries to get home, he learns that Sunny Side is more like a prison, as it turns out the others are being played with a bunch of toddlers who have no idea how to play with them. Now Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang must escape Sunny Side and get back home before Andy leaves for college.<br/><br/>This movie made me cry, there I said it. This film came out at almost the perfect time. It came out right before I was going into my senior year of high school, so had they just waited one more year, it would've been even more perfect. But that didn't stop me from crying at the end of this movie. Basically everything that could go right with a movie, goes right here. There are a few flaws, such as a few jokes being less funny and more annoying, and yes, they actually do make a joke about crap.<br/><br/>Pixar has made a perfect trilogy, one that ranks up there with Back to the Future, and the original Star Wars trilogy. And is even better than Lord of the Rings, and the Star Wars prequels. Thank you Pixar, I haven't seen Cars 2, but even if that movie is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, I won't change my mind that you are the best animation company ever."

","A lot of animation movies have been coming out lately and none of them could even compare to this. I was a big fan of the first toy story growing up so watching this took me back and i really enjoyed it. The animation is just incredible as it should be sporting a wopping 200 million dollar budget. The acting is great and they story line is funny with quite a lot of touching moments as well.<br/><br/>This movie follows the main characters from the first one. Buzz Lightyear Woody, the potato heads, slinky and all. Woodys owner is getting older and going off to college so Woody and the toys begin to think he is going to give them away. But in a mix up they accidentally get sent to charity and their lives get turned upside down.<br/><br/>This movie is really good for people of all ages. The animation and acting will make you get right into the movie. The story is great and you will end the movie feeling touched."

","I was a little bit apprehensive before seeing this as the first two had such an impact on my childhood, I just didn't think that it could live up to my expectations. I would go as far to say that it is better than 1&2. I thought that the story-line was very good and it was very cleverly made. It is amazing the difference in animation compared to the first two. My only complaint would be that they had left it too long, as 1&2 came out relatively close together and I have had to wait about 11 years for 3. Overall I would say that Toy Story 3 is a great family film and is definitely worth watching. I would rate it 8.5/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone."
"IllusionOfLife","10","0","0","27 June 2011"," An Unnecessary Sequel that More than Justifies its Necessity.
","Over the past fifteen years Pixar has consistently made not only the best animated films, but some of the best films of the last decade and a half, period. All their movies are great but my absolute favorites are: Ratatouille and Finding Nemo (tied for first), WALLE and Toy Story 2 (tied for second), and A Bug's Life and Up (tied for third). Make no mistake, the others that did not make this list are all excellent movies (yes, even Cars), but those six that I mentioned are the best of the best. So how does Toy Story 3 stack up? <br/><br/>Well before I answer that question I'd like to talk for a moment about one of the two movies in my second place slot: Toy Story 2. Toy Story 2 was a movie that was riddled with production problems from the beginning; it started as a direct-to-video project headed up by two less-than-experienced directors, then when the decision was made to make it a theatrical release, the story was not where it needed to be so, with less than a year until release date Pixar started over from scratch. Despite all of that Toy Story 2 not only was a good sequel, it was actually better than the first, and to this day stands as an example of one of Pixar's very best films. Not only that, but it's ending was perfect, it was satisfying, it was big, and it felt very final. Nothing else needed to come after Toy Story 2, and in many ways, nothing should have. However, here we are, 11 years later with a second sequel: Toy Story 3. <br/><br/>And what would you know? It's fantastic! A first time director took a movie that had absolutely no reason for existence and made a film that justifies it's value as an addition to one of the most beloved film franchises of all time. It was hilariously funny, deeply moving, and full of characters that feel like real people despite being computer models of plastic toys (basically everything you've come to expect from Pixar). From the brilliant opening scene to the emotional conclusion, this was one excellent movie. However, though great, it still didn't quite match the mastery of Pixar's best films and it didn't quite top Toy Story 2 as best of the franchise. <br/><br/>The biggest downside of this movie was that the second act moved too quickly and things were too easy and predictable. After the brilliant reveal of Stinky Pete the Prospector as the villain in Toy Story 2, the mystery surrounding the villain in this movie wasn't nearly as hard to solve and was answered as soon as it started making you question yourself. Second acts are typically the weakest parts of movies due to what's known as the second act sag, where the story takes too long transitioning from introduction to climax. This movie, though, seemed to overcompensate a little bit in that regard by resolving plot points too quickly and without enough effort. On one hand the second act was easily the funniest part of the film, but the story was at its thinnest during that part. <br/><br/>Aside from that one complaint, though, Toy Story 3 was an excellent film. I grinned like an idiot through the whole first act, I laughed hysterically through the second act, and, to quote director Lee Unkrich's favorite response to the film, in the third act ""a tear made it past my beard."" While this movie was not a film that necessarily needed to be made, I'm very glad that it was. It had everything that a good film needs, and aside from a slightly thin second act it was firing on all cylinders. Pixar has once again beaten the odds and created a truly remarkable film that defies all expectations, it may not be a perfect film, but considering how rare it is for a second sequel to be decent, let alone good, the fact that first time director Lee Unkrich was able to make a truly great second sequel to a fifteen year old film is an amazing accomplishment, the Academy might as well just give him his Oscar now and save some time because he definitely deserves it. <br/><br/>Rating: A+"

","An animated movie about plastic toys really shouldn't make a grown man cry. But with Toy Story 3 the good folks at Pixar make that possible. Your level of weepiness may vary but if this film's final act doesn't at least induce a sniffle or two you may want to place your hand on your chest to make sure that you do actually have a heart. A three-film journey is complete and what a ride it's been. And after three films full of great entertainment, adventure, comedy and thrills the saga of our favorite plastic playthings ends with some raw, heartfelt emotion. It's hard to say goodbye to our toys.<br/><br/>In many ways you know going in what you're going to get from a Toy Story film. First off, you know it's going to look fantastic. The animation revolution which the first Toy Story film began is in full bloom now. There's some truly breathtaking looking stuff. You'll hear that familiar and beloved song, You've Got a Friend in Me, with a new twist and Randy Newman will have some great new music for you too. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen will once again brilliantly bring our heroes, Woody and Buzz, to life. And most of your other old favorite voices will be back too. Could we really have a Toy Story movie without Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as Rex or John Ratzenberger as Hamm? Of course new friends introduced into the Toy Story universe in Toy Story 2 will be back as well, notably Joan Cusack's Jessie, Jodi Benson's Barbie and Estelle Harris's Mrs. Potato Head. And then you toss in the new toys. There are some real gems in the new bunch. Ned Beatty has the most significant new role, that of Lotso the hugging bear. Timothy Dalton is a treat as thespian hedgehog Mr. Pricklepants. And Barbie needs her Ken. Enter Michael Keaton who is perfect in the role of the guy who, despite all his protestations, is totally a girl's toy.<br/><br/>So the gang's all here, old friends and new. The story begins with Andy, owner of all our favorite toys, now grown up and about to head off to college. The toys end up, after a few misunderstandings and contrivances, being donated to a daycare center. Most of the toys seem happy with their new fate. But ever-loyal Woody knows he must get back to Andy. And the rest of the toys soon get a cold splash of reality. Life at Sunnyside daycare isn't so sunny after all. They've gotta get out. In Toy Story 2 the other toys set out to rescue Woody. This time Woody sets out to rescue the other toys. There are moments where it does seem a little too familiar and repetitive. But there are more than enough great moments, and certainly enough great characters, to keep the movie chugging along. And ultimately there will be great drama, danger and peril. Forget little kids, even adults might be covering their eyes. There's a lot of scary stuff our beloved toys go through. Amazingly this animated movie about a bunch of toys manages to put your heart right in your throat. A wonderfully exciting climax to this great three-movie ride. And then, right at the end, the serious heartstring-tugging begins. A beautiful, heartfelt, poignant end to the great Toy Story saga. A terrific and fitting ending which, over the course of three beloved films, these toys and the Pixar geniuses who created them have certainly earned."

","""Toy Story 3"" is certainly a movie for all ages.

Our favorite characters are back for one last hurrah. <br/><br/>The production values are simply fantastic. The perfect movie when it comes to animation. <br/><br/>But what I liked the most, was that I felt like in my childhood days.

","If you are a unique person like me, you have always heard great things about Toy Story movies but never actually sat down or decided to watch one. To make it even better, you probably have never watched the 1 and 2 but wanted to watch 3...if its a yes, I sure bet it was a heart warming experience and now you are adding 1 and 2 to your queue.<br/><br/>Having watched minimal animated movies and a limited liking towards them, I asked myself not to lose interest through the ride but Toy Story proved to change all of that. It does not matter whether you already know the characters or not, this movie will immerse you into a sea of happiness and joy that will not just bring back all the memories as a kid, but it will elevate you to dream and always keep good things closer. The monumental characters like Woody and Buzz will remain and never grow older in your heart, and your imagination/interpretation of the emotions will bring tears of joy and attachment.<br/><br/>The strength of the movie is more than just Woody and Buzz here. What makes it great is a culmination of some very creative thinking, pristine story telling, solid animation and perfect voice overs. And if you pay close attention, then this movie is not about Toys.....this story is about sticking and always being there..... told is a masterful way.<br/><br/>Go watch it and respect the Toy + STORY!!"

","Toy story 3, in my opinion got to be one of Pixar best since Finding Nemo. Everything about is just marvelous, I enjoy every moment of it especially how they managed to balance the story between being sentimental and humorous.<br/><br/>The good thing about Pixar is that they put great consideration into storyline and for me that is the most important thing. The base of great movie is a great story and that what make Pixar always delivered good movie. This also applied to this movie. It has everything that one could hope for – sentimental moments, adventures, humor, and so on.<br/><br/>I won't get into much detail because the first two movies have already proved itself how great this franchise has been. This movie will complete the trilogy and I must say the standard doesn't drop one bit, yet – it set it selves even high – meeting all the expectation for the entire fan.<br/><br/>Since I watch in normal TV I can't really say how great the 3D version is, but I can say is that the picture and animation look much sharper than before; making it even more appealing to watch. Plus the great music from the previous film also doesn't get old.<br/><br/>All in all, I have a great time watching this.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Yes, I got the DVD and it all worthwhile.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10 (Grade: A)"

For me, the first one was too short and the human animation was too...fake. The second one was a bit, well, slow. But, this one... Is a true work of art. There were scenes where I laughed so hard, my ribs started to hurt (especially in the monkey scene, I SCREAMED out of laughter for straight ten minutes!).

"dusty_rx","9","0","0","31 March 2011"," I raise my hat to you, Pixar
","First of all: I am now a 20 years old student and you could say I am in the process of becoming an adult and maybe that is one of the reasons Toy Story 3 had such a strong impact on me, because I could really relate to Andy, but that is not everything.<br/><br/>It is easy to pick apart a movie you hated, but it is hart to express why you loved a certain movie because you feel you completely got to share all the emotions it evoked in you to a full extent with your readers, which is really, really difficult. That is why I won't go that much into detail about every aspect of the film. I won't summarize the storyline, talk about the voice acting, the music, the stunning visuals, stuff like this. I'll just try to explain why this movie (or Pixar movies in general, that is) is so amazingly powerful. Like any Pixar movie, it excels at both: comedy and drama, and while it had it's funny moments (some hilarious ones actually, Ken and Latino Buzz) the main reason this movie will be remembered by me is the final act which had me on the edge of my seat like literally NO movie before and crying like no movie before. (I was really thankful for those 3D-glasses that prevented my friends from seeing the tears in my eyes, but maybe they were crying as well. Actually my eyes are filled with tears as I am writing this right now.) I grew up with the Toy Story movies and as my childhood is coming to an end, the Toy Story Saga is, too, and even though I never owned a Woody or a Buzz or any other toy out of the movie, they were a part of my life. The movie reminds you of those days when you were a child, when you were allowed to dream, you were free and innocent. And even though as time goes by life's problems come crushing down on you, in every adult deep deep down there is still a tiny spark of memory about this and Toy Story 3 brings it all back up again. It reminds you how important it is to never forget this time and that you still got it in you, but also that you might need to move on and say goodbye at certain points in life. There are things worth preserving, but that does not mean you should cling to them for all time, which is why the passing of the torch at the end e.g Andy giving his toys to a worthy new owner is such a good last point to this trilogy.<br/><br/>Friendship, Love, those are strong words which often get thrown around in movies yet mean NOTHING there, I usually find myself laughing at romantic movies or the likes that are supposed to be sad, but damn, Pixar you made me cry about FICTIONAL toys and I was emotionally attached to our protagonists like I never imagined possible. The amazing ending scene has been discussed and analyzed a lot here by people who explained everything that is going on there much better than I could probably do, so I'll wont focus on it and instead share my thoughts about the strongest scene in the movie (or ANY movie EVER, I am serious about this) in my opinion: The incinerator scene was just UNBELIEVABLE. You are used to expect happy endings in certain kind of movies (e.g family movies, cheap action movies etc.) and never feel any excitement because of this, but in this particular scene Pixar had me really believing ""Oh god, this might actually be the end of it all, how DARE they to do this to us"", and while one part of me would have appreciated the movie for it's courage if it actually would have ended there, with the friends holding hands while facing destruction, the other part (the bigger one) could not have lived with this. The scene worked PERFECTLY. You forgot that you were watching a movie. Those were your friends that were going to die. You felt the fear, you felt the relief. It felt real, and while fictional movies don't portray real EVENTS - they still deliver real emotions. How this could be pulled off so amazingly well in TS 3 is beyond me. I bow down to you Pixar."
"sashank_kini-1","8","0","0","31 March 2011"," Toy Legacy
","Unlike a majority of fellow critics on IMDb, I was underwhelmed by the hype for Toy Story. At that time, I was probably 14; Woody I thought to be querulous and grumbling. On my second viewing however, my opinion about the movie was less caustic. I appreciate the authenticity of the story, and how it reflects the life of a ten year old whiling away his hours, interacting with the inanimate figures. Now that I hear my cousin bantering ceaselessly about how has Beyblades 'listen' to him, find that the portrayal of the toys is immaculately accurate. <br/><br/>The toys have animated conversations sub rosa, as they live their plastic selves live, play, love and protect each other from all kinds of adversities. The beautifully drawn opening scene unravels in a customarily swift action, throwing the viewers right into the center of action. All know how this scene is going to end but no one expected monkey critters or the dinosaur cracking hilariously through the earth. But that's how a child's psyche works - in an incredible, zany and good vs evil way. My cousin says a few of his Beyblades strike with the attacks of his choice at his command. As long as he is having fun and gives feet to imagination, no one should intervene.<br/><br/>Only this time, it is the toys feeling nostalgic and rebuffed by Andy's abandonment. Real, cruel life takes over as the human being is forced to part with the very tutors of his childhood who taught him how to imagine, how to reestablish the boundaries by setting forth his vision. Toys are an indispensable part of early life as they teach one that life is not just about seeing but seeing with a mental squint. <br/><br/>Andy's is now a grown up but he is reluctant on parting with his old friends. He stores them in a trunk and decides to move them to the attic. His insistence in treasuring the toys show his childlikeness and fondness for the toys. Also he is large-hearted and generous, as seen later. The toys have made him this person. Hand another child a gun and see what he becomes in future!<br/><br/>Anyway, he and his sister do the the clearing, she dispensing with her Barbie, as Jessie dolefully looks on and gets unnerved, so do the others, worrying that they may be in the trash anytime. Woody remains optimistic and hopeful, reassuring them every moment. One slight misunderstanding and all except Woody almost land up in the trash. They escape and reach the Sunny Side daycare, and are welcomed with open arms by Lotso, Ken, Baby and a plentiful of other toys. Woody is slightly disappointed by the selfish fickleness of his companions and decides to return home, loyal to Andy. The others have a rough first day only to be even more surprised (in a bad way, of course) at night. I for a moment wished I were among those toys at the center looking at all those amenities (thank heavens, I'm not).<br/><br/>The rest of the story chronicles swiftly as Woody assumes the role of a hero again, Buzz jigs to Spanish songs and for a while, poses his old form again, to the distress of everyone this time, the toys make an eventful escape, nearly die (or melt) and find a new home. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks is not in any way overbearing as he gets at times ( Turner and Hooch, for instance) while Buzz is versatile as a character (he can dance for sure!) and his voice- over is great. Andy really pulls the heartstrings because of his honest voice-over while Ken adds to the comic relief. Some adroit thinking from the creators of Pixar who noticed the underlying dishonesty I usually saw in the Ken dolls owned by the sister. Men will be men. Here both Ken and Barbie are lovestruck and inspire and change each other.<br/><br/>The incinerator scene is genuinely poignant and highlights the camaraderie between the toys. The aliens have a vital role in the film. The animation is lush and effervescent, dazzling with colors, the cream of the crop being the animation of the dog (wait, was that really animated?) At 103 minutes, I really wished it were just a bit longer, especially the daycare escape sequence. <br/><br/>A very fine effort by Pixar studios. It'll probably grow on me more during my subsequent viewings. Yet, Ratatouille remains my personal favorite. 8 on 10."

What happened next was a breathtaking journey of a toy's love for his 'kid'. The film does not disappoint at all, it is funny with wonderful witty dialogue and scenes, as well as fantastic voice acting from some truly talented set of actors.<br/><br/>Every scene is brilliantly devised and there is never a dull moment, whether Woody and the gang have a falling out, or Woody is imprisoned in the little girls house, or Buzz's Spanish turn. It's just utterly magical. One of the true highlights of the movie is 'Ken & Barbie', you have to see it to understand just how funny Michael Keaton is!<br/><br/>I'll always remember the last scene, not because of Woody but because of what it can do....I will always remember the weeping of a woman next to me, I will remember the reddening eyes of a grown man on a row in front of me. For you see this is not just a simple 'cartoon or animation' it is a tale of growing up, a tale of leaving innocent things behind that made rainy afternoons fun, its about the splendours of the imagination.<br/><br/>I hope this is not the end my friends.

","Ever since I was a child, i have always enjoyed pixar's movies. They are always meaningful, funny and just amazing. I went in to watch the 3D version when it came out but i don't think the 3D part is too great and it's not very necessary to watch it in 3D. I wouldn't say it's the best movie pixar has ever made but it's quite entertaining. First, the plot is hilarious and made many people laughed in the theatre. It's also touching when they left each other and i could hear sobs coming from even adults. The most surprising/ SCARIEST part of the movie was when the giant baby went crazy evil. It scared the hell out of us. Overall, i would say it's a fantastic movie for it's animation, plot, and sound. It's a definitely a must-see for all ages and it's totally worth watching!"

","Sequels are a tricky thing; especially the ones which are supposed to end a movie series. Try and do too much, and the audience will be left with a sour memory, do too little and the audience will be left unsatisfied. A good sequel is one which presents something new and interesting to the audience but still manages to mesh seamlessly with the previous installment. Unfortunately, there are very few movie series which can claim to have enthralled the audiences with each new installment. Some of the more recent ones that come to mind are the Lord of the Rings series and the Jason Bourne series. The latest entrant into this category is the Toy Story series.<br/><br/>Ever since Woody and gang entered our consciousness, they have enthralled us with their pranks, idiosyncrasies, and their camaraderie. After the second movie released in 1999, all the fans - including yours' truly - were waiting for the third movie with bated breath. As it turned out, it was a good thing that no one held their breaths for a long time; because the third movie took a really long time to come. But what was finally dished out ensured that Toy Story would remain eternally ensconced in our hearts as one of the finest animated movies ever made.<br/><br/>The movie starts with most of the toys' - and I guess a lot of fans' - worst nightmare coming true; Andy is all grown up and ready to go off to college. The question confronting the toys is 'Where now?' Most of the toys have been given away in the yard sale over the years. The only ones who remain are Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Bullseye, Slinky, Rex, Hamm, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Heads, and the three-eyed space aliens from the Pizza Planet. The moment when Andy's mom puts the toys - except Woody, whom Andy is taking to college with him - in the trash can instead of the attic, is when the fun begins. Though the toys do manage to escape the getting crushed in the trash collecting truck, they end up in a day care center where they meet a lot of new toys including Lots-O'-Huggin' bear, Big Baby (an actual big baby doll), and Ken. Then follows a nightmare that makes the attic in Andy's house look like heaven. Their eventual escape from there is classic sequence with lots of nail biting moments. And the ending? Well, let's just say that by the end of the movie, it will be hard not to feel goose bumps. The movie is a perfect balance of hilarious moments (none more than Buzz getting reset to Spanish settings), dark moments, and really touching moments.<br/><br/>The central characters still continue to enthrall you. All the previous actors/actresses return to reprise their roles. And the actual characters still retain their freshness. Woody is still the tough-but- kind cowboy of the first two movies. Buzz is still the boy-scout space ranger, though he seems to be a bit tongue-tied when speaking to Jessie (not the Spanish Buzz though). Rex is still trying - and failing - to look menacing. Mr. Potato Head is still the eternal pessimist with a sarcastic humor. So what has changed? For starters, the toys are no longer facing a threat from Sid the evil-neighborhood-kid or Al from the Al's toy barn, but from Andy himself. And for once Woody is not showing as much confidence in Andy as he once used to. <br/><br/>Somehow, the plight of the characters is synonymous to the situation that each of us has to face at some time or another. Whether it be getting selected for the school play, or in a sports team, or being accepted by your peers during the day of school/college/work. And the similarities don't end here. Time and again you will be reminded of the various 'last days' that you have had. Last day at the school, last day of your graduation, last day at an office you have worked in for a long time, the day when you moved out of your home, and so on. The empty feeling that you tend to get, the sad farewells that you might have had with your closest friends, the fond memories of the times - good or bad - that you might have shared, the uncertainty of whether you will ever meet your friends again; all these feeling somehow fight their way up amongst all the worries that the modern day life tends to heap upon us. If nothing else, watch the movie for just reminiscing those moments.<br/><br/>Pixar's animation is awesome as usual. The direction is great. The security arrangements made by the toys at the day care center is very cleverly done; trucks for watch guards, and slides for watch towers. The escape sequence of the toys from the day care is cleverly directed. Randy Newman provides great music once again, kicking off the movie with the familiar 'You've Got a Friend In Me' track. The rest of the music provides good support to the movie.<br/><br/>It's very difficult to point out any flaws in the plot of the movie, except that it gets a bit serious too many times. But then, it's OK considering the fact that it was essential for the movie to end the way it did.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it is one of the finest animated movies I have ever seen. And Toy Story is definitely one of the best trilogies I have ever seen. When the release of the sequel was announced, my greatest fear was whether Toy Story 3 would be able to stand up to the first two movies; considering the fact that it was being made after more than a decade. But, not only has it stood up to the first two movies, in my humble opinion, it has surpassed the first two movies."

","The Toys are back in town! (Yea, I said it). ""Toy Story 3"" may just be the best installment in the Toy Story series (and the word on the street is Pixar may be making a forth). Pixar hasn't let me down yet on staying true to what matter most, the story. And somehow Pixar keeps raising the bar on 3D animation making it seem like they are untouchable. ""Toy Story 3's"" visuals and animation put the first ""Toy Story"" to shame. It is like comparing VHS to Blu-Ray.<br/><br/>With a huge cast of characters, I was worried that ""Toy Story 3"" might become too saturated with character stories and I would have trouble following and caring about all of the story lines. But director Lee Unkrich does a good job of splitting the character's up in the movie through a series of events and has the audience follow three grouped story lines instead of the potential 20. This allows for good action sequences and quick cuts between story lines that leave you anxious for more. I do admit that the middle of the movie does get a little slow at times, but not slow enough to where you feel they could have left some of it out. Sometimes developing a good story takes time and I am happy that Unkrich didn't feel like he had to cut story to meet a time frame.<br/><br/>Read full review at FlicksWorthWatching.com"

","With the final release of the third installment in the TOY STORY series, Pixar has officially created one of the best movie trilogies ever. The franchise is one of the few that got consecutively better with each movie released. It's got all the fun of the previous films but the third has a bit of a darker turn as the toys are faced with the realization that they're no longer needed in Andy's life. Andy's all grown up and he's getting ready to leave for college. Woody has been selected to travel with him but the others are being relegated to the attic. An accident finds the toys at the curb for trash collection so they escape and climb into a box for donation at the local daycare. The idea of endless days filled with playtime is appealing and the toys at the daycare welcome them with open arms but things are not all what they seem. Andy's toys are left in the toddler room where they're ravaged by the kids and they soon discover the place is run like a prison by a lovable bear known as Lotso (short for Lots'o'Huggin Bear) and it's up to Woody to help his friends break out.<br/><br/>This film has a darker edge than the previous two, and the villainous Lotso (voiced by Ned Beatty) seems especially evil. He comes across as a loving grandfather figure but he rules the daycare with an iron fist and a handful of minions, the funniest of which is Ken. Voiced by Michael Keaton, Ken is hilarious and a major scene-stealer as he has a hard time figuring why his love for fashion and pink dream-house make him a ""girl's toy"". Lotso and Ken are just two of the new additions to the film, with a load of other new characters. There is plenty to love about this new film and the characters are just one element.<br/><br/>The film is still a children's movie but it's geared even more towards adults than the first two. There are definitely more adult themes and tense moments than before, but nothing too frightening for little ones. It's everything you love about TOY STORY with an even better story and dozens more characters. The best in the series, easily."

","Toy Story 3...Lovable ""To infinity and beyond!""<br/><br/>It is usually a tough task to get satisfied when you walk into a movie after your expectations have been shot to the extremes. With Toy Story 3, the story is different. You may have seen 1 & 2 and in case you haven't, they tell a story of a bunch of toys belonging to a kid named Andy. These toys go through various adventures trying to spend most of their time with their owner and not get away from him for any reason. In the 3rd part, Andy is off to college and no longer in need for his toys, but through a classic mix up, the toys get delivered to a day-care center instead of the attic, and there begins a new adventure.<br/><br/>Animated features, especially Pixar's, have always been presented in the form of a funny, well entertaining story with a deep moral lesson behind. However, a turning point to the history of Pixar and the whole animation industry was ""Up"", which won 2 Oscars and was nominated for 3 more. Some of the reasons to that success were adding a few more dramatic elements to the plot, surrounding the movie with high class music and making the story constantly eye catching. In Toy Story 3, Pixar looks back at ""Up"" and builds upon on its success using almost every aspect involved. You get the music, the laughs, the drama, and the cliché moments and end it all with a perfect resolution.<br/><br/>The similarities with ""Up"" go even deeper with the significant character resemblance between the villains in both movies. Both Christopher Muntz, the explorer from ""Up"" and Lotso the notorious teddy bear of ""Toy Story 3"" appear to have been good hearted at the earlier stages of their lives, which are presented in flashback forms in both films. Pain and grief ignite hatred and corruption in their personalities and turn them to who they are now. <br/><br/>Like ""Up"", ""Toy Story 3"" is full of well crafted dramatic moments and overwhelmingly funny ones as well. It's a pretty satisfactory journey from beginning to end for the viewers regardless of their expectations. As the story builds up, it turns so realistic; not until Buzz starts speaking Spanish that it hits you that you're watching an animated movie not a real one.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Toy Story 3 has something definitely special and different to present to the series fans. It will leave you knowing for sure that it's the best of the trilogy. It has a unique plot, a beautiful score and a hilarious bunch; we've learned to laugh with long time ago. I guess the Pixar lot are expecting to add another Academy Award to the collection in 2011. Watch it in 3D!"

","I was just wondering, you known, how come a sequel could get an 8.8 out of 10? I haven't seen such a high score for a while... But after I went through the whole thing I had to admitted that it really deserves the applause. This is definitely not another cliché-ridden good vs evil animation that might bore most of the parents to sleep. It is both entertaining and educational. As a grown up, this film really makes me start to re-exam the relationships that I am currently involved. What the essence of these relationships? Are they different from my childhood ones? If so, what's changed? Me, friends, teachers, colleagues? Am I made the decision myself or did the society or living pressure force me to? Is that a good decision? Should I change now, and go back to the time when real care and loyalty are the most important stuff between me and my friends, just like the ones between the toys and their owner?...<br/><br/>Albeit this film is supposed to make you giggle, that's it, I just cannot get these questions out of my mind. Yet I think I am not alone, what do you say?<br/><br/>Anyway, good job, good time =)<br/><br/>PS:Buzz speaking Spanish? That really tickles me a lot =)"

","Wow.<br/><br/>This film has some serious BALLS.<br/><br/>That's right. This kids film is some ballsy stuff. Ballsier than Apocalypse Now. OK, you may eviscerate me now!! Being a fan of Toy Story 1 and 2 when I was a kid, I knew I was in for a serious ride when I went to the 4 PM IMAX screening on opening day. As I walked into the the theater, I had to tell myself that this is it, this is the last Toy Story movie ever, that I will never see another Toy Story movie again. So as the movie began playing, I prepared myself to say goodbye to my favourite walking talking toys.<br/><br/>This movie is simply a gem. I had anticipated it all the way back when I saw the trailer with Up. The whole theatre went ""Oh COME ON!!!!"" when they found out they had to wait a year to see it.<br/><br/>Toy Story shows that Andy has grown up now, is going to college. The toys have been donated to a local daycare, which may seem like a happy place to all the other toys, but Woody can't shake the fact that the person he grew up with, Andy, is away from him now. Sunnyside Daycare has rowdy kids though, who do nothing but destroy the toys. Even worse, Lotso Huggin Bear, Ken, all the others seem nice, but are evil and cruel bastards. Furthermore, Buzz has been reprogrammed to be on Lotso's side. Oh no! The toys must reprogram him, and furthermore, get the HELL out of Sunnyside!!! The film is, in a word, spectacular. I was expecting it to suck, but surprise surprise!!! I loved this film. Great voice acting, great direction, animation is spectacular, and the best thing of the film? The darkness. One incredible scene is where the toys face death as they find themselves in the furnace near the end of the film. That scene had me on the edge of my seat, and hit me like a big bag of bricks. Just powerful, incredible stuff. And BOY did I cry like a baby at the end!!! Overall, it's time to say goodbye to Woody and Co, and TS3 is the perfect opportunity to do so."
"crow30002003","10","0","0","5 December 2010"," A perfect example of how to end a trilogy
","In the movie business, especially with animation, sequels are often made as a cheap cash-in targeted at fans of the original. However, there are some sequels and trilogies that try to surpass themselves with each installment. Toy Story 3 is no exception. Pixar deserves a standing ovation for the superb work they did for the 3rd film in the Toy Story franchise. It's a film that I honestly think was targeted at the people who grew up with the first 2 Toy Story films, as it exhibits excellent continuity from the previous installments (Like Woody's stitching from TS2 and Buzz's lack of a sticker from TS1), and the re-release of both original films. However that doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed by current generations. <br/><br/>Now onto the plot. Andy is moving to college and has to clean out his room, either throwing stuff away, putting stuff in the attic, donating them or taking stuff with him to college. He intends to put the toys in the attic, except Woody, who he wants to take with him, but the toys end up at Sunnyside Daycare, run by Lotso Huggin Bear. At first he seems like a nice character, but soon reveals his true colors as Sunnyside begins to resemble a prison to the toys, when they request to be in the room with the caring children rather than get roughed up by the apparently younger tykes. It even has a security system run by the ever popular cymbal banging monkey. The rest you'll have to see for yourself instead of reading a description. This summary doesn't do the film justice.<br/><br/>The film contains a combination of comedy, drama, action, and some genuine tear-jerking moments, especially near the end. It features a cast that's semi-well known, including several who've been in the previous movies (Tim Allen and Tom Hanks, to name a couple) and some fresh new faces, or voices, I should say. In Pixar tradition, you have to watch the film a couple of times to get the full effect and catch everything in the background.<br/><br/>All in all, Pixar has once again brought us a movie that does not disappoint, as sequels normally tend to do. It serves as a fitting end to the franchise, that is if a 4th one isn't in the works, but even if it isn't, this ties up all the loose ends. This is one movie I cannot say enough good things about, and I saw the 2-D version! I highly recommend this flick not just to children, but older teens and parents who grew up with the first Toy Story movies. I look forward to what Pixar has up their proverbial sleeves in the near future, as they have given me faith that they can do sequels right unlike their parent company (Yeah, I went there).<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"appleredhappiness","8","0","0","3 December 2010"," Toy Story 3, the trilogy is complete
","Toy Story 3 made the ""trilogy"" complete. Although, the plot, emotional at times, created a bittersweet taste and a lump in the throat, it abounded with creativity. The movie keeps the most beloved characters and address the theme of friendship and change. There is a time and a season for all things. The viewer can relate with the idea that life change is inevitable. We must learn to appreciate each stage of life and hold on to the sweet memories. The toys are stuck between remaining faithful to Andy and accepting the fact that all children grow up. They feel a duty to stick together and be there for Andy when he needs them. This sense of duty and commitment is portrayed many times, as Woody tries to convince the toys to return to Andy and stick together, and even when they face death (in the garbage furnace they reach out to hold hands and face it together). Other positive values include respect for the life of others, both friends (Buzz jumps under falling debris to push Jessie out of the way) and enemies (Woody saves ""Lot's-O-Huggin' Bear"" by pulling him out from under a piece of metal on the garbage conveyor belt) alike. It is not our job to choose who lives and dies, that's up to God. We are to do what we can to uphold justice, but also exercise love and compassion as we can.<br/><br/>There were only a few aspects of the movie in which I was disappointed. The scary looking baby and clown toys were a little unnecessary, reminiscent of the ""Twilight Zone."" Ken is portrayed as a metrosexual. He is self absorbed, excessively preoccupied with his appearance and with clothes, self conscious of his being a 'girl's toy,' and has girly handwriting. It's unfortunate that Pixar had to take a stab at manhood, but I suppose that this contrasts with Andy who is growing into adulthood with kindness, security, and concern for others.<br/><br/>The animation in Toy Story 3 is very well done, from the new high-tech play sequence in the opening scene, to the incredibly colorful and complex atmosphere of Sunnyside Daycare. Hilarious new characterizations are spread throughout the film to counteract the seriousness of the plot. The antics of ""Spanish Buzz Lightyear"" and the inventiveness of ""Sandwhich Wrap"" Mr. Potato Head could not help but make me wonder...'who comes up with these things?!!"" Very creative!! In an age where people leave the house to get away from their family, children grow up too quickly, and society promotes a ""take care of yourself"" attitude, Toy Story 3 encourages the development and maintenance of family and friends, value for others' lives, and principles of perseverance and commitment."

","The first 10 years of Pixar's exploration of feature animations were the preparation for some great results. Ratatouille and Wall.E were a glossary of narrative and visual accomplishments by the studio. But Up was a failure, i think, some would speculate because of the 3D, preferred by money making Disney, others would argue that Disney itself its pulling the strings now, and the creative minds in Pixar are constrained now. Some applaud that turn to the codes of Disney reference, others remark on the loss of creative power. And those opinions fall positive or negative, over this Toy Story. And although i am concerned about the ""disneyzation"" of pixar, i think this specific film is a different case in their filmography, and it actually exceeds Up in many respects.<br/><br/>The 3D is a waste. Unless i feel they have something to say in these respect, i'm not sure whether i'll try to see a Pixar film in 3d again. It's a mere executive decision with no visual consequences other than the traditional loss of light. The short film that precedes the film, that is something well done here.<br/><br/>We don't have a completely absorbing environment, like in Wall.E (although the garbage scene does report to that film), instead we live on the memory of the older Toy Story films. Indeed that nostalgic component of this film (specially for guys of my age) counts a great deal here, and indeed may cloud my own vision of this film. But i admit it's nice to see Buzz and Woody live through to see our days. That's why this film is a special case within Pixar (although i know that this Toy Story 3 was a pressure by Disney due to the value of the brand with the ticket buyers).<br/><br/>We do not have an enervative spatial exploration and camera moves, but i think they synthesize some of the lessons learned in Ratatouille, which was all about cranking virtual cameras under tables and between dishes. So this film, in those matters, works like a recap of previous episodes.<br/><br/>The story itself is a disappointment. The temptation to the self-reference of the previous TS was to great for them to deny it. What we get is the memory of old characters. I do like how we get into this film, the western episode of the train crash, it's an efficient device, and it also tells us that we will have film references through out the film. Indeed we do, countless references to countless genres, as far as i could tell all of them audience friendly. Ken and Barbie work in their own acts, although they lack integration to a larger structure which, anyway, is not meaningful enough to make them stretch the script to include Ken and Barbie as important characters, instead of circus numbers.<br/><br/>What Pixar Has been getting via Dreamworks, is the rendering of characters facial expressions. But i which next time we have these guys back to the innovation trails.<br/><br/>P.S. a remarkable detail that i truly appreciated, which remarks on the proximity Pixar-Disney is the inclusion of a Miyazaki character with the other toys in the nursery. it's well known the recent proximity between Disney and Ghibli, so i really smiled at this wink they were giving us.<br/><br/>My opinion: 3/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of sequels. Even some of the best and funniest franchises usually generate huge disappointments with their sequels. Perhaps it is because the Toy Story folks did not feel compelled to rush right back out with their sequels, but for whatever the reason, they have avoided the dreaded sequel curse that has plagued such classic originals as ""Naked Gun"", ""Airplane"", ""Nutty Professor"" and ""Shrek"" - all great originals that fell flat with their sequels.<br/><br/>Toy Story III incorporates enough of the familiar and time-tested characteristics that we all expect from Woody, Buzz, Potato Head, etc., without becoming repetitive and predictable. To quibble, there may have been a moment or two when it lapsed into all too familiar territory, but the movie more than overcomes that minor shortcoming with the same excellence we have come to expect. My only hope is that they know to quit when they are ahead and not churn out Toy Story's IV and V with substitute voices and 2nd rate stories. They have defied the odds with a 2nd top notch sequel, so I hope they don't get greedy - but this is Hollywood..."
"dmcarefuldriver","5","3","8","8 January 2011"," OK, But Far Below My Expectations
","Toy Story 3 has gotten nothing but excellent reviews. Everyone says that it is phenomenal in every way. At the time I am writing this, it's the highest rated Pixar movie here on IMDb.<br/><br/>I have been very impressed with several of Pixar's newer films. I thought Cars, Ratatouille, and WALL-E were all great. Up disappointed me by having forgettable and stupid action in the second half of the movie. Unfortunately, Toy Story 3 disappoints me in exactly the same way. Most of the second half of the movie is fairly forgettable and irrelevant to the original plot.<br/><br/>To compliment the movie, most of it is well-written, humorous, and has great voice acting. The ending is really nice, too. Unfortunately, there are several big scenes that were disappointing. Towards the second half of the movie, the plot begins to drift away from the compelling idea of the toys needing to get back to their owner to the generic ""good vs. evil"" battle. I found this to be unfitting and far less entertaining than the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>The climax of the film is fairly evil and intense, which surprised me. I can easily see little kids getting scared by what I thought was going to be a truly all-ages film. (This movie definitely should have been rated PG.) I also felt that by having the evil character not redeem himself, the movie teaches a bad message.<br/><br/>For Toy Story and Pixar fans, Toy Story 3 is probably worth watching. If you loved Up, you will probably love this movie just as much if not more. But don't think that this is a perfect movie for the whole family. It might be quite scary for young kids, and I don't think most adults will appreciate it much.<br/><br/>Hopefully, this will be the last Pixar film that hurts itself with generic action and an overly evil character. Toy Story 3 is certainly not a bad film, but I know Pixar can do much better."
"Turfseer","6","3","8","9 August 2010"," Entertaining, but not as good as Toy Story 1 & 2
","I was looking forward to seeing Toy Story 3 since I enjoyed Toy Story 1 & 2 so much. The question remains whether Toy Story 3 measures up to its predecessors. All the main characters are back including Woody and Buzz Lightyear and the Pixar animation, with its attention to extreme detail, is even better. It was a good idea not to bring back all the toys from the previous features and dispensing with the toy soldiers (for example), by having them 'bail out', which was quite clever.<br/><br/>The plot begins in the present, with the toy's owner, Andy, now about to go away to college. He packs up his toys (excluding Woody who he intends to take with him to college) and puts them in a bag, about to bring them upstairs to the attic for storage. Somehow he gets distracted and his mother mistakenly throws the bag with the toys out in the trash. The toys manage to escape from the bag but jump into a box marked for the Sunnyside Day Care Center. Woody manages to follow the toys to the day care center and insists they should all return to Andy before he goes away to college. The toys, however, don't relish the idea of being no use up in the attic and stage a mutiny. Woody leaves his colleagues, only to end up in the home of Bonnie, a young child, who has some neat, new toys including a Shakespearean hedgehog, Mr. Pricklepants, and a scatterbrained triceratops, Trixie.<br/><br/>Unlike Toy Story 1 & 2, which featured human antagonists (the vicious child 'Sid' in ""1"" and Al McWhiggin, the conniving toy store owner in ""2""), Toy Story 3's antagonist is Lotso, a bear with a chip on his shoulder. It seems that Lotso was lost by his previous owner, a child named Daisy, who replaced him with a similar looking model. Somehow the idea that the innocent toy world can be corrupted by an evil seed within its own ranks isn't as effective as having human antagonists. That's because I think it's better to depict the toys as essentially representing the innocent and positive world of childhood with the negative force derived from the worst aspects of adulthood. In Toy Story 1, Sid is a child, obviously conditioned to be a 'monster' by his parents; and in Toy Story 2, Al the toy store owner, embodies the sin of avarice, which must be opposed through the 'goodness' of Andy's toys. In a sense, 'toydom' is diminished by pitting toy against toy and the point that adults are responsible for causing the problems of childhood, is lost.<br/><br/>The other problem I found with the plot is that Andys' toys' reaction to Lotso's directives was unfounded. You'll recall that Andys' toys claim that being placed with the 'younger children' is inappropriate; but as toys, they should expect to be thrown around by younger children (isn't that what younger children do with toys?). And was Lotso being so unfair when he demands that the new toys be placed with the younger one's first, since they're ""first in line""? Notice at the end of the film, when 'fairness' is supposedly restored, Ken and Barbie are now running the day care center, now allowing all the toys to take turns, interacting with the younger and more disruptive children. Note that the toys will still be subjected to being thrown around by the younger children—simply less often.<br/><br/>Still, Toy Story 3 is filled with thrilling scenes, reminiscent of its predecessors. After Andy's toys attempt to escape from the day care center, we're taken on a wild ride inside a trash compactor. The toys face their 'dark moment of the soul' as they're about to be burnt alive in an incinerator; after Lotso fails to save them by pushing the compactor's stop button, they're miraculously saved by squeeze toy aliens who somehow manage to stop all power by operating the controls in the control room.<br/><br/>There are other neat scenes in Toy Story 3 including Buzz turning into a Lothario after accidentally being set on 'Spanish mode', Barbie and Ken falling in, then out of love and back in love again, Ken's hilarious wardrobe display and the fantastic introductory sequence featuring a wild chase involving both a train and a spaceship.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen Toy Story 1 & 2, Toy Story 3 might seem like a masterpiece. But for those who have seen the two earlier incarnations, one can only conclude that ""3"" just isn't quite as good. ""3"" does get marks for trying however. The theme that one cannot hold on to the past is ably embodied in Woody's resistance to leaving Andy and finally accepting, along with the rest of Andy's toys, the idea that it's time to move on. On the other hand, it's sad to see Lotso, pinned to the front of a garbage truck, with the implication that he may be the victim of his new owner, who might be some kind of sadist or pervert. The image of an innocent child's toy, made to represent some demonic force, is all wrong and sadly makes Story 3 inappropriate for younger viewers."
"jboothmillard","9","3","8","26 July 2010"," Toy Story 3
","The first two are rated five stars by the critics, and I was worried this third film rated four stars wasn't going to be quite as good as the predecessors, but I was pleasantly. Basically Andy (John Morris) has grown up and preparing to leave for college, and he has to decide what is going to happen with the remainder of his most loved toys. Woody (Tom Hanks) is surprised to be put in Andy's college box, while Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest of the gang are put in a black bag meant to go in the attic. But Woody watches as Andy is interrupted and the bag is mistaken for trash, so when the toys do manage to escape the garbage disposal van, they get themselves in the box heading for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody is forced to go along with them, and he tried to convince them that Andy meant them to go in the attic, and that Daycare isn't going to be the same as having a real owner. When they arrive at Daycare they are welcomed by all the resident toys, led by cuddly teddy bear Lotso (Deliverance's Ned Beatty), and his second in command Ken (Michael Keaton), who is smitten with Barbie (The Little Mermaid's Jodi Benson). Woody is fed up of trying to get them to believe him, and he manages to escape, but with his mode of escape he winds up flung into a tree and in the hands of child Bonnie (Emily Hahn). Meanwhile, Buzz has been turned into his former self believing he really is a space ranger, and all the other toys have been trapped by Lotso who knows the chaos the much younger children can cause playing with them. Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris) also comes to realise that Woody was telling the truth about Andy meaning to put them in the attic, because of her missing eye catching it, and Woody meanwhile is hatching a plan to bust out the gang out of Sunnyside. After a number of Great Escape style moments, and Buzz turning Spanish (Javier Fernandez Pena), all the toys make it out of the compound, but not without Lotso catching up to them, and forcing them to go heading for the dump. Lotso betrays the toys to make his own escape, and the toys look like they will face their end heading into the incinerator fire, but thankfully the Aliens (Jeff Pidgeon) grab them with their beloved Claw. The toys manage to make it home, where Andy is luckily not quite finished packing, Buzz and the others expect Woody to go to college with Andy, but he makes a choice to write a note for Andy to find. This note is the address of the little girl he had a wonderful playtime with, Bonnie, and Andy hands over his beloved toys one by one to her, he even sacrifices Woody who was with him since he could remember. Before he leaves, Andy has a final play with his toys and Bonnie, and drives away knowing his toys will be in good hands, and he says a thank you, and the toys are happy to have an owner again. Also starring Joan Cusack as Jessie, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Blake Clark as Slinky Dog, Bonnie Hunt as Dolly, Whoopi Goldberg as Stretch, Timothy Dalton as Mr. Pricklepants, Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom, R. Lee Ermey as Sarge, Teddy Newton as Chatter Telephone, Bud Luckey as Chuckles, Beatrice Miller as Molly, Charlie Bright as Young Andy and Tom and Jerry: The Movie's Richard Kind as Bookworm. The characters are all still lovable, and all your emotions are pulled, I honestly thought it was going to be the end when they were heading into the incinerator, and the emotion returned when Andy said his goodbyes. The film also brings you the same range of good emotions, including great new characters voiced by great talent, and great comic moments, including Ken doing his posing for Barbie, Buzz turning Spanish, and Mr. Potato Head becoming a flat bread wrap and much more, and the creepy moments are with the Big Baby. If this is going to be the last time we see Woody, Buzz and the gang, then I think it has been left on a good note, it is a great fun animated comedy adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Song for Randy Newman's ""We Belong Together"" and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Sound Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Very good!"

","This is not a movie for young children. New characters are villains in the guise of toys, sections of the film are dark and too scary for toddlers, and rarely will you hear children laugh during this film. Our local theater reports quite a few unhappy parents abandoning the movie before the end and complaining on their way out. Past experience with Toy Story movies and other Pixar products had us hoping for an enjoyable movie and this was anything but. Technical wizardry will only carry a film so far and this movie needed a much better story. My four year old preferred a day at home to this movie and my seven year old expressed her distaste for characters who never do the right thing even when it's really important."

","As a fan of animated movies ,such as the Shrek series toy story all the Pixar greats and Madagascar. I was excited to go see toy story. The movie started of typical as you got to see all the classic toys as the entered the first scene woody buzz Mr. Potato head etc. Then Andy was introduced there to his mother telling him he has to put his toys in the attic throw them away or take them with him to college.<br/><br/>After this point the whole movie goes downhill. Every single thing is predictable from a to z. You know the toys are going to get donate. As soon as you meet the bear you know he is evil.(plus his back story was boring). You know woody is going to break out come back save the toys. I could have written the whole script in five minutes and the story has been done again and again. Plus there was probably a handful of good jokes. 11 year waste for this. forty minutes into the movie i wanted to leave and if i wasn't with my girlfriend i would have left.<br/><br/>The story needed a bigger connection with people as the first two movies had to do with the toys and there interaction with humans. While this movie was all about toys being held captive by other toys. I thought that was a mistake as one can not relate. The bottom line don't see unless you want to waste your money on a predictable unentertaining movie. Sit home watch the original or rent Shrek two. This movie only disappoints."
"jhuni_x","4","16","86","24 June 2010"," I wouldn't recommend this dark, joyless, product-placing, fantasy/horror film
","Fantastic Elements: First of all, I am not particularly fond of the fantasy genre as a whole because of its tendency to be disconnected from reality. In the case of the Toy Story franchise, it is posited that toys can be brought to life.<br/><br/>So what is a toy? It seems that a toy could be practically anything that you like to play with, so it would then seem that anything could come to life in the Toy Story universe, which doesn't make much sense. Why do certain inanimate objects in the house become alive while the table doesn't? It seems completely arbitrary.<br/><br/>Additionally, how is it that these toys come to life even though their very own creators believe that they are merely inanimate objects? I simply don't see how they could unknowingly create these conscious beings.<br/><br/>How could the toys conceal that they are alive and why? Why would Woody for all of this time refuse to talk to Andy and then all of a sudden at the end decide to communicate to him by writing something down on a piece of paper? <br/><br/>Mrs. Potato head left her eye at Andy's house and she was still able to see with it? There is some kind of wireless transmission going on here? Why is it that Buzz Lightyear had his consciousness temporarily shut off by a process that was manufactured by humans that are presumably unaware of the toys supernatural intelligence? How exactly does this supernatural intelligence relate to the machinery that was manufactured?<br/><br/>How is it that the daycare center was able to be administered by toys like Lotso, with their surveillance footage of toys, the monkey with the security cameras, cars patrolling every night, toys constantly being moved around, toys having themselves filled with sand, and so on without being noticed by the humans??<br/><br/>There is simply too many things which don't make sense, but hey this is a fantasy film. Perhaps it is presumed that you will be incurious and mindlessly receptive to what is being presented here.<br/><br/>Plot: The plot essentially adopts a ""prison break"" style. Humans play little to no role in this film, so I think they could've just made the entire plot toy-centered, as the human-toy interactions are scarcely utilized in this movie. Instead they could've just made the film entirely centered upon humans, then it would've been considered to be a below-average prison escape film. However, they didn't do that, and people elevate this movie to a higher status because it has the toy story name and it uses the toy story characters. Personally I don't think that makes a movie good, I don't think you can just take some plot and substitute the characters for Toy Story characters and somehow come out with something that is a ""masterpiece"" as many people are claiming.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film the toys are in the comfort of Andy's home. Then at about 15:00 in the toys are mistaken for trash and thrown away. They feel rejected and they lose the comfort of their home. They then begin on a joyless and unentertaining quest to find a home that just gets darker and darker as the film goes on.<br/><br/>After leaving Andy's house they go to sunny-side daycare and at 32:00, the toys are thrown around and treated like trash by the children at the daycare, it is at this point that the film takes on its horror character and prison escape focus. The toys are put into awful and dark conditions, sometimes compared to hell and the holocaust, certainly not something young children should be exposed to.<br/><br/>At about 75:00 they decide to throw Lotso out of the daycare when they escape, and suddenly the daycare is turned into a toy utopia and suddenly all the toys are free and well off. Its not as if such changes can happen so quickly in the real world, progress is always gradual. Some people have even proposed that the toys died in the incinerator scene only to go to heaven which would explain these changes.<br/><br/>Finally, when they are free, Andy decides to give away all his toys. So what?!? If Woody really wanted to he could maintain a conversation with Andy when he is in college as his already showed that he is proficient with computers and phones, so he could just call Andy or talk to him over the internet. However, for some unexplained reason they can't converse with one another. In that case Andy can just buy new copies of those toys just as Lotso's owner replaced him so that no big deal on his part, and if Woody doesn't want to maintain a conversation with Andy that is his loss.<br/><br/>Product Placement: It just so happens that the computer Woody uses to search for his home is an Apple. We get to see many advertisements for Apple products, and there is even an iPod in there, courtesy of Pixar studios. Other products such as Mattel's Barbie & Ken dolls are advertised, and most importantly Disney has rolled out its own line of merchandise based upon the main toy story characters that will certainly be a very profitable business for them. It should be pretty clear why Disney chose to use toys in this movie when they could've just used people, they make lots of money from selling those toys. And this is not the last you are going to see of them, Disney holds the copyright on them for the foreseeable future and they will continue to sell them and build films around them, so as to maintain their profitable business.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you actually cried over this movie, save your tears for a REAL tragedy, the real tragedy is that the Chinese workers who are actually creating these toys are treated like slaves. (See the documentary - {Santa's Workshop: Inside China's Slave Labour Toy Factories})"

","I cannot think of any faults or criticisms for this movie. I fail to find even a single flaw or tiniest nitpick in any of the film's aspects. I consider this a good candidate for the title of the greatest movie of all time.<br/><br/>Every single thing is polished to a mirror shine. The story is full of humor, sadness, tension and loveliness. The characters are all hilarious and likable, yet they all have distinct personalities and traits. The animation is beyond gorgeous and the movie is full of colour, which is used very effectively to create a matching atmosphere for each scene. The comedy, both physical and verbal is brain-debilitatingly hilarious, especially a certain scene involving Buzz Lightyear and the word ""reset"".<br/><br/>There's really no point to continue this any further. This movie is as close to perfection as can be. If you haven't seen it, you should feel bad."

","Wow. I was really disappointed, and I'm shocked that the fanboys having pumped this film up to #6 on IMDb at this time. That's sheer lunacy.<br/><br/>I loved Toy Story & Toy Story 2 (which I saw again last year). The focus in those two films actually WAS on the story, and Pixar is noted for putting the story first, ahead of the animation.<br/><br/>But this time around, they REALLY missed the mark. Halfway through, I was wondering if I was watching Toy Story 2 all over again. It was all so very repetitive and boring.<br/><br/>Last, one of the notable new characters, Ken, is a closet case and it's strongly hinted at more and more as the film progresses, but Ken is never allowed to grow beyond that denial, and Barbie falls victim to his lies. How is that appropriate for a kids' film? The character should be who he is proudly, not closety. This is what we tell our kids, so why wouldn't it be the same for toys? (Focus groups, probably)<br/><br/>Of all the Pixar films, this one has the least story, the least heart, and the least fun.<br/><br/>This is not to say it doesn't have some wonderful moments. A bad Pixar film is still better than most other things out there. But this is a new low for them."

","I know how all you people think that Toy Story is awesome because it is imaginative and full of that childish innocence that you hoped that you could return to, but this is just way off the hook! For me, Toy Story has never been the favorable movie on my watch list. Somehow i never got to the point of appreciating talking toys. Creepy. Of course, the animations were okay, but you would expect them to be. What really just didn't work out for me, was the part where Jesse fell for Buzz Lightyear. Okay? What happened to the stuff in Toy Story 2? I mean, if what i am stating right now is not a spoiler, than I don't know what is. Jesse showed no signs of admiring Buzz in Toy Story 2, so what happened?

Beautifully animated with several nice set pieces, the film emotionally and character wise didn't work for me. The film, for what ever reason just seems terribly wrong. Its not the dark tone of the film that bothers me, except perhaps that the people at Pixar seem intent on making this black and bittersweet. I know part of th problem is that several of the characters, especially Woody, seem to have been shipped in from another film. How did Woody end up so psycho? I don't know.<br/><br/>I don't see the point of ripping the film apart since odds are you're going to love this.

I would absolutely NOT recommend this movie to children. While there were some funny scenes, overall the story line was pretty bad.<br/><br/>There was an option for redemption, but it did not materialize.

","The third movie of the Toy Story trilogy is the one most recommended. It suppose to be very emotional and probably the best movie of that year. I confess, it took me a long time to finally get to watch it, and I was excited to. But I think that I was expecting too much of the movie. It was entertaining and at some pints very funny, but it's not as good as the first movie. The film centres around the rescue of the toys from their new home and the ups and downs are all over Toy Story 3. The twists aren't that good, but I suppose they are okay. The one sided story line was sprinkled with some nostalgia over Andy's childhood and growing up. However if the growing up and becoming an adult scenes were more and the ups and downs on the rescue were less, than probably it would have been better for me."

In part one, it was the new toy (Buzz) challenging the viability of the old one (Woody). Part two is more of an origins tale. The trend continues in part three, this time dealing with the growing-up of toy owner Andy.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, Toy Story 3 sees the toybox gang (led as usual by Woody the Cowboy and Buzz the Space Ranger) trying to deal with Andy going away to college. When some of the toys panic in thinking they will end up in the city refuse, they ""escape"" to a local daycare, where life seems to be fine. However, the idyllic daycare future (where toys always get played with) may not be as rosy as it seems, forcing the toys to make some tough decisions about returning to Andy or moving on with their lives.<br/><br/>All the good stuff that made the franchise what it is today is present in this film: the strong lead characters, the wise-cracking ""peanut gallery"" of supporting characters, and the hilarious sight gags that will thrill both young and old. Also, the animation is slicker than ever (compare technology from the mid-90s to today and you'll get the picture), bringing the characters and their rich environments to live in even more vivid clarity.<br/><br/>However, what really sets this film apart from other Pixar fare is its attention to themes that tug at everyone's heartstrings. The toys struggle with their loyalty to Andy (who has inevitably outgrown them) vs. their desire to still be played with (every toy's greatest joy). At times, you might wonder just why exactly you are misting end (especially towards the end) about chunks of plastic animated on screen, but then you'll remember: Because they DO mean something to you, as they share the same struggles as normal people. Unlike perhaps any other children's film franchise in history, Toy Story really creates an unbreakable emotional bond between ""actors"" and audience.<br/><br/>If this is indeed the final chapter in the Toy Story saga (and the ending, while emotional, leaves some wiggle room for the future), it went out on the highest of possible notes. It will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and, perhaps most importantly: FEEL."
"jcaesar-01251","7","1","2","3 March 2017"," Toy Story 3 brings the emotional depth so you bring the box of tissues.
","This is a kid's movies for adults. To me, Toy Story 1 is my favorite Toy Story of them all (which is three). It was a film about the relationship between Andy and his toys, much like Toy Story 2's plot. This story focuses on the relationships but in an abstract way, the toys end up going through an evil, cuddly teddy bear and a garbage incinerator to try return to Andy, who in turns hands over his beloved toys to another young human who he knows will take care of them like he did. For me, the film lacked the humanity that the previous two films had, and tried to make up with through action and humor, though it took away from the characters and emotions. Overall I found it a befitting end to an awesome and potential genre defining animated trilogy. I love this film and hope you will too."
"chris82392-2-494338","10","1","2","6 February 2016"," This movie doesn't need another glowing review, but I'm giving it one.
","Toy Story 1 and 2 came out when I was young enough to be ACTUALLY playing with toys, instead of leaving them on my shelf and looking at them, like now. Fast forward to 2010 when Andy was going to college and leaving his toys behind, I was doing the exact same. I gave away all of my Lego bricks and other toys to charity and my old day care. It hit me hard in the heart the way only PIXAR can. And time has just made it grow. If you watch any retrospective review of it, they talk about the layers this movie has, the symbolism, the meaning. And all they HAD to do was make a dumb sequel to turn a profit. Instead they created a masterpiece. A collaborative work of art that I will praise till my death-holy f#%k that got dark. I'm sorry I got swept up there. 10/10 will watch forever. Thank you PIXAR."
"trooper5783","10","1","2","28 January 2016"," Awesome movie! One of my favorite animations EVER!
","Back in 2010, I was living in Spain, and me and my family went to go see this at the drive- in at the Naval Base(my dad was in the Navy for years, so the movie was in English because there were many Americans living there). My dad and my brother thought it was not that good, my mom and I thought it was great! The visuals are brilliantly creative and somewhat realistic, the gags are hilarious, the heart is darker than the other two, the voice work is delightful and the score by Randy Newman is absolutely amazing! I'm getting this for my 3D TV because some people say the 3D effects are spectacular. And on that note, the attention to detail looks like it can fit the technology. I love this movie, it's the best of the three Toy Storys and the perfect finale to an already perfect trilogy. I give this 10/10, no flaws with this movie at all."
"tdavis-27311","10","1","2","4 January 2016"," Best Movie Ever!
","""You've got a friend in me,"" go the lyrics to the Randy Newman tune that has been crooned in all of Pixar's magical Toy Story films, including the brand-new Toy Story 3. It's a catchy little ditty, and it might even trick you into thinking the films are about friendship. But you'd be wrong.<br/><br/>Despite the buddy-action trappings that made it seem like Woody and Buzz were starring in plastic-plaything spins on 48 Hrs. or Lethal Weapon, the Toy Storys have always been about the emotional Tilt-a-Whirl that is love—and more specifically, about family love. The 1995 original was a tale of sibling rivalry, with Woody (Tom Hanks) learning to make peace with the ""new baby""—Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen)—stealing his owner Andy's attention; 1999's Toy Story 2 pondered the risks and rewards of opening up to intimate connection. And this time around—in yet another Pixar triumph of profoundly felt storytelling—it's time to talk about letting go.<br/><br/>Of course, because these guys are too sneaky just to serve up the vegetables of a moral, they wrap it in irresistible cotton candy. The 11 years since Toy Story 2 have passed almost in real time, with a now-17-year-old Andy preparing to leave home for college. That's not great news for a bunch of childhood toys, with Woody, Buzz and company facing the prospect of either attic storage or donation to a day-care center. But while a sentimental Andy intends the former, a mix-up finds the toys barely escaping the garbage and on their way to Sunnyside Day Care.<br/><br/>At first, it seems like the gang has lucked out. The de facto leader of the day-care center's toys, a strawberry-scented, stuffed Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty), welcomes them all warmly, and there will be kids to play with them for the first time in years. Then, the rampaging toddlers show upÑand a plan for escape starts to form.<br/><br/>In typical Pixar form, the adventure elements from director Lee Unkrich are splendidly and inventively choreographed. Woody's solo dash from captivity is a snappy set piece, and the complex, Great Escape-type plan of those who eventually follow includes some hilarious moments, including Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) being forced to attach his features to a floppy flour tortilla. There are great new character additions like a foppish Ken doll (Michael Keaton), and a stuffed hedgehog named Mr. Pricklepants (Timothy Dalton) with serious thespian pretensions. There are also giddy details galore, like a Speak-n-Spell being turned into a casino game for the day-care toys' after-hours amusement, or the retro fashion show that allows Ken to show off his extensive wardrobe (including a Nehru jacket!).<br/><br/>But this is also a Toy Story with a unique sense of the passage of time, subtly suggested by the casting of John Morris—who voiced the young Andy in both earlier Toy Story installments as a child—to again play the role as an adult. A generation has grown up with these characters—Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Blake Clark, replacing the late Jim Varney)—and we might think of them as family. But in Toy Story 3, we also see them thinking of one another as family, facing the kind of complex decisions every family faces. When a climactic scene finds them linking hands during a crisis, it's one of the most genuinely lump-in-the-throat movie moments since ... well, probably since the last Pixar movie.<br/><br/>It might seem at first glance that Toy Story 3 is merely riffing on the same aforementioned theme already nailed in Toy Story 2, including a montage that recalls the heartbreaking ""When She Loved Me"" sequence. In fact, Toy Story 3 is actually taking that concept—the risk and inherent pain in any intimate relationship—to an even more sophisticated level. As the final 20 minutes of the film play out, screenwriter Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine) spins us through the wrenching landmark moments when family members need to say their goodbyes, and feel the ache of transitions. What continues to astonish about the Pixar films is the way they manage to pair blissful entertainment with the miraculous experience of being human—and in Toy Story 3, that includes the wonderful, awful, vertiginous experience of sharing a home, a history and a heart."
"epicphanpy","10","1","2","29 March 2015"," One of the best films I have watched!
","The Toy Story series was created amazingly well. Each movie brings comedy, fun, suspension, and happiness. Every time I watch a Toy Story movie, it becomes the highlight of the month. The movie is just incredible. <br/><br/>The film is perfect for families to watch together. All the movies bring excitement for the next, and I can say I am as excited as never before for the fourth movie. This doesn't mean the specials (Toy story of terror, etc.) are not bad. Like all Toy Story films, the shorts are just as amazing and fun to watch. <br/><br/>Back on to Toy Story 3. This movie brings toys to life once more, in a huge adventure where the toys get accidentally taken to a day care center, and it is up to Woody to convince the others that they weren't abandoned and to return home. <br/><br/>You might need to bring tissues - my Mum cried at one part :)"
"sandnair87","10","1","2","19 March 2015"," Heartfelt Swan Song to Andy's Toys!
","From the ever-reliable purveyors of digital charm at Pixar, Toy Story 3 is a bona-fide summer delight loaded with action, humor, nostalgia, a veritable blizzard of pop-culture references and general good vibes. It is injected with humour and powered by fun as the adventures of Woody, Buzz and Co brings these toys together in ways that will entertain and move you.<br/><br/>Andy is all grown up and about to drive off to college. His mom meanwhile wants his room cleared, leaving the fate of his toys uncertain. Fears of the unknown, of neglect and abuse, are gradually eclipsed by the threat of disposal. The whole gang gets caught in an odyssey of compounded indignities and the misunderstanding consigns the toys to Sunnyside Daycare, presented as a heavenly vision of constant, collective ownership and communal living. Alas, their utopia turns out to be a veritable penal colony, presided over by a tyrannical pink huggybear called Lotso (who makes a terrifically malignant bad guy) and his two henchmen, a bumbling lazy-eyed baby doll and Barbie's swishy soul mate Ken. It is here that our latest adventure begins.<br/><br/>This time around, we get to see it all as the characters experience true peril (don't miss the brilliantly choreographed garbage dump incinerator scene), exciting adventure, genuine emotion, and the importance of love in one's life. What the film does so beautifully is to twist the existential crisis of a toy into a reckoning of our younger selves. It understands how we attach fond significance to those things that have been mute companions and witnesses through the years, and have measured our lost time. It is a poignancy that gathers such force by the end that your eyes, already moistened around the edges, will start teeming helplessly.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 hits every button from laughter to tears and lifts you up on waves of visual bedazzlement. Unflinchingly honest and genuinely moving, Toy Story 3 is a marvel, an absolute touchstone in movie history. Tag it as one of Pixar's best!"
"lauragrieme","10","1","2","16 March 2015"," Growing Up With Toy Story
","I was born in the early 90's, and grew up with Toy Story. I would always peek in my room and try to see if my toys were alive. Not only is the whole concept of Toy Story brilliant, but they ended the story exceptionally well. <br/><br/>The story, while a cartoon, faces real life problems. Growing up isn't easy, and saying goodbye to parts of your past is extremely difficult. It shows that you have to be careful who you trust, because some people aren't always going to be nice to you (like Lotso). It teaches you how to love with the whole ""about to be burned alive but holding hands"" thing (which was a little traumatizing, but heartwarming because all of these toys really loved each other). And most importantly, it teaches you how to be optimistic of the future. While it was heartbreaking to see the toys and Andy part, we were left optimistic that this new little girl was going to have many years with these toys to look forward to. <br/><br/>This installment was wonderful and really hit home for me. I actually cried at the end when Andy left for college, because that following year I was going away to college as well. To me, this franchise isn't just a cartoon, it's a journey. And this last installment really brought the journey to a fabulous end."
"paul2001sw-1","8","1","2","27 December 2014"," Not quite as fresh as its predecessors, but still funny and moving
","The original 'Toy Story' was not only the world's first fully digitally animated feature, but also funny and original, the story of toys who just wanted to be played with, but who lived with the fear of redundancy and, in the case of Buzz Lightyear, an identity crisis (Buzz believing himself to be a real spaceman, and not just a toy). It played with the dual life every child ascribes to their toys, and brilliantly exploited its novel medium's ability to combine realism and fantasy. The sequel was pretty good as well. 'Toy Story 3' isn't bad either, although the idea is, inevitably, not quite as fresh in its third outing, the basic dynamic of the plot mirroring that of the two earlier films. There are still some fine moments: when Buzz gets stuck in his Spanish mode, the result is truly hilarious, and the scene in the furnace room more affecting than a story about talking toys has any right to be. The ending of the tale implies this is probably the final outing for these characters, and I think that's the right decision. But the series remains comparable in its quality to the best of Pixar's subsequent, much-admired work."
"drqshadow-reviews","10","1","2","1 December 2014"," A Wonderful Throwback to the Days of Pixar Yonder
","Like an old slugger on the downswing of his career, under the right circumstances Pixar can still knock the ball out of the park. Toy Story 3 is living proof, vivid and playful and touching and meaningful at or above the lofty levels of their mid-peak masterworks. With a true ensemble cast, it allows the old stars to spin their familiar spells while tossing in a few new supporting players (Michael Keaton as Barbie's beau Ken is especially entertaining) but wisely doesn't focus on any single character for too long. With a roster this well developed, still clicking deep in their third feature, why not celebrate that kind of rare, wonderful diversity? I'm glad Pixar waited to tell the right story, too: the level of care, meaning and power that's on display here simply doesn't come around all that often. Let's do it right or not at all, yeah? Needless to add, it's a stunner visually, with brighter colors, more brilliant settings and no shortage of Pixar charm fitting right in alongside the timeless character designs and visual themes of the two preceding films. An essential tale that's effectively moving, sweet, heartfelt and hilarious... and maybe even the best chapter of the trilogy."
"thedudeabides-2","10","1","2","31 July 2014"," Fantastic end to a fantastic trilogy
","How many times have you cried at a movie aimed at kids? There are only a few notable examples with Bambi perhaps being the most popular. Well now you can add Toy Story 3 to that list. Pixar's third and, most likely, final outing for Woody, Buzz and co. has all the hallmarks of a Pixar movie. Eye meltingly beautiful animation, silly jokes aimed at kids, clever jokes aimed at adults and a surprising amount of adult content hidden in the subtext.<br/><br/>It had been 12 years since the second movie when Toy Story 3 was released but the folks at Pixar haven't missed a beat. Fittingly, we join Woody and the gang as they reach the end of their 'careers' as Andy's toys. Andy is now 17 and heading off to college, leading the toys to the realisation that they are no longer needed. A mix up with the garbage leads to the toys being sent to Sunnyside day care – a child's nursery which shares more than a passing resemblance to a retirement community.<br/><br/>It sounds a little depressing but this couldn't be further from the truth, as Woody and co. meet some of Pixar's most memorable characters to date, with Micheal Keaton's Ken doll being a particular highlight. The plot plays like a toy version of The Great Escape as the toys realise everything is not as rosy as it appears and must subsequently engineer an escape. There are some truly inspired scenes which take advantage of the central premise of toys coming to life; such as a group of toys playing poker inside a vending machine, a traumatic pre-school playtime at Sunnyside and a spectacular ending inside a trash compactor.<br/><br/>The subtext of retirement lends the film an emotional undercurrent not normally found in a kid's movie and you may find yourself complaining of something in your eye on more than one occasion; but you will be doing so with a huge smile on your face. <br/><br/>A masterpiece of animation from a company at the very top of its game. Toy Story 3 builds on the successes of its predecessors to deliver an emotionally charged, hilarious ending to the trilogy. A must see."

","From the moment I heard there was going to be yet another Toy Story, I was immediately excited and I had a right to be. Normally when you know another movie is coming out you may assume that there shouldn't have been a point and it would ruin the films altogether, however Toy Story 3 didn't. This movie was excellent from start to finish. I would even be happy to see a 4th one! The storyline was great! To be honest at the end I did feel emotional, these talking toys have been a huge part of Disney and Pixar and now that it's over you wonder if anything can replace it but it can't. I do believe that they did a brilliant job with this movie. One I do watch again and again."
"Marc_Israel_365","8","1","2","18 March 2014"," The best of the series due to the writing
","What we have here is the incredible ability to communicate. Toy Story 3 delivers the most vast experience through multiple themes of aging, family, duty, self awareness and resolution. Our toy friends are mostly all back and they stay true to their character, while clever writing literally reprograms another. When faced with their challenge of survival, each point is thoughtfully made and yet we have a difference of opinion. They are splitting up themselves, not by an act of an outside force or circumstance. This was the best of the film. Kids learn to review their thoughts and that we are all fallible and we all change. Wonderful. Our ending is way more tense that I would have liked (did anyone else think of The Holocaust?) but the experience has its merits if not for pushing us to the edge. Seeing this many times at home shows this will hold up over time and really does complete our Toy Trilogy."

Watching Andy be a grown up had me crying, thinking that would be ME in a few years...going off to college- leaving my room with all my cute stuffed animals.

Toy Story 3 was also the first film to be released theatrically with 7.1 surround sound.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on the toys Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and their friends dealing with an uncertain future as their owner, Andy, prepares to leave for college. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Don Rickles, Estelle Harris, John Ratzenberger, Wallace Shawn, Jeff Pidgeon, Jodi Benson, R. Lee Ermey, John Morris and Laurie Metcalf reprise their voice-over roles from the previous films. Jim Varney, who played Slinky Dog in the first two films, and Joe Ranft, who portrayed Lenny and Wheezy, both died before production began on Toy Story 3. The role of Slinky Dog was taken over by Blake Clark, while Ranft's characters and various others were written out of the story. New characters include performances by Ned Beatty, Timothy Dalton, Kristen Schaal, Bonnie Hunt, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeff Garlin, and Michael Keaton.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Andy leaving for college and donating his beloved toys -- including Woody and Buzz -- to a daycare. While the crew meets new friends, including Ken, they soon grow to hate their new surroundings and plan an escape.<br/><br/>The movie has a story with timeless, universal themes: family, coming of age (and leaving behind childish things), and the inevitable time when, past our prime, we will all face potential social obsolescence.Aside from that,Another worthy entry in a much-heralded series that amounts to a prison break story as exciting in its own way as Steve McQueen's ""The Great Escape"".And finally,it is a deftly blending comedy, adventure, and honest emotion that makes it a rare second sequel that really works which makes it one of the best movies released back in 2010."

","I'm one of the rare few that really disliked the second Toy Story film. Mostly because of the annoying bitch Jessie. She's here again, but she's sidelined quite a bit. The third entry into the franchise has Woody as the focus, and the story naturally progresses as Andy is getting ready to leave for college. It sets up some familiar and some new themes, involving abandonment, friendship, and moving on in life. It's these themes that allow this to be a mature film without disappointing the kids. Plenty of action, lots of laughs, and some great humor, kick this way past the 2nd installment. I didn't feel it was as complete as many have said, nor was the intensity matched by real sacrifice. The film realises that the best thing about the original was Buzz's delusions. So naturally they reintroduce it here as he is ""reset"". I guess I'm not that emotionally attached to this movie because I never gave up my most favourite toys. I believe people crying over this just feel guilty for giving up on their childhood. Entertaining, and wonderful, but lacking what I truly loved about the first film."

"jzappa","8","1","2","10 August 2011"," Goodbyes are Hard
","I don't think ""good enough"" is something that's ever assumed at Pixar. Their labor of love, Toy Story 3, even bids a long-standing justification for careless filmmaking: It's a sequel. In 3D, which thankfully wasn't part of my experience. If truth be told, how good do the studio pushers and enlisted creative staff need to strive for it to be? Well, as it appears, this entire three-part, 15-year blockbuster about the escapades of a cluster of juvenile plastic items has come to be a lingering, melancholy reflection on bereavement, transience and love.<br/><br/>As endurers of for example Terminator 3, Live Free or Die Hard and Blues Brothers 2000 understand, too many outings, especially johnny-come-lately sequels, can be the fatal blow for a high-quality franchise. Toy Story 3 has flourished where others have staggered since it has remained faithful to its extraction at the same time it's further developed its scope. And since in ways both major and minor the people behind the series just adore movies. A fantastical rendering of the end of formative years and the consequence of friendship in preserving that warm constancy through life's transformations, this, Pixar's highest-grossing spectacle so far, focuses on the basis for why we constantly revisit the cinematic experience. As written by Oscar-winning Little Miss Sunshine writer Michael Arndt, quite impressive considering the enormous committee of writers typically developing animated films, this transcendent variation on the buddy film manages to suggest danger and excitement as well as unforeseen moments of sorrow. Preeminent, and most distinctive of Pixar on the whole, it grasps authentic feeling and puts it on the screen in a way generationally, culturally and perceptively universal.<br/><br/>The circumstances put forward an occasion for a handful of movie gags, a favorite Pixar idiosyncrasy. Look forward to lots of allusions to Cool Hand Luke and The Bridge on the River Kwai. But generally it's an opening to be in these characters' warm company again. An opportunity to meet new acquaintances as well, as Barbie encounters the man of her dreams, complete with a pastel leisure suit and glossy narcissism. It's all pleasurable, but also craftily executed, with an infatuated consideration of nuance. The Ken doll moves precisely like a Ken doll would. The wind-up monkey hits his cymbals in exact, unenthusiastically automatic shudders. Scenes are neatly paced and climaxes develop further climaxes.<br/><br/>In some sense, the story of a troupe of toys struggling to meet their duties and confront change, in another a musing on the edge of youth and the value of love in defining the stages in one's life, this epic anthropomorphic love saga persists in achieving the ridiculous by making every age group in every family in North America accept that toys are people too, distinctive individuals with psyches and viewpoints of their own. A reflection on the brink of changing times and the importance of love as continuity between those often truly frightening transitions, it's arguably quite a radical vision for a big movie-going event for whole families. It doesn't gloss over the very real fears it suggests, but deals with them in ways that are liberating for children who weren't born yet when the first two films were released, as well as cathartic for those of us who knew Woody and Buzz as youngsters ourselves. Now, we're Andy's age. And boy, is it tough to say goodbye."

","After watching the very first two movies of the Toy Story franchise, I fell in love with the story, the characters, and the movie itself. When I heard that a third movie was in the making, I was so excited. It became the most anticipated movie of 2010 for me. When seeing ""Toy Story 3"", the third and final installment had something that the first two didn't have. A dramatic, heartwarming, and tear-dropping storyline. The movie involved Andy heading for college, and the toys are accidentally sent to a day-care center. While the toys are enjoying their new life in the day care, which is secretly ruled by an evil bear doll named Lotso, portrayed by Ned Beatty, Woody meets some new faces while trying to get back to Andy. Then, the whole movie focuses on trying to get back home and start a new life. During the film, the film teaches the importance of letting go and moving on. The film was actually the best movie in the ""Toy Story"" series. I was amazed on how many times I've laughed and cried, but mostly cried. I couldn't stop thinking about that movie for days. New characters including Michael Keaton as Ken, Jodi Benson as ""Barbie"", and Ned Beatty with his best role as the evil Lotso Bear, really make the movie a lot more special. The story was filled with much heart, and was well-written with comedy and drama. The film took us back to our childhood memories, and brought us to a time when we enjoyed these movies when we were little. That's what made this movie make a billion dollars in the box office this year! With a heartbreaking finale and the return of our beloved friends, this movie is a total must-see. ""Toy Story 3"", in my review, ""A fun, and beautiful family reunion, with talking toys!"""
"Doylenf","8","1","2","16 February 2011"," Abandoned toys make their great escape in sequel that exceeds expectations...
","If ever there was a film that exceeds all expectations it's Pixar's TOY STORY 3, a movie with the familiar cast headed by TOM HANKS and TIM ALLEN as Woody and Buzz Lightyear, respectively, featuring the further adventures of the toy gang everyone fell in love with after the first smash hit.<br/><br/>The toys are accidentally abandoned when Andy's mom is helping him pack for college. They end up dumped unceremoniously at a daycare center for kids whom the toys think will appreciate and play with them just as Andy did--with tender, loving care. <br/><br/>As they discover on their first day in the playroom, these kids are a nightmare with toys. Woody resolves to return to his owner's attic while the others stay behind until they must plan their great escape. What happens next is unpredictable from start to finish, the only certainty being that there will be a happy ending--which gives the story a final tug on the heartstrings with a poignant and tender conclusion.<br/><br/>This is animation that is beyond clever, as imaginative as a film of this kind can get, masterfully staged and brilliantly animated. It's also a bit scary at times since all of the characters almost meet their final destiny a number of times, long before the story is over, thanks to a villainous plush toy bear called Lotso, wonderfully voiced by Ned Beatty, hug-gable on the surface but a scoundrel at the core.<br/><br/>Since all the technical stuff is beyond reproach, there's no reason why TOY STORY 3 shouldn't please fans of the first two in this series and even exceed expectations with a story of depth, compassion and humor that gets better as it goes along.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"Buddy-51","9","1","2","26 January 2011"," a beautifully realized story about friendship
","Lee Unkrich's ""Toy Story 3"" plays a little like an expanded version of ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" crossed with Rankin/Bass' ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer"" - with a bit of ""Stalag 17"" and ""The Great Escape"" thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>It's eleven years since we last checked in on Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie and all the other occupants of little Andy's toy box. Only little Andy ain't so little anymore, and as he embarks on a new life in college, his once-beloved companions fret over what is to become of them now that they'll no longer be getting the kind of attention and affection all toys need to be happy (actually they haven't been getting much play time at all for the past few years of Andy's adolescence). Woody insists that they must stay loyal to Andy, but the others fear it may be time to move on to friendlier, more kid-centric territory or face an ignominious end, thrown to the curb so some giant garbage truck can scoop them up and mash them into plastic pulp. Instead, through a series of crazy misunderstandings, they all wind up in the local daycare-center-from-hell (sort of a more sinister version of the Island of Misfit Toys), where they are placed at the mercy of both a band of overexcited toddlers and a bunch of sadistic playthings who rule the place with an iron fist. Only Woody manages to escape their evil clutches and, like the true cowboy hero of old, he comes up with a plan to rescue his desperate compadres from this virtual armed camp, ironically named Sunnyside.<br/><br/>It seems redundant at this point to keep heaping praise on these Pixar productions, so let me just say that ""Toy Story 3"" is a true crowd-pleasing delight, a witty, endlessly inventive, and visually stunning animated movie that works equally well for youngsters who are still playing with their toys and old folks who might well become inspired to head up to that old attic and dust off some long-forgotten buddies of their own. The voice work by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Estelle Harris, et.al., brings each and every one of these charmingly diverse and beautifully differentiated characters to vivid life. We're so familiar with them ourselves at this point that they almost feel like they came out of OUR toy boxes. It's also fun watching the movie make villains out of some seemingly innocuous, even cuddly, toys like the embittered, strawberry-scented teddy bear who runs the joint and a diaper-clad baby doll that serves as his loyal henchman.<br/><br/>In addition to high comedy, Michael Arndt's script provides a careful balance of breath-bating suspense and heartbreaking sentiment (believe me, there won't be a dry eye in the house at the end), as it explores the universal themes of camaraderie, friendship and the importance of working together in a common cause.<br/><br/>Whether young or old, 2-D or 3-D, at ""Toy Story 3,"" everyone can be a kid again."
"katie-sirles","9","1","2","20 January 2011"," Toy Story 3
","Disney and Pixar have done it again. Toy Story 3 opens with an action packed scene in the old west with all of the old classics. Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky Dog, Rex, Jessie, Buzz, and of course, Woody. The suspense is at its peak when we are taken to Andy's bedroom. He is a little boy and he is just as we remember him from years ago. Flash-forward via camcorder montage to present day. Andy is getting ready to go off to college and the first thought I have is ""My, how you've grown! You've gotten so big!"" As if I were watching a real child grow up and go off to school.<br/><br/>The toys are in remarkably good shape considering it's been ages since we've seen them last. In the same old toy box from the days of yore, the group is devising a plan to get their kid, Andy, to want to play with them again. If they are very lucky, they will get to accompany him to college. In a clever trick using the house phone and Andy's cell phone, the toys make one last-ditch effort to gain back the love Andy once had for them.<br/><br/>When faced with the question of what he wants to do with those old toys, Andy tosses Woody in a box marked ""College"" but puts the rest of the toys in a black garbage bag. While Andy's original intentions were to take the toys up to the attic, an inevitable turn of events leaves the toys on the curb, dreadfully awaiting the garbage man. Woody races to their rescue and is swept up in the mix and taken with the rest of his comrades to be donated to daycare.<br/><br/>Upon arrival, the group is welcomed by the other toys with open arms. Lotso, the huggin' strawberry-scented bear, comes out to act as tour guide for the toys and acts just as sweet as he smells. With his buddy for life, Big Baby, he shows the toys around and promises them that they will be played with everyday from here on out. The clan is filled with glee at the thought of being played with and start to accept this new reality.<br/><br/>Woody wants to stand by his kid because even though the rest of the group believes that Andy intended to throw them away, Woody knows it was all a big misunderstanding and that Andy really does love them.<br/><br/>Throughout the rest of the movie, the audience meets a slew of new characters, some friend and some foe. Notable voices include the charter members of the movie. Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as Rex, John Ratzenberger as Hamm and Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom. Some of the same from the second installment return as well. Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head, Joan Cusack as Jessie, and my girl Jodi Benson as Barbie. The same Jodi Benson who voiced Ariel in The Little Mermaid and more recently played Robert's assistant in Enchanted. I was simply ashamed of myself for not picking out her voice before the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Newcomer to the trilogy, Ken, is voiced by Michael Keaton. Ken is dimwitted and hilarious and a welcome addition to the movie. One of my favorite bits in the film was when the team has to help Buzz come to his senses and discover a highly comical defect in his factory settings.<br/><br/>Get your tissues ready, ladies and gentlemen, because my eyes were not dry at the end of this delightful little romp. The movie is fun, touching, full of laughs, and will surely remind you of those dusty old toys in your attic."
"JakePFC","10","1","2","19 January 2011"," For those who didn't grow up with Toy Story, this is fantastic. For those who did, this is beyond that.
","I think I'm lucky in that the timing for Toy Story 3 to come out was absolutely perfect for me. The first Toy Story was released when I was about four or five, at the beginning of my childhood. The final installment came out when I was 18, and a few months away from leaving home. That practically made it symbolic to me, whether the film was great or not.<br/><br/>Putting that aside, this film is still extraordinarily good. It hits every note it needs to in order for it to be a classic film. It's funny, it's imaginative, there's adventures in there, the characters show their strengths and flaws, there's drama, there's emotion. It's everything you could want it to be.<br/><br/>To start with, it's a good story. I'm glad they went for the beginning of the end with Andy moving out of home, because it settles that presumption that the toys would eventually just all be thrown out in the end.<br/><br/>The idea of the toys finding themselves in a nursery was a good one. It allowed a lot of imaginative and clever characters, as well as this new big world for our characters to explore. Without giving too much away, the plot to escape was easily the most entertaining part of the film, with the ridiculous intricacy of the idea making it quite an intense part of the film, broken up by some fantastic visual jokes.<br/><br/>There's two scenes toward the end where people will tell you they cried. Though I personally didn't (which took some effort), it's not hard to see why. It's incredible that they managed to make these lifeless toys into something we, as an audience, could feel so emotional about though. That, for me, is the ultimate triumph of this film. They have essentially made them human in our eyes.<br/><br/>I just loved Toy Story 3. It's not often I can sit with my four-year old brother and get the same level of enjoyment from a film as him, but Toy Story went beyond all presumed possibilities. It's perhaps the perfect family film."

","I was never a lover for Pixar movies as they were somewhat boring to my likings so when I got the DVD of this for as a present for my brother as he like Toy Story I decided to get the loan of it off him.<br/><br/>I liked Toy Story because its cool to see what would happen if your toys came to life when no one was around.<br/><br/>Winner of 2 GOLDEN GLOBES TOY STORY 3 is about Woody's(TOM HANKS FROM CHARLIE WILSONS WAR) and Buzz's(TIM ALLEN FROM SANTA CLAUSE FRANCHISE)owner Andy who is all grown up and he is going to college. Of course he can't bring his toys with him so he decides to put them in the attic.But when his mother notices the black bag she thinks it garbage and so they are sent to the trash bin. They manage to escape and so they decide to go to Sunnyville which is a children's crèche where they donate unwanted toys. Woody and the gang meet new friends and Barbie(JODI BENSON FROM ENCHANTED AND SHE VOICED ARIEL IN THE LITTLE MERMAID BACK IN 1989)meets Ken(Micheal KEATON FROM HERBIE FULLY LOADED)and they meet an evil pink bear(VOICED BY TIMOTHY DALTON)who apparently thinks that children don't love toys as his previous owner lost him and she replaced the bear for another one.<br/><br/>The toys of course are in great danger and they try to save the day as usual. Personally when I seen this movie last night on DVD I said to myself this is going to suck big time as I mentioned above that I never liked Pixar movies I mean NEVER but when I saw this film I actually liked it. I always liked Toy Story anyway and the story was touching and heartwarming especially the ending which if you wanna know Andy decides to give all his toys away to some little girl in the end and the music by RANDY NEWMAN who did the likes of THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG,MEET THE PARENTS ETC.<br/><br/>If you want to see this film whether your a 65 year old man or woman or a 4 year old child or any age then I highly recommend this film to anyone who liked Toy Story since it debuted in 1995.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: A winner 8/10"

","I never was a fan of Toy Story movies. They seemed like something I'd not like. I felt like they weren't my age. That's why I never watched them. Fortunately, I found myself today unable to find a good movie. I searched and searched and decided I should watch some movie like Monsters INC or Tangled. Good I chose to watch Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>You see, I am in a place in my life where everyone tell me to leave everything childish behind. I'm on a border, like every person on Earth, a border between childhood world and real world. And I felt the movie really close to myself for that reason. It did not only show my feelings about my old toys, it showed my feelings about childhood. I never wanted to leave it but on certain age you must. Of course I do things grown people should do and I like them, just when I find some thing from childhood I feel amazingly happy for finding out I was this person before. A kid, a kid who believed in fairy tales and different worlds. This movie reminded me of this lost world of happiness, joy, friendship, dreams and unreal reality. It reminded me of this girl in me that I try to hide because I have to \, because it's inappropriate for a girl my age, in college and with responsibilities, to act like a kid. <br/><br/>It's really an amazing movie. It takes great imagination to do such a movie and everyone will like it I'm sure. Because it's good for everybody. For kids, grown ups, teenagers who crosses the line and people who just left the kid in them behind."

","I was waiting for 11 years for the next Toy Story 3. At first when the trailer came out I thought oh jeez this might not work at all. I WAS STONE DEAD WRONG! I came in to the theater and my childhood heroes are back on the big screen. Woody and Buzz Lightyear! OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I thought this is going to be great!!!! The movie starts off with the iconic song ""you've got a friend in me"" and it shows flash backs of Andy's childhood with him playing his toys.<br/><br/>I won't say anymore about the plot (although you have to see at the two movies to understand the references if you're a newcomer to the franchise), but WOW!!!!!!!!! IT WAS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It wasn't an animated movie just for kids. It was for everybody who grew up with Toy Story as a kid like myself.<br/><br/>It was a grown up cartoon that any movie buff would love. It was funny, it was exciting, it had...drama and also made you get into...tears? Geez PIXAR, you make everybody bring in tissue boxes with your movies, but you guys make perfect movies.

I haven't seen My Neighbour Tottoro yet but I'd absolutely love to do that soon.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 will stay in my heart forever along with the other Toy Story movies. It looks like Up won't be the only computer animated movie to be nominated for best picture much longer. Move over Shrek, Toy Story 3 kicked your franchise's ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","2","7 November 2010"," Toy Story 3 Makes For One Of The Finest Trilogies
","Very rarely does a movie live up to its 'predecessors'. The 'Toy Story' sequels did it twice. I was out and out amused by 'Toy Story'. I loved 'Toy Story 2' and now the third film is just as remarkable. The talented people at Pixar know how to give gems.<br/><br/>For me, 'Toy Story 3' holds tremendous nostalgic value. I recognized many of the toys that I used to have as a child (and have long since been removed from shelves in toy shops). All 'Toy Story' films express the significance of toys in people's lives, like how toys help develop creativity and imagination, nurture attachments and relationships and how symbolic they are. This one shows how, as children grow up and move to different things, toys hold lesser value to them. What was once so precious to a child that he would spend hours of the day with, will eventually end up stored in a carton or thrown away. I could relate very well to the Andy character and how it was difficult for him to let go of what was so precious to him when he was a boy.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Toy Story 3' is just as delightful, colourful and vivacious as its prequels. It's loaded with energy. The cool gang that included Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Lotso, the Potato Heads, Rex, Hamm and friends are back for another awesome adventure. Some very interesting new characters have been introduced. The voice cast is as excellent as ever which isn't much of a surprise since it includes Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Don Rickles, Estelle Harris, Jodi Benson, Wallace Shawn and many more.<br/><br/>Easily, this little gem makes 'Toy Story' one of the finest trilogies. Needless to say, it's the best of what I've seen of 2010 thus far and I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone."

Toy Story was just a well made masterpiece that Will go down as one of the best movies ever made!!1"
"tieman64","Null","1","2","2 September 2010"," The Brave Little Toaster
","The first ""Toy Story"" movie was about a Space Ranger called Buzz Lightyear who realizes that he is not a ""unique and special toy"" but a mass-produced piece of plastic. In a bit of reverse Nietzscheism, Buzz therefore casts aside his delusions of grandeur (""To Infinity and Beyond!"") and learns to find value in his lowly community of toys.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 2"" told virtually the same tale, but instead of a toy called Woody teaching Buzz the value of community, we had the reverse, Buzz and his friends trying to convince Woody not to abandon his toy family in favour for life in a classy museum.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" rehashes this tale (right down to the kindly old man who turns out to be the villain), but is more explicit in its existentialism. Here, Woody makes the argument that the purpose of a toy is to ""be there for Andy whenever he needs them"". Toys therefore believe themselves to be the servants of their owner Andy, who is portrayed as a sort of pint-sized God. No matter how apathetic or neglectful Andy is, Woody believes that the value of a toy comes from its usefulness and acceptance by its master. In other words, toys only have extrinsic value. This is a direct contrast to most religions and cultures, which all stress that humans have intrinsic value. <br/><br/>Before Andy goes off to college, his mother gives him a cardboard box and a garbage bag. ""Decide,"" she says, ""which things you're going to throw away and which you're going to store in the attic!"" As the toys view the attic and the garbage bag (and later a garbage dump) as miniature versions of heaven and hell, Andy's choice is awaited with apprehension by our gang of plastic heroes.<br/><br/>Due to a misunderstanding, the toys all think they are being thrown out. Better to escape now, they decide, and flee to Sunnyside, a daycare centre which is portrayed as a Retirement Home for Toys. Woody, of course, resists this move. He tries to convince the other toys to be faithful to Andy, but through a series of betrayals eventually grows to accept that he lives in an uncaring world and that all toy's must suffer (like the myth of Sisyphus) the fate of being loved and then abandoned many times over.<br/><br/>At Sunnyside, Woody's polar opposite is Lotso, a stuffed bear who was once abandoned by his owners. Lotso interprets his abandonment as a total betrayal by (his) God and so (unlike Woody) wallows in negativity. As a direct result of his emotional scarring, Lotso has turned Sunnyside into a nightmarish concentration camp which masquerades as a libertarian paradise. In his Sunnyside introductory speech, Lotso touts the joys of self-ownership as well as the improved material comforts which his system brings (dream houses etc). Our heroes, who are portrayed as a bunch of immigrants fresh off the boat, are understandably enchanted.<br/><br/>They quickly realize, however, that this paradise masks something quite sinister. New toys have to work their way up Lotso's system, starting by doing the painful, backbreaking jobs that the rulers of Sunnyside won't do. There are a couple exceptions: Barbie is taken by the ruling elites as a mail-order bride (essentially a hooker) and the entrepreneurial Buzz is chosen for promotion to the managerial class and brainwashed so he won't sympathise with his old comrades. In other words, Sunnyside's supposed ""freedom"" is actually slavery, complete with military discipline, brainwashing and a panopticon prison (an all seeing monkey).<br/><br/>Like all the ""Toy Story"" films, ""Toy Story 3"" then turns into a prison break flick, our heroes overthrowing Lotso by working together, harnessing the collective power of the working class and using the managerial class (Ken, Bookworm) against itself. ""Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not the threat of force!"" Barbie states during a rousing speech. Having nailed the system's key flaw she then overthrows Lotso and installs a kind of communal utopia, Barbie and Ken the new leaders of a Sunnyside that's filled with lots of dancing and groovy parties.<br/><br/>Before this, Woody and the gang battle Lotso and his henchmen at a hellish waste disposal site. Just before our heroes are about to die, however, they're rescued by a giant claw. Significantly, this claw was the God of a bunch of friendly alien toys in ""Toy Story 1"". I.e. – fictitious, harmful Gods have been replaced by the actual helping hands (claw) of friends.<br/><br/>The film then ends with our heroes being transferred from Andy to a kid called Bonnie, their new master. The Pixar folk turn this into a happy ending when it shouldn't be. Realizing their ultimate purposelessness our heroes learn to find joy and meaning in community rather than Gods. But the film then sells out by delivering them into the hands of a warm and caring owner all over again. This is half-hearted nihilism: What happens when Bonnie grows indifferent? Isn't Bonnie just another master? What happens when the toys grow tired of one another? The Pixar Universe may admit that these toys are just pieces of plastic meant to be discarded when they've outlasted their usefulness, but it doesn't ultimately treat them that way. Still, maybe that's a good thing. This is already a pretty twisted children's movie. Any darker and we'd have an audience of suicidal six-year-olds.<br/><br/>Beyond all this, the film's action sequences can't touch those in the first two movies. Whole chunks of th film, including its junk yard/trash compactor climax, are also lifted right out of Thomas Disch's ""The Brave Little Toaster"". Indeed, the whole ""Toy Story"" franchise is a virtual rip off of Disch's film, a flick which many of the Pixar boys (Lasseter, Joe Ranft etc) worked on, and which also used various household objects (toasters, appliances etc) to tell an adventure tale about ageing, abandonment, impermanence, loss and death.<br/><br/>8/10 - Creepy."

"lee300772","9","1","2","26 July 2010"," The greatest trilogy since Lord of the Rings
","A whole decade has passed since Toy Story 2 rolled onto Cinema screens (and a staggering fifteen years since Buzz & Woody's original outing). Since those days of Pixar infancy, the studio has gone from strength to strength (Cars being the exception!), warming our hearts, and providing us with modern cinematic classics such as Finding Nemo, the Incredibles, Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up. The major question on everyone's lips is can Pixar overcome the curse of the 3rd film (e.g. the Godfather Part 3 and more comparatively Shrek the Third)? Can it retain that Pixar magic, keeping aspects of the original films we so adored (the emotion, humour, escapism and adventure)? Can Toy Story 3 successfully bring the series to a close with a big bang and provide audience members, such as myself, who began watching the saga way back when in 1995 with satisfying closure.<br/><br/>Going into the cinema, watching the massive queue snake around the cinema, there was a real sense of anticipation in the air, everyone anxious, itching to scout out a prime viewing location for the film in the cinema. After the rudimentary procession of trailers and popcorn crunching had died down, the audience slipped on their monstrous 3-D glasses as the picture began.<br/><br/>The Good In this final instalment several new elements have been weaved into the Toy Story gene , building on the original aspects of it's predecessors. Firstly there is the toy box-full of new additions to the Toy Story rooster, with Lotsa, Ken, Barbie, Stretch and sparks to name a few. These characters breathe new life into the franchise and provide a big dessert spoon of humour to proceedings (especially Barbie and Ken).<br/><br/>After re-watching Toy Story 2 recently, the other marked improvement Pixar has made (as well as making the character designs more sleek and polished) is the sheer amount of new characters and attention to detail in the backgrounds. Whereas the backgrounds in Toy Story 2 were quite empty (in comparison) and merely acted as a stage for the performances of Woody and the gang, here you get the sense with locations such as Sunnyside DayCare centre, that Pixar have spared no expense in making the sets incredibly detailed, packed full of new toys and tiny details, helping the audience become engrossed in the world of Pixar.<br/><br/>A noteworthy point that has been raised by the IMDb community, is whether there is a noticeable difference between 2D or 3D, have Pixar really bothered with it, and where is that extra money going? 3-D is not used as a gimmick in this film, unlike other recent cinema releases, which seem to be built solely around this facet (e.g. My Bloody Valentine 3-D springs to mind). In Toy Story 3 it has been used to provide greater field of depth to the locations and is only used to enhance what is already there.<br/><br/>In a similar vain to its predecessors, Toy-Story 3 has a terrific musical score. What is really striking about the music is its ability to move us from feelings of excitement and adventure at one moment, to humour, then sadness ,with the effortless artistic strokes that the studio possesses. This is accomplished in a completely natural way, it only adds to the many pros that the film has to offer.<br/><br/>Whilst the storyline may seem basic and follows a predictable arc, there is so much else Toy Story 3 provides us with, great humour (with the audience in hysterics at several points e.g. Spanish Buzz!!!), exciting action and shenanigans, that we don't care if the plot isn't Inception-like in complexity, we focus on enjoying the journey the film takes us on.<br/><br/>The Bad Whilst undeniably entertaining, Toy Story 3 needed more moments to pause, to slow down, for characters to reflect. More moments with emotional gravitas, which were delightfully sprinkled throughout the film Up, would have been welcome. Obviously the fast pacing is a good thing, as it never allows the audience to get fidgety, however it would have been good to experience that Pixar moment, where you feel your tear ducts are propping up a waterfall or where you have so much warm, fuzzy, lovely feelings in your gut, you want to hug the person next to you. However this is a minor gripe as the ending of the film provides a gripping and touching moment of near tragedy, which had me (and I'm sure several other young men) holding back tears. Also some of the new characters got little screen time to really develop, e.g. Buttercup, Trixie and Mr. Prickle Pants (although I liked the brief story behind Lotso, reminiscent of Stinkie Pete from Toy Story 2).<br/><br/>The Conclusion As I sat in my comfy, plush cinema seat, sensing the end was near, I began to feel incredibly disappointed, not because the film failed to meet my incredibly high expectations, but because I knew I would never be able to watch another Toy Story film for the first time, every again, and the characters that I had grew up watching and caring about, much like Andy's character, I would be leaving behind. However Toy Story shall forever remain in my heart and will definitely be in my DVD collection as soon as it hits the stores. This film lives up to the hype, whilst its not perfect, and maybe lacks some of the emotional depth of films such as Up and Wall-E, there can be no doubt that the trilogy went out on a high, entertaining everyone in that cinema, from 17 year old girls, to 30-something couples to young students such as myself.

","The Godfather Part 3 couldn't pull it off, Spider-man 3 couldn't pull it off and don't even get me started on the third Matrix film. But here finally after 11 years since the Toy Story 2 was released is a second sequel that gives the original Star Wars trilogy a run for it's huge age range of fans, huge quantity of fans and most importantly lives up to it's even huger expectations at every turn.<br/><br/>Like about every fan of Pixar who was an eager novice of the film makers when they first released Toy Story in 1995, I have watched every successful run of some equally enjoyable and more expansively collective films ranging from The Incredibles to Up which have clearly gathered even more of a fan base for those who missed the early wonders of when Pixar first began.<br/><br/>In particular, Pixar who are renown for their rare gift of rich story telling, have more recently created those tales that come from the heart and captured audiences emotionally without making the charm or humour distasteful because script writers were concentrating too hard elsewhere. Even the weaker of the films (Cars in particular) shared this constant factor when struggling to be sympathetically strenuous. Up was especially effective at this and its no surprise the third outing of Toy Story was going to be sharing this same compassion.<br/><br/>In keeping with the yearly reoccurrences of a newly made animated tale, Pixar have kept the years that have passed of us watching and fawning over their films the same as the time that has passed within when we last watched the gang.<br/><br/>This has obviously resulted in some major character growth, from Andy now a fully grown teenager starting college to Buster, the family dog who the years have taken their sorry toll on, albeit still with witty effect at making his hopelessness and newly shabby appearance amusing.<br/><br/>Sadly this means Andy no longer carries the affection for his toys (as an audience this is hard to relate to, if you love them as much as I do) meaning his move to college will result with their move to Sunnyside Daycare – which despite the optimistic name doesn't hold dear to Woody's heart rather than his more preferred option (to the others toys dismay) of staying in the houses' attic and waiting for Andy's kids to discover them years later.<br/><br/>The ending of the film, which was as nostalgia filled as expected does a tremendous job of concluding the morals and love of the story between the characters and audiences it has shared it with. If you found Up sad well wait till you watch this, because hiding your crying eyes behind a box of popcorn is harder than you might think – and a skill you will need to know before watching.<br/><br/>Pixar, who have pulled off something considered more of an impossibility the what was attempted in Inception, have successfully have blended new characters (Ken was a comedian with little effort) and a plot that didn't dither on uncertainty of where to find its feet on new territory for the third time."
"roemorg","10","1","2","24 July 2010"," I almost cried
","I'm not usually a crier at movies (Especially animations) but I had an emotional pull to this one. I'll give you a recap.<br/><br/>Andy is going off to college and is way too old for his toys. So after some things happen, the gang ends up at a daycare center and meet new toys. But some of these new toys are out to get Woody, Buzz, and the rest. So they try to come up with a plan to escape. A huge twist at the end, something you don't expect.<br/><br/>I think what really brought my emotional level over the edge, were the last words. I swear I did almost cry. But I didn't because I felt embarrassed to cry over an animation. I now know that it's okay to cry because it is a movie that makes you want to.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a fantastic end to the toy story trilogy. Brilliantly captured and new ideas (Like Buzz speaking Spanish) that you would never think of. A movie that you might have to see twice its that good."
"ajs-10","9","1","2","24 July 2010"," Another great film for Pixar!... & even better second time around!
","NOTE: What follows is my original review of the film when I first saw it in July last year (2010). It recently premiered on TV and I felt I should see it again. Fortunately my opinion has not changed, hence the repeat outing for this review. It was good to watch it in the privacy of my own home because I got something in my eye towards the end and there was a handy box of tissues nearby Hope you enjoy the review.<br/><br/>-o0o-<br/><br/>The toys are back for their third outing. And as the 3D debate rages on I took the high ground and stuck to the supposedly outmoded two dimensions for this one. After all that's exactly the number of dimensions the screen has. But enough of this I hear you say, tell me more about the film.<br/><br/>Andy is growing up fast and is on his way to college soon. He has not played with the toys in quite a while and, quite frankly, they're worried. With talk of the attic, and even worse, the trash, even Woody is getting apprehensive. Andy's mum tells him to sort out his room, things for the attic, things to go to college with him and things to go out for the trash. His sister Molly also gets a box to put toys in to donate to the Sunnyside day-care centre (yes I know I used the English spelling, I'm English, what can I say?). By some mix-up all of Andy's toys end up in the donation box, I won't say how because I don't want to spoil it. All seems very pleasant when they arrive. They are greeted by a bear called Lotso who is very nice to them, but all is not what it seems at Sunnyside. I think that's enough of the plot to whet your appetite. You wouldn't forgive me if I gave too much away would you.<br/><br/>As we have come to expect from Pixar, this is an exceptionally well made film with a great plot, endearing characters, lots of adventure, comedy and one or two tear-jerking moments along the way. Great work, as ever, from the voice talents of, Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Joan Cusack as Jessie, Ned Beatty as Lotso, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Michael Keaton as Ken, Wallace Shawn as Rex, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head, John Morris as Andy and Jodi Benson as Barbie.<br/><br/>There are some great moments, like when Ken met Barbie for the first time, Mr. Potato Head as a tortilla and Buzz Lightyear in Spanish mode has to be seen to be believed! I really enjoyed this film, I really engaged with the characters I know so well for the previous two films and found myself quite choked at the end. All three films have been tremendous and I really hope they don't make a fourth, finish on a high guys! Over all, highly recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 8.7/10"

","I am 17 years old. I am lucky enough to be a part of the generation that grew up with Andy throughout the years. I loved Toy Story as a kid, it was one of my favorite things to do when I went over to my grandma's house. Then came Toy Story 2. At that point I was a little older and found it less entertaining than the first but nonetheless great. Then I stopped believing in Toy Story. After the second one came out that was it for me. I grew up and became uninterested in movies like that. But when I heard last year that Toy Story 3 was announced, I knew I was going to see it anyway. I went in excited, not as excited as when i was a kid, and watched the movie. I have never been moved like this in any animated movie let alone a kids movie. Toy story 3 will make you believe again. The characters are hilarious, the action is fantastic, the animation is beautiful, and the end will bring buckets of tears.<br/><br/>Take a break from the your everyday life. escape into the magic of Toy Story 3. find your inner Andy.

"adam_evans14","9","1","2","23 July 2010"," Being 20 now....i have to say...this films for my age more!
","When my dad took me and my older brother to see toy story in cinema in 1995, i was only 6 years old and little did i know at the time, i was witnessing the beginning of perhaps the greatest film trilogy of all time. Toy Story captured the imagination and was the perfect family film combining adult (hey ham look i'm picasso....what 6 year old knows picasso) and child-like humour which made it a must see for parents and their children. One of the great things about the toys was how the characters all demonstrate human emotions giving the audience more empathy for them. <br/><br/>One things for certain. PIXAR will eventually make a bad film, because its impossible that everything they produce is a masterpiece (although thus far they have done so). This film is their absolute pinnacle. The next film may be excellent, but it can not top this. The film is set around the toys being taken to a daycare centre before Andy's moving on to college. Shortly after arriving it seems the toys have landed on their feet and are set to be more loved and used than ever before. All is not what it seems though and the toys are soon plotting on busting out and getting woody back to Andy before he departs to college. <br/><br/>Animation- Outstanding as ever Voice acting- Top class Direction- A joy to behold<br/><br/>Everybody on earth has a companion that they feel truly loved by. To Woody, Andy is this and his unwillingness to accept Andy having grown up is saddening to the audience watching. Anyone whose watched toy story 2 will understand Woody is now in Jessie's position shown in the montage. The obvious theme in this movie is growing up and moving on, but having seen the ending, id say woody's choice of jumping in the box with buzz and the rest, signals to people that there are people we love and inevitably have to let go, but your friends will always be there with you. This film had the perfect ending with a healthy message to its viewers. The guys at PIXAR are philosophers on life really aren't they.<br/><br/>Up until 3 days ago i had lord of the rings and indiana jones as the pinnacle of film trilogies (not including Indy 4) but i'll have to rethink things now. Outstanding film from pixar but truth be told i was expecting nothing less. <br/><br/>9/10...No more now though....3 is enough"

","Throughly enjoyed this movie: Read my review on my blog: andygaudion93.wordpress.com Trying to get as many views and constructive criticism as I can. Would like to be a film critic in the future. Now im just trying to fill the minimum 10 lines. Here's that website again: andygaudion93.wordpress.com Soooo, how's your day been? andygaudion93.wordpress.com How about that Toy Story 3? Aesome movie Nearly made me cry remember andygaudion93.wordpress.com in case you had forgotten andygaudion93.wordpress.com Thank You :) Here's the first paragraph to get you to want to read more: There was one moment during my viewing of the latest offering from Disney Pixar which defined the true and rightful audience of Toy Story 3. It came at the end of the movie as the customary Pixar credits sequence began to roll. The characters were still on the screen entertaining the audience, yet parents were hoarding out their children (perhaps it was past their bed time). Out of the fairly packed opening night audience, only one row remained until the end credits sequence finished. The row was full of 17 year-olds. And yes, I was one of them. It proved that this movie wasn't made for the poxy Balamory-generation, but instead for us, the kids of the 90's. It was made for those of us that grew up with Woody, Buzz and co. For those of us that either had the pleasure of viewing the first installment in cinemas in 1995 or watched the VHS repeatedly upon its release the following year. It was made for those of us that have waited patiently for 11 years since the second installment came out in 1999. But amazing though this film is, it has forced us, kids of the 90's to come to a realisation that perhaps some of us were shying away from. We have to grow up. We have to leave our childhood and our toys behind. The sense of nostalgia and happy memories I certainly had when watching this movie, though glorious during the film, left a saddening feeling after the movie. Damn you Pixar, you got a hefty emotional response from me. Go to andygaudion93.wordpress.com to read the rest :) Thank you"
"mark-earlam","7","1","2","22 July 2010"," Good but not great
","I wouldn't agree with many of the reviews when they say this is the best in the series. The first in the series is by far the best and will always be a classic.<br/><br/>While the film is pretty good it will never beat the first time you meet the main characters and there lies the problem. The new characters are mostly secondary to the ones we already know so it is business as usual as far as I am concerned.<br/><br/>I think most people reviewing this film forgot how good #1 was when they first watched it and hence saying it is the best one.<br/><br/>However saying all that, this is a good film and worth seeing as long as you don't expect too much from it. The story is basic but the characters are still funny enough to make it worthwhile.<br/><br/>A good ending to a great series."

","I was only two years old when i seen Toy Story. Then i was only six when i seen the second Toy Story. I can't remember the first time i had seen the first Toy Story but it was a film that was always there in my childhood. Same with the second film. I can remember going to the cinema with my family to see the second Toy Story. Everyone was excited since it was four years ago when the first Toy Story had came out and i had the same feeling tonight when i went to the third one with my friends. It was weird. I felt like a kid again. Since, It had been eleven years since i had seen a new story for the toys that were always present in my childhood. It was strange though, it felt like i could relate to this movie. Since Andy the owner of Woody and Buzz was growing up. I felt like i could relate to this since when i seen the first and second Toy Story. Andy was only i could guess about five or six years old. Around the same age i had first seen these movies. Then in the third movie. Andy is seventeen years of age. Around my age. It felt like when he got older. Everyone who was a kid when toy story was first out got older. It was like we could feel his pain of getting rid of his toys. At the end of movie. It felt like the end of an era. Similar to the Friends finale. We all knew it was coming. We all knew Andy was growing up and would eventually change. For me, This was what made the movie special for me."
"agmoldham","8","1","2","20 July 2010"," A farewell to Woody and Buzz?
","I've heard the Toy Story films described as being the Godfather of animation films. I'm pleased to report that the third instalment of Toy Story is much closer to the quality of the first 2 films than the third part of the Godfather.<br/><br/>The final part of Toy Story see's Andy about to depart to college and the toys facing an uncertain future as it's time for a tidy up. We have all our old favourites here together with a few new friends (and enemies) that they meet along the way. As usual with Toy Story, it's got something for the adults and the children. If the first Toy Story was the buddy film between Buzz and Woody, the second film was the rip roaring adventure with a few dark moments then the final film is a fairly sentimental goodbye to our old friends. They'll be sadly missed and Toy Story will make a great box set which you'll be able to watch back to back in half a day. One of the best films of 2010 ... even if it wasn't quite as thrilling as the first 2."

He's brave, like a cowboy should be. And kind, and smart. But the thing that makes Woody special, is he'll never give up on you... ever. He'll be there for you, no matter what."" - Andy<br/><br/>Childhood is a time where we recount some of our most vivid and heartfelt memories. Toy Story 3 is not only a film about childhood, but also a coming-of-age story, which follows Andy as he transcends from adolescence into adulthood. Change is a universal constant, and as proved by this film, change is something people must accept and deal with at various moments in their lives. <br/><br/>Much like Woody, who is personified as brave and noble, we must be brave as we exit the doors of our youth and enter into a land of endless possibilities. For this very reason, Toy Story 3 is a near perfect film in all categories. With the aid of a top-notch film crew and cast, Toy Story 3 provides a storyline that all viewers can relate to. This also allows the audience to feel sympathetic for the characters as they face endless struggles in their search for happiness, which is necessary in any film.<br/><br/>With Inception following very closely, this film is without a doubt the greatest of the summer blockbusters for 2010. The extra focus on character development, emotional attachment with the audience, and universal themes and consequences allows this film to push ahead of the rest. I definitely recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>My Final Consensus: Toy Story 3 shows the depth and significance of childhood memories. This film allows anyone to look back and remember how their youth helped to mold them into the individuals they are today. Some advice, even to the male audience out there: Bring a tissue, or four."
"airguitar57","10","1","2","12 July 2010"," Pixar ends a trilogy the right way
","There seems to be a curse when it comes to the third film of a trilogy. It doesn't take long to realize that these tertiary films tend to be pretty crappy, just look at Alien 3, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Spider-Man 3, and Back to the Future Part III. The Toy Story franchise proved itself when it produced Toy Story 2, a sequel that was at least on par with its predecessor, but that alone does not a hit make, let's not forget that The Godfather Part II was followed by Part III. OK, enough teasing, Toy Story 3 is one of the best trilogy end caps of all time. The film is nearly perfect in every way and is the most enjoyable film of the summer, so far.<br/><br/>Ten years have passed when Toy Story 3 picks up (pretty close to the actual time between this film and Toy Story 2). Andy is now seventeen and heading off to college. Lying, untouched, in his toy box are Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Bullseye, Slink, Rex, Hamm, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head and their children (three aliens from Pizza Planet). Our favorite toys have seen their friends go and now only look forward to being placed in the attic. After being forced to do something with his toys, Andy takes all but Woody and places them in a bag destined for the attic. After leaving the bag of toys, Andy's mom, always known for misunderstanding her son's intentions places the bag on the curb. Eventually the toys escape the bag and make for a donation box headed to Sunnyside Daycare. The toys must then decide if they want to return to Andy for a life of retirement or remain at Sunnyside and fulfill their purpose.<br/><br/>As far as family films go, no one can tell a story like Pixar. The company has produced 11 films now and all of them have been hits. Even Cars, without a doubt the weakest member of the pack, still managed to debut at number one. Since the creation of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2001, if Pixar has had a film in the running it has won all but two times, those two losses are for the films Cars and Monsters, Inc. Pixar produces animated greatness. Sure, I am fawning all over Pixar, but they so deserve it. Toy Story 3 just further proves that Pixar does not make a film unless they expect it to be great.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful. The opening segment alone, a heavily detailed Wild West adventure that sees Andy's imagination brought to life. The film is able to combine the world of toys with that of the grand sweeping western. It is possible to forget that the landscapes are digitally created since they so fully capture the beauty of the desert rivaling the cinematography of The Searchers. Although the opening is slightly removed from the rest of the film, the animation never falters. The animators have obviously grown since the creation of Toy Story. In the first film, the human characters flirted with the ""uncanny valley"". I remember thinking that Molly specifically looked a bit creepy. Now all of the characters strike that comfortable balance of animation and real life. The easiest comparison is that of Toy Story's Molly and Toy Story 3's Bonnie. Bonnie is always cute and never gives you the eerie feeling that The Polar Express tends to elicit.<br/><br/>The story and writing is fantastic. The creators know how to strike the proper balance between adult and child humor. The femininity of Ken is a running joke that continues all the way through the ending credits and I personally never grew tired of it. Sure, the film is funny, but it wouldn't be a Pixar film if it didn't tug at your heartstrings. My mom may not have cried the way she did in the first ten minutes of Up but my sister had the pleasure of sitting next to a pregnant woman who bawled her eyes out during this film's last ten minutes. The film is able to work because it does not pander to the five-year-old in the audience. Toy Story 3 will bring smiles to both adults and children, and is an example of great film-making.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is damn close to perfect. The only thing that I can possibly say negatively about the film is the similarities between this film and Toy Story 2, in particular the villain. Lotso and Stinky Pete are characters that are extremely similar (it was very hard for me to keep a straight face while typing this sentence). They are both presented in the same manner, a seemingly nice and fatherly character that has a dark side that comes from a place of loss, and meet similar fates. The similarities may have been unintentional but they are there nonetheless. In no way does this comparison hurt the film or take away from the overall enjoyment, but it is there and it would be unfair of me not to point it out.<br/><br/>Pixar is unparalleled in its level of film-making and Toy Story 3 is another jewel in the company's crown. Toy Story 3's story is the perfect ending to the Toy Story franchise with writing that has not lost its spark. I have grown with the franchise, seeing Toy Story in theaters at the age of nine, and now Toy Story 3 at the age of 23 and the characters resonate with me just as much now as they did then. Despite some sneaking similarities to Toy Story 2, the film is able to work both on its own and as the third member of a trilogy. Toy Story 3 is not a great animated film, or a great child's film, it is simply a great film."

","Brilliant. Simply Brilliant. I don't know how Pixar keeps doing it but by all means they should keep it up. This is now the third time Pixar has brought tears to my eyes (along with Toy Story 2 and Up) which is amazing when you consider that we're talking about toys here - or are we?.<br/><br/>That of course is what makes Toy Story 3 so amazing. To an adult, this is more than just an animated action picture about pieces of plastic. The toys and their adventures come to symbolize the journey that all us take through life. Toy Story 1 is about childhood, where everything is magical, fun and sometimes a little scary. Toy Story 2 is about growing up and becoming an adult, discarding the trappings of childhood and figuring out who we really are. Toy Story 3 is about the end of life, letting go and passing on what you have learned to the next generation.<br/><br/>I think it is no exaggeration to say that we are in a Golden Age for animated movies unlike any before. Here's hoping that the genius of the wizards of Pixar continues to be passed on to the next round of artists, animators and story writers."

","Back in 1995, Disney released Toy story, which was groundbreaking animation. In 1999, they released Toy story 2, which didn't surpass the original but was a worthy sequel. now, after eleven years, Toy story 3 has been released, and it's now made the Toy story trilogy one of the greatest trilogies ever made.<br/><br/>This is easily one of the best films of the year. No movie will make you laugh, feel, and even care more than Toy story 3. The creators at Pixar have created something beautiful. They have made you feel for these lovable toys,and believe it or not, has made everyone cry a river over them.<br/><br/>From the minute Toy story 3 begins, I knew one thing: I was going to love this movie. I was excited to see Woody, Buzz and the gang of lovable toys back on the big screen again. That is one of the main reasons why Toy story 3's heart is gold,and why it could easily be the best film so far this year.<br/><br/>Woody(voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz(voiced by Tim Allen), Rex(voiced by Wallace Shawn) Jesse(voiced by Joan Cusack),and most of the toys from the first two films return. Except this time, their owner Andy isn't a kid anymore. He's going to college, and his mother sends the gang off to Sunnyside Daycare.<br/><br/>Woody, if you've seen the other films, has to return to his loving owner. So he escapes and leaves the others. The gang is tricked by an evil toy named Lotso(voiced by Ned Beatty) and they are terrorized by mean kids. And once woody finds out, tries to save his friends,and hopefully, return home.<br/><br/>There may be no other motion picture in 2010 that will amaze you more than Toy story 3. That is until Inception comes out. but for now, we gotta enjoy this. Toy story 3 is brilliant. i loved it's jail theme. <br/><br/>There are lots of laughs, lots of dazzling effects, heartfelt moments, and we really need more films like this. I'm happy woody and the gang returned. It took a while but i'm glad. Toy story 3 is the best film of the Summer so far and and is a top choice for the best movies of the year.

","Like most people from my generation, I grew up with Buzz and Woody, and their small, but epic adventures. When I heard that this film was going to come into fruition, I was excited. Finally after 11 years, the long awaited sequel was going to come out! However, I did worry a little. When I walked into the theater, I was filled with high expectations. Most Pixar films fill these expectations of a great animated film(except for the depressing Incredibles and stupid Cars), but Toy Story 3 was a different case. It not only exceeded my expectations, now I am going to expect much more from Pixar. The movie is simply hilarious. Sadly, some of the characters were not in this one, but we do have the main ones, and that's the important thing. This film is not only the funniest in the trilogy, it is also the darkest. Some of the plot seemed like a rehash of the second, but done is such a way that you don't really realize it or just don't care. This is also one of the few animated films where I teared up a bit. The ending is just perfect, and that is how it should end. I would say that Toy Story is the greatest trilogy in film history."
"StevePulaski","10","1","2","3 July 2010"," The animation is wonderous, as well as the story
","It's hard to keep a franchise going for three movies and still stay fresh simultaneously and Toy Story 3 shows its still possible. The Pixar geniuses return to their first film to have a sequel (let alone two) and they succeed in giving it their true magic that is rare in new animated films. Pixar has always made wonderful, artsy films that not only express a great message and feel, but they express great color and animation to them as well. The first Toy Story came out in 1995 making it Pixar's first film all around and it seemed that after Toy Story came out, hand drawn animation laid in it's grave while a new age of CGI animation started dominating the market and revolutionized a whole new era of movies. The sequel as well.<br/><br/>Even if you have seen one but not the other, you seem to already know the characters and even if you don't, the movie basically says ""Hey we have made you wait eleven years, here's an introduction."" Though this film takes on more of a parody element, prison like film and seems targeted to the audience that were like 1 or 2 when the first hit theaters. Plus they have adult humor with prison escapes that keep the parents interested. Though some jokes were a little too childlike and maybe would have got to the true Toy Story fans who were in middle school when the first one got a release. Now they would obviously be in their twenties and quickly lose interest in this film. And though Pixars films can be cliché and non-suspenseful because you know the characters will find a way out of it. This one still keeps you in suspense.<br/><br/>The plot is about Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), and the rest of the toy gang figuring out that Andy is going to College and needs to pack what he wants to take, what he wants to toss, and what he wants in the attic. By mistake (and a lot of fun actions) they instead go to Sunnyside Day Care Center where they meet other toys and the seemingly nice owner by the name of Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (Lotso). In the mean time Woody escapes Sunnyside by luck and wants to find his way back to Andy's. He makes his way back to Sunnyside to go to his friends and just in time when the gang finds out of Lotso's evil and his plans to treat them like prisoners. The rest of the film is devoted to focusing on the gang's (genius) plans to get out of Sunnyside and to escape Lotso's clutches.<br/><br/>The movie is simplistic, but yet genius at the same time. The ways the characters find ways to hide from adults is hilarious, clever, and unique. Its also nice to note that the opening short film, Day & Night was just as amusing as the entire film. It brings out the creativeness and art in Pixar and even shows that people of all differences can come together and be happy. Its one of the better shorts they have done, even with a simple concept. I'd give it a three and a half out of four stars.<br/><br/>Its also interesting to note that the voice of Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) and Lenny and Wheezy (Joe Ranft) have both died since Toy Story 2 came out. Ranft's last role was in the Pixar success (and my favorite of their films), Cars as the fire truck ""Red"". Varney's was Daddy and Then and was replaced with Blake Clark for the voice of Slinky and Lenny and Wheezy were simply written out of the story. Though the movie brings mention of some older characters from the previous films. So overall, this film is amazing and he even though it out hand drawn animation in it's grave, it brought in a whole new world of art. Plus it would be odd to see Toy Story in the hand drawn era.<br/><br/>Starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Don Rickles, Michael Keaton, Blake Clark, Wallace Shawn, and John Ratzenberger. Directed by: Lee Unkrich."
"Likes_Ninjas90","9","1","2","3 July 2010"," A really touching family film for those who are new to the toy box and for those who are ready to open it again for one last time
","Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the other toys have noticed that over time a lot of their friends have gone missing. Most of them have been thrown out because their owner Andy is now grown up and ready to leave home so he can attend college. He must make the difficult decision of deciding what to do with his toys. He contemplates taking Woody with him and leaving the rest of the toys in the attic. After almost being throwing out in the trash however, the toys end up at a day-care center where everything seems blissful and welcoming. Woody realises the realities of the day-care center and is too loyal to Andy to stay behind. He escapes, hoping to get back before his owner can leave for college. The rest of the toys are met by an old teddy bear named Lotso (Ned Beatty) who wants to keep them in line so that they will endure the reckless playtime of the infants who are too young to know how to treat the toys properly. Woody decides that he must return to the day-care center to help his friends escape once again.<br/><br/>Pixar are undeniably the leaders in animated pictures and they remain a marvel to behold. Amidst Hollywood's tired fixation on sequels, reboots and remakes, Pixar holds a refreshing attitude towards storytelling. They respect the intelligence of their viewers to appreciate their films for more than just CGI wizardry. They must values their reputation as the pinnacle of animated films because their films have consistently delivered on their expectations for strong narratives, exciting action sequences and touching characters. The Toy Story series, which started back in 1996, is arguably Pixar's most popular franchise and it epitomises this attitude towards storytelling. Despite the inclusion of a new director for each Toy Story film the quality of each feature has remained particularly high. Toy Story 3 was directed by Lee Unkrich and it delivers what fans have come to expect from these films in terms of both content and quality. The latest addition takes us through familiar climaxes and similar themes as the previous efforts. We have certainly been on this rescue mission before. This is not so much a criticism because it is joyous territory to revisit once more and unlike Shrek Forever After the messages here feel relevant rather than tiresome, complimenting the film as a fitting end to the popular trilogy.<br/><br/>At its core Toy Story 3 is a film about the falsity of preservation, with the toys having to realise that not everything is always going to stay the same and not everything is always what it seems at first glance. These mature themes are delivered again with maturity, sweetness and humour. There is a beautiful closing sequence at the end of the film which in particular speaks volumes about generational change and has resonated very strongly with audiences. Throughout their very best films like Up and Toy Story, Pixar have inspired our belief in the humanity of their CGI characters. The regularly funny dialogue and strongly developed characterisation give a unique personality and emotional depth to each character. Woody is again driven here by old fashioned values and ideas of loyalty and camaraderie. Through motives such as these our beliefs in the toys grow and allow us to care more about them in the action sequences. Even after three films it is still surprising how tense some of these sequences are, purely because of how much we care for the wellbeing of the toys. Toy Story 3 has been released in both 2D and 3D but even in the standard, cheaper format the film looks fantastic. It's colourful and dynamic, beautifully animated and designed. The most subtle shots, like a close-up on Woody's face, provide the audience with an emotional reaction, usually more common in live action films.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 offers a lot of the same elements as it predecessors, which is an almost entirely positive comment. The story and its messages might be familiar to audiences but there is no denying the timelessness of the themes and their significance to all ages. The amount of heart that is projected by these computer generated characters and how much we care about them is testimony to the quality of the writing here. This is a really touching family film for those who are new to the toy box and for those who are ready to open it again for one last time."
"GeorgiaEM94","10","1","2","3 July 2010"," Really Brings You Back
","When I first saw the trailer, or sneak peak, of Toy Story 3, I thought, 'Here we go, another good movie ruined with sequels,' but when I heard all the good comments about the movie, I had to go see it. I'm glad I did. This movie by far was the best movie I have see all year. Everything from the cast to the script was incredible. It was hilarious, intense, heart-warming, and everything in between. It really brought me back to when I was a little kid. <br/><br/>I couldn't help but get teary-eyed at the end. We were saying good bye to some of the best characters Pixar has ever created, and it reminded me of myself, how much I have grown and how I will be going off to college soon, too, leaving behind all of my oldest toys and memories.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was incredible. It had all the right stuff and a little extra to boot. It was an excellent way to end the franchise and I will definitely miss Buzz, Woody, and the whole gang."
"jburtroald95","8","1","2","2 July 2010"," It warmed the cockles of my heart.
","In yet another triumph, Pixar has skillfully managed to break the curse of the second animated sequel, a pratfall that both DreamWorks and Twentieth Century Fox have succumbed to with 'Shrek the Third' (2007) and 'Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' (2009) respectively.<br/><br/>A large part of this film's success of is fuelled by the timeless quality of the two earlier Toy Story films, an asset that is unfailingly retained in the third, as well as our joy in seeing the now very accomplished animation giant return to its humble roots. However, this doesn't seem to be enough, as a bountiful array of new themes, characters and plot devices have clearly been introduced in order to sustain the third installment: Andy (voiced by John Morris) is becoming distanced from his old plastic companions as he is reaching adulthood; the old toy gang has been heavily depleted over the time change, leaving only the principles remaining in Andy's room; the villains are more numerous, and all of them are toys that have been corrupted or mutated; Buzz (voiced by Tim Allen) has since the beginning become a hackneyed sentimentalist, and so is transformed into a childish gag for most of the film by having him malfunction – it's all still more than sufficient, but as with 'Wall-E' (2008) the feat is pulled off not quite as effortlessly as usual.<br/><br/>While it has been a staggering ten years since 'Toy Story 2' (1999) the previous entry in the series, we realize that the fabulous star-studded voice cast, which also includes Tom Hanks and Joan Cusack, must have been quite a challenge to reassemble, and animation is indeed a very slow and painstaking process. Directed by Lee Unkrich and co-starring the voices of Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Jodi Benson, Blake Clark, Estelle Harris and Ned Beatty, Toy Story 3 is definitely not a cheap re-hash of the others, but a serious contender for this year's Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film, an award that would sit well alongside those for Wall-E and last year's Up."
"dreaujyc","10","1","2","2 July 2010"," Hooray! Pixar!
","Very few motion pictures or animations can touch me for I have seen enough to immune from all kinds of clichés. But Tory Story 3 does. The only thing dissatisfied me was the 3-D glasses, Pixar does not need that technology to make its works perfect, and once again. I reviewed the others toy stories right after I came back from the theater and finally convinced myself that no one on the earth could make plastic toys strike adults again and again. I was a teenager when toy story 1 was on TV in China. The sequels amuse children for they are really funny, but express further more towards elder people. When we grow older, people will find out that so many beautiful things are gone and affections fade away. Like Andy I put behind most of my toys before going to college, unfortunately I do not have a Woody to recover me.. Although I didn't cry during toy story 3, I was totally overwhelmed for Pixar did another excellent job. WALL-E and Up surprise me so much that I can not believe Pixar is able to do better.The truth is toy story 3 is the best. Pixar gives us lessons about how to innovate and carry out those innovations. I'm looking forward to what's coming next."
"j-delcolle","9","1","2","1 July 2010"," Better than the first?
","The truth is, they could've filmed some homeless guy taking a crap, slapped the name ""Toy Story 3"" on it, and it would've made money. From a marketing stand point, they had no reason to try at all. But, they did, and it more than payed off.<br/><br/>Disney and Pixar have something hard to find in cartoon; respect for their characters. And often when this is had, it takes away many comedic opportunities. But this movie has the perfect blend, and is a perfect ending to my favourite movie series as child.<br/><br/>There are so many small things, and so many big things, that I'd like to discuss, but you could probably see the movie several times in the time that would take me.<br/><br/>As for the title, ""Better than the first"", it very well may be, but I find it hard to give impartial opinions to something I loved so much as a child. If I found out I had 1 hour and 43 minutes to live, I just might spend it watching this movie. I'm not lying when I say the scenes in the trailers are probably the worst parts of the movie.It barely loses that one star it does for these scenes."
"arthera09","10","1","2","1 July 2010"," I love Toy Story
","I did not expect a lot from this movie. I went into the movie with the mindset that they could not make 3 great movies with the same characters. I felt that the movie would fall flat and just resort to clichés. The movie felt right in so many ways. The writers took advantage of the fact that there were well established characters with well established relationships with each other. The fact that I grew up with these movies and these characters really made a difference. I was 11 when Toy Story came out and 15 years later it was a perfect progression for the characters. I really saw the characters grow up in unexpected ways, but never in a way that alienated the characters. The landfill scene while action filled was so emotionally charged that it just blew me away. It is rare that an action scene is able to hold so much emotion while keeping the characters in the spotlight. The last 15 minutes with Andy was the best way for the movie to end and really brought together the whole trilogy. The movie was funny, moving and just a good time the whole way through. The movie looked great I really loved the music. Everything came together in the most satisfying way. I cannot wait to own the trilogy and share them with future generations. This movie is destined to be a classic."

I've seen it many times over so far. Go to a Very late night showing if you want to enjoy having no kids. I watched it at 1:30am the first time, night after opening. almost empty. The animation is so superb. Pixar has come a long way. The sound was also quite amazing. no movie would be good with out sound and this is damn good.

It had captured the very aspect of the previous movies, and recreated all of it with stellar visuals. Not only was the story bittersweet, but it (hopefully) ended the series on a high note. I enjoyed seeing all of these characters from the older movies, (all the same voice cast, might I add) and glad to see some newer ones too.Toy Story 3 really lived up to all the hype, in what is (in my opinion) the best 3 movies Pixar has ever released."

The new characters are great, and the old characters are better! The jokes are fresh and the originality of the story amazing, and the movie has a ending that will likely bring you to tears, IN A GOOD WAY. sadly the only thing i regret about this movie, is its truly the end of Toy Story, its time to say goodbye to buzz and woody everybody. *small spoiler, nothing important, common sense stuff* and btw i recommend if you watch this movie, don't re-watch the first 2 movies a day before seeing this one, it'll likely bring a awkward feeling to the third, one thing that made the third movie so great was seeing the return of some of your favorite animated characters since its been so long since you've seen them, and i assume it'll be awkward to see andy as a kid then 2 days later when you see the third hes off to college? It'll ruin one of the biggest lessons that this movie gives, such as ""growing up and letting go"" you don't really grow up with andy and go through this emotional trial with him if you just re-watch the movies ."
"sharktrooper21","10","1","2","30 June 2010"," Pixar does once again... And better than anyone else
","In a world where going to the movies has become a hit-or-miss game as far as satisfaction is concerned, Pixar just refuses to be like everyone else. Okay, what has their competitors at Dreamworks made that people like?<br/><br/>Hmmmm... The first two Shrek movies, Kung Fu Panda, How To Train Your Dragon... Heck, finding films like these is like trying to find a goldmine in the mountains. Chances are, the end results will be disappointing (Shrek 4 BETTER be the ""Final Chapter).<br/><br/>Pixar, however, seems to have this good luck streak that began with their first film that continues to ensure that the audience will not regret paying for that ticket at the box office. Yet when I went to see this movie, I was glad that I did. I mean, I actually found myself smiling while the film was playing. I can't name a film off the top of my head that can do that.<br/><br/>Now I've grown cautious of sequels after seeing my fare share of movies. But for those of you who haven't seen this or are worried about another Pixar sequel (to this film or any of the others), rest assured. Pixar will not do a sequel unless they can think of a story that will be just as good as the predecessor.<br/><br/>What is shocking to me is the fact that Pixar has shown that they can't make a bad movie and prove it by doing a TRI-QUEL (thrid in a trilogy). The only other tri-quel I can name is the Return of the King from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. So this makes everybody else in Hollywood or elsewhere look REALLY pathetic.<br/><br/>SEE THIS FILM AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!!"

","Toy Story was a movie that reintroduced Animated Movies to the mass audience, way back in 1995. Now 15 years later comes a movie when animated movies are plenty, most of them fail to charm us like they once used to and a time when sequels are rarely good as the originals.<br/><br/>A few months back, I concluded(rather hastily) that this year no animated movie can beat 'How to train your Dragon' and was almost sure of it after seeing the latest Shrek. But then who would have though the good old woody-Buzz-and-the-toy-gang in their third installment would change all that with a gripping plot, brilliant graphics, right amount of humor and a superb ending that would make sure you will remember the toys for a long , long time.<br/><br/>Andy, the kid had grown up to become a teenager.

It's up to Woody & Buzz (the always reliably amiable Hanks & Allen reprising their iconic animated characters) to save the day (and themselves). Warmly and touchingly animated (in wondrous 3-D too boot too!) by the studio artistic geniuses and expert direction by Lee Unkrich with a very shrewd (and decidedly darker) screenplay by Michael Arndt collaborating with John Lassetter, & Andrew Stanto and Unkrich. Among the new standouts is Keaton as the 'metorsexual' Ken doll (acerbically full of himself). One of the year's best."
"monstermayhem32","10","1","2","28 June 2010"," A Satsfying Conclusion?
","Even though it had been 11 years since Toy Story 2, I think the long wait was worth it, since I think that the 3rd film did a rather decent job of concluding the series. The way that the film ends is the passing of the torch from one owner to another which was rather emotional since it almost felt like the beginning of the end. The film was left open for a 4th film, but I think it would be interesting to see what the next installment would have in store for Woody and Company now that they are living with Bonnie. However I think the film did a good job with toys dealing with the fact that Andy is now moving on to College and that they are left with an uncertain future."
"jeffro45","10","1","2","28 June 2010"," A well-written piece that's timely for parents and kids.
","The movie did the impossible . . . again. They wrote and shot a movie sequel that outdid the previous one, as the second Toy Story did to the first film. This one was particularly well-written, and as a parent, I thought it was poignant to me and my children (both of which were under 10 at the time of the first flicks) considering that the story was based on the very realistic passage of time that stands between this film and Toy Story 2. In that regard, it was just as moving and touching for both myself and my wife as it was for our children, since our ages and situations are similar to Andy and his family in this third flick where the empty nest looms ever closer.<br/><br/>The humour was great and broad enough to please everyone, with the characters acting just as fresh as they were as if they had just come out of the box, and despite my fears of them being somewhat 'rehashed', they came off as more interesting and funnier than the first times around. And, as per usual, the CG animation was up to Pixar's usual standard of excellence."

"moselekm","8","1","2","27 June 2010"," Story telling at perhaps it's best. And with toys.
","People made huge hype about this movie. I was pretty pumped at the idea of a third one when I heard about it a few years ago. However, as the last months closed I became more and more disinterested as I was reminded how weak the second one was. If you liked the second one, great. So did I, but I certainly dreaded one with the same pacing.<br/><br/>I'd have to say that the only thing I really really disliked, was that the old cast seemed of just died off. I mean, seriously. Etch was in the friggin' first teaser! He's not even in the movie. I honestly felt lost without him. How cool was it to see Etch just scramble around and draw crap perfectly?! Well, not in this movie. Also some key players are also missing. R.C., Speak and Spell, and Boe Pete (Is that how it's spelled?) I didn't like that. The movie, like all the other movies takes us from one setting to another. Forcing the toys to learn some disturbed truth at the new setting and to figure out how to get out. All while trying to earn Andy's love and respect! I am not saying this formula sucks. It's great. It's easy enough for an infant to follow and allows enough entertainment for an adult to actually enjoy. However, the final climax was a bit lacking to me. And I felt like I had been there before.<br/><br/>I am announcing all these bad things, because that's all that matters in a Toy Story review. WE ALL KNOW IT'S WORTH WATCHING! But which one is best? Certainly not this one. Not to me at least. Toy Story has the original charm, it's tough to beat. So tough that I doubt it can be beat. But this one beats the second one easily.<br/><br/>So all in all, this movie is worth viewing in theaters. In fact, if you haven't, then you're simply not a movie go'er. This movie is well worth the time and money and for old school fans it will make you want to watch the first two over and over again and talk about all three movies."

But some other characters are also worth mention. Barbie and Ken, The Rex, The three eyed aliens (my favorite), the evil pink & fluffy teddy bear-Lotso, the potato couple and the baby were all fun to watch.

","Toy Story 3 is quite an experience. If you're like me, you have watched the Toy Story movies as a child. So, it was a little weird going to see the third movie in the theater all grown up. Even though it was not worth seeing in 3D, it was still an amazing movie with a fantastic storyline.<br/><br/>I was very surprised on how much this movie made me laugh. I am not one to laugh at comedy that is made for children, but this movie has succeeded plenty of times. It is one of the few movies I can say that all ages can enjoy, and even if you are not a big fan of family films, you still might enjoy it.<br/><br/>The whole Plot of the story is that Andy, the child from the previous movies who played with the toys, is all grown up, and is going to college. The toys are put in a day care center, and they have to start their new life there. I was surprised when this plot occurred, as it was more creative than I expected.<br/><br/>What truly makes this movie fantastic is the great voice acting and new characters. The voice acting is outstanding to say the least, and the new characters all have personalities that fit their toy figure. To see such a huge new variety of cast, its fair to expect disaster. But, Pixar did a fantastic job, and the story keeps almost all characters in the story and have their own place in the plot.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is not a perfect movie, though. The storyline reaches a couple of dull spots where I lost interest, and the ending was not too satisfying. I don't want to ruin anything, but you will see what I mean. It just seems the story shifts what the characters want.<br/><br/>Overall, Toy Story 3 is a fantastic family film, and I know kids will enjoy it, and adults might even enjoy it more. This is near the top of the best summer movies of 2010, and for great reasons. Although not perfect, it is definitely worth seeing in the theaters."

","I do sincerely apologize for being punfully playful in my movie review of the extra charming ""Toy Story 3"". Yes once again, I will be a Mr. Puntatohead! ""Toy Story 3"" is a room full of entertainment heaven. It is that good! I am not toying with you! This Toy story picks up when a grown Andy is preparing to leave to college, and unsure on what to do with his classic toys he has cherished throughout his past childhood. The same cast of Andy Toy characters are back; of course headed by Woody The Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear. But as the last Toy story, new toys are introduced to this story including a toy boy for Barbie, and that would be none other than Ken. The Andy toy family eventually end up in a day care center called Sunnyside, even though the toys end up being more scrambled than sunnyside up by a feisty group of toddlers. The so-called toy leader at the Sunnyside Daycare is a conniving bear called Lotso, who has lotso devious plans to hold the Andy toy entourage as prisoners. However, Toy Story 3's primary premises play more with the concept of the agony & denial of ""letting go"", and the togetherness of loved ones. Not to mention, the specialness effect that childhood toys could have on one throughout an entire lifetime. There were a few handkerchief moments in the teary story of ""Toy Story 3"". Academy Award winning screenwriter Michael Arndt scribed an exuberant and heartwarming screenplay which should present him a revisit to the Oscar red carpet. Director Lee Unkrich was precise with his handling of these toys, and the rest of the Pixar clan were once again terrific. And woodynt you know it, the vocal performances of Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head were a thing of beauty! I especially liked Michael Keaton's vocal work as Ken. In no way, shape or form ""Toy Story 3"" belongs in the toylet. It is a classic tale that both children and adults will adore, even though some kids might not see a baby doll the same way again. The final buzz is that ""Toy Story 3"" will live in all us for infinity and beyond. And that truth is not light years away! ***** Excellent"

The 3-D in this movie is very good, since there are no gimmicky stuff popping at you. At 103 minutes, this is the longest Toy Story movie ever (second to The Incredibles in Pixar length), but moves along at a rapid pace. Go see it."

","Life is all about moving on... and leaving behind the sweet inanimacies of our childhood in a box somewhere in the attic or given away or, worst of all, trashed. These are exactly the choices Andy faces when he packs up for college, and is given the responsibility of disposing his toys.<br/><br/>The toys, in spite of being the same ones with which the trilogy kick started in 1995, have become more and more funny. Woody, his fellow deuteragonist Buzz Lightyear, and the ""others"" get ragged and tagged all over the city as they fight for another chance to be played with and loved.<br/><br/>If you think that this is just another overrated movie, and the hype is not worth it, then you stand to lose out on one of the best movies you can watch in a theatre... :-P The laptops and those 'big' 22"" screens just wont cut it. Go watch it on the ""BIG"" screen. Its worth every paisa or penny or whatever currency you fancy.<br/><br/>I'd like to congratulate PIXAR for producing excellence, yet again, and at the right time too, as we, who grew up with Andy, are nearly the same age as Andy, and may have moved over ToyStory if it were a bit late. Then there was another fear, fear of the film ""choking"" like most of the sequels ""choke"", and like Spain and South Africa ""choke"". Well... not only did it not ""choke"", but it flourished, and may manage to choke ""A-Team"" and likes.<br/><br/>Funny, Insipiring, out-right hilarious, emotional and poignant. This film did justice to the trilogy, and was the PERFEKT way to pen an end to this wonderful saga... adiós Buzz... My Rating : *********** (11/10)"

","I remember watching 'Toy Story' a couple of times... I was in school that time. way back in 1995... the film had become a rage amongst us. I and my pals use to plan to watch 'Toy Story' every weekend and enact a scene from the cult-classic. I was Woody and my best friend was Buzz... oh boy, what memories and what fun! <br/><br/>I am emotionally connected to 'Toy Story', I loved the second installment as well. A decade later, one of my all-time favorite's are back in 'Toy Story 3', the final installment. What Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios achieve in 'Toy Story 3' is something extra-ordinary.<br/><br/>Some films entertain and some films enlighten, but 'Toy Story 3' is a combination of both. A film that is beyond it's characters, beyond it's limitations and beyond it's dream.<br/><br/>The relationship between a now-grown Andy and his Toys is so so beautiful that you leave the auditorium moist-eyed. In fact, the entire cinema was in tears when the end credits rolled. 'Toy Story' had a perfect start and in 'Toy Story 3' they do the very same.<br/><br/>Michael Arndt's writing is EPIC! Lee Unkrich's direction is picture perfect. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen voice Woody and Buzz, like never before. They become more than your favorites. In fact, every character, old or new, is lovable and memorable! <br/><br/>I just hugged my old Woody doll, and my elder brother has caught up Buzz. Even if your a elder, you will fall in love with your toys again after watching this Masterstroke! 'Toy Story 3' is a winner all the way... The Best of it's Trilogy! Two Big Thumbs Up!"

","Thanks to Tom Berger for another animated movie review! Toy Story 3 finishes off the franchise that was started 15 years ago by Pixar's first feature length film, Toy Story. It's an unsurprisingly fitting end to a great series of films, maintaining all of the charm, humour and heart of the previous two films while illustrating what 15 years of evolution can do to CG animation.<br/><br/>The film finds the human star of the series, the not-so-young-anymore Andy, getting ready to pack up for college. Asked to figure what to do with his now long neglected toys Woody and Buzz (voiced by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, respectively) so his younger sister can inherit his bedroom, Andy decides to take Woody along to college, consigning the rest of the maudlin, worried crew to the attic. A misunderstanding by Andy's mom finds the toys on the curb, waiting for the garbage truck. After a narrow escape, the toys manage to get themselves donated to Sunnyside Daycare, where they can finally be played with and appreciated again. Shortly after arrival, they meet the grizzled toy patriarch of the daycare, Lots-O-Huggin Bear (Lotso, voiced by the very good Ned Beatty), who ensures them that their years of neglect are behind them and they can look forward to a lifetime of joy and attention thanks to an ever changing line-up of toddlers.<br/><br/>It becomes quickly clear, however that life at Sunnyside isn't quite as bright as the picture painted, and the toys are now left to hatch an escape plan from the tyranny of Lotso's reign.<br/><br/>The story is gripping and suspenseful, the action is dynamic and exciting (including an amazing Barrel-O-Monkeys nuclear explosion), and the humour, as always, is top notch. There's a formula here, not a complex one but consistent none the less: a little danger, a little emotion, and a laugh every minute-and-a-half, no matter what. Of particular note is Buzz Lightyear set to the Spanish default, and the sexually ambiguous Ken doll strutting his stuff for Barbie in a wide variety of vintage fashions.<br/><br/>The film plays to its strength: its characters and its witty, moving script, and in doing so boils up an engaging story rich with legitimately bitter-sweet themes of separation, loss and transition. Close to home for anyone that has ever outgrown a childhood toy, the film manages to make what might be a modern retelling of ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" sweet and funny while, true to Pixar form, striking a heartfelt nerve. It's not just a great piece of animated storytelling, it's a great film, bar no qualifiers what-so-ever.<br/><br/>Noteworthy as well is the opening Pixar short, Night and Day. It's a remarkable innovative piece, and an inspired hybrid of classical 2D with 3D animation that almost defies description. In fact, the short was such an unexpected joy, I encourage you to watch it knowing as little about it as you can. My favourite Pixar short by a landslide."

"critic-monster","9","1","2","22 June 2010"," Not disappointing and hilarious!
","Before I start, I just want to write: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. I will make an effort not to write any, but I cannot be sure since I do not know what you guys consider ""spoilers"".<br/><br/>So I rate this movie a 9/10! Being that Toy Story 1 & 2 are both a huge piece of my childhood, I had very high expectations for this movie. Most movies (such as ""Shrek 4"") do not even come close to my standards. However, Toy Story 3 was totally not disappointing and I loved every minute of it! <br/><br/>You know how sometimes when you watch a kid's movie, and there's a joke or two in there where all of the children are cracking up, but it's too stupid for any adults to laugh? This never occurred. In fact, I found that it was the opposite at times; every adult was laughing, but little kids were too young to understand it! I found this common throughout ""The Incredibles"" as well. One reason why I love Pixar: they make family movies. <br/><br/>Not only was the comedy hilarious, but the overall story was phenomenal! Yet another great aspect of all Pixar movies. There were the fun times and the heartfelt times. I did not get the urge to cry -- as I have done so during Finding Nemo and UP! -- but the level of hilarity definitely accounted for it. Watching Woody and his overly complicated tactics never failed to make me smile. I became so intensely captivated in the story that I was sad when it ended. This is something everyone looks for when they see a movie -- especially when they have to pay around $4 extra for something in 3D.<br/><br/>So what makes this movie so great? What makes this movie, well, a great movie? The fact that it's for a family. That your children, you, your cousins, aunts, uncles, grandma, everyone, can all go watch this movie and enjoy it. Just because the target audience is 9 and under does not mean you should be ashamed of seeing this movie if you are 14+. It also gave everyone a sense of closure with their favorite childhood series. So, need something to do this weekend? Go watch this movie. If I wasn't disappointed, you won't be either."

""Toy Story 3"" is ""Wow"" It's an all in one package. <br/><br/>Let me start off, I was born the year ""Toy Story"" came out. So I didn't really sit down and watch ""Toy Story"" until I'd say about 1st grade, in 2001, and by that time ""Toy Story 2"" was out in DVD so I got them both, and I really liked them, I was one of those kids where, I'd watch the movie over and over until i knew the lines ha-ha. <br/><br/>So now ""Toy Story 3"". This movie was ""Wow"" It just wowed me. I was touched by how emotional this movie was, I mean for an hour and twenty minutes of the film you were exhilerated, laughing your butt off so hard, and you just felt very incredible by watching the old Toy gang on a new adventure, and the new toys felt like if they were in the previous films as well, then the last 15 mins of the film, is just emotional, then the credits come with the extra footage, and that made you laugh and smile again. It's ""Wow"". <br/><br/>There were adults crying, yes even guys were crying, my mom's boyfriend was even crying, this movie has been the best of many films i have seen in my teenage years, pixar astonishing job on this film.

"alex-sfkid","10","1","2","22 June 2010"," Toy Story 3: Another Great Selection from Pixar
","I just got back from the 12:00 Noon showing of Toy Story 3, and I have to say that this is easily the best film of 2010 so far. I loved Iron Man 2, but this easily tops it. The entire cast (excluding Jim Varney who died) returned for this installment: Tom Hanks returns as Woody, Tim Allen returns as Buzz Lightyear, Joan Cussack returns as Jessie, Don Rickles returns as Mr. Potato Head, John Ratzenberger returns as Hamm, etc. Michael ""Batman"" Keaton steps in as Ken, a character who I believe might upset some gay people, but still is funny. Also, if you want to take your kid to a movie where they won't get scared at all, this isn't it. The movie is MUCH darker than the last 2 Toy Story films. For example: There is a scene at the end after the toys escape from Sunnyside Day Care, where they are taken to the dump by a garbage truck and get caught in a pickle where they are about to be burned alive along with all the trash. The scene is very, very intense for a G-Rated film. All in all, though, Toy Story 3 is a FANTASTIC film and easily the best of 2010 and also my favorite of all 3 Toy Story films. I give it a 9.5/10"
"TheUnknown837-1","7","1","2","21 June 2010"," the only thing it really has standing against it is the fact that it inevitably invites comparison with the first and second entries of the trilogy
","We've all been craving for a third and final hurrah with Woody and Buzz and all of their plastic friends for eleven years now and at last we've been delivered what we've been asking for, to a certain degree. Now, don't start getting worried, folks. I am most certainly *not* trying to warn you off of seeing ""Toy Story 3."" On the contrary, I am *insisting* that you go to see this marvelously-animated, refreshingly fun, and surprisingly moving little gem not just because it is the third and final installment of one of the most beloved sagas of all time, but because it's simply a great movie. All I am saying is that it does not sit on the same tier to the original 1995 ""Toy Story"" or the even greater ""Toy Story 2"" released in 1999. But again, how many films do? Very few.<br/><br/>Some time has passed since ""Toy Story 2"" and things are vastly changing for Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), Buzz (voice of Tim Allen) and their friends. Their owner, Andy is all grown up and heading off to college. Many of their friends have since been sold away or broken and the toys are fearing the same outcome for themselves. By mishap, they end up being whisked away to a daycare center, that is, when the humans are not around, run by a purple stuffed bear (voice of Ned Beatty) who later turns out to not be so cute and cuddly. Once again Woody is the hero trying to set things right as he not only strives to return to Andy before he heads off to college, but save his friends from torture and, possibly, destruction.<br/><br/>There is a lot to praise about ""Toy Story 3."" Starting with the ostensive elements, it is a great-looking movie. The animators, because of a computer glitch, had to rebuild their characters and settings from scratch and you wouldn't know the difference. The animation is marvelous and inventive with a vast array of colors. The movie is fun to look at and is most certainly fun to watch.<br/><br/>The real strength of the ""Toy Story"" trilogy has been in its story. So many movies these days look great, but the visual appeal is badly welded around stories that aren't worth a dime. The trilogy has stood out because of strong stories and characterizations that make you really feel for some individuals are really nothing more than just animated plastic, even in their own world and universe. We go to the level of these toys instead of going with the cliché of staying on the human level and look down upon them. And they have gotten more mature as they have gone along. The first movie's story was about a toy fearing being replaced or forgotten. The sequel dealt with the anticipation that such a thing could happen soon and the third resolves with the actual event of a toy being abandoned by its owner. I don't want to give too much away, because this story starts out strong when we learn that some of the recurring characters from before will not be featured this time around, and it works out to one of the most poignant and genuinely moving culminations of recent years. I was tearing up at the end and I guarantee you many others in the theater I was in were too.<br/><br/>If ""Toy Story 3"" does have anything countering against it, it is the inevitable fact that people will compare and contrast it to the first two movies, which are more complete on a psychological level, and superior as motion pictures and storytelling. By itself, it is a more than fine movie, but we do have a certain tendency to expect the best because Pixar made the lightning strike the top of the tower twice before. And not only with the other two movies in this saga, but with gems such as the recent spellbinder ""Up.""<br/><br/>Despite a few complaints, I immensely enjoyed ""Toy Story 3"" and I more than happily recommend it to everybody. Although it does not have the same level of heart and awe that the first two movies had, it is a more than satisfactory conclusion to this trilogy and without a doubt the best movie that I have seen in a theater this year. The ""Toy Story"" movies are three genuinely enthralling motion pictures. They are the Mount Everest of modern-day animation because they not only look good, but have strong characters and strong stories. And once again, I must reflect upon how my heartstrings were tugged at without remorse when that beautiful ending came along. It's been a long time since a movie has done that to me."

","What's most wonderful about TOY STORY 3, and what sets it apart from the rest of the series, is how it approaches the character of Andy, the kid who was given Buzz Lightyear for his seventh birthday back when nobody had ever heard of Pixar in 1995. Andy's always been a sweet kid, a kid worth the loyalty of Woody, Buzz and the gang, but beyond that, he's been, well, a kid. As we catch up to him in part three, however, Andy's leaving home for college, and his choice of what to do with his toys – bring them, store them in the attic, or trash them – frames the story. The film's insight into Andy proves its best asset, because unlike parts one and two, the toys in this final chapter have a complex relationship with their owner, and their journey is not about simply getting back to him at all costs. It's about the question of where a toy's place in the world is – where it has value, and when. That the end of childhood is the jumping off point for this series capstone makes it not only the darkest of the three, but the most rewarding, at least for a former kid. If you are one, you will more or less love this movie.<br/><br/>Read the rest of my review (and more) at: http://stevenspielblog.com/"
"dvc5159","8","1","2","17 June 2010"," As expected of Pixar; not only an excellent animated film, but also one of the greatest sequels ever.
","After many successive years with critical acclaim (""Ratatouille"", ""WALL- E"", ""Up""), animation powerhouse Pixar returns to its roots - good ol' family entertainment, after an eleven-year gap since the last ""Toy Story"" film. Being a kid when the first one came out I absolutely adored it and enjoyed the second one as well. Between then and now I grew up and watching the two original movies again I started paying attention to the themes and messages that the films were trying to convey, and both films were rich with them, as well as heart. Now, fresh from the cinema, I have seen the third film.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"", is, as expected from Pixar, not only an excellent film AND the best animated film of the year, but also one of the best sequels ever made. Seriously.<br/><br/>Why? Well, apart from the great characterization and chemistry between the characters, terrific voice acting, stunning animation and eye- popping visual effects; this film has a big, beating heart, and strong believability to go along with it.<br/><br/>I watched the first two films. I watched these two repeatedly as the years pass. I not only liked the characters, I related to them. I felt joy, pain and sadness towards them. Knowing that this film is the last film in the ""Toy Story"" franchise made me curious and even sadder. But just because it's the second sequel in the franchise doesn't mean it won't measure up to the first. This film did measure up to the first, mainly in the emotional range. It's hard not to shed a tear when the powerful and emotionally wrenching third act pops up; you know that we've grown up, it's time to move on and say goodbye to our beloved toys that we've all come to love; once and for all. That's not to say that the film is entirely solemn. The film is almost crammed with hilarious jokes in many parts of the film (Spanish Buzz was hilarious and had the entire audience howling with laughter). The screenplay is fantastically written, weaving together the hilarious moments and tender heartwarming moments, while not leaving out the emotional intensity of the film. This is where the film's magic works it's charm on the audience.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, John Ratzenberger, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and Estelle Harris reprise their roles with ease and believability with Blake Clark doing a good job standing in for the late Jim Varney as Slinky. The new-coming actors to the franchise are also good, with veterans like Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Bonnie Hunt, Whoopi Goldberg and (surprise) ex-007 Timothy Dalton providing voices to some very interesting supporting characters. Randy Newman's score is, as usual, lively and upbeat as ever, and Lee Unkrich (standing in for original director John Lasseter), directs the film with a touch of class and charm.<br/><br/>Pixar shows no signs of slowing down and this film certainly continues this winning streak of theirs. If you are a fan, a father, a kid at heart, or just anybody, really; see this film. It will make you laugh, and it may make you cry. But most important of all, it will make you feel like a kid again while reminding you that; it's time to go on.<br/><br/>Despite very few flaws including the sad removal of certain characters that will tick off some fans, ""Toy Story 3"" is ultimately an emotional and ultimately more-than-satisfying conclusion to one of the greatest film trilogies of all time. Woody, Buzz and other characters, thank you for all the laughter and lessons you have taught me and other kids back in the years. Goodbye, and enjoy your places as some of the greatest animated characters ever.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9/10 (Excellent)"
"moviemanMA","9","1","2","20 June 2010"," The toys are back in town
","Toy Story 3 takes us back to the toy chest where we find Woody, Buzz, and the whole gang trying to get grab the attention of Andy, their owner, before he leaves for college. It seems that they are destined to spend the rest of their lives in the attic, unless they do something about it. As Andy decides to either keep his once adored toys, throw them away, or in the case of Woody take him to college, they are mistakenly place in the wrong bag and are nearly thrown away. Thanks to some cunning from the gang, they manage to slip into a box bound for the nearby day care.<br/><br/>At Sunnyside Day Care things seem to be too good to be true. They meet Lotso, a large, magenta teddy bear who greets the gang with open arms. We are led to believe that Sunnyside is a sort of retirement home for toys where they will have nothing else but endless days of being played with. Everyone is on board but Woody, who feels it is his duty to return to Andy. Before he can return home he is found by a girl named Bonnie, who take him home with her.<br/><br/>While Woody tries to get back to Andy, things aren't as smooth as they should be at Sunnyside. Rather than being played with they are mishandled and abused by toddlers. It appears that they were lied to. Now everyone is in the wrong place and it is only just a few days before Andy leaves for college.<br/><br/>I was blown away by the quality of the story. Aside from Up this might be Pixar's most adult film. There are a lot of allusions to the previous films with catchphrases and mannerisms, but this movie hits home in a big way. I think we all have had a moment where we have come across a toy that was once so highly regarded and prized but has fallen away due to maturation and time. There is a moment where you realize that this toy has had its run and it will either be passed down, passed on, or thrown away. In real life it might not be as hard, but when looking at it through the eyes of these toys, it's heartbreaking.<br/><br/>This film and the two previous have all been a focused on identity. In Toy Story Woody can't handle not being the number one toy in Andy's life so he tries to eliminate the competition, only to realize that he is not being forgotten, just that he is a piece to a bigger puzzle. In the second film Woody sees what his past was and how important he is to other people, but what truly matters is who loves him the most, and that is Andy. Here Woody refuses to let go of Andy because he isn't ready. What he learns along with the rest of the group is that they have fulfilled their duty and they must let go.<br/><br/>Thematic elements aside, this is an extremely well done film. I can't say that the animation is better because they are using the same characters in the same world, but compared to the previous films in the series, this looks the best by far. In just their second attempt at making a 3D film, they have succeeded beautifully, though I don't think it is necessary to see it in 3D like how I felt about Up.<br/><br/>The new characters are a lot of fun. Lotso, Ken, Trixie, Mr. Pricklepants, and Buttercup have great personalities are are voiced by excellent actors (Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Kristen Schaal, Timothy Dalton, and Jeff Garlin respectively). Like all Pixar films, they choose the right voice for the character, not the right choice for the marquee. Granted, these are pretty much all well established actors, but it's their talents that make them worth it.<br/><br/>I had mixed feelings going into this film. Toy Story is one of my favorite films and I hate to see a good thing turned into a bad one. I am happy to say that I feel so happy knowing that they took they're time in turning out a great film as well as a perfect ending for a great franchise. For those on the fence about going, do yourself a favor and see this one. It's worth it, but don't feel like you need to see it in 3D. I think it would work perfectly well in regular 2D."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","2","20 June 2010"," Every bit as exciting and special as its predecessors and other Pixar greats
","Pixar has taken the animation genre literally to infinity and beyond in the 15 years since ""Toy Story"" first changed the game forever. So when the ground-breaking production company decided to return to an old friend in 2010 after three straight years of cutting-edge family film-making, you had to know there was a compelling reason to go back to the toys that wasn't merely monetary. Normally any movie title with a ""3"" next to it is a warning sign, but not a Pixar film. ""Toy Story 3"" is every bit imaginative, ingenious, funny and heartwarming as not only its predecessors but also every other animated film out there.<br/><br/>I don't cry at movies -- ever -- but three films in the last three years have pushed my tear ducts to their limits: ""WALL*E,"" ""Up"" and now ""Toy Story 3."" Sure, the first ""Toy Story"" came out when I was still playing with toys, so the nostalgia and attachment factor played a part in my love of this movie as it will for many, but on its own, ""Toy Story 3"" is every bit as intelligent on its own as the Oscar-winning Pixar films of the last two years.<br/><br/>There's no denying the film is cluttered with too many toys we barely get to know and that certain plot elements (namely that relate to the film's antagonism) are rushed, but the film stays unwaveringly true to its heart and message as all Pixar films and great family films do. Kids won't be able to pick up on the toys' existential contemplation as expressed by their desire to be ""played with"" and the feeling of loss and rejection at Andy's going to college, but the humor and physical adventure is right in their wheelhouse.<br/><br/>This final (in all likelihood but not sealed off) story takes the toys to Sunnyside Daycare after they are mistaken for trash when Andy intended them to go in the attic now that he's moving out. What a perfect locale for introducing new characters and giving the toys an opportunity to finally be played with again. Of course it's not long before they realize not everything is ""sunny"" at the daycare as they've been relegated to the youngest kids for whom they're not age appropriate and consequently end up broken and covered in paint. The toys at Sunnyside also have their own chain of authority that begins with Lots-o-Huggin' bear (Ned Beatty) and includes Ken (Michael Keaton) as well as many others.<br/><br/>Woody (Tom Hanks) finds himself separated from the gang because, like always, no one believes him that Andy didn't intend to throw them out. After a side venture to a little girl's house and some more characters like Mr. Pricklepants the thespian hedgehog (Timothy Dalton) and the triceratops Trixie (Kristen Schaal of ""Flight of the Conchords""), the daring Woody must return to Sunnyside and rescue his friends.<br/><br/>The elaborate plan to escape Mission Impossible-style from Sunnyside is Pixar writing at its finest and where the movie really earns its points as far as entertainment goes, especially for those unfamiliar with the characters. Like the previous ""Toy Story"" films, this one also expands the scope to include the big and scary ""real world"" and has a sense of authentic danger, which was exactly what made the originals so captivating and thrilling.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" might not have the thematic power of ""WALL*E"" and ""Up"" (and those are exemplary models, so that is not a shot at this movie) but it certainly outdoes both films in terms of action and plot creativity. Now that the comparison has been made between gold and diamonds, it's time to say that ""Toy Story 3"" will give anyone who ever loved a toy some kind of closure with regard to that last flame of child left inside. <br/><br/>That and there's so much darn good in this movie. From sticking together and helping others to the idea of sacrificing something you hold dear so that someone else can get that same joy from it -- it's all part of that special emotion Pixar captures every single time it embarks on a new project. It proves that touching films start with ideas about human truths. Then the geniuses like the brains at Pixar find ways to wrap clever, funny, entertaining, relatable and lovable concepts around them.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"

","Our beloved Pixar really bring out their dark side with the much-anticipated third installment of their ""Toy Story"" series. I saw a few kids in my theatre with dolls and action figures of the main characters they cherish, but these characters are now faced with an unfortunate and inevitable scenario; their owner Andy has grown up and is leaving for college. That's not the only scenario that they face, too. To be fair, though, this film still has an upbeat tone and has the wit, adventure, and heart of the previous films. I love this one just as much as those and maybe a bit more for the emotional ending.<br/><br/>Woody, Buzz, and several other main toys who are still left spend years in a toy box going unplayed with in Andy's teenage modified room. Days before he heads to college, he decides to bring Woody with him and have the others go in the attic. They're placed in a garbage bag and are mistakenly dropped off at the street curve for the approaching garbage truck. Woody tries to re-enact his rescue scene in the second film by getting Buster the dog to help him, but Buster's now too old for this kind of thing and the scene actually got laughs from the audience, including me. The toys save themselves and think it was done on purpose, so they get in the back of the car to be dropped off at a daycare centre where they'll be played with again. Woody hesitatingly joins them and it's all glorious adventure from here on out.<br/><br/>A group of toys and their Southern accented leader Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear run the daycare for the other toys like a fascist prison. (I'm not kidding.) One room has toys that are treated with care from kids and the other is for toys who are treated poorly from toddlers. It's forbidden for toys to crossover and for them to leave the daycare. Guess which room Woody and his pals get? The latter, but they don't know about it since Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear manipulates them with his friendly personality. Woody wants to be with Andy and as he escapes, he's found by a caring little girl named Bonnie, who takes him to her home. At night, a creepy cymbal-banging monkey toy watches over the daycare via security cameras. I know that toy resembles a real one, but I, myself, was still kind of disturbed by it. Will Woody be able to get back to his friends? Will they be able to escape the daycare and get back to Andy in time? Find out when you watch the film! (Don't worry; you won't be left hanging like ""Woody's Roundup"" show.) <br/><br/>You may get tired of reading this, but the makers at Pixar have done a commendable job yet again. I cared about Woody and his pals like I did for the previous films. The toys keep their personalities, although Buzz experiences the same disorder from the first film and another disorder that kept the audience and I laughing. As I've mentioned, this film has wit and plenty of it, like the grand escape scene at the daycare, especially what Mr. Potatohead does. Pixar always manages to use the perfect blend of storytelling to get a wide audience. Even with a dark tone, I bet ""Toy Story 3"" will still be a hit at the box office; maybe even one of the highest grossing films of the year. If you're reading this review in 2011 or beyond and it wasn't a hit, then it strangely didn't work for Pixar this time.<br/><br/>I cannot praise the animation enough. It is *ace*. The opening fantasy scene will show you right away with its texture. Since technology has really improved over the last decade, the animators know how to use it. The detail with the landfill scene probably would've been too difficult to make in the '90s. Of course, the main characters we cherish look the same and not blown out of proportion. The animation is one reason the film will, in all likelihood, be nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature.<br/><br/>The film is rated G by the MPAA and Canada's provincial rating boards, but I think it's somewhere between G and PG. Children under six or seven may be frightened by some scenes. The film's darkness is arguably necessary for the main characters as they metaphorically experience the pains of being unwanted from someone who used to love playing with them. As with ""Ratatouille"", one moral to the story is that family is more important than anything else. Families stick together, no matter what.<br/><br/>Although the film is not without flaws, they feel very minor. I sort of predicted the ending and there are coincidental moments that are done just to drive the story, like how the garbage truck arrives during two conflicts. Kids aren't likely to notice them and will hopefully be engaged with the film like me. Yes, third time is definitely a charm. Just like the first and second films, when you see this one, you may even want to see it again."

","It's hard to describe how good this movie is. I saw the first when I was in my 20s and without any kids, and it was great. But now to have my kids scootch up next to me during the scary parts and then cheer with me during the good parts is one of the great joys of my life. Did I cry? You better believe it. Just like I cried the last time I re-watched Toy Story 2.<br/><br/>If you have any doubts about being a parent, take them to see a Pixar movie. And if you have any doubts about Pixar movies, have kids. This is why movies were created, and it's why movie theaters still exist.<br/><br/>Thank you Pixar."

","Andy is going off to college and is given the option of putting his toys in the attic or throwing them out. Through a series of unfortunate events, the toys actually end up being donated to Sunnyside Daycare. Which at first, seems like a wonderful place to be, but the truth about the place is soon discovered by the toys and they try to escape.<br/><br/>In 1995 when Toy Story first hit the screens, I was around 7 or 8 years old. I am in disbelief at how young I was, 1995 doesn't seem that long ago, but it's been 15 years. I was still in elementary school when the second one came out too. I was young and was able to connect to both of the films, I saw a little of myself in Andy. I grew up playing with plastic army men, dinosaurs and cowboys. There is a special bond between a boy and his toys and Toy Story got it perfect. The original Toy Story introduced us to a few things. One was Pixar, a studio that would go on to create dozens of films that are entertaining and brilliant. Another was the first fully computer animated feature film. It changed the way animated films were made. Finally it gave us two of the most recognizable animated characters of all time, Woody and Buzz. <br/><br/>Flashforward 11 years after Toy Story 2. I have recently graduated college and don't play with my toys anymore. Andy is heading off to college and he doesn't play with his toys anymore. The big question I had was, can a third entry to a series that is more than a decade old, still hold true to the original and will I still be able to connect to it? The answer is yes, on both accounts. Toy Story 3 is magical, entertaining and heartfelt. It reminded me of my childhood and my toys, the biggest thing this film has going for it is nostalgia. I found it funny that more than half the people in the audience were not alive when the first film came out. <br/><br/>The constant fear of being discarded is present here, as it is in all three of the films. With this entry it is the forefront issue. The themes of loss, friendship and courage are all present in this third installment. Usually the third film in a franchise falls short of what the first two are, but this is not the case. Toy Story 3 is just as good as the first two. My minor complaint is that there is that one thing that is missing. It might be the 11 year gap between the films, but there is that little special thing that made me love the first two films that this one doesn't seem to have. Buzz seems a little underused as do the other toys, but this is a small issue that doesn't ruin a great film.<br/><br/>There are 3 scenes in the film that made me almost cry. Hey, I said ALMOST. The first one is pretty early on, when Woody calls for a meeting, something we are accustomed to in the previous installments. But this time we don't see dozens of toys coming out from under the bed, behind closets or out of bins. It's just these guys. All the other toys that we see in the background are gone. Even though they were never the main characters, or given a lot of screen time, there was something about each one that we seemed to love. This people were a family and that family is broken. Wheezy, Bo Peep, Etch, RC, Lenny the Binoculars, Mike the tape recorder, Rocky Gibraltar the gladiator. Dozens of lovable background characters that made us love that room so much more.<br/><br/>The other two scenes are near the end, one in which the toys join hands in fear of their ultimate doom. It's their realization of the end and their bonding together that got to me. The other is the final send off from Andy. The film builds on the previous adventures these characters had to tug on the heart strings. It never reaches the emotional depths of Up, but these are two totally different films. The way they chose to end the series, in my opinion was perfect and sad. <br/><br/>There are hundreds of new characters, all introduced at the Daycare. At first you would seem to think that you will be overwhelmed with all the additional characters, but it is never an issue. The two most prominent new characters are Lotso Hugs and Ken, who is voiced by Batman himself. Some of the more interesting new characters are never given a chance to shine, they belong to Bonnie in her room, mainly my new favourite Mr. Pricklepants. <br/><br/>The film mixes adventure, comedy and drama all perfectly. It's not as funny as the first two, but it is more adventurous. The animation doesn't call for anything fancy, these are toys after all, yet Pixar finds a way to still dazzle the eye. The climax of the film has a lot going on and it is edge of your seat entertainment.<br/><br/>To end this review, I'll simply say the last thing Andy said before leaving the toys...""Thanks Guys"""
"undergrad21","9","1","2","19 June 2010"," Remembering the old days
","Do you ever get that nostalgic feeling of when you were a child? When nothing seemed too complicated and you felt loved? Toy Story 3 is an excellent movie with good pacing and well fleshed out characters in its own right, but what made this an above OUTSTANDING movie is that watching this reminded me of my 7 year old self feeling like i was on top of the world.<br/><br/>The story line of Toy story 3 is nothing we haven't seen before. Much like the previous two, its about staying together as a family and coming back home. But as far as the story telling and presentation goes, this recycled story line feels fresh yet familiar enough to those of us who grew up with the original movies to feel at home.<br/><br/>I cannot praise enough about this movie and i say its one of the few must see movies of the summer. Even if you don't like over priced popcorn and sticky floors, once the movie starts you'll feel right at home, wherever you were when you first watched the series back in 1997."

","11 years of waiting for a third and it was worth the damn wait. My goodness what a fantastic film, one of the best second sequels of all-time. It's great to see all (well, almost) the characters back. Randy Newman is back as the composer and gives another Oscar-worthy score. Toy Story 3 from the beginning to the end has very clever storytelling (they better win for screenplay at the Oscars next year), laughs, tears & action thanks to Pixar as is the case with them. This movie is amazing, mix with lots of laughs & tears. The ending will make you cry even if you don't want to, it will make you cry. Very easily, the best film of the year kicks Kick-Ass off the spot of the best film of the year. Toy Story 3 is another masterpiece from Pixar, their second best in my opinion (behind a three-way tie Wall-E, Finding Nemo & Ratatouille)."
"craigjohnson20","8","1","2","19 June 2010"," A Fitting End to A Great Trilogy
","PIXAR: Hits – 11. Failures – O I'm not sure how long Pixar can keep up this amazing tightrope walk of great films; but, for now, it's all good.<br/><br/>In 1995, we were introduced to a boy named Andy and his toys, including cowboy, Woody and Space Ranger, Buzz Lightyear. Now it's fifteen years after the first film – although in the film world, it's closer to ten. Andy is seventeen years old now; and although he will soon be off to college, and is too old to play with toys, he still keeps a motley crew of his childhood possessions in the old toy trunk in his room. The paired down group of toys consist of Woody, Buzz, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, piggy-bank Hamm, Slinky-Dog (Blake Clark flawlessly filling in for the late Jim Varney), cowgirl Jessie, Bulls-Eye the horse, Rex the dinosaur, and three of those Pizza Planet aliens that worship the claaaaawwww.<br/><br/>It's a time of sadness for Andy's toys. Woody and the gang keep trying in vain to get Andy to play with them. And at one point (sniff) it dawns on us that Woody has lost the love of his life, Little Bo Peep long ago, possibly in some garage-sale.<br/><br/>Then things take a turn for the worse when Andy has to decide whether to either throw his toys in the garbage, move them up to the attic, or donate them to a day-care centre. Andy decides to take Woody with him to college and move the rest of the toys up to the attic. However, the toys, minus Woody, decide they would rather be played with in day-care then to stay cooped up in the attic. So, they manage to get themselves packed away in the donation box in Andy's Mom's car – it's a long story; but trust me, they get there.<br/><br/>As Woody breaks free of Andy's luggage and tries to explain to his toy-friends the importance of their loyalty to Andy, he ends up getting shipped off to day-care too.<br/><br/>No sooner do they arrive at day-care, then Woody breaks ranks and tries to make his way back to Andy. Along the way, he winds up in the possession of a little girl and it's there that he learns that his toy friends, rather than being played with by a bunch of five to eight year olds like they used to with Andy, they are being trampled upon, chewed on, and suffer all types of abuse by a room full of toddlers. Worst of all, Andy's toys can't escape because, after hours, the day-care becomes a rainbow-coloured gulag run by the furry pink, strawberry-scented ruler named Lots O' Hugs (Lightning Crash!) Now, Woody is on a mission to save his friends in an elaborate prison break to get back to Andy's house.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3, is the funniest Pixar movie I have seen in a while. And what I like about the humour in Pixar movies as opposed to the humour in Dreamwork's ""Shrek"" or ""Madagascar"" movies is that Pixar doesn't try to make people laugh by specifically referencing movies like ""The Matrix"" in ""Shrek"" or ""Planet of the Apes"" in ""Madagascar"". Much of the humour comes from parodying the conventions of the prison-break sub-genre rather than specific films themselves: although, ""Toy Story 3″ alludes to movies like ""The Great Escape"", we never once hear that film's catchy theme song, nor do we see Buzz Lightyear bouncing a ball repeatedly off a wall and catching it. We do, however have a Fisher-Price phone that has been in the day-care for decades, and knows the ins and outs on how to stay alive on the inside. I suspect Pixar movies will have a longer shelf-life than many of it's Dreamworks counterparts; not just because they are better films, overall; but because they are not concerned with being hip and current the way Dreamworks tends to be.<br/><br/>I have heard some reviewers say this film is darker and scarier than it's predecessors; but I don't think anything in this film is any darker than Sid's room of toy-torture from the first film. So if your child was okay with that, they should be fine with this.<br/><br/>And although, I wouldn't say this film is quite as good as the previous two, it's very exciting, humorous, the characters are as endearing as ever; and the thing ends on a very touching final note that makes you hope they don't muck it up with a fourth entry.<br/><br/>On a final note This is the second film from Pixar, after ""Up"", to be made in 3D. However, just like the previous film, I don't think this needs to be seen in 3D – in fact, the 3D is less necessary here than it was in ""Up"" since that film had the added bonus of some very nice aerial effects. There's nothing gimmicky about the 3D effects in Pixar's movies; and at some points, with this film, I even forgot that I was even watching it in 3D."

","I just have to say that this is without a doubt one of the BEST movies of the decade. It beats out Toy Story One and Two a million to one. It causes you to laugh hysterically at parts and ball your eyes out of sadness at others. (Keep in mind that I enjoyed the first two)<br/><br/>It's got something for everyone. It's great for children, PERFECT for older teens, and even great for adults. There were quite a few very emotional adults in the theater I was in. All around, it's not audience age specific, but I do recommend having seen the others before this one if you haven't. Although the others aren't NEARLY as good as this one, you feel more attached after having seen the others. <br/><br/>Another note: The 3D doesn't really add or take anything away from the movie, so if you want to save some money, see it in regular theaters. It's up to your personality, but it really doesn't add or subtract. It's just there."

"MovieFanGuyy","7","3","12","23 June 2010"," I liked Toy Story 3 but....... not as much as the first two films.
","Pixar is back at it again, with a film that fans have been waiting for over 11 years, Toy Story 3. All of the great toys are back, Buzz Lightyear, Woody, and so fourth. <br/><br/>(There are serious spoilers in this review so beware!)<br/><br/>The first and ending parts are the best, but I felt that the middle story was really weak, and this series is really starting to show it's age.<br/><br/>The first film, which was released back in the mid 1990s, was the first CGI animated film in history was was another great milestone in Disney animation, and Toy Story 2 was released four years later, and is considered by many, including myself, to be the best film of the series.<br/><br/>Now 11 years later, Disney and Pixar are back with Toy Story 3. This time, Andy, the owner of the toys is now 17 years old and about to depart for college. He hasn't played with his toys for a long time, and they are starting to miss their interactions with him. After a very imaginative opening, which takes the opening of the first film to a new level, the very long mid-section begins, which takes the characters from Andy's house to a daycare center called Sunnyside, to a landfill, and this section is very long and prodding. Aside from a few humorous moments such as Buzz speaking in Spanish, the story lags in this section. Woody finds a young girl named Bonnie who is a child who attends Sunnyside, and goes to her home. I also seriously missed BoBeep's interactions with Woody from the first two films.<br/><br/>Some of the middle sections are extremely cheesy to watch, such as Ken and Barbie, and a bad fashion show set to the tune of 70's disco hit ""Le Freak"", which has got to be the low point of the series. After the high note of Toy Story 2, which doesn't have a weak moment in it at all, I found quite a few low notes in Toy Story 3. Sure, many will disagree with my points here, but as a fan of this series, I felt that the middle section needed a lot of work.<br/><br/>The end brings it all home as Andy is reunited with Buzz and Woody and the last time he plays with them and says goodbye to his beloved toys is easily the best part of the film. With that being said, when Pixar makes a fourth Toy Story, I say that they start from scratch and focus on the central characters as the third film had far too many characters interacting in a very weak mid section which was nothing more than an animated prison escape film. I loved the first two Toy Story films, as well as other Pixar classics like Up, Monsters Inc, and The Incredibles, but I didn't enjoy Toy Story 3 as much as the first two Toy Story films. It's great seeing Buzz Lightyear and Woody back on the big screen, but next time, hopefully Pixar will focus on the central characters rather than adding too many characters next time around in the inevitable fourth Toy Story movie. I would give this three stars or a 7 rating. However these characters are timeless so we'll see them on the big screen again guaranteed."
"aschein81","7","5","25","21 June 2010"," A funny and zany children's screwball comedy...but not one of Pixar's best
","First things first, this is a film obviously aimed at children ages 3-10, so I am not exactly the target audience for this. That being said, if I was a kid in that age range I would have a blast at this movie, as it is great fun for the very young, undeveloped mind. However, as an adult reviewer I give this film a mixed review overall, for it does some things well, yet fails in other aspects.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is quite a bit of fun, with plenty of gags and silly comedic moments. If escapism and comedy is all you are looking for in a summer film, then this film will serve you just fine. It is an entertaining summer film, so I would recommend it on that level alone. However, let's look at some of this flaws, which certainly don't make it deserving of a 9 or 10.<br/><br/>Flaw 1 - lack of heart or character growth. Unlike Pixar's 3 masterpieces, UP, Wall-E and Nemo, this film just lacks any kind of emotion, wonder, or heart. It feels more like an Ice Age film that is simply focused on comedy and action, but feels very hollow emotionally. It feels like the team at Pixar was just going through the motions of churning out another cutesy film, without trying very hard to make it a good one. It is true that the last 5 minutes have some heart, but the 85 minutes before that don't have much at all. Certainly far less than what we would expect in a Pixar film.<br/><br/>Flaw 2 - the 2nd half of the film really drags. After about 30-35 minutes into the film, the script suddenly becomes cliché-ridden as the toys get captured and have to be rescued/escape back home. Literally nothing interesting or mentally engaging happens in the 2nd half, other than the toys trying to escape, with a few gags thrown in. This becomes tedious after a while, so the film feels about 15 minutes longer than necessary.<br/><br/>Pros - Top notch animation, some funny gags, Latso the Bear character, and a great opening scene Cons - Story is too simple and drags during the 2nd half, too many Ken/ Barbie scenes becomes repetitive."

","I was really looking forward to this movie because of all the great reviews. I was seriously disappointed. <br/><br/>The plot was boring and stupid in my opinion. Not suitable for kids and definitely not satisfying for adults. I had read reviews saying that new characters were really funny such as the ""gay"" ken but i don't think there was any emphasis on characteristics of the new toys. Also I couldn't feel any sympathy towards a bunch of toys which were feeling vulnerable because their human is going to college. Not cute. <br/><br/>I really didn't enjoy the whole movie and was waiting for it to be over. Its a shame because i like all other Pixar movies and am a big fan of cartoons in general."
"Baldyy","5","3","13","9 August 2010"," Entertaining For Adults, Dark and Eye-Opening for Children
","This movie is Rated G and is clearly not directed towards a ""General Audience"". Half, if not all of the humor in this movie is way above the heads of young children, and is definitely not something I want my kids to be laughing about at such a young age. ""Toy Story 3"" is an incredible step down from the first two movies in that it has ZERO character development. The only character who remotely changes is Big Baby, who is overshadowed throughout the whole movie by Lotso anyway. The story is also much darker and depressing than the first two; Woody's grim outlook makes him a much less likable character and there is really no clear protagonist throughout the film.<br/><br/>The tone of this movie is considerably more somber than the first two films. As a movie supposedly directed toward children, it has several ominous undertones; the daycare resembles a concentration camp, and Lotso almost like a dictator with absolute power over everyone inside. I would rather wait for my kids to see ""Schindler's List"" when they're old enough to understand it than have their minds darkened by the evil doings of Lotso and his companions at such a young age. Lotso is also a horrible influence on young children, and everything he does in this movie is everything that children should learn not to do. I can't tell you how many children were disappointed that Lotso never changed heart throughout the movie; I feel like it's ""American History X"" all over again. This is alright for mature audiences, but when Woody helps saves Lotso's life and Lotso tries to kill him again, what kind of message is that sending to children? That people cannot change? That there is no hope for the evildoers in this world? Kids are supposed to learn to be forgiving, but this message teaches the exact opposite.<br/><br/>Not to say that this movie wasn't brilliantly put together with beautiful animations and emotionally stimulating moments, as Pixar never fails to accomplish. I personally enjoyed the movie, although the comedy was a bit over the top at times, especially with Ken. However, it failed to spark any thought in my mind afterwords, resulting from the lack of character development and ingenuity in the plot. I would rate it a 4/5 for anyone over the age of 12, and a 1/5 for any child that wouldn't comprehend half of it."

I don't understand why the rating on IMDb was so high. There is way too little humor in this movie. The rest of the scenes is not really anything we haven't seen before. A big Nazi bear who locks the hero's up and they try to escape the camp... did not get me smiling. And then all the whining, we have to get back to Andyyyy, Andyyyy loves us.. bla bla bla Now for the positive part of the review: it looks amazing!

But the rest of the movie? I felt like it was a waste of my time and money. I had gone in with high expectations after hearing all the rave reviews and, I must say it is one of the worst sequels Disney have ever produced, in my opinion, that is. While the second movie in this trilogy, this movie was however, enjoyed by younger viewers. It takes them on a roller coaster of emotions and teaches them lessons about growing up. But, having viewed it from the point of view of a twenty-something who grew up with these movies, I left feeling disappointed and deflated."
"joshuadrake-39480","10","1","3","15 May 2015"," The best TOY STORY yet!
","TOY STORY 3 was released after eleven years of waiting for a third TOY STORY film and negotiations with Disney and Pixar and this is the best TOY STORY yet! The plot focuses on the toys, Woody, Buzz Lightyear and their friends dealing with an uncertain future as their owner, Andy, prepares to leave for college.<br/><br/>TOY STORY 3 is better than the second ""Toy Story"" film and I think the film is just as good as the first two. The comedy in this film is really funny and hilarious and the story of the film is amazingly well written by Oscar writer Michael Arndt. This film was the first animated Disney film to gross over a billion dollars, until FROZEN did this in 2013.<br/><br/>Lotso is the only problem I have. He is way too dark and serious for this kind of movie, but they wanted a darker villain for the Pixar movies and I think the story is amazingly well-done once again.<br/><br/>The end of the film with Andy giving the toys to Bonnie was told perfectly and the scene with the toys almost being incinerated at the dump was sad and emotional for me, the music was really sad and I did not laugh, I just felt sorry for the characters during that whole sequence.<br/><br/>The acting, like the first two TOY STORY films is just top-notch and the returning cast members are amazingly perfect in their performances.<br/><br/>The new cast members are Ned Beatty, who does the voice of Lotso and he does a good job in the part of a bear who smells like strawberries AND is really evil. Michael Keaton plays the voice of Ken, Barbie's love interest and he was the right choice to play the part and he was amazing.<br/><br/>This film actually appears on my ""Top 10 Best Disney Movies"" and it is the best of the TOY STORY franchise. The other new cast members are Whoopi Goldberg as Stretch, Timothy Dalton as Mister Pricklepants and the rest of the new cast is just amazing in their performances as well.<br/><br/>I think the only character that I feared about was Slinky Dog. This was the character that Pixar and other fans of TOY STORY feared about.<br/><br/>The character was originally voiced by Jim Varney, who was suffering from cancer during production of TOY STORY 2, and died a few months after it's release and he was replaced by Blake Clark and he does a really good job in the part.<br/><br/>The music by David Newman is once again incredible and I do love the musical score for this film and the song he wrote for the end of the film, ""We Belong Together"" and that was good to hear during the ending titles.<br/><br/>There have been talks about another TOY STORY and it is going to happen and will be released in 2017. I can't wait for that.<br/><br/>Overall, TOY STORY 3 is the best of the TOY STORY films and I can't wait to see another one in 2017 and it will be fantastic and amazing and it is definitely the best TOY STORY film ever made! This film is also an ABSOLUTE SMASH HIT - 10/10!"
"tsakiridis1217","10","1","3","26 March 2015"," The Way All Animated Films Should Be, Beautiful
","Before watching Toy Story 3, I decided to revisit 1 and 2. When they were made, I was actually 1 and 4 years old. And those were such amazing movies, emotional, captivating, heart-driven and hopeful stories that I couldn't help it but wonder: Can a 3rd movie work the same wonderful way the previous ones did? <br/><br/>Well, the answer is a loud ""Yes!"". From the beginning till the end, every single moment is fun and endearing. Pixar got it all right; coming up with new situations and exploring new territories but never destroy or alter what we loved about these characters. Woody and Buzz by now should be acknowledged as a whole generations' childhood memories. We have grown with them, shared with them, felt for and with them and experienced with them so many. <br/><br/>And a strong reference to the voices: Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. If they were not in it, I don't know if this could work the same way. On all three movies, they managed to capture hearts and emotions on such deep levels... they are basically the reason why we love Toy Story. And by the end of this one, we owe them a big ""thank you"".<br/><br/>I don't care if you are 5,15,25,35,45,55,65,75,85,95 years old... this is the movie you must see to be moved and feel like never before. This is the perfect ending to a beautiful trilogy, filled with heart, love and hope."

","Toy Story 3 was the perfect finale to the Toy Story trilogy. It made me laugh, and made me cry, and even with it's new story brought in elements of the previous two. Growing up with these movies, that was an important aspect for me, and I'm so glad that this movie didn't ruin the entire thing. It just made it so much better! <br/><br/>The introduction of new characters was a little bit iffy to me, because Jesse and Woody and Rex and all of the existing characters were already so ingrained in my mind. Lotso and the others were the perfect addition, and without giving anything away, they were the perfect enemies. <br/><br/>I'm very glad that this movie turned out this way and that it is relatable to young kids and adults alike. I think that Pixar made their mark again, with this new favorite enjoyable for all ages. If you haven't yet seen Toy Story 3, do so now!"
"andykessinger","9","1","3","6 January 2013"," Amazing
","I grew up with the Toy Story movies. I grew up in the same years, and ages that Andy was in the first two movies. When Toy Story 3 came out, I went and saw it, and having graduated myself, I knew the feeling. Let em get straight to the point: I thought that the movie was very well made, the animation, like all Pixar movies, was excellent, the story was excellent, and the humor was priceless. Many people expected too much out of this movie, but it was better than I myself expected. Well worth seeing, but be sure to know the first two well before seeing this one, because it won't mean as much if you don't. Toy Story is my favorite childhood movie, and this one definitely does it a lot of justice."
"duffy047","10","1","3","4 January 2013"," A delightful movie experience
","I'm ashamed to admit that I haven't seen much of Toy Story up until recently. I'm positive that I haven't seen any of the movies in theaters and I only remember watching Toy Story 2 when it aired on television about 5 years ago. It is strange that I hadn't seen it before, being 10 years of age back in 1995 when Toy Story came out and thus being target audience.<br/><br/>Having found reviews and scores of Toy Story on IMDb.com, I decided to give the movies a try and watch all three of them starting with Toy Story, then Toy Story 2 and to wrap up with Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>It was, in my honest opinion, a very delightful movie.<br/><br/>Looking back on all the three movies, I now see that ""growing up"" is the main theme of these movies and that each movie has its own adventure that is part of the ""growing up"" theme. Toy Story is also a movie that many people, young and old, can relate to because viewers will look back on their own youth and experiences of growing up.<br/><br/>A theme in which viewers recognize themselves in, in combination with very likable characters performed by a great cast (and each character stealing the show in their own way) and some genuine adventure, humor and emotion makes the Toy Story movies a highly recommended ""Must See"" movie for boy or girl, man or woman.<br/><br/>If Toy Story 3 were to be the last of the series, then it has been a good closure. If there is going to be a Toy Story 4, then I will be looking forward to it and I will be watching it in theaters.<br/><br/>And to be a little bit off-topic: when it comes to animation movies, Pixar has made some great movies like Toy Story, Ratatouille, Wall-E and others. Keep up to good work and keep delivering us great animation movies for us, young and old, to see! Thank you!"

","After the dual success of Toy Story (1995) and Toy Story 2 (1999), when the production of Toy Story 3 was announced many like me were not surprised, but I didn't expect much, thinking what will be the next adventure for this crew. When the movie commenced with shots of Andy at his young age, I was smiling as it was good to see him all happy and his toys complete. Then it fades to show us Andy all grown up and ready for college, with the toys eager for some playtime with him. This new Toy Story animation had our Toys go through a stage when their owners are too old to play with them, and our toys got mistakenly donated to a Day Care, with Woody wanting them to go back to Andy's who wants to move them to the Attic.<br/><br/>The new story of Toy Story 3, made me raise an eye brow as I was eager to see what was going to happen next; it was from that point I knew this was going to be a fun ride, and a fun ride it truly was. The removal of some of the old characters and the addition of some new characters, added to the fun. Disney/Pixar Toy Story 3 had it all, then there is the climactic scene near the ending where all of Andy's toys were at a junkyard and with all heading to a sure doom, they held hands ready to go down together. I remember the feeling I got when watching that scene; I was like, ""something better happen to save these guys.""<br/><br/>With Disney's acquisition of Pixar in 2006, saw John Lasseter rise to be in charge of all Disney animation production, this gave more room to the production crew unlike the tight schedule and the back and forth talk they had to face while working on Toy Story 2. John Lasseter who directed the first two Toy Stories, stepped down from directing this one, because of the production of Cars 2 was in progress at that time and he was directing it. So Toy Story 2's co-director, Lee Unkrich was the sole director of this film, and he did a good work as this movie can stand beside the previous two, with its head held up high.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 won the Oscar for Best Animated feature and another for Best Original song, it became the highest grossing animation ever, grossing over 1 billion dollars and if you have taken the time to see the previous two Toy Stories then there is no reason you shouldn't see this one.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

"maciem7","10","1","3","8 November 2012"," Tale of the Toys
","Toy Story 3 is an unrivaled movie, and is the premium choice out of the Toy Story trilogy. Animation, storyline, and actor and character choice play a colossal role in making Toy Story 3 the stupendous movie that it is. Making $1,063,171,911, this is a motion picture that appeals to all ages and pleases every single viewer. <br/><br/>Essentially, the animation that Pixar implemented in Toy Story 3 makes the movie as pleasing as it is; without it, the tale would not have received a 92/100 from metascore. Using Pixar animation, all the characters look real, but with a tad bit if cartoon features and looks. Pixar does this by creating three dimensional models, and using computer animation to animate the models. In all animated movies, the actors voice over the animations, and the same process was used to create Toy Story 3. Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, and Joan Cusack as Jessie are just a few big name actors and actresses who played roles in this tale of the toys, and the entire case did a gratifying job throughout this story. <br/><br/>Evidentially, the director, Lee Unkrich, and the writers of Toy Story 3, John Lasetter, Lee Unkrich, Andrew Stanton and Michael Arndt wrote a fantastic and greatly reviewed story line. In the motion picture, Woody and the other toys from the toy box get packed up and sent to a day care facility when Andy, their owner is off to college. The toys meet many new acquaintances, but do not care for the guests who come to the facility, so they attempt to break out with help from the residential toys. I personally like how Unkrich used the techniques used by Lasseter, the director of the other two Toy Story movies, and brought back the characters from the preceding movies. An interesting fact about the movie is that the Pizza Planet delivery truck appears in every Pixar movie, including all three Toy Story tales, except The Incredibles. The movie is humorous, but at some instances, intense. A quote that demonstrates the humor is said by Rex the Green Dinosaur about Lotso the Bear, ""And he smells like strawberries!""<br/><br/>Conversely, I thought that Toy Story 3 was not the best installment of the trilogy until I was persuaded by other sources. Equal to all other third movies, I thought that the movie was not as full of excitement as the other two motion pictures. Many people may have been let down by the third installment, and this does not help the trilogy's popularity. Additionally, some of the new characters are not as strong as the crew of regular toys, like Lotso the Bear has an evil side, which may not appeal to younger children. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the main characters are Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Rex, Hamm, Lotso, Barbie and Ken. All of these animations are splendidly voiced by a variety of well renown actors and actresses. Unkrich was emphatically smart to pick all the roles and role players that he did. Having the same voices that were featured in the first movies was appropriate for this motion picture. Viewers greatly appreciated this, and it helped the rating be as high as it is. Incorporating known toys, such as Ken and Barbie, was also particularly brilliant because children can use these popular toys to reenact their parts in the movie. <br/><br/>Obviously, Toy Story 3 is a wonderfully made and acted motion picture, but you, a viewer of the movie and a reader of this review, should answer this question. Are the first two Toy Story movies a sufficient ending to the series? After seeing this third movie, your opinion will be changed. Toy Story 3 concludes the Toy Story trilogy in an extravagant way."

","Hi Guys, Actually i never watch animated movies until and unless there is something like THIS.The script of this movie is so well tamed that you will find yourself lost....even a beginner like me who watched the Toy Story 3 first finds the subject very interesting and the screenplay keeps you glued to the seat. The voice over artists are perfect match for the characters they depicted.This is where i begin my Toy Story in a non linear fashion.Overall this movie is a fantastic depiction of story telling.Animation is one where your creativity is put to testing and the Director of this film defined it in a perfect way. The only loop hole i found was that the motive behind Lots'Os past.However he deserved his fate in the very End. This is the only movie which i have rated 10/10 till date.May be there are many more classics out there which i have not yet seen."

"TonyHurtado","9","1","3","28 January 2011"," Toy Story 3, is the best animated film ever!
","I have waited 10 years for this to finally come, finally Pixar has concluded the Toy Story franchise with Toy Story 3. Although Toy Story 3 was funny at times the movie was also very touching especially at the end. The end was the saddest part of the whole movie, I admit I shed a slight tear because it reminded me that growing up has it's perks but also it's downs. One of it's downs is that you start to miss the good old days where you felt like you can do anything and that you cant enjoy your toys like you used to. Anyways besides the sadness Toy Story 3 is an instant classic. Probably the best movie of the year and best movie of the summer of 2010. I would give it 10 out of 10 tars for the excellence in the story, the animation and just the movie itself. This movie will probably be considered one of the best films ever created as time progresses."
"Dragonfyre137","6","1","3","3 January 2011"," Worth of watching, but not necessarily worth of the cinema entry price
","Before watching the movie myself, I first read a couple of other reviews and even got surprised finding this movie no. 27 of top 250 movies. however, I don't think Toy Story 3 deserves such a high rank:<br/><br/>The animations might not be the worst, but on the other hand they are not quite the best as well. I don't want to spoil anyone: The plot itself matches the level of a Disney movie: Not too complicated for small kids to understand, but not that interesting to keep you in front of the telly for the whole time. Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind that Toy Story 3 is mainly for children rather than adults, so it's not quite fair to compare it to adult-movies. It was entertaining at some points, but at some parts I wasn't quite sure whether something was supposed to be funny or not, so the tin-laugh would have been useful.<br/><br/>As I said, I don't think Toy Story deserves the rating of 8.7 as compared to other movies, If you ask me it's ""worth watching"", but when going to the pictures, I'd think twice if it's really worth the 10 bucks.<br/><br/>Hence: 6/10"
"Gambitt","7","1","3","20 December 2010"," Dark, different, but still fun
","As entertaining and fun as it was, I liked Toy Story 3 less than its predecessors. It simply lacked the sweetly poetic and soulful touch that made the first two instant classics.<br/><br/>The artwork, animation, music, and voice acting are all superb, as we've come to expect. Toy Story 3 is much darker, even downright creepy at times, a welcome change from the first two. Like Up, Toy Story 3 does not adhere as tightly to a central theme as prior Pixar movies. However, unlike my experience with Up, I did not come away inspired and moved by the adventure and the characters. Instead, the movie felt like it bounced all over, sampling from themes already explored in Toy Story 1 and 2, nibbling on a few new ideas, but never really delving too deeply in any one direction.<br/><br/>My bigger issue is that Toy Story 3 relies more heavily on visual slapstick, referential gags, and audience familiarity with the first two movies. In short, it feels much more like a Dreamworks movie. True, Dreamworks movies are fun, but Pixar has always made superior films by sticking to bold and fresh characterization, clever jokes, and sincere, masterfully woven messages.<br/><br/>But the end result is still a 7 out of 10. Even when stumbling, Pixar still makes very good movies."
"doctorsmoothlove","7","1","3","19 September 2010"," Thrice-Told Tales
","The novelist Colum McCann writes in an interview regarding his most recent novel Let the Great World Spin that there is a continuous need for authors to tell stories. Stories will never stop needing to be told, and there are an infinite number of stories to tell. Still, some stories are so unusual that I find myself unable to conceptualize their creation. Pixar does this, and frequently. I'm amazed that over the past years they have produced stories about a rat that cooks, a robot that cleans garbage, and an old man who floats to South America in his house. All of these sound silly when I describe them to you, but they are told with a great degree of artistry and humanity. They have been some of the best films of their years.<br/><br/>The release of Toy Story 3 in 2010, fifteen years after the original, provides kindle for the argument that Pixar is taking a creative break and milking their flagship franchise. One of these is true; they are relishing in public awareness of the Toy Story saga. They have earned the right to relax a bit after three consecutive years of original works. What they have not earned the right to do is lower the quality of their films. While this installment is not as wonderful as the previous two, it is still a worthy follow up. It's a slight decline, like earning your first A-.<br/><br/>The film takes place several years after the previous ones. Andy has finished high school and is ready to attend college. Woody, Buzz, Jesse, and the other toys have been locked away in a toy box for years since his childhood ended. Since all toys have the desire to be played with, many of the remaining ones want to find another owner. Andy's mom asks him to decide what do with them. He can put them in the attic, take them to college, or donate them to a daycare center. After a mistake that only seems to happen in animated movies, the toys (save Woody) are taken to Sunnyside Daycare and welcomed by its loving authoritarian Lots 'O Huggin' Bear. He explains that this is a paradise for toys, as there will always be children to play with them.<br/><br/>He doesn't mention that the youngest children are abusive, while the older ones are gentler. Lots-'O and his cohorts are always played with by the older children, while Andy's toys must survive with the toddlers until he sees a use for them. The daycare provides the story with many new characters, including Ken and Barbie. There is an ongoing joke about Ken not being gay, despite his remarkable adherence to all gay stereotypes. Buzz provides more comic relief as he is captured by Lots-'O and mistakenly switched to Spanish audio. It's the same kind of cheap humor that the talking dog brings to Up, only with added unnecessary homophobia and cultural stereotyping. It's almost as if Pixar doesn't think its films are ""kiddy"" enough and adds stylistic elements to dumb them down a bit. The added laughter is even more prevalent in this film than in the previous two. I may have to give a negative review to a Pixar production if this continues.<br/><br/>The film excels as its predecessors did. It's a very emotional work. Woody arrives at Sunnyside and helps the toys escape, but they are forced into a trash can by Lots-'O. They escape destruction and return home. Andy decides to donate them to his young neighbor and has one final playtime with them. Woody's gives a wistful look as Andy leaves. The shot is an ironic closure to everything the toys have done for three films now. They have been separated from their owner so many times, only to part willingly. As the toy soldier says ""the mission is over"". Will there be another Toy Story? We did not need another installment following the last one, but we got one. It's good, but its quality is more reflective of its placement within a larger body of work, than of its own merits.<br/><br/>Recommended"
"LazySod","7","1","3","26 July 2010"," A bit too grown-up for the kids
","When making sequels one always has to make the conscious choice to keep the story going on in the same time line as the film or not. In this case the decision was made to have the film and its characters age at the same speed as the real world - and that makes for some effects. Andy is now ready to go to University and has left his toys untouched for many years. Now that he's about to leave his parental home the question arises what to do with the toys. Will it be the safety of the attic, or the trash-can or some other fate? To me this film was tilted just a bit towards the audience of the first film and no longer really towards the kids in the audience. My own kid loved the film anyway - even though he had some questions about some of the things that happened and I found the film a little too gloomy. Life isn't perfect, but that doesn't have to be displayed so openly in a children's film IMO.<br/><br/>When it comes to animation this one does what it is supposed to do. It's great to watch all the characters and their surroundings move along and the color scheme is very pleasurable. The story runs OK, but as said before it's a bit too gloomy to my taste.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 snakes in boots"
"gavin-42","7","1","3","25 July 2010"," Wow, not nearly as good as the first two.
","OK, so I of course loved the first two films, loved Avatar in 3D, had seen the trailers (including in 3D during the World Cup which looked awesome), and had high hopes for this film. We saw it this morning in Real-D 3D.<br/><br/>First of all the 3D added very little to the presentation, so if you aren't specifically a fan of 3D then don't bother as you'll not be missing anything. I had to actually exert some effort to notice the 3D much of the time which was odd. It felt like there just wasn't enough information being presented by the 3D effect, even less so than other films including other animated ones.<br/><br/>But anyhow, what about the movie? Well 7/10 is all I can give it. Yes, it's a Pixar film, so you know it's going to be well produced. But quite a number of things really bugged me:<br/><br/>It's much, much darker than the original movies (both figuratively and literally). Over the top nightmarish at times. Very much like Harry Potter in comparison to the originals which were much more Loony Toons.<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailer you've seen many (most?) of the good lines and gags in the film. They picked out the cream for the trailer and if you've seen it then you've pretty much seen the movie. This was really annoying especially after having seen the trailers probably a dozen times over the last year.<br/><br/>Lots of expository, relatively less physical gags. I couldn't help feeling that the filmmakers were treating this as somewhat of a chore. They needed to wrap up the series and so this, and this, and this need to happen to get there so let's march the characters in that direction. Too much time was spent getting through all this rather than just coming up with a fun movie.<br/><br/>The first two movies are classics, and 10/10 in my opinion. This one is just OK, and not the light happy fun of the first ones."
"Cowzilla15","7","1","3","15 July 2010"," A tad bit overrated...
","I watched Toy Story 3 on the night it came out. I thought it was a really good movie. What I didn't expect is for it to take #6 in the Top 250 (as of 7-15-10). It really doesn't deserve that. I am also greatly disappointed that it even passed up Toy Story (1), it was not better than the first. The movie is just getting a hype from reviewers that quickly go towards that 10 star rating immediately because of the fact that it wasn't a bad movie.<br/><br/>On a lighter note, I thought it was a great movie. Great animation, dialogue, decent plot, it's just a decent movie overall. Shouldn't be in the Top 10 and absolutely shouldn't be in the Top 5.<br/><br/>I'm not bashing Pixar or the makers of Toy Story, I'm simply just mad that an average movie is taking out all the other movies on the Top 250 when they actually do deserve the position they had before."
"incu-ry9","9","1","3","7 July 2010"," A Film With A Big Heart and One Mistake That Makes It Imperfect
","I have been a fan of Toy Story ever since I watched the first one when I was 7 years old, so I have a long history with this franchise. Well, where do I start when discussing a movie with this much subtext and baggage attached to it? I'm hoping to go with an objective angle of analysis. <br/><br/>Plot: First of all, I would like to say that I loved the plot decided upon for this film--Andy leaving to college, thereby bringing about the day that was mentioned in Toy Story 2 where Woody would have to deal with Andy leaving for college. Also, the pure surprised involved in the plot and subplot was immensely satisfying and kept me wondering what would happen next. <br/><br/>Characters: The gang is back (minus Jim Varney, but he has a passable imitator) in addition to a bunch of new personalities who add new dimensions to the film. The character who steals the show has always been and will always be Woody, the cowboy character, Clint Eastwood, the man who always doubles back for a friend. Buzz Lightyear is again great, but the real vehicle for our perceptions is Woody, as we see him loyal to Andy to the end, but at the same time doubting his decision as he is played with for the first time in years. The amazing amount of perspectives cast in the characters of Woody, Buzz, Jesse, and Lotso are truly amazing. The villain (whom I wish would have been made into more of an antagonist) is Lotso, who ironically smells sweet like strawberries. Sadly, this is a character who has already been explored quite a bit in Toy Story 2 in the person of Stinky Pete, who was neglected and therefore finds it right to manipulate those around him. Also, for Miyuzaki lovers, there is a nice homage to ""My Neighbor Totoro"" in the film. <br/><br/>Theme: One reason I love the Toy Story films so much is because of the way that they address the theme of loyalty, abandonment, loss, and change without appearing one-sided or sentimental about it. The third film in the series is no different, where the meaning evoked by the film compels us to care about these people that we only know in real life as hunks of plastic (but also makes us feel horrible for anyone we ever abandoned or rejected). <br/><br/>The Mistake: I realize that in my title for this review, I named one mistake that was made in the film that kept it from being a 10-star movie for me. Though I'm pretty sure this movie is not going to be studied in film classes, I will now elaborate on that, because I believe it deserves some focus. **SPOILER** In the famous Incinerator Scene, Lotso is saved by the gang, and thus repays them by leaving them to their deaths. Then the toys all grasp hands, thus accepting their fate and are saved by ""The Claw,"" controlled by the Little Green Men. This is known, as I'm sure most people know, as a deus ex machina. I found this to be a terribly atrocious way to resolve the absolute major climactic point in the film--truly, after this moment, everything is falling action or denouement. So many things are wrong--or maybe a better way to put it would be to call it ""untrue""--in this scene, that it truly threw me out of the story for the first time in the whole movie. I will elaborate on why I found this so horrible because I believe this deserves an explanation. 1: The use of The Claw, while a familiar and maybe even laughter-inducing reference to the first movie, is such a manipulation of the internal logic of the plot that I felt cheated out of the profound moment afforded by both the saving and subsequent betrayal of Lotso and the toys' acceptance of their fates. 2: I felt very disappointed in the toys' ""acceptance"" of their fates, for some reason and my disappointment was confirmed and exacerbated by their reward of being saved from the incinerator because of their lack of struggle. Of course, their rescue was not predicated upon their placidity, but the way in which the chronology of the plot unfolds shows the toys being rewarded for their compliance and acceptance of their fate with being rescued by the ""god from the machine"". To me, this sends a very negative message to young people and old watching this film. Maybe it is just me, but I felt that a much better ending would have had to do with Lotso, which leads me to point 3. 3: I believe that the director missed a very great opportunity to do something with the character of Lotso that could have possibly moved Lotso from the black and white villain to the far more truthful grey of an antagonist. As opposed to the acceptance of fate/deus ex machina, I would have loved to have seen a conflict within Lotso once he reached the emergency stop, ending in his rescuing of the gang, because of a sense of duty to repay a kindness. Such a great moment for real character change and revelation was missed in favor of a more palatable ending. The most important thing to mention in this hypothetical scenario is that Lotso doesn't have to change into a nice toy suddenly--he could go on continuing his distrust of humans/chip on his shoulder and still have done at least one good thing. This one good thing would move our attitude toward him from one of being glad that he gets stuck to the front of the garbage truck to one of far more depth and complexity that is usually found in films like this. <br/><br/>Anyway, that is my review and hopefully someone found it helpful."
"anchoreddown","9","1","3","5 July 2010"," certainly worth a look!
","To me, it was pretty obvious after Toy Story 2 was released, their would be a third film in the making.<br/><br/>It is hard to describe exactly what one feels after walking out of a movie like this. For most people, the Pixar animation was something brand new back in 1995 when the original was released, leaving the audience wanting to see every little detail.<br/><br/>The third Toy Story does a few things that are new to the world according to Buzz Lightyear and Woody. They get brushed off to the local daycare center. The audience is nearly horrified seeing there's a dictatorship being run by a teddy bear, but before you know it, you are reminded by the jokes flying around left from right that in this kind of a movie, anything goes.<br/><br/>This really is nothing short of a Toy Story picture. Everything you'd expect, with a few twists. Not only that, but if you're an adult watching this, you somehow grasp and remember what it was like to become a young adult and learning to give up those old toys you remembered as a kid."
"Robert_duder","9","1","3","4 July 2010"," An absolutely brilliant entry proving this is the most brilliant animated series of all time
","If there is any proof that sequels even third entries can be as brilliant as their originals...Toy Story proves it. Fifteen years later not only do they bring back the characters we know and love but make us love them even more and bring literally the best completion to a trilogy of all time...(Sorry Return of The King fans.) I love sequels personally even when they are bad but I think if they truly end the Toy Story series here they couldn't have done it more brilliantly. This is probably the best movie you'll see in 2010 so far and easily the best movie of the summer. Toy Story has absolutely everything that made the first film so amazing and best of all we see a young boy grow up like so many of us have since the original film and say goodbye to our friends...the toys. Despite a beautiful, moving, emotional, happy ending there is that feeling of sadness and reminiscing of days gone by. The fact that a 'cartoon' can bring all this out proves its brilliance but Toy Story 3, and the Toy Story series has never been a 'cartoon' but rather THEE animation epic that sets the bar for every other animated film in existence.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return to their incredible iconic roles in the biggest of ways. Best of all Tim Allen gets some of the most solidly funny, roll in the aisles moments as Buzz is set back to his 'demo' mode and switched to Spanish speaking which will have everyone in tears laughing. Both men should get SOME sort of award for 15 years of two of the best characters in film history. Their chemistry is stepped up from the second film and the two buddies are back in full force. Joan Cusack (used sparingly and much less annoyingly as Toy Story 2) is great as Jessie, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Estelle Harris, John Morris, Jodi Benson (hilarious!), and Laurie Metcalf all return to their roles and are as brilliant as ever. Imagine one of the best casts of all time coming back together after fifteen years and picking up where they left off. There is some real important newcomers to mention. First of all Slinky Dog takes a bit of a back seat role with the death of his voice Jim Varney and comedian Blake Clark takes over and does a solid job but somehow the character doesn't have the same feel to him. Michael Keaton is mind blowing as Ken (yes of Barbie and Ken.) He is absolutely hilarious and the character is just perfectly written and created. Teddy Newton voices the great character of the 'chatter telephone' (who didn't have one of these!!) Another amazing addition to the cast but without voice is 'Big Baby' who almost brought tears of sadness to my eyes when she/he gurgles 'Mama.' Finally...lets talk about the character that became one of my favorite characters of all time. Ned Beatty (best known to me as the bumbling sidekick of Lex Luthor in Superman films from the eighties) voices Lotso. A teddy Ruxpin like character who has become inherently evil after being abandoned by his owner. Lotso is absolutely villainous and Beatty is amazing behind the voice. He is the best villain of any cartoon I have ever seen and perhaps one of the best in film in general. If the hundred other reasons aren't enough to see this the character of Lotso makes this a must see.<br/><br/>I mentioned when reviewing the first film that the intensity of certain scenes make the film almost too much for really young kids and a terrific nail biter for everyone and Toy Story 3 takes that to a whole new level. These toys are cast aside and go from a Nursery school like concentration camp, to a garbage dump, to being seconds from being incinerated. Then you have the terrifying trio of Lotsa, and his bumbling buffoons Big Baby, and Ken who literally torture and lock up the toys. Regardless the message behind the film will likely leave most with their heart strings pulled. Toy Story 3 has the happiest and the saddest ending of any film out there. Obviously if you haven't seen the Toy Story series then don't see Toy Story 3 because although it would still be great, the film becomes truly brilliant when you already know and love these characters. Advertised largely in 3D (like every other movie it seems) but the 3D won't make or break this film. The movie stands clearly on its own merits as being absolutely amazing. 9.5/10"

","This is really embarrassing. I can't believe that a cartoon movie will make me cry. I think there are only 2 movies that made me cry and that is Marley and Field of Dreams. I was neglecting the review from my friends when they said that the movie will pull-out the kid in you. It was a mix of action, comedy, suspense and drama. The last part was really moving. I can compare that to the short speech of Paris Jackson at her dad's memorial. I think those affected are the ones who saw the prequels. The attachment of Andy to his toys from the previous titles and letting go in Part 3 is the focal point of the movie. I will give this movie a perfect 10."
"Laserwolf65","Null","1","3","30 June 2010"," Good, but disappointing
","In 1995, Toy Story was released, and my 7-year-old self loved every minute of it. Four years later, Toy Story 2 came out and, while not quite as good as the first, it was still an excellent film. The characters and plots of these films are, and will always be, near and dear to my heart. I, like everyone from my generation, couldn't have been more excited to see Buzz, Woody, and the gang for one last romp; the results of this 11-year wait for a sequel are commendable, but underwhelming.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a mind-blowingly fun action sequence taking place in Andy's imagination. We are then treated to a short montage relating the story of Andy and his toys as he steadily grows older. Both sequences are very satisfying.<br/><br/>As the movie continues, we meet up with Andy at age 17. He's ready to go to college and has to decide what to do with his old toys. Although he wants to put them in the attic, they accidentally almost get thrown out, but eventually they wind up at a daycare center. Everything seems great--what with a plentiful supply of children--but things are not what they seem. It turns out that the paradise is more of a prison, and thus the gang must escape and return home before it's too late.<br/><br/>Here is where the movie sags and seems to go on autopilot. Though I won't spoil anything important, I will say that this is the third movie in row where woody is separated from the gang, the third movie where there's a rescue involved, and the third movie where we see buzz in ""space ranger"" mode. There are a few good gags throughout all this (I laughed really hard a couple times) but it's pretty mediocre over all.<br/><br/>All of that changes in the last half hour though. To mention anything would spoil it, but suffice it to say that there's a harrowing sequence in a dump that's just heart wrenching. The ending moments are pitch-perfect as well, giving us the absolute best possible send off for the franchise. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried twice in this last 30-minute stretch.<br/><br/>It's a shame that a good half of the film is so average when the rest is absolutely superb. All in all, Toy Story 3 is a good, but disappointing and uneven movie. I was glad to see it, but whereas I usually can't wait for a Pixar DVD release, I probably wont pick this one up when it first comes out, rather I'll wait until the price drops.<br/><br/>3.5 stars out of 5"

","***1/2 out of (****)<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" may not be the epic masterpiece that everyone had been anticipated, but it's a great film nonetheless. It sure may be flawed, but it definitely has an undeniable charm and a lot going for it. First of all, I thought that the performances were phenomenal, as expected. Second of all, I thought this film had the best premise. The last twenty minutes are pretty blatant that this isn't a typical children's movie. Moreover, I thought that the film went by very smoothly, so the film was nicely paced. There weren't any scenes that lagged or dragged out. The movie, in my opinion, was about the perfect length. And for anyone wondering, I thought the 3-D was pretty good and not shabby in any way.<br/><br/>Now onto the flaws. I thought this ""Toy Story"" was my least favorite because of the script. There's still the charm and spunk, but the wit is missing. This latest, and possibly last, installment of the trilogy resorts to occasional slapstick violence and some typical one-liners you'd hear in a children's movie. Also, I thought the beginning was a little slow, but the movie did pick up near the end.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Toy Story 3"" isn't on par with its predecessors, but it's very close. It sports amazing performances, a great premise, and a good pace. On a side note, the 3-D was pretty good. I really don't see any reason how anyone wouldn't like it. I mean, there's so much going for it. Despite not giving a perfect score, I'd actually like to see it a second time. ""Toy Story 3"" may not be Pixar's best, but it definitely sticks to you. ""Toy Story 3"" is great entertainment that'll tug on your heart strings, send tears rolling down your eye, and have your knees hurting from belly laughs. Overall, it comes recommended."
"jtw9471","4","2","10","18 April 2012"," Classic comedy? Me can't brain.
","In Asian we love anitmater films, yes. I love to see giant panda do fat fighting things, there are many laughs. Toy story was good too. It was original and that is something we don't see very often, especially here where we copy everything you build and sell it back to you but breaks in 2 weeks. Ha ha. Toy story very clever and now computers do animater, whatever next? Robots take over the world now, humans are their slaves. So was amazing, looked great. Toy story 2 was exactly the same as first. Little bit different, now Woody was a girl. Woody is American slang for thing that should not be talked of to children. Why is it talked of to children in film for them? Is a bit wrong, I think. Ignoring disgusting innuendo, film was interest. Not very but kids like it and I like them to shut up. Everyone wins. Now third it out. Oh good, more toys to buy exactly like ones from last two films but now with new expensive features. Someone put jokes in and a bit of a story. Not much, just little bit. Is good for kids film. Kids like but as boy in movie, they get too old for this now. They don't want toys, they want girlfriend to sleep over. Woody is bad influence. So film OK for younger people. Still very nice. But this film in top 20 of all time best comedy. Is listed with classic movies but is just hour and half advert for things I don't want to have to buy for kids. No. Is good enough and score well for kids film. Better than Asian kids film where everyone dies. But compare to proper comedy... score is bad. Is not classic comedy. Think some people don't understand cinema. Is fine for people with bad education but if you have computer you be lucky enough to think well and should be clever than this. Film has no point. Message of this film is please buy more stuff. Not good for children really and what kind of adults watch? Left cinema thinking i was glad I saw different film and bought pirate DVD of this at station entrance from old woman with no teeth. Sadly disappointed with state of people who think this classic comedy. would score 7 for kids but would not buy more woody dolls even from market. Score only 4 as classic comedy."

","Toy Story 3 retains the feel of the first two movies. It does remind you what it was like to be a child, and the tone of the movie is spot-on, certainly worthy of holding its place in the series. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but I must say that I didn't find it to be as fantastic as the first two.<br/><br/>In terms of effects, sound, voice-work, the movie is spot on. The only thing somewhat lacking is the script. While it may not be terrible, it seems to just be average. There isn't anything in this film that wasn't in one of the first two, aside from the theme of maturity Andy goes through, which was rather well done. The moments that were meant to be funny were amusing, but not as hilarious as hoped.<br/><br/>I like short reviews that summarize the quality of the movie without spoiling it, so I'll say no more. Overall, yes, the film is very enjoyable, but it does not live up to the immortality of the first two films."
"SquigglyCrunch","5","1","4","22 March 2017"," Plot Hole: The Movie starring Toy Story 2's Plot
","Toy Story 3 follows Andy's toys as he moves to college and attempts to donate them, whereupon they decide to escape from the day care in which they were sent to. <br/><br/>Similar to the last two movies, the voice acting is great. Every actor has hit just the right amount of expression and tone for each line in each scenario. It's clear that these guys are competent and know exactly what they're doing at this point. <br/><br/>In addition, the music continues to be good. It's a well-suited soundtrack for the series, and that trend doesn't stop here. <br/><br/>However, this movie is littered with plot holes. Most of the movie is consumed by the toys' attempt to escape the day care. Their plan is intricate and well-thought out, yet so little of it makes sense. So much of it is reliant on certain items being in certain areas when, in reality those items are fairly unlikely to be there. And the characters would've had zero opportunity to actually seek out these items due to their situation in the day care. I found myself sighing and cringing far too often as their plan was carried out, and it just proved unenjoyable to say the least. <br/><br/>Furthermore, I don't see how people can love this movie more than Toy Story 2, because both movies are practically identical. If you don't see it, let me break a couple things down for you. Both are about the toys trying to escape from their current predicament to return to Andy, both movies feature a large, lovable character with a cane who is later proved to be less than what he was originally thought to be, both feature sob stories (complete with flashbacks) for new characters, both involve a scene near the end where the characters are on a conveyor belt of some kind. Connecting the dots yet? Yeah, they're the same movie, just with different looking characters. And there's even more similarities than that if you watch the movie, which I won't spoil for you if you haven't seen it. <br/><br/>Overall Toy Story 3 is nonsensical, often rushed, and completely recycled material. I really don't understand how it got as much acclaim as it did, but that's beyond my control I suppose. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie."

This is a trilogy that grew up with its viewers. The first one came out when we were blown away with cgi, the second came when we wanted more emotion with our animation, and this one came when we were all grown up. With that said Toy Story 3 is pretty much just good old fashioned corn, with a lot of heart.<br/><br/>6/10"

He definitely was developed well and made me actually be scared and fear him too along with the other toys.<br/><br/>I think this was an adequate and proper conclusion to the Toy Story series. A tale about growing up and passing things down to the new generation. It was a bittersweet end which was proper as it would have been not believable at all if the toys stayed with the kid.

","Pixars last three films have been genius on every level, and they hope to continue this winning streak with toy story 3 and it just doesn't deliver. I was a big fan of the first two movies especially the second one for their heart and humor. This film relies too much on nostalgia and sentiment and not enough on actual substance. There are a few occasional laughs here and there but sometimes the humor is just horrible (lincoln logs). The generic prison beak segment isn't exactly too thrilling and the stuff in between is just boring and unsatisfactory. Its such a shame that the middle and beginning were so poor when the movie had such a great climax that was actually intense and heart-breaking...and then back to the sappy garbage.

","If there is one animation studio we can always rely on and so far, has not let us down, it is the Pixar Disney Studios. Their movies are always played for laughter mixed with substance, sometimes we'll shed a sentimental tear or two, and while their movies rake in the money, this studio has more consideration for its audience. I'm saying this against the recent trend of Dreamworks movies where it looks for pop culture references out of nowhere and star power, and while they look for bucks, they are more in for themselves. Right now, I'm hearing that Dreamworks has run into financial trouble. Pixar has not.<br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" is the latest of the ""Toy Story"" trilogy and Pixar flicks, and it never disappoints. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are back on hand as Cowboy Woody and E. Buzz Lightyear, and apparently, these actors work so well they enjoy working together. The other reliable cast members are Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Pixar Good Luck Charm John Ratzenberger as Hamm the Piggybank, Joan Cusack as Jessie the Cowgirl, and Laurie Metcalf as Andy's mother. New faces include Ned Beatty as the evil pink teddy bear Lotso, Michael Keaton as the dashing Ken doll, and Jodi Benson (Who more than twenty years ago, did the voice of Ariel in ""The Little Mermaid. Time flies.) as Ken's girlfriend Barbie.<br/><br/>This story takes place many years later. Andy is grown up and is getting ready for college. He doesn't know what to do with the toys and thinks about putting them into the attic box. However, the toys end up in a trash bag, and his mother accidentally sends them to the Sunnyside Day Care Center, where other toys have been donated. All the toys feel that Andy is getting older and he doesn't need them anymore. Woody is still most attached to Andy and cannot separate from him. There the toys bond with Barbie and Ken, and at first they befriend the tricky organizer of the donated toys, Lotso, but soon realize that he is in just for self profit. Once again, as in the other ""Toy Story"" movies, the toys all encounter peril, here going from one garbage compactor to the next, but they always make it home to Andy.<br/><br/>This movie has the most adult themes - separation anxiety, scary toys (in the first movie, a rotten kid named Sid had very scary toys) that may frighten the most impressionable young children, and an ending that tugs at the heartstrings more so than in the other two movies. You wouldn't mind getting out a handkerchief for this one, but the rest of the movie is still funny and sometimes frightening, but not to give nightmares. I'm always looking forward to see the next Pixar movie, but at this point, I'm thinking twice before I throw out my precious money for another bombastic Dreamworks movie."
"brianford","7","1","4","5 July 2010"," Decent movie but 3D is awful
","First let me say the movie was quite good - though not on par with the first two. The story is very emotional with all of the hazards that the toys went through and while watching I actually wondered if they had not overdone it and if it were appropriate for my 6 and 2 year olds. The story is woven in such a way to have a very happy ending and that made up for a lot of my hesitation but not all (the very dark recycling facility scene brought up images for me of the limbless young Darth Vader burning on the shores of a river...another scene that gave me pause as kids would be watching). Again, overall a good movie but I would like to add some further technical criticism. For such a high budget movie, the 3D was not worth the money at the theater. The scenes that seemed to be done for the most impact looked simply like two planes...a closer plane with 2D characters on a screen doing a scene and another 2D background further off. I remember in an optics class creating a hologram that did actually recreate a wave front and one could actually walk around the image and it was stunning (albeit monochromatic)...are my standards too high? I don't think so with all of the hype around 3D cinema and TV and the disappointing understanding that Disney/Pixar are doing nothing other that 3D from now on. There goes a lot of emphasis on content and their previous standard of stunning visual content. But a good movie overall and I think that it really resonated with the kids and that was what was important to me anyway. And there really aren't any more new toys that I need to buy for the kids...thanks for that Disney."

","Toy Story 2 saw cowboy doll Woody (Tom Hanks) realize his kid owner Andy (John Morris) would grow up someday. In Toy Story 3 he has: he's 17, he's headed for college, and he put his toys away long ago. After years of neglect, nearly being crushed in a garbage truck is the last straw. Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Mr. Potatohead (Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (Blake Cark, replacing the late Jim Varney), and the rest of the family hop in a donation box headed for Sunnyside Day Care, a paradise on the outside and a death trap filled with rampaging, abusive toddlers on the inside.<br/><br/>Pixar Animation Studios has never made a bad movie and their eleventh feature doesn't break tradition. Simply decent films like Cars and A Bug's Life have been known to surface, though, and Toy Story 3 ranks among them. Screenwriter Michael Arndt has nothing new to say, simply stitching together story and themes ripped from the first two. The toys have to escape a hostile environment to return to Andy (as in the original), and they must grapple with their feelings of abandonment (as in the sequel). Neither concept was a big focus in the movies they came from, so all Arndt has done is elaborate on places we've been before. His script doesn't become inspired until halfway through, when it turns into a prison break picture. Halfway through is too long a wait.<br/><br/>But once Toy Story 3 gets going, it gets good. The action delivers genuine thrills, with an elaborate escape plan and a perilous encounter in a landfill. The humor, all too sparse in the beginning, creates gags like Buzz in Spanish mode and Potatohead as a tortilla. Whether this marketing dream come true is actually finished remains to be seen, but the heartfelt ending couldn't possibly be topped for emotion and meaning.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 leaves little doubt of its inferiority to its predecessors with an unoriginal story and a bad first half. Once the remaining scenes pick up, though, the movie becomes decent. That's a disappointment in the company of other Pixar works, but this one has moments of brilliance to show that decent isn't so bad after all."

","I don't care how much you hang onto the old Disney classics, but ""Toy Story"" is by far their best work. It's the one that started it all. Since it's release in 95', nothing but masterpieces have followed in the PIXAR wake. And unlike it's competition, they refuse to cash in on the sequel idea, and look forward to fresh new alternatives. However, the ""Toy Story"" franchise is the only exception....and it's sequel is far better than anything Dreamworks or Sony animation has ever created.<br/><br/>If you remember the moral tale that was involved with the second one, Woody made the choice to stay with his owner Andy, knowing that the day would eventually come where he would grow old and tired his favorite toys. In this movie, the toys are finally reaching that moment. Andy is leaving, so what are they left to do now? And in this moment of choice, the toys speak of their future actions as if they are going into retirement. Which is really funny, because they try to convince each other that the attic is not such a bad place......much like taking your grandparents to a retirement home. The movie is filled with the perfect doses of humor and emotion.......i mean, what else would you expect from a PIXAR film? Do they ever make anything below great? From start to finish, the movie really is an emotional ride. It's opening sequence immedietly grabs you. It's second act really tickles your funny bone by adding new and fun characters, especially with Ken and Barbie. But the ending is enough to make a grown man cry.....in which i could not help but shed a few tears. I mean come on, i grew up watching these movies, so seeing it come to a phenomenal climax was something i could not contain......and trust me, the ending is highly emotional. Im just glad that there was a bonus reel during the credits, so i had enough time to dry my eyes before entering the theatre lobby.<br/><br/>Bottom Line, laugh at me if you will, but in my mind, the three greatest trilogies thus far in film are ""Star Wars"", ""Lord of the Rings"", and ""Toy Story"".....if any director is attempting to make a third installment in their movie, they should certainly take notes from this film. Because it didn't draw out it sequences, and beg for your tears. It was just genuine and simple. Just like the first ""Toy Story"". And that is why PIXAR always knocks it out of the park. Because they don't make crappy sequels to cash in at the box office, much like ""Shrek"". They take their time and make sure that it's worthy of fitting in with it's predacesor. And in this case, it wraps around the other two like a warm blanket. PIXAR, thank you for giving me these movies, i will always hold them close to my heart. And thank you for giving it such a great finale."
"Covlat1","10","15","226","13 June 2010"," Very Disappointing
","I saw a special screening of this in Arizona last night. The first twenty minutes of the movie are very promising, and almost lives up to the original. However, then the film simply DRAGS and DRAGS. Its literally almost two hours long, which would be OK if it was a good movie, but it isn't. I loved the first two, but this is just BAD. The 3D effects were cheesy, awkward, and badly played, the animation isn't improved from the first two. The jokes were horrible. Even my seven year old nephew said it was unfunny. The plot was extremely predictable, without any twists.<br/><br/>Along with that, Tim Allen (Buzz) sounds fine. However, Tom Hanks (woody) sounds AWFUL. He sounds too old for the part. They should have gotten somebody younger.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't deserve to be called Toy Story. You would think 11 years would be enough to make a decent sequel, but this was just a joke.<br/><br/>This gets a very generous 2/10 from me. 0 stars for the movie, 3 for the name Toy Story, -1 For the Failed hopes and dreams."
"jose-cruz53","6","1","5","5 October 2012"," Good, but nothing really special
","I have noticed that Pixar's films have amassed legions of fans, even though they are supremely mediocre. Maybe that's why they are so popular: mass appeal means mediocrity. The best stuff is generally not the stuff that appeals to everyone, to appeal to everyone is to make something that everyone enjoys and understands, but given that people are different, it means that you must make something that doesn't impress an individual as much as it could, as to impress the greatest number of people.<br/><br/>Take this film for instance, it is a decent film, it entertains, but it is not a masterpiece by any means and is full of flaws: This film is filled with clichés and forced emotions (melodrama). These flaws are typical of Hollywood blockbusters and they reinforce the mediocrity of the film. Though, the film manages to execute these clichés well enough to be a good film, but expect nothing special."
"seaview1","9","1","5","5 July 2010"," TOY STORY 3 Is a Winning Number
","Completing one of the greatest trilogies in movie history (joining Star Wars and Lord of the Rings), Toy Story 3 is everything one could wish for and more. These familiar toys that come alive with feelings and interplay became the cornerstone of Pixar Studios and a string of superlative animated gems. Disney should be thanking its lucky stars.<br/><br/>Picking up from the previous films, Andy has played with his beloved toys for years and explored imaginative adventures and thrills that are the stuff of a rich, wondrous childhood. The old gang is back with Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), and the others. As Andy approaches college age, it is a time of change, and the toys lament at not being played with anymore. They are destined for the attic or the trash dump or maybe a chance to entertain kids at a day school. Lest you think the field of toys gets too crowded (Little Bo Peep and Etch a Sketch have moved on), there are some nice additions (Barbie doll gets to romance Ken), and some not so nice ones.<br/><br/>Sunnyside Daycare seems to be an ideal situation with children who want toys, and toys needing to be needed (a kind of schoolyard version of 'The Island of Misfit Toys'); it appears to be a match made in heaven. There's even a connection between Andy and a daycare staffer whose daughter, Bonnie, is beginning to play with her first toys. But a mysterious leader emerges in the form of a stuffed bear, Lotso (a charming Ned Beatty), who has a rigid pecking order or hierarchy for the toys, and that leaves our newcomers at the mercy of the youngest, most violent kids who abuse them.<br/><br/>As Woody finds a temporary home with Bonnie and tries to make it back to his friends, Buzz attempts to find out the truth of the daycare and is captured. From there, the film becomes an escape story as the toys struggle to flee their daycare prison. Last minute rescues are trumped by surprises and betrayal, and salvation can come from the most surprising source. Will Woody and Buzz save the day, and what will become of their toy brethren? Will the toys find happiness somewhere perhaps? <br/><br/>What has never failed is that the filmmakers treat their audience with intelligence and respect. It also does not depend on one seeing the past films, but it does help in order to appreciate certain references. The Pixar team led by director Lee Unkrich and screenwriter Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine) should be commended for never losing sight of the story. The cast of voices including Joan Cusack, Don Rickles (priceless as Mr. Potato Head), Estelle Harris, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger (who has voiced in every Pixar film), and newcomer Michael Keaton (as Ken) are terrific. They do a better job of acting and emoting than many a live actor.<br/><br/>The film's first hour or so is good but not great. It is in the final scenes that the themes of loyalty and sacrifice take on a deeper meaning, and the film blossoms with pathos. The notion of abandonment and wanting to belong resonate universally. As the toys learn that they can make other children happy and feel a purpose again, Andy also learns a lesson in life: passing the torch from one child's happiness to another. It's about growing up and letting go while finding closure amidst a time of uncertainty and change. Imagine that-a kid's film that is affecting to adults! <br/><br/>If this is the end of the precious series (with record box office grosses, I find that hard to believe), it has ended on a very high note. Do stay for the end credits as you learn a bit more about the fate of our beloved toys. As much as I would hate to see these animated friends go, I should remember that these jewels are to be shared and cherished by future generations. How's that for life imitating art?"

","Alright! I can feel the controversy beginning! <br/><br/>But this was easily Pixar's worst movie. And the only one that I managed to properly dislike. <br/><br/>Of course, being Pixar, it can't be all bad, and the plot, and the visuals, were pretty good. The plot in particular was great, except for one thing. <br/><br/>This is not a kid's movie. How is it rated G? How? Why?<br/><br/>The reason I hate it, and why it shouldn't be rated G, comes from one fatal flaw in the plot. <br/><br/>It was terrifying! This might as well be a freaking horror movie! I saw this when it came out, when I was about six. And it traumatized me! It freaking traumatized me to the point where I still sometimes have nightmares about Big Baby and Lotso Huggin Bear killing me in my sleep! <br/><br/>Not kidding. It's just terrifying. it might as well be Child's Play. Before watching this, I had no problem with dolls or anything. Now, I can't look at a baby doll without being terrified, all thanks to this movie. <br/><br/>I can't even fathom how scary this was for me. I think that maybe now as a teenager I might have enjoyed it, but seeing it at the age of six has forever tainted my opinion of the toy story movies and toys. Would not recommend to anybody but horror fans. That's how scary this is. <br/><br/>It's a straight up horror flick. That's all I can say about it. Don't show it to your kids."

","With their human going off to a noticeably generically-referred to ""college"", the now-idle toys mistakenly get shipped to a ""Cool Hand Luke"" prison-camp like daycare center. Hilarity generally does not ensue. A Big Wheel-sized amount of suspension-of-disbelief is needed to accept that somehow the Ned Beatty-voiced strawberry-scented Care Bear runs the prison, er, daycare, such that Woody & Co. are trapped in the toddlers room where they are tortured, er, played with. Since it was hard to accept the idea that the human day care mavens somehow couldn't simply put the toys into whatever room they wanted, I spent the time in the theater's darkness trying to develop a theory that the film was a veiled protest against secret CIA black-ops prisons. Given that the Patriot Act is still in effect, I will refrain from relating my ruminations on the subject. Anyway, the film has an intriguing voice cast such that it is populated deep into the character list with former actors who could open a film in their time. Also Don Rickles is in it. The script is passable with a reasonable amount of pathos for the younger target demographic but it lacks the winking adult-targeted asides such as those found in ""Monsters, Inc."" There is an attempt at this with the Ken doll trying to defend against charges of being a girl's toy but it never goes anywhere. This being Pixar, the animation is technically top-notch, however, since the toys-coming-to-life thrill is now some 15 years old, Disney must rely on the audience being too young to have encountered the conceit before. In short, this one goes into the over-rated Pixar films bin next to ""Finding Nemo"", and ""Ratatouille"" rather than into the Pixar classics bin which includes in this order: ""Wall-E"", ""Monsters, Inc"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Cars"" and ""Up""."
"Terastas","5","1","8","19 March 2012"," The obvious conclusion.
","Lets get one thing straight: Toy Story 3 is not a bad movie. It follows the exact same formula as the previous two installments, and does succeed in bringing the series to its logical conclusion. The writing, voice acting and animation are no different from their predecessors -- that does not warrant discussion.<br/><br/>The problem is that, as I said, it follows the logical conclusion. Chances are that, when you heard there was going to be a Toy Story 3, you or someone you know must have said ""Well the only way they could conclude it in a good way would be (yadda yadda yadda)."" And chances are that whatever was speculated is exactly what happens in the movie.<br/><br/>In other words, its way too predictable. Even little kids will continually find themselves thinking ""Yup. Saw that one coming."" This is a spoiler-free review because I don't need to write spoilers; you'll know exactly what's going to happen with which characters as soon as they are introduced.<br/><br/>This is ultimately what kills it. Five minutes in, you'll know how it's going to end. Save your money and just try to think for yourself how this movie must have gone; 99/100 of you will be spot on."
"sulinc","Null","1","9","30 October 2017"," Overrated (hear me out on this one)!!!
","I first saw this in theaters in 2010, and I gave it a four out of ten. However, I decided to watch it again 7 years later, and I am lowering my rating to a 3. It still is a decent movie, but as a Pixar movie, I expect a higher standard with films. It brought nothing new to the table, like the first two did. Toy Story was the first computer animated movie, and Toy Story 2 proved that animated sequels could be great, unlike previous straight to DVD Disney sequels. (Mulan 2). As for the third entry, it was just a bunch of nostalgia thrown over a bunch of references thrown over a bunch of conveniences. I mean come on, Woody just happened to find a kite on the roof of Sunnyside. There are many other ""well that was lucky"" moments in the movie. I do NOT think that this deserves to be in the top 250 movies, as it brings NOTHING that is new and interesting to the film industry, other than the first animated movie to gross $1,000,000,000. I really can't get emotionally moved, let alone attached to any of these characters. It's very similar to Toy Story 2 with it's villain's motivations and appearance. In short, this movie is bad and disappointing. Just because it's nostalgic and filled with references doesn't mean it's a good movie. The inferno scene is emotionless and quickly glossed over. Like this film if you can, I just can't. Final Review: Bad, disappointing, letdown."

","Of all the Toy Story movies, I think this is my favorite.

There are moments, no matter how many times I watch this, that make my eyes well up and really tug on the heartstrings. I have a stronger reaction to this than any of the others, hands down.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the story here is powerful. A story of growing up and changing, about leaving behind the things of our youth and entering adulthood. About moving on when the things we idolize leave us behind.<br/><br/>It's also hilarious, has a wonderful villain and just strikes it completely out of the park.

","The first two Toy Story movies were pretty good (even if I thought them boring as a kid - but that's because I had a very low bar for boredom at the time). But the 3rd one is even better! It's also darker and more dystopian, but that's part of what I like.<br/><br/>The movie is set a number of years after the first two. Andy is a teenager, about to go to college. He hasn't played with his toys in years - and they're depressed. Andy packs away all his toys to be put in the attic (apart from Woody, whom he intends to take to college). However, the bag he puts them in just happens to be a trash bag - which he puts down for a few minutes to help his sister. Their mother comes along, assumes it's trash, and puts it on the curb - just as the rubbish truck is approaching!<br/><br/>Well, the toys get out (just!), but are convinced that Andy deliberately threw them out. They stow away in the Mum's car with the toys she's donating to Sunnyside Daycare. Woody tries to talk them out of it - unsuccessfully. And since he doesn't get out of the boot in time, he winds up going to Sunnyside as well.<br/><br/>(When they arrive there, there's a crude political joke in which Rex says it must be nice because there's a rainbow on the door. Thankfully, this is too subtle for most kids.)<br/><br/>Well, everything seems nice and rosy, and it's run (well, when the humans aren't around) by Lots-O-Huggin' Bear (Lotso), who seems quite nice. Most of them stay, although Woody tries to leave (and winds up getting picked up by a little girl named Bonnie). The other toys quickly discover that life in Sunnyside isn't what it initially seems.<br/><br/>The movie is brilliantly plotted, with great animation and the usual great cast. Again, it's darker than the others, and dystopian. But if you're not too bothered by that (my mother doesn't like darker films - but she likes this one), you'll thoroughly enjoy it. It's the best movie in the trilogy (or quadrilogy, as it's soon to be)."

","I am positively surprised in every way possible! Toy Story 3 is a spectacle of a movie to a spectacle of a franchise which has captured the hearts of millions of kids and adults from all over the world.<br/><br/>In its (at the time of release) 15 year life span, Toy Story has done what most franchises fail at: <br/><br/>1. expanding its universe without getting repetetive or far-fetched.
2. Improving the animation
3. Showing an evolution in its characters (growing up, you can call it)
4. Adding new characters with depth and a purpose in the story. <br/><br/>TS3 deals with yet another issue of being a kid which is inevitable, growing up! Andy is now going to college and must decide what to put his toys in the attic or throw them. They're accidentally thrown out and ends up in a daycare. From there they must find their way back. <br/><br/>That's a great set-up, and TS3 is easily the most emotional and dramatic of all three movies. I admire how they managed to cram so much stuff into the movie without making it feel like filler. Seriously, there are plenty of good laughs in it. <br/><br/>But it will not only have you laughing a lot, because what makes TS3 the most special is how dark it is! Perhaps that is not suitable for the youngest viewers, 'cause believe me there are some disturbing images and charaters among the lot. <br/><br/>To avoid spoiling anything I will sum it up shortly to finish. <br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is an amazing if a little dark addition to the franchise which leaves no stone unturned and no eyes dry when it comes to an end."

However as Andy's mom is delivering some stuff to donate to one of the city's local daycare centers, the toys see other toys in the daycare like the butterfly room being taken good care of. However a strawberry- scented grandfatherly and charismatic teddy bear named Lotso (voiced by Ned Betty) who seems like a nice guy to treat all toys as equals has assigned our toy heroes to be in the toddler room where they are abused and sticky as the toddlers are too young for the toys to be played with. Yet Lotso with his baby doll assistant are keeping our fellow toys minus Woody whom escaped luckily as prisoner. So now Woody has to rescue his fellow comrades and try to get back to Andy's house before he leaves to college.<br/><br/>A fantastic third installment in the series that manages to be as excellent as the first 2 movies which were instant classics and so will this movie. There are many fantastic trilogies like Star Wars classic trilogy, Indiana Jones, Evil Dead, Fistful of Dollars, Back to the Future and more and this is one of them. After 11 years since 99 when i keep hearing in magazines/the internet about Toy Story 3 it felt like development hell but it finally got greenlighted and boy it felt like it was worth the long wait. <br/><br/>The script by Michael Arndt is surprisingly brilliant and full of humor/emotion and energy. Even the direction by Lee Unkrick is nice and the animation is just outstanding/spectacular and even better in 3D which i saw in theaters 4 times and it's an utterly fantastic, well written and impactful sequel.

Grant it, Pixar has amazing writers and very rarely make a bad product, but I don't see how you surpass this. This movie truly touches everyone who views it on an emotional level. The fact that they waited 10 years to make this, it feels as though you grew up with Andy if you watched these as a kid. Andy's toys were in a way your toys, and when he moved on it felt as though the audience had to move on with him. It is so poetic. We all grow-up and move onto to bigger and better things. The closure was incredible with this movie, and because the audience was put in Andy's shoes, this should be the last we see the toys, much like how it will be the last Andy sees of them. By the way this ends, they intended for this to be it for the Toys. I only see them ruining this franchise with a fourth (I could be wrong), but money talks."

Like all of Pixar's movies, the characters, comedy, and storytelling brim with more ingenuity, wit, and heart than nearly anything else on the market. They don't just make great children's films or great family films, they make great films, period. Like last year's Up, Toy Story 3 explores poignant themes of aging and mortality while wowing audiences with thrilling adventure and humor that puts competitors to shame. It is as charming as the first two films, with the advantage of ten years' advancement in computer animation and a screenplay that is truly touching. Highly recommended for the whole family (except the youngest of children; our heroes are put in grave peril, which may frighten or disturb them)."

"ElMaruecan82","8","0","1","25 September 2016"," Iconic Disney Toys Finally Confronted to the ""Circle of Life""...
","As the most anticipated animated film of 2010, ""Toy Story 3"" fulfilled everyone's expectations, crossing the billion mark, topping the box-office above notable champions like ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Harry Potter"" and ""Inception"", while the rest of the Top 10 was crowded with the other animated contenders as ""Shrek IV"", ""How to Train Your Dragon"", ""Despicable Me"" and ""Tangled"". ""Toy Story 3"" became the all-time most successful animated film before being dethroned by a freezing princess in 2013 and one of the few sequels and animated movies nominated for Best Picture. <br/><br/>But it doesn't take the highest IQ to figure out that the third opus of the 3D saga couldn't possibly fail. The ""Shrek"" franchise was getting out of breath, ""Tangled"" had a better story than marketing management but ""Toy Story 3"" had everything, the title, the characters and the sentimental value. After one decade, kids who've watched the first in the theaters were ready to be taken back to their childhood memories, and those who weren't even born in the 90's knew the movies from the DVD and merchandising so the film could count on a wide audience. That is to say, if I was the CEO of Pixar, I'm not sure I would have given a raise to the marketing manager for all that.<br/><br/>Now, to the story: in the first, we were discovering toys through their sacred relationship with their owners; the sequel carried more existential undertones: Woody took pride in being a valuable item because of his rarity, while Buzz realized he was only one article among thousands of others. But in the end, it came down to their value as Andy's toys. Still, the introduction of Jessie left one important point suspended, Jessie belonged to a girl who ignored then abandoned her when she grew up, and in a way, by ending up in Andy's room, they were only getting a suspended sentence. When ""Toy Story 3"" opens, Andy is a young man preparing to go to college and assigned the difficult task to get rid of his toys.<br/><br/>We saw that coming and the scenario is quite simple: donation, attic or trash? Only Woody is privileged enough to be packed with the college stuff, as Randy Newman would say ""he's got a friend in him"", but all the others (including Buzz Lightyear) are put in a garbage bag although Andy meant to take them to the attic. Unfortunately, the mother bumps into the bag before Andy comes back and she puts it near the trashcans. Woody manages to slip from the box and save his friends who are then taken to Sunnsyide, the daycare center. The toys are convinced that it was the right choice although Woody tries to convince them that Andy didn't want to abandon them. Anyway, the reception they receive in Sunnyside announces the sunniest future indeed.<br/><br/>Lotso, the Teddy-Bear chief Toy welcomes the newbies, with the demeanor and reassuring voice of an old patriarch, his crew includes a creepy baby doll walking like the Frankenstein Monster and Ken. Ken who? Well, Ken the Barbie-gay, I mean guy. I wish it didn't take me six years to finally see ""Toy Story 3"" because I knew already about Lotso being the villain, so I knew there was a catch behind his friendly tone and Vito Corleone father-like personality. I'm not sure I would have seen it coming in the theater, not even expected that Lotso would be the worst antagonist of the entire trilogy.<br/><br/>So, I kept waiting for the catch and it didn't take long to show, these plastic bastards put them right in the younger children section, and being the father of a three-year old girl, I know the evolution of behavior that goes from the age of two to three and seeing our beloved toys, being licked, hit, thrown on the wall by children was the closest thing to a torture a Disney film could get. It was sad enough to see them put in a garbage bag, but they had to go through this, and this wasn't over yet. Buzz is put in demo mode and recruited as a guard while they are imprisoned in the room and the whole center is managed like a concentration camp. The only way out is the dumpster.<br/><br/>""Toy Story"" was about friendship, the second, existence and the third, martyrdom. Even the antagonist had reasons to be angry and cynical, accidentally left by his owner's parents, he was shocked to see that she immediately replaced her. Something snapped. Of course, this issue was already tackled in the second film, and the likeliness of being thrown somewhere is supposed to upset us. But ""Toy Story 3"" goes as far as possible and I seriously don't use the word 'concentration camp' lightly, because the moment where all the beloved toys are about to be thrown in the fire, and for the first time, they were powerless, and all they did was to hold their hands and waiting for death to come, was like watching the Holocaust of Toys.<br/><br/>I must say that was perhaps the most intense climax I've ever seen in a Disney film, and I heard so many things about it being an upsetting tearjerker that I thought that would be the end, no kidding. Well, I'm glad they kept that ending but God. Andy realizes that the sentimental value of his toys depend on their current utilization as much as their past, kids in school can play with them, but there's ""playing "" and ""playing"". We get the nuance when Andy gives all the toys to the little girl who loves toys and perhaps that emotional hesitation before he finally gives Woody is the film's emotional highlight. <br/><br/>For the first time, there's a voluntary separation between the two partners, it's an end of era but also a new starÂ… indeed, the good old circle of life, also affects toys."

","Having absolutely loved the previous two films toy story three was definitely going to have to live up to expectations! And without a doubt it did! Such a tear-jerking film for something that's meant to be a kids film; however, brilliant none the less. It's certainly a perfect all round family film for any time of year. Definitely worth a watch!... if you haven't seen it already that is ;) The classic characters with a few new ones for a twist. A new place of action and more love than ever before. - is that even possible? But also comedic and playful. If toy story 3 can't teach our children today that love is for everybody and that hate is just a reflection of how that person is feeling towards themselves i don't know what can! Please make a number four!! please! haha."

","A true trilogy perfect no 9. Out of ten in the Sieris with. Is amazing for an animation in my opinion. This film by far has the best villain in the Sieris. It is emotional as usual in the Pixar universe and Barbie and ken have a lot in this movie then I think people would think. This film is also really funny maybe the most funny out of all film. It's one of the best film of 2010 and of all time like the other two films. This has one of my favourite short films as well but that is not part of the film though. The film is amazing the mom of Andy had a lot to do to this film. The villain lotso was great as the villain because he was the best villain of all of them not the best of Pixar though. Daughter had a lot to do in this film to of the film of the other family but I won't spoil the plot though check it out yourself if you want to know. the main plot it's great but I don't want to spoil because it's a great film not to spoil Overall this movie is amazing and definitely a masterpiece of work by Pixar."

","This film has three series. And this film, Toy Story 3, is a time when Andy enters university. Going university means almost being an adult. And being an adult means ending a childhood. We spent a lot of time with our toys, when we were children. But we forget the time spending with them, we became more and more adults. This film reminds us of such a precious time of our childhood. We can go back children by watching this movie. In addition a sad reality is described in this film. Toys owner is only one. But there are a lot of substitutes of toys for the owner. Some of toys experience this cruel reality. This is one of remarkable different characteristics from other series.<br/><br/>Also this movie describes good friendships of toys. They never give up on their friends and leave even if the situation is serious. They overcome difficulties together. And we are attracted this point."

","I watch this movie and I'm very impressed. Among Pixar's film, this is the best, I think. This movie is more dramatic and exciting than previous movie. Woody goes on many adventure to save his friends. It is very dangerous. But he doesn't forsake them. This time I think that the most different point to before series is that main characters run a risk. I was very excited and moved because they gets over such dangerous. In the last scene, I cried all the time. It is very good ending. If I get married in the future, I will watch it with my family. This movie not only makes us impressed but also tell the importance to take care of a toy. I cannot treat a toy violently. We should tell the importance to future son or daughter through this movie.

","When Toy Story 3 came out on cinema ,I was a teenager and I was thinking I was well over the kids films and cartoons( I though anything animated the fool) and when this movie came out ,I was put in charge to keep an eye to my younger sister and a friend of hers, when we went to the cinema. So I had the idea that I would be just job for the older Brother. Then I saw the movie and it was glorious! When I came out of theater ,I was thinking"" this isn't just a kids film ,it is a work of art which everyone can enjoy!""<br/><br/>The story continues the ark of the previous flicks. Now Andy is going to go to College and the Toys are anxious with that, for the purpose of a toy is to be played so what's their goal now? After wards, they are send mistakenly to a day-care center (the original goal was to go to the attic) ,where they think that all the problems are fixed, but things aren't always as they look like and its up to one of the best Cowboys of all of fiction, to bring his family back home. <br/><br/>Apart from its beautiful animation, relatable characters and solid story, the closing chapter of this trilogy deals with the deepest themes of them all, abandonment and what to do when your purpose (you can also say career) is done, for it is hard to continue when the base of your living ends! That theme is the most adult of the trilogy ,for everyone from senior students to hard working adults are afraid of they can't keep up with their job or even worst their area of expertise in now unnecessary (which means their skills are also needless). <br/><br/>For real when I gave my exams for go to university I was thinking just that message and when School is finally over what I should for in Greece it is a common say that when a person goes to university has a hard time keep up with the demanding program there. Likely I adapt quickly ,but it was hard and that movie gave me that lesson better than all of my school teacher!<br/><br/>Now I have already wrote the amazing facts about Toy Story 1 and 2 ,with 1 been the very first full-length movie with computer generated images and 2 to be at first planed to go direct to video! So, in my point of view, seems right to give a great fact about 3 also. Toy Story 3 is the first animated film to be A BILLION DOLLAR MOVIE! For real it grossed a total of 1,063,171,911 $ world wide. That number wasn't unheard of in twenty ten ,but it never happened with an animated film, to put it simple ,the massive success of Minions, Frozen, Zootopia (all of them grossed over 1 billion) ,wouldn't be possible if Toy Story 3 didn't create that opening.<br/><br/>In short this flick is a future classic and its legacy ,like with the rest of this amazing trilogy, I hope to be continued with the four installment, which will come out in 2018. Fingers crossed!"

","When I watched this movie for the first time, I cried because the ending is so moving. In Toy Story 3, we can see the conflict of Andy, though till now toys are in the center of this series. This time(in 3) I made to consider , what is toy? And this film reminds me of the past toys that I used to play with in my childhood. Some were abandoned, and some are still exist as toy. But abandoned toys still live in my heart, and it is the true meaning of toys. In this film, toys are passed to another child, so Andy takes part with them. But Andy must remember them somewhere in his heart, like me. And this means toys live along our life. When we become adult, almost all toys are abandoned, but it does not mean that we don not like them. It just means toy's place shifts to our heart from real existence. Moreover, the bad bear character has impressed me a lot, because the reason he becomes evil suggests the problem of modern society. It has much to consider for me."

","Toy Story 3 is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated comedy-drama film, and the third installment in the Toy Story series.[2] It was produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by Lee Unkrich, the screenplay was written by Michael Arndt, while Unkrich wrote the story along with John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton, respectively director and co-writer of the first two films. The plot focuses on the toys Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and their friends dealing with an uncertain future as their owner, Andy, prepares to leave for college. The film features an ensemble voice cast with Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Estelle Harris, Jodi Benson, and John Morris reprising their roles from the previous films, and Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Whoopi Goldberg, Blake Clark (replacing Jim Varney), Timothy Dalton, Kristen Schaal, Bonnie Hunt, and Jeff Garlin joining the returning cast."
"datautisticgamer-74853","9","0","1","27 May 2016"," Can it be? A third movie that happens to be the trilogy's best?
","That's right: I personally find Toy Story 3 to be my favorite movie in the Toy Story trilogy. The animation, as expected in 2010 compared to the 1990s, is better (though should that matter?), the characters are either already classic or feel classic upon being introduced to make them both seem recognizable and just met. The story isn't terribly original, as I noticed some elements recycled from Toy Story 2, but since this movie went in a different direction, the execution of it went differently and better in plenty of ways; there were less tedious moments and more emotion being doled out by the plot, including one of the best endings I have seen in an animated movie (up there with The Fox and The Hound). And yet, somehow, it's the one Toy Story film so far to not get 100% on Rotten Tomatoes (99%, thanks to Armond White and 3 other critics). After watching the original film as toddlers, plenty of more adult people in the audience will think back to that time and relate to it. While I have yet to do that, the emotional impact of it all is so strong that it was one of the movies that I cried while watching. You just might as well, especially if you are at a pivotal point in your life. But the real tearjerker is that this would be Pixar's final film before they fell into a Dark Age of their own (as Disney parasitized off them and made themselves a Second Renaissance)."

Toy Story 3 is hilarious, heart warming, creative, and a film that anyone will fall in love all over again with.

His mother wants him to either box his old toys up and put them in the attic or donate them to a nearby day care.

The young Andy grew up, stopped to play and decided to donate most of his toys for a daycare, retaining only those he liked most, such as the inseparable Woody and Buzz Lightyear. But something goes wrong and everyone ends up in a daycare where a mysterious pink bear seems to rule. Directed by Lee Unkrich, this movie kept the voice actors from the first two for the central characters of the plot.<br/><br/>Any connoisseur of good cinema knows that to make a good sequel it's necessary to establish a happy continuity with the previous films. Toy Story movies managed it easily and effectively by holding the cast core together: in fact, the major cast change in this film is the output of John Lasseter, standing on director's chair one of his co-directors in Toy Story 2, which shows us the importance of a stable team in the success of this franchise. Adolescence and the fate of toys when children's leave to play are important issues for the plot, despite having been addressed in the previous films. Some toys have, in their past, sad stories of abandonment related to that, a recurring situation in Toy Story's films, but which is of increased importance in this one, touching more particularly the most adult audiences, which makes this film the most adult of the franchise to date. Perhaps because of that, this movie was a huge success at the box office and critics resulting in several awards, among which are the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film, the BAFTA for the same category and, finally, the Oscar's for Best Animated Film and Best Original Song (""We Belong Together"").<br/><br/>This is an excellent outcome for one of the most successful franchise's of animated cinema.

"joshuafagan-64214","10","0","1","3 November 2015"," A Fulfilling Symphony of the Heart
","From the release of Toy Story 2 in 1999, Pixar went on an unprecedented creative streak. All of their films- Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, the Incredibles, and so on, became unprecedented critical and commercial successes. And they were all original films. In the face of the tide of franchises that conquered the first decade of the two thousands, it was a breath of fresh air and a pulse of creativity that rang throughout Hollywood and beyond. Wow, new and creative and well-done films could perform just as well if not better at the box office than massive, overblown, CGI-fests? Who knew? All of these films have and will form the fabric of many a kid's childhood. They are the kind of movies that last. Perhaps the movie scene of the 2000s did not deserve these films, but it certainly needed them. As soon as (main-branch) Disney animation went down, Pixar rose to claim the now-empty Western animation podium. For that and for much more, it has gained deserved respect.<br/><br/>But that run had to stop sometime. As much as we as members of the human race like to imagine that things go on forever, we all know that everything ends. Our lives. Our dreams. And Pixar's run.<br/><br/>Thankfully, it did not go out with a whimper, but with a sizzle. The first Pixar sequel in 11 years and the end of that run of near-perfection, Toy Story 3 holds a unique place in the Pixar canon. It is also their best film. As an animation buff, I am often disappointed that I don't like Pixar as much as I should. I guess it's too clean, too flawless. But whatever that issue, I do not have it with this film.<br/><br/>The Toy Story movies are some of my favorite Pixar movies. There is a reason that everyone who pans them gets torn to shreds. While I do not believe that 1 or 2 are as good technically or writing-wise as the Brad Bird films or even Finding Nemo (hence their exclusion from my top 100), they have that sense of energy and truth and knowing beyond knowing that I love to see from animated movies.<br/><br/>You can feel the impact of the passage of time. This may have been lost on the children who were ostensibly the audience of the movie, but it was certainly not lost on the high school seniors and college kids that probably made up as large a portion of the actual audience. I do not think that it is a coincidence that this film was released on what was, in many parts of the United States, graduation week.<br/><br/>The tone taken by this film is dark and existential. This is not an unexpected turn for the series; these themes- of being left behind, replaced, and made irrelevant- were present in the first one and were only ramped up in the second. But would be a little jarring if it was released in say, 2002. Real time needed to pass for this film to work as well as it did. Perhaps the best compliment I can pay to this movie is if all long-delayed sequels were as good as this, I wouldn't mind the long delay.<br/><br/>There is a scene in the first act of the film in which Woody (played excellently once more by Tom Hanks) calls all the toys out, the same way he did in the first him. It does not take him long to realize that it's not accident or mishap; most of the old group is gone. It is a short scene, but a memorable one. It sets the somber tone that pervades the rest of the movie. If I wasn't already completely invested, that moment made me so. And I wasn't let down.<br/><br/>This movie is, at its core, about letting go and moving on, no matter where the roads of the future may lead. It is not a story that has never been done before, not even one that has not been done in any animated movie. But it has never been done with this much gravitas. If you never cared about the world or the characters of Toy Story, you won't feel the draining, gripping, tear-jerking ambrosia that the rest of us do. But that is a small percentage of people.<br/><br/>Not much is talked about what has happened to the characters over the course of the last decade or so. But you can feel it; the animation and the acting performances give it to you wrapped in a bow. Everything feels so real, nothing is forced. A lot of that has to do with the fact that while the twenty-something in the audience have grown up with these characters, so have the people who made these movies, though in a different way. John Lasseter, the face of Pixar, was in his later thirties when the first Toy Story film came out. By this film's release, he was in his fifties. He had watched his kids grow up and learned more about himself.<br/><br/>Some people have said that the ending is a bit on the sappy side, and if this film was released in a vacuum, I'd partially agree. But it is not. At this point, Andy is a stand in for you the viewer. Instead of letting go of your toys, you are letting go of this franchise, and likely with it, your childhood. It is one of the moist poignant scenes ever filmed and it gets me every time. I hope TS4 will be good, but for me, this is the perfect end to the series.<br/><br/>(P.S. Look at the last shot before the credits roll. It is exactly the same as the first shot from the first movie, only that one panned down and this one pans up. It is subtle, but effective. I noticed it the first time off and it struck me like lightning.)"

"joshuadrake-91275","10","0","1","16 September 2015"," The best TOY STORY yet!
","TOY STORY 3 was released after eleven years of waiting for a third TOY STORY film and negotiations with Disney and Pixar and this is the best TOY STORY yet! The plot focuses on the toys, Woody, Buzz Lightyear and their friends dealing with an uncertain future as their owner, Andy, prepares to leave for college.<br/><br/>TOY STORY 3 is better than the second ""Toy Story"" film and I think the film is just as good as the first two. The comedy in this film is really funny and hilarious and the story of the film is amazingly well written by Oscar writer Michael Arndt. This film was the first animated Disney film to gross over a billion dollars, until FROZEN did this in 2013.<br/><br/>Lotso is the only problem I have. He is way too dark and serious for this kind of movie, but they wanted a darker villain for the Pixar movies and I think the story is amazingly well-done once again.<br/><br/>The end of the film with Andy giving the toys to Bonnie was told perfectly and the scene with the toys almost being incinerated at the dump was sad and emotional for me, the music was really sad and I did not laugh, I just felt sorry for the characters during that whole sequence.<br/><br/>The acting, like the first two TOY STORY films is just top-notch and the returning cast members are amazingly perfect in their performances.<br/><br/>The new cast members are Ned Beatty, who does the voice of Lotso and he does a good job in the part of a bear who smells like strawberries AND is really evil. Michael Keaton plays the voice of Ken, Barbie's love interest and he was the right choice to play the part and he was amazing.<br/><br/>This film actually appears on my ""Top 10 Best Disney Movies"" and it is the best of the TOY STORY franchise. The other new cast members are Whoopi Goldberg as Stretch, Timothy Dalton as Mister Pricklepants and the rest of the new cast is just amazing in their performances as well.<br/><br/>I think the only character that I feared about was Slinky Dog. This was the character that Pixar and other fans of TOY STORY feared about.<br/><br/>The character was originally voiced by Jim Varney, who was suffering from cancer during production of TOY STORY 2, and died a few months after it's release and he was replaced by Blake Clark and he does a really good job in the part.<br/><br/>The music by David Newman is once again incredible and I do love the musical score for this film and the song he wrote for the end of the film, ""We Belong Together"" and that was good to hear during the ending titles.<br/><br/>There have been talks about another TOY STORY and it is going to happen and will be released in 2017. I can't wait for that.<br/><br/>Overall, TOY STORY 3 is the best of the TOY STORY films and I can't wait to see another one in 2017 and it will be fantastic and amazing and it is definitely the best TOY STORY film ever made! This film is also an ABSOLUTE SMASH HIT - 10/10!"

","Pixar really knows a good story and how to tell it, so that both kids and grown ups get entertained and caught up in it. This is a film that is as good as the two previous ones and even though the toys are further away from home then they have ever been, it still feels very much as it did ten years ago :)<br/><br/>There are some great new things in this, especially Barbies new found friend Ken gets to show of a little and really is a fine new character. Actually they are all great new characters, some more trust worthy then others, but all with great voices and personalities.<br/><br/>This is as the other Toy Stories, very very good for both small and big, I and my kids really love all three movies, even though this is a bit sad."

I grew up watching Toy Story 1 and 2, so watching this one in my late teens added a dimension of greatness to it. Never before have I cried like that while watching a movie. If I put aside the nostalgia factor, I still think I would have considered Toy Story 3 my favorite animated movie. It is probably Pixar's funniest and saddest, and most thrilling film.<br/><br/>I think this movie can be enjoyed by people of (almost) all ages. Like always in Pixar movies, there are both jokes intended for kids and jokes intended for adults. However, most of the jokes that were popular with the children of the theater, were so great that I found them hilarious as well."

The people at Pixar are true artists, real masterminds of storytelling, plot line perfectionists and great at capturing heartbreaking moments. I've been mistaken all this time, this movie and the trilogy all together still a masterpiece, a funny thrilling emotional trip, that describes my boyhood better than Boyhood itself.<br/><br/>It is so ironic when you notice the resemblance between the mother/son scene in the two movies, and not only Toy Story did it first, it did better!"

The animation is flawless, colorful, and gives such a good feel to the movie. The story is well written(not a shocker there).In my opinion this is one of Pixar's hardest films for them to top and I don't know if they ever can, though they might, but it's going to be hard to do.

","Toy Story 3 (2010): Dir: Lee Unkrich / Voices: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Joan Cusack: Every bit as wonderful and joyous as the first two Toy Story films. What is truly remarkable is how simple the first Toy Story is as a landmark animation, and how both sequels manage to improve using deep impression themes. Andy is grown up and ready for college but his toys get misplaced on the way to the attic and are shipped off to Sunnyside Daycare. They are greeted with the pains of toddlers before being greeted by Lotso the stuffed bear. Directed by Lee Unkrich with glorious images throughout as well as a comical yet suspenseful screenplay. There is many references to prison movies that are amusing. Tom Hanks again voices Woody the cowboy who breaks out of Sunnyside to go to college with Andy but soon realizes that his friends are in dire need of help. Tim Allen again voices Buzz Lightyear who ends up a prisoner in Sunnyside and whose batteries are switched around to a comical effect. Ned Beatty is the perfect voice of Lotso with his own backstory on how he came to land in Sunnyside. Michael Keaton voices Ken who gushes over Barbie. This is hilarious especially when trust is violated and Barbie decides to take matters into her own hands. Joan Cusack is great voicing Jessie who discovers that Buzz has language buttons that bring about different personas. There is a strong theme regarding friendship and how life's difficulties are easier faced when not alone. Pixar once again creates a winner and for a second sequel, that is an amazing accomplishment. Score: 9 / 10"

","This is definitely the best of the three 'Toy Stories' I enjoyed this movie very much, it was very professionally made, the animation, the soundtrack, the screenplay, everything was top notch.<br/><br/>The characters are the same (with the addition of new ones which imparts a 'freshness' to the motion picture) and are more likable than ever. The story this time is much more involving, which is what separates it from the two previous movies of the series. This is story is much more interesting, emotionally involving, while the dialogs are punctuated with frequent witty one-liners. The video and audio are both also as good as you can expect them to be. Well done! Highly recommended for all ages."
"bestbarman","10","0","2","17 May 2015"," Brilliant.
","When I first watched Toy Story I thought it was brilliant, so much so I felt any sequel to it will fall on flat ears because of the genuine brilliance of this film. I mean who could top Toy Story? Luckily the animators at Pixar knew better.<br/><br/>The second Toy Story was equally brilliant and again I thought how can we top this? Then they created Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>I loved how the three films had a beautiful rolling continuity, seeing Andy age through the films was great. I also loved how they used the same voice for Andy, It added a sense of real believability to his character. <br/><br/>I will also say it was great seeing to toys age without aging, they knew that Andy was an adult and instead of trying to be the toys they hoped he would play with again they made the tough choice to say goodbye (not figuratively obviously but still...) to their owner and make another little child happy. Made me cry! <br/><br/>The preschool was a lot of fun to see. Seeing how toys created a dictatorship government was interesting lol. It was funny to watch our toys try and escape the preschool with a particularly funny Mr Potato- Head using his attachments on a tortilla. Has me laughing my socks off every time I watch this film. <br/><br/>The near death scene near the end of the film was very touching and again made me reach for the tissues. <br/><br/>Spanish Buzz was also very funny and so was the imaginary tea party at Bonnie's house before Woody returned to the school. Oh and seeing a adult Sid from Toy Story 1 was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Yes there were a few flaws and plot holes but I can live with them due to the brilliance of the film. <br/><br/>All in all I give this a rating of 10/10 :)"
"lucasversantvoort","8","0","1","6 May 2015"," Terrific capper to the trilogy, but strangely unmoving
","Like many films, prior to watching it, I was well aware of the fact that an incredible amount of people had already boarded the hype train for Toy Story 3. It was one of those occasions where there was always someone regaling you with their oh-so emotional experience watching Toy Story 3. The fact that it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars only added to the hype for me, because that had only happened two times earlier, with Beauty and the Beast and Up. What this told me was that if it didn't make me cry big, manly tears, then this film would be somewhat of a disappointment. Unfortunately, this is what happened. The film was for me somewhat of an emotional letdown, but it's saved by its superb comedy writing.<br/><br/>The story deals with Andy heading off to college and having to decide what to do with his toys. After a series of accidents (what else), our familiar gang of toys find themselves in a children's daycare. It all seems like heaven, but there's the question of whether they should stay or return to Andy. Woody is the only one who decides to try to return, but is taken home by a little girl. The other toys discover that the children play way too rough with them and decide to leave. However, the daycare hides a gang of toys led by a large purple teddy bear called Lotso, who rules the daycare with an iron fist and our pack of toys find out leaving won't be so easy. The film thus devolves into Woody returning to Buzz and the rest and trying to break out of the daycare and return to Andy.<br/><br/>As I previously stated, my main grievance with the film is that the drama failed to connect with me somewhat. I am of course referring to the two big emotional scenes toward the end: the scene where the toys' lives are at stake and the ending itself. I found myself in the undesirable position of realizing on an intellectual level what the filmmakers were trying to achieve (Maximum Emotional Impact), but not really caring on an emotional level. The furnace scene was however very tense and I found myself reflecting on all I've experienced with these toys as it was happening: they may be toys, but dammit, I've known them since I was young and they shouldn't be harmed. I still feel though that entire scene was a tad emotionally exploitative: to make the audience experience the death of Woody and co without actually killing them, a cliché often found in films. (But then again, entering a theater is implicitly allowing yourself to be exploited and it's what entertainment is made of.) As for the ending, I knew the ending tried to make people reminisce about their childhoods and all the toys they used to own and I highly appreciate the sentiment itself, but the scene itself is done with all the subtlety of a brick to the face: the scene where Andy give his toys away, gets in his car, turns toward his toys across the street and says, and I quote, ""Thanks guys"", is enough to send someone like me screaming for the hills.<br/><br/>The true star of the film however is its humor. Unsurprisingly, it was written by Pixar newcomer Michael Arndt who had previously found success with Little Miss Sunshine which is the film that found a way to make a family smuggling the corpse of one of their deceased family members (the grandpa) out of a hospital not only plausible, but funny at the same time. As with that film, the humor in Toy Story 3 is outstanding. When I think back to Toy Story 3, I don't think of the supposedly sad ending, I think of Spanish Buzz, Barbie and Ken, etc. Easily my favorite moment is the introduction of Chuckles the clown, who is actually (of course) a cynical, world-weary clown. From the way the camera pans to him sitting in the window opening as a melancholy harmonica plays, to his wonderfully clichéd dialogue and gravelly voice, this is parody done completely right.<br/><br/>It's not like I'm saying Toy Story 3 is bad. It's not. As far as trilogies go, this is quite honestly a great success. It's really funny, it's tense (the 'prison break') and despite any qualms, it's a film easily watched and enjoyed from beginning to end. It's just that besides the excellent comedy, I didn't really connect emotionally with the ending which was made all the more surprising by the fact that pretty much everyone else practically had to renew their supply of Kleenexes from both blowing their loads over this film and wiping their collective tears."

Until yesterday, I never thought of watching it or any Toy Story Movies before. But now I'll wait to see more Toy Story movies. I'm glad that I watched all three Toy Story Movies. The whole movie kept me in a trance, but the end scene made me cry. Passing on something, that has been emotionally attached to you, is really hard.

"MUFCOK","9","0","1","3 February 2015"," A fitting end to an incredible trilogy, certainly worth the wait!
","Toy Story 3 starts as Andy is packing up his things, cleaning out his bedroom as he prepares to leave home for College. He is separating his belongings into piles of store in the loft, send to local play centre and take to college with him. Toys are fed up and feeling unloved as they aren't played with anymore and are becoming increasingly worried that they are going to be donated. Andy can't bring himself to throw away his childhood toys and opts to put them into the loft for safe keeping. The bag of toys get mixed up with some other bags and they end up being re-homed at the local child day centre. The toys are unaware of the mix up and they are under the impression that Andy doesn't care for them anymore. The vast majority of the story is set in the Sunny Side day centre with many news toys being introduced.<br/><br/>The pressure to create Toy Story 3 and ensure that it lives up to its incredibly high reputation and previous two films is massive but Pixar do not let us down. The imagination that the creators have is second to none; the work that they have created is nothing short of pure genius. The message behind the animation is spot on, this is what makes many Pixar stories appeal to adults as well as children. It has humour, heart, depth, fantastic effects and of course the message of friendship and loyalty. Toy Story 3 is the biggest one yet; it boasts fantastic effects and takes the toys adventures onto a massive scale. It does push its limits but it doesn't for one second forget the basics, it keeps true to the previous two movies and that is what makes Toy Story 3 a massive success.<br/><br/>If I was to be very picky and try and fault Toy Story 3 it would be the Ken and Barbie storyline, I don't think it is necessary. I understand why they did it and I don't fault them for it but in my eyes I didn't enjoy that so much. The last fifteen minutes are faultless, it is a movie making masterpiece and I wouldn't change a single aspect of it, it's the most fitting end to any movie trilogy I have ever seen. Nothing else needs to be said, it is as magic, touching and fun as the previous movies and is on par with the best animated movies ever made.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Like so many kids i grew up as Pixar began rising to the peak of animation. I was wowed by the first Toy Story and thrilled by the second, but nothing could have prepared me eleven years later for this masterpiece. This film had be me laughing one minute, heart in my mouth the next and crying my eyes out and the end of the film. Because of my age when this film was released, i could relate to Andy and how he was changing in what he loved due to advancements in technology and his age. The plot is simple yet complex at the same time as we follow Woody and Buzz as they attempt to get back to Andy again before he leaves for college. The film keeps on the edge of your seat the whole way through as the gang of toys fight for what they love most: each other. The voice acting is once again superb with the timeless Tom Hanks and Tim Allen leading the charge. Along with these two leading stars, the inclusion of Michael Keaton as Ken is such a brilliant turn as he is completely hilarious. The animation is superb as is every Pixar film is along with the lighting and music which is expertly provided by Randy Newman with the song we belong together a personal favourite of mine. The eleven year wait was brought to a conclusion for me with what i found to be the most emotional final scene i have ever witnessed in a film. When Andy gave his toys to Bonnie, i somehow felt as though i was losing them to, proving how incredible Pixar are at masterful story telling. I will never forget this film and the effect that it had on me, a feeling of pure enjoyment no other film will ever rival. To infinity and beyond Pixar, to infinity and beyond."

I personally thought it would have been awesome had the toys gone in the attic, see total black for a little bit, then the bag opening up and there's Andy's kid(s) and it shows them playing with the toys (with Daddy Andy playing sometimes, too). I think this would have been the best ending. The one they did was good, I just think this way would have been better and we could see Andy's kids growing up. It would also teach that things can be passed down from generation to generation (as I believe it may have been referenced that Woody was passed down to Andy from someone in his family). Otherwise, the movie still tugged at your heartstrings and was an awesome addition to the Toy Story Franchise. If only the ending were different I would have ranked it higher because I actually was disappointed in the way it ended and left me feeling flat."

","Very clever use of fun situations and delivers an emotional message about moving on. I can understand how viewers would be moved by the ending with Andy conflicted over Woody having a new owner. My favorite moment was the Cool Hand Luke riff (spend the night in the box) and Ken's clothes modeling for Barbie to 'Freak Out'. It struck me by the end of the picture that it was Woody who was the dinosaur of the group, the last one to understand that it was time to move on for his own and Andy's sake. The Pixar folks did a nice job with this one and if an animated film has to occupy IMDb's top one hundred films, this is a worthy contender. A nice film for all ages."

This is a charming, funny, sweet, sharply clever action filled adventure filled with so many great characters (the big baby doll is genuinely creepy at times) , and it has more than a little touch of weepiness towards the end. The sense of passing youth and time in general is sublimely well crafted, and throughout this is hugely entertaining. All in all a great addition to family cinema."

","Disney and Pixar studios do brilliance again when they brought us the second sequel to Toy Story. In this sequel, the Woody, Buzz and the Gang are mistakenly delivered to Sunnyside Daycare instead of the attic at Andy's house right before he leaves for college. They toys befriends new toys at Sunnyside and all, except Woody, decide to stay in the daycare and be played with with little kids for generations to come. However, Woody still believes that he and his friends belong wot Andy and he attempts to convince the others they weren't abandoned by Andy and to return to his house.<br/><br/>Like the previous two movies, this is filmed in brilliant, colorful and detailed computer animation. The story is filled with more surprises and adventure, from Woody and the gang trying to escapes the grips of the deranged toy Lotso to Buzz being mistakenly reprogrammed to speak Spanish only.<br/><br/>There are much comedy and humor, with some of my favorite scenes including the hilarious chemistry between Ken and Barbie and the part where Chuckles (the sad looking clown doll) describing (while sitting idly by a window, overlooking a stormy night) his sad misadventures when he, Lotso and Baby were abandoned by their owner.<br/><br/>Each character was given a unique personality and special brand to act out its performances, which will delight an audience of all ages. I enjoyed seeing the introduction of new toy characters including Dolly, Mr. Prinklepants and Trixie. I like the fact that all the toys work together to try to overcome its adversities and also like the fact that this film, unlike the previous two, has a little more drama and darkness to it, but still light-hearted enough to enjoy the comedy and imagination.<br/><br/>Hands down to a great directing and writers team for making one of Disney/Pixar most memorable movies; great for adventure, laughter and music - one of the best of the Pixar movies! <br/><br/>Grade A"
"Incendid","9","0","1","31 January 2014"," One of Pixar's Best Movies
","Ciaran- Toy Story 3 is one of my favourite animated movies as it portrays everything a animation should portray- friendship, loyalty and love. Toy Story 3 just wraps the animation and story into a beautiful movie. After watching the movie again, the camera angles and lighting this movie shows, in one scene where Buzz is locking up the other toys in every single shot in the scene Buzz is always in the light- however Lotso throughout the movie transitions from the light, then to half-light, then to darkness. I cried in this movie twice- in the inferno scene and the final goodbye scene. As i said before this is one of my favourite animated movies- i highly recommend this movie- 8/10.<br/><br/>Jacob: I will always remember popping in the first two Toy Story VHS tapes and watching them endlessly. Like E.T. they perfectly capture the innocence and imaginative freedom of childhood, and this is essential for an emotional connection and a nostalgic feeling that those films gave us. Naturally I was very excited to hear of a new Toy Story in production. I saw it and loved it as much as the other Pixar productions. It was darker (not too dark), more emotional and had a charming sense of humour. I was actually splendidly surprised about the direction that that this film was taking. I was expecting just another adventure story that will lead to more sequels but this is the final chapter. Some remember the heartbreak they had when they have to give up something so close and personal and this film captures that perfectly. The villain is lots'o fun, the drama is there, the characters have returned and they are all witty and funny. The scenes with Barbie and Ken are absolutely hilarious. The ending is a but cheesy but is cheesy in good way, the kind that jerks a few tears or maybe a thunderstorm of emotions. 9/10"

","Toy Story 3 has everything you could possibly want in a great film. It has heart and emotion, more suspense than any film Hollywood has put out in recent memory and it's packed with more action than ten summer blockbusters. <br/><br/>I honestly can't find anything wrong with this film. It deals with grown up themes such as what it's like having to grow up and fear of abandonment. We all used to be kids and at some point we stopped playing with our old toys. Seeing that transition come to life on film is sad to say the least. <br/><br/>Any great animated film has something to offer all demographics. Toy Story 3 does just that and more. The kids will love it just because it's a cartoon with pretty colors. Adults will love it's heartwarming story telling and memorable characters. If you are a movie buff, you will especially have a fun time catching little nods to all kinds of film genres. <br/><br/>Toy Story 3 borrows major themes from prison films, gangster films and even horror films. The later is mainly because of the zombie like baby that is creepy to say the least. <br/><br/>What Toy Story does best is make you care about the characters. The viewer is literally invested in their well being. As the film progresses, we are increasingly fearing for the safety of our favorite toys, and even though it's an animated film, the question of whether or not the toys will survive begins to creep into our minds. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if there is anything more I can say about Toy Story 3. It's funny, it's sad, it's full of action and it's nostalgic. In one word, it's perfect. <br/><br/>Along with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Toy story might just be the greatest trilogy of all time."

"mgruebel","7","0","1","24 December 2013"," Pixar can do well even with sequels
","Usually sequels, especially of children's animated films, fall pretty flat by the third time. Not this one. Pixar's director gives the audience a feeling that the same loving effort in writing and production was invested in number three as in number one.<br/><br/>The plot does not cover much new ground: toys are thrust into a dangerous new environment, don't stick together at first leading to their near-demise, then finally recognize the strength in unity. However, the script is well crafted. I watched the 'adult' film Oblivion the day before TS3, and the former proves that Hollywood is willing to patronize its adult audience with more inconsistent plotting than its child audiences.<br/><br/>The evil mastermind is a teddy bear that smells of strawberries. Pure genius, and he has a good evil mastermind backstory to go with it. As a big plus point in script writing, teddy is not reformed at the end, showing that not all bad people can be reformed, and suffers a suitable terrible fate, but without any violence, indeed a fate driven by a truck driver's LOVE for the bad toy. Pure genius.<br/><br/>I have to confess the director managed to get a lump in my throat by the time the toys say goodbye to their long time owner Andy who is off to college. Perhaps it is because I watched TS1 with my kids when they were little, and now they are off to college. Whatever the reason, and yes, they are playing with your emotions 'the easy way' in this film, nonetheless I can count the animated films that put a lump in my throat easily on the fingers of one hand."

","Superb story, really engrossing and loved the movie. They have used the empathy techniques, quirks and teasers and the turning points so smoothly that one simply gels with the story .. I wouldn't mind watching this movie 5 times in a month over and over again!!! The best thing about the story is when Andy is giving away his precious toys to the girl. How he feels for them even today when he grows up and then reality strikes as with age one has to move on. I hope they continue with e series and soon come out with many more of these. It is simply one of my most favorite titles. If i love animation today, its not because of toy story but if the world loves Animation then it can definitely attribute to this brilliant idea one perceived."

So cute.<br/><br/>But, it wasn't the best of the three by any means. That doesn't mean it wasn't good though. I would recommend that anyone and everyone watches this movie, especially if you have seen the first 2. I think that you should watch the first 2 movies before you watch this one, though, because it will help you get the emotions of it and truly understand the story line.<br/><br/>Great movie."

","Better than the second one, this one returns many more toys in this movie. The gang is mistakenly thrown out as trash when Andy is about to go to college. The toys escape just in time and decide to go to be donated to the daycare. It becomes clear that there is a dictatorship when the new toys are tricked into the more rambunctious toddlers room. Meanwhile Woody gets out of the daycare only to be taken by another kid.<br/><br/>There are two things I love about this installment of the franchise. First is the fact that there are more toys, and the whole gang is around. The interactions and the comradery that was a little thin in the second installment. All of it is back. And Barbie gets Ken to go along with her.<br/><br/>Second is the great escape concept. It really works for these toys. The danger has never been more compelling. The victory has never been more sweet. It's a great idea for the story."

The new characters in the movie feel like they were in the previous two films, they were that engaging and really worked well in the movie.

Of course, once you know there is a one and only Mr. Tom Hanks behind the microphone impersonating Sheriff Woody, you can't get then Forrest Gump and current captain Philips out of your mind, but who cares; no one with a sound mind wants to take Professor Robert Langdon out of the picture! <br/><br/>This sequel might be the only one to have not failed continuing on the success path as most others do.

","As a kid, I grew up watching both of the Toy Story movies a lot. I loved how funny they were and I loved the characters - the little green alien toys were always a favorite of mine. When I found out that there was going to be a third Toy Story movie I was so excited. I had really high hopes and expectations for the movie and they were definitely met. I have to say this is the first time that I have said that about a third of any movie. Movies seem to get worse and worse as they go on, but this was not so with this movie. The story was good, and it was great to see all of the old characters from the other films - as well as some new ones - in a whole new adventure. I think this is a great movie for not only kids, but everyone else that grew up watching the other Toy Story movies."

","I've always been a fan of Disney Pixar films, most notably Finding Nemo, the first two Toy Story films, The Incredibles, Wall-E, Up and A Bug's Life, but this one's phenomenal and I've seen it four times so far: once at the cinema in 3D (which was really good); once when my mum rented it while I was staying at her house; once on my flight home from Dubai and just recently when I rented it myself. This film is so amazing I'm seriously considering purchasing it in a triple pack along with the first two.<br/><br/>There are several redeeming qualities in this film such as the opening scene involving Andy's toys in a western film scenario, some humorous lines, Buzz Lightyear in Spanish mode, references to the previous two films (such as the aliens pointing out, ""the claw!"" and Jessie moaning, ""It's Emily all over again!"" when referring to her previous owner she sang about in Toy Story 2) and new characters such as the good-bear-turned-bad Lotso Hugging Bear, the shy but adorable Bonnie and Barbie's new love interest, Ken - that doll's house scene where Ken models his outfits for Barbie is priceless! Although certain characters from the previous films are missing (Bo Peep, Etch-a-Sketch and Weezy) due to having been sold, it still includes my favourite characters of Woody, Buzz and Jessie. I also liked the bittersweet feel of the film due to its inclusion of happy and sad moments. Even though I didn't cry at this film, I found the back story of Lotso Hugging Bear, Big Baby and Bonnie's toy clown Chuckles very moving as well as the ending scene where Andy gives all his toys to Bonnie. In addition to the redeeming qualities I've already mentioned, I liked seeing the teenage Andy, pre-teen Molly and older Buster, who was hilarious when moving slowly inside Andy's room. Also look out for a near-cameo appearance of Totoro from Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece!<br/><br/>Overall, this is a brilliant film that has all the aspects I look for in an animated film. 10/10."
"Lionheart490","10","0","2","25 May 2013"," This is a perfect film
","Episode #6 of Lionheart490's IMDb Movie Reviews <br/><br/>It is rare for me to consider a movie to be perfect. I mean I know there is a lot of wonderful movies out there but it takes a certain kind of talent, heart, and intelligence for me to consider a film to be flawless. When it comes to ""Toy Story 3"", I believe this film to be absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>It is the third and last part of the critically and commercially successful movie franchise about living toys that made Pixar a household name known as ""Toy Story"". I actually consider the first two Toy Story films to be incredibly amazing movies. They have the right amount of great storytelling, wonderfully written characters, spectacular performances, groundbreaking computer animation, and giant amount of heart that make them deserving of the ""classic"" status. But I consider this film to be my favorite one in this spectacular trilogy. <br/><br/>The basic themes of the Toy Story franchise are dealing with maturity and loss seen through the adventures of a bunch of living toys enjoying their life in hands of a happy child named Andy. The first two films go into these themes, but it is this film that these ideas of growing up and dealing with loss of loved ones really are explored. This is really important as the first two films featured the toys being with their owner, Andy, when he was a child. But in ""Toy Story 3"", Andy is all grown up and really doesn't need his toys anymore as he's going to college. They really do explore these rather adult themes and ideas while still being a presentable movie that children can enjoy. That is one of the great things that Pixar has done with their films is making films that anybody can watch. Anyone can watch ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Wall- E"", ""Up"", and the ""Toy Story"" films without feeling like it was made specifically for children. A kid can watch this movie and love it, then grow up to watch it and love it the same or even more. That was exactly what Pixar did with its' Toy Story franchise when you think about. <br/><br/>Kids who were Andy's age when they watched the first Toy Story in 1995 ended up growing up with the franchise. When Toy Story 2 came out in 1999, those kids ended up watching it and loved it. Then Toy Story 3 came out in 2010, those kids are now grown up and in college just like Andy. They feel like this trilogy of films is telling their story and dealing with their feelings on maturing and losing ""their precious toys"". That is why many grown-ups cried during this movie and that is why I believe ""Toy Story 3"" to be the perfect conclusion to this wonderful movie trilogy. <br/><br/>Now recently, people have been worried about the future quality of upcoming Pixar films. Films like ""Cars 2"" and ""Brave"" have made people believe that Pixar reached its peak and can't produce any good quality work like they used to. Especially with the news of things like ""Monsters University"", ""Finding Dory"", and ""Toy Story 4"" being in the works. However, I am a bit more faithful in Pixar and being hopeful that Pixar hasn't jumped the shark just yet. It seems Pixar is pulling a similar maneuver that they did with the Toy Story films with ""Monsters, Inc."". ""Monsters University"" seems like Pixar is not only aiming for kids but for the kids who loved watching ""Monsters, Inc."" when it came out and are now in college. I hope the movie doesn't turn out to be the gross dumb college comedy that everyone is thinking it'll be. <br/><br/>Yes, there is possible plans for a ""Toy Story 4"" but I really don't think a fourth film is necessary. I really think Pixar was able to get it right with making a trilogy of flawless animation masterpieces with the right amount of heart, intelligence, and talent. It is rare to see a trilogy of all good films, especially films like these that seem to progressively get better and better. Pixar has reached perfection with these films. This is why I believe ""Toy Story 3"" to be a perfect film. It is not just my favorite film in the trilogy but one of my favorite films of all time. I believe that ""Toy Story 3"" deserves the honor of getting an excellent rating of 10/10."
"Imdbxprt","8","0","3","26 March 2013"," The reason why this film falls just short of the best Pixar film yet
","This is a great film. No doubt about it. I am not writing this review to re-inform you that this is one of the best animated films ever, because you should already know that by now.<br/><br/>I am writing this not to tell you all about how great the film was. There is too much to talk about. Instead, I am going to discuss why Toy Story 3 does not deserve a 10-star rating.<br/><br/>First impressions are very important. In films, it's first impression can tell you about the tone of the film, it can introduce you to new characters, and even tell whether or not the film would interest you.<br/><br/>I will say right now that I do not degrade the film because of the surreal idea of talking toys. Why? Because the opening of the film introduced me to these talking toys. It told me ""This is going to be a fun family film"".<br/><br/>The reason why this is so important is because if a film like Pixar's Ratatouille showed a talking rat 20 minutes in, I wouldn't be surprised. I knew that there would be talking animals. But if a film like The Dark Knight Rises showed talking rats after 20 minutes, I would lose hope in man-kind. <br/><br/>Why? Because the opening of The Dark Knight Rises introduced me to a perilous, dark, and serious story.<br/><br/>You also get first impressions from the characters. For example, when we meet Andy for the first time in the film, we are demonstrated that he is a typical 18-year-old boy.<br/><br/>Here are some examples: <br/><br/>-At one point, Andy's little sister explores his room before Andy gets annoyed by her mere presence, and makes her leave. And that's fine. After all, he's a typical 18-year-old boy.<br/><br/>-Later, his mother walks into his room. She shows to be supportive of Andy going to college but tears up a little shortly after. She gives Andy a hug, and he reluctantly lets her do so, while gently pushing her off so as to not be rude. This behavior from his mother embarrasses him. And that's not unusual. He's just a typical 18-year old boy.<br/><br/>-And when he receives a call from his toys who are hiding in the treasure chest, Andy opens it, retrieves the phone, and closes it. Clearly showing that Andy has no care for his toys anymore. But he's an 18-year-old boy, anyways. There's nothing strange about that.<br/><br/>Now, before I went to go see this movie, reviews saying ""the end of the film was beautiful"" and ""I was bawling in tears at the end"" mislead-ed me to believe that I'd see a great film that would lead up to a brilliant conclusion.<br/><br/>Conclusions of good films will often tend to be the most memorable part. The ending of Wreck-It Ralph and How to Train Your Dragon are two great examples of this.<br/><br/>A powerful conclusion to a story can turn a typical 4-star film into a 5-star ""this is the best movie ever"" kind-of film.<br/><br/>I went to this movie with high expectations for the end that virtually everyone was talking about. Andy drops off a box of his old toys at the house of a little girl. Does he:<br/><br/>A. Give the mother the box of toys with ease like a TYPICAL 18-YEAR-OLD BOY, or does he,<br/><br/>B. Sit down with the little girl, drawing toys from the box one-by-one giving roughly 7-hour-long descriptions of each toy's background story, while slowly growing more and more emotional?<br/><br/>If you guessed the answer was ""B"", then you'd be sadly correct. And if you're thinking, ""Well, he's probably just being playful with the girl. After all, he wouldn't want to just drop off the box and leave! That'd be rude!""<br/><br/>Well, I wish that was a valid thought, but no. He gets very emotional. So much so that when he is talking about Woody and the girl tries to grab his leg, Andy quickly pulls the toy away from her, guarding Woody with his life.<br/><br/>Seriously. Just GIVE THE GIRL THE DOLL! This character quickly went from a normal adult to a 5-year-old. This is NOT a normal adult. If I knew someone his age who behaved the way he did, I would want to stay as far away from him as possible.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I still believe that this is one of the best films ever made, but it's only the second Pixar film to UP, since the so-called ""brilliant"" conclusion made me leave thinking ""Pixar, what happened to you?!"""

As far as the length it was definitely long enough without been cut too short or been stretched. Good angles on the camera work. I do not see any reason to have this movie on 3D (then again so far I been less than impressed with 3D).

"TomTomH","8","0","1","2 July 2012"," The perfect final chapter to a stunning trilogy!
","Toy Story 3 is a heart warming and laughable experience in every category that I think should be ranked as the title: The Best Animated Film In History. You'll laugh, you'll cry, then after you've watched it you'll be desperately going discuss or recommend it to friends wherever you go to see. There's a tiny bit of negative aspect in this film that effected me (it's only the cinematic experience not the home version). It was the ear splitting sound and 3D that was unpleasant for me. The 3D made no difference. NOTHING came out of the screen that was disappointing. Although the dialogue looked very good, it still hurt my eyes. Also a complaint about the sound. It was very loud and at the beginning of the film I had to put my hands over my ears. It was that loud. That all that was bad about it. Despite it's future references and new dialogue, it brings new characters and all new unexpected things to the franchise that gives you heart to the characters and feelings you've loved and known for past and years to come. When I first read the plot I thought (and what most people say) it was nothing different than to the first two. But when you watch it it makes some big and better differences to the scenes and animation. Director Lee Unkrich brings Toy Story to a extraordinary and exciting conclusion. Delivering an animation that's funny, amazing and sad in some places. It's worth going out to buy it from the DVD shop or off Amazon. This is truly the best, perfect and worthy finale to the franchise that brought computer animation to the big screen and made Pixar popular."
"RainDogJr","Null","0","2","14 June 2012"," it even has Totoro!
","A couple of days ago I watched TOY STORY 3 for the first time since 2010. It's really great to check it out now, without all the hype and stuff. I was one of the few who weren't EXTREMELY impressed with it back in 2010 (and who didn't like much when filmmaker Quentin Tarantino said it was his very favorite film of the year), but now I can enjoy it much more. I mean, it's not that I didn't like it back then (I watched it twice on the big screen, to tell the truth) but some people of my generation (I have, basically, the same age of character Andy) were saying that they cried with the ending and that it was the best movie ever and stuff; so I found all of that really annoying. <br/><br/>Anyway, with TOY STORY 3 I think in that ""an expert always makes it (the difficult) look easy"" sort of phrase. Why? Well, the story featured here deals with a natural transition: 10 or so years after the second film we have now Andy getting ready for college and certainly giving all of his attention to stuff like a laptop or a cellphone rather than to his once beloved toys (Woody, Buzz, Jessie and company). It may look like it was an easy decision to work on that transition but other company would have done something else; Pixar itself did a perfect example of the typical uninteresting sequel with CARS 2. <br/><br/>And certainly it's not just the decision but also how to develop the thing. Pixar did it just freakin' right here, in their traditional full-of-great-details fashion. Just take for example our introduction to the hard times the toys are going through: it's a desperate situation with a couple of phones and the toys trying to get Andy's attention – the natural transition is exposed perfectly and we immediately feel empathy with the characters plus, the whole thing ends with a pretty darn funny joke about Ebay! So yes, this is terrific stuff. <br/><br/>It's also worth noting Pixar's decision to have as new characters a couple of old and very famous toys: Barbie and Ken. Again, the development of the situations with these characters is brilliant; for instance, giving Ken some bullying problems for being a ""girl's toy""! You'll find some truly hilarious material and for me they, Barbie and Ken, steal the show. And those great details are worth nothing too: from seeing Woody's hygiene to the ULTIMATE tribute to Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli! I just LOVED seeing Miyazaki's Totoro here as one of the toys (and even being hugged by Woody); one of the coolest movie things in recent memory. Terrific film: 9.5 out of 10. <br/><br/>*Watched it (again) on 11 June, 2012"

","Yes. It's a kids movie. Not just this one, but the prequels were meant for kids. Is it wrong for a 21-year old man to love the trilogy? I feel justified for loving the trilogy and the latest movie in particular.<br/><br/>I feel i was born at the right time and was of the right age to like the movies. I was 4 when 'Toy Story' was the next big thing in Animation after The Lion King, 8 when 'Toy Story 2' hit the theaters and 19 when it finally concluded(now that 'Toy Story 4' has been announced). I did enjoy all the movies but was too old to believe in talking and walking toys and figments of imagination anymore.<br/><br/>I watched Toy Story 3 to finish off the series and get done with it. But, it was something i had not anticipated. The plot and the storyline is predictable and is meant to be- it's directed towards the below 18 age group. But it was the theme that caught my eyes and mind. A grownup boy feels its time to part with his boyhood buddies- his toys. I love the way the toys try desperately to draw his attention in the beginning, in vain.<br/><br/>Yes, i did have toys and had monologues with those plastic things that can't talk and there was a time i happily threw them off. But, there's a secret vault in my heart that still broods over the time i had with my playmates. Thanks to the makers for helping me reminisce."

","When I watched the movie Toy Story 3 I got to see it all out in theaters. I personally think the movie is amazing just like Toy Story 1 and 2. I like the fact that they have an evil character to always throw in a surprise. The hole movie was somewhat expecting but sometimes it was completely expecting. Toy Story 3 is my favorite out of all the toy Story's because Woody goes on so many more adventures than in the other movies. The fact that Buzz and Jessie fall in love because Buzz goes all Spanish really made me laugh. At the end of the movie it got pretty intense and scary, then after the scary and intense part they were all safe and happy. Overall I absolutely love the movie, it is definitely my most favorite movie of all time."

But the original takes the cake in my mind which makes the ""Best animated movie of all time"" on the front of the DVD cover... a little over the top.

","Toy Story. I love it. When I was a kid I never watched the whole movie for some reason just parts but my classmates were talking about it a lot. So when I was like 15 I finally decided to watch it and I just loved it. Of cause back then there wasn't part 3. But now there is. So the story is about our toys getting to the kiden(I don't know how to spell it) garden. And how they didn't like there and tryed to escape. Oh, good old Hollywood. So the story is OK I guess I didn't enjoy it as much as part 1 and 2 but... Animation is good although I liked Tangled better. Acting is awesome. So are the songs and sound. Now to the bad. I think I didn't like this movie that much (although I liked it) because it takes itself way too seriously. It's not nearly as funny as 1 and 2. Yes there are a lot of characters and I guess it's suppost to be good but I don't think it's such a good thing. You don't get to know them well anyway. First parts didn't have that much characters but were so much better. So the movie with OK plot, a lot of characters, good animation and lack of humor. But you know that you would watch it don't matter what. It's you're childhood."
"FairlyAnonymous","7","0","1","29 June 2011"," A really good animated movie, but not as good as the others
","I have been a toy story fan ever since the original, and I especially liked the second one. Those two movies were adventure movies, which were both about journeys. This movie is not about a journey, but more of a prison movie. The basic synopsis is that the toys are stuck in an evil day care center, and they are trying to get out.<br/><br/>The movie is good and it has a lot of heart in it, but it seems a bit generic as far as plot goes. The problem with Pixar is that their villains are pretty much all the same. The villain is some guy who looks nice, but is really evil... that happened with Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, Up, Monsters inc., The Incredibles, and Wall-E. Pixar makes good villains but with Toy Story 3 it seemed just like a copy of the other villains they have made. Some good character, that had some troubled past and automatically hates everyone. Pretty standard.<br/><br/>The characters are all likable in this movie, while a large percent of the cast is gone from over the years. Toy Story 3 has this constant escape theme where someone thinks they saw something, turn around, and then it isn't there anymore. This happens in all of the Toy Story movies but it happens maybe four times in this movie. I guess what makes this movie real good is the nostalgic sort of feeling. It has been a while since any Toy Story movie so automatically everyone is going to love it and say it is good. I'm not saying it isn't a good movie, but I feel like the plot could use some work.<br/><br/>The ending action sequence is pretty dramatic, though just saying that the burning room is around 3,000 degrees or hotter so they would've been on fire already. I guess I felt like Pixar was trying too hard to impress us with the ending. The whole furnace scene dragged out pretty long, and felt like the movie was being overly dramatic. You know when a movie tries too hard to make something sad, well this movie does that. The very end scene where Andy gives away his toys feels almost a little too forced. I know the scene is sad, but it felt like they were slapping you in the face and saying ""This is a sad scene, so it must be sad"".<br/><br/>While this is most likely the last movie in the franchise, I must say it has ended well. The humor is pretty good, though slightly predictable as far as jokes go. While this movie isn't a journey, or an adventure, it still has heart. The animation is also very good as far as lighting goes, and everything is pretty detailed. This is not my favorite Pixar movie, but it is still a good one. Peace."

In this movie was more action scenes than in it's prequels and it was just great. With much more characters than other parts and greater storyline. And what I liked was that in this movie I couldn't foreseen the ending cuz I knew it will end well but there was more than one variant what ends well. It was cool to watch how Woody chooses if he wants to stay with Andy or with his friends. And as this movie was last of toy story 3 and as I were able to watch how Andy has grown up it was just epic ending for this awesome trilogy. I surely can give this movie 10/10."

","Toy Story changed animation movies forever. Toy Story 2 surpassed that, and right now, Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous movies, we are taken to reality, where Andy is now grown up, and doesn't play with his toys anymore. No matter how hard the toys try to get Andy's attention, it seems he has grown up. Andy had decided to bring Woody to college, while the other toys would be in the attic, but Andy's mom mistook the toys for garbage and threw them away. This led to the toys giving up and finding a new place where they can be played.<br/><br/>This movie has everything, it has action, drama, romance, and also moments that will have tears in our eyes.<br/><br/>Over the years, Pixar proved that they can make good movies with good plots, with great animation. Every year, they improve to give us good plots and great movies. Toy Story 3 has just surpassed both Toy Story films. Pixar took a great risk in making this 3rd movie darker in tone, as we would actually see a scene where a toy would betray the others who helped him, and actually left them all to die. And for the 1st time in animation movie history, the toys actually gave up and decided to meet their fate, until fate was kind enough to save them. It was the best scene in animation movie history, and one of the most scariest.<br/><br/>The last 20mins actually left an entire movie theater in tears. It was that emotional scene where it was just like it is happening for real. When you watch the scene, you can releate to yourself, when you actually grow up and go to college, and to donate the toys that you have been playing with and having them all those years.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10/10 for the superb plot. It could have won best picture, but was happy that it won the Best Animation Movie."

","A whole generation grew up watching the great ""Toy Story"" series in the 90's and then we entered in the 21st century and people at Pixar must have thought that kids wouldn't care about a film about toys. After all, kids nowadays have other kinds of things to do, now they use the internet, computers, video games, in short, the culture of toys changed a lot and that's why we had to wait for 11 years until the release of a third part of ""Toy Story"". People at Pixar needed to know if another movie would be plausible, meaningful now. But the wait worth all the while. ""Toy Story"" continues being the animated film series that never fails, entering into a new generation without disappoint its previous, and end up being the most innovative and brilliant film of the series. <br/><br/>Why we care so much about this phenomenon? Because it really touches a part of us that never dies, our childhood memories, our childhood toys and the all fun we had with them, some of the greatest moments of our lives. But then one day we grow up and must leave them all behind; some of us can do very easily, others take a longer time or always hide them in some part of the house keeping them as remembrance of a good time. ""Toy Story 3"" using the famous toys Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and others, in this part of life when kids grown up and don't need these toys anymore, so Woody, Buzz and all Andy's toys are frightened with the possibility of going to the trash, or to the attic, or the last and more plausible option, being donated to a day-care center. But when Andy is deciding to keep the toys before going to college his mom takes all of them putting them in a day-care center that seems to be a great place to stay, all the toys there welcome them very well, including Barbie's Ken (voice by Michael Keaton) and a charming bear (Ned Beatty), but things are not what they appear and here starts the dangers of the lovely characters of ""Toy Story"" who wants to back home to his previous owner.<br/><br/>In its themes about rejection, changes of life and the things we miss in life ""Toy Story 3"" adds humor, great jokes, an incredible adventure (the opening scene has to be most memorable moment in a transition of a wild adventure with the toys and than transformed into Andy playing with them as a kid) and a lot of emotion (very difficult not to cry at the final minutes). And, again, as the other films this is not just entertainment for kids, the series always knows how to grab a older audience, of all ages, it's fun for everyone. <br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" is the best Animation of 2010 and one of the Top 10 of the past ten years, but in terms of longevity, in touching themes that never gets old despite we think it might be, this film will echo in a long time.

It is undeniable that toy story changed the story of animation, and it deserves a huge praise just for that.<br/><br/>That being said, i loved this film. Regrettably, i went to watch it at the worst theater ever (a friend invited me... boy, do i regret that), and there were black spots throughout the movie, as well as sound dis adjustments, so i was annoyed by this and i couldn't be immersed 100% by the film.<br/><br/>But it still caught my attention from start to finish. The story was pretty well written and executed, so not one minute of it was boring at all. The characters we love kept delivering, and there were some cracks of laughter, especially from Spanish buzz.<br/><br/>But i found this movie more happy sad than i found it of funny. I had heard how many people had cried of this film, and i was no exception. The incinerator scene was just perfect and really moving, and i must say i cried here rather than on the ending. But it the movie ends perfectly and in a moving way, and just in the perfect way. Andy couldn't have kept the toys, or it'd've been unrealistic, so he did the best he could do, and by doing so, he moved millions of us who watched the film that went through the same.<br/><br/>Lotso was just plain evil, and i was so angry when he betrayed them at the incinerator. But he was a strong part of the film.<br/><br/>The animation was great, but i just couldn't get much into the score. But maybe that's because my theater sucked at the sound.<br/><br/>I won't lie: i preferred How to train your dragon, but that's my opinion and i respect everyone else's. And it does deserve all the praise it's getting. The problem is: How to train your dragon does too! It was the perfect Dreamworks movie for me.<br/><br/>I'm buying the whole trilogy for DVD sometime soon, and this franchise will be forever in my heart. Good job to end it after all this years!"

","The only question which has been lurking in my head after watching this movie is 'How do they do it ?'. The entertainment world is already running out of ideas,fairy tales and bases for scripts,so much that most of the movies made today both live action and animated films derive the base for a good plot from books,true incidents and fairy tales or resurrection of the old plots, comedies and remakes. World of cinema seems to be running out of entertainment resources. I mean we all predicted the exhaustion of natural resources, but resources for entertainment.......that's something new and unprecedented. But looks like Pixar has already got a stock pile of imaginative writers,talented directors and creative animators making up the perfect elements for a recipe of exhilarating entertainment. The movie starts of with an intriguing plot about the future of the toys which rests in the hands of their most loved owner Andy, who has grown older and is going to college. Since the toys are forced to live with the curse of immortality, their fate either includes them to be locked away in the attic for an indefinite period of time or to be passed on to other kids to be played with, who wouldn't be as nice, loving and careful as Andy was with them. But there is a twist of fate in the plot which surprises the toys and also giving them a hope to be played again,which under revelation later turns out to be undesirable and they end up in captivity also regretting their decision since they ignore Woody's foreboding of the idea. It is then all up to Woody who attempts to regroup and team up with his buddies to get all of them safely back home. Even though the movie does actually repeat some elements of the escapist type of plot similar to the preceding installments, but it never strays away from the humor which has been carefully maintained in every installment of the franchise and which is incredible in this,especially for the grand finale. The story becomes quite unpredictable with intense dramatic depth and a very heart warming ending moving even grown up audiences to tears. The comedy in this movie is pretty good but not as intense or as hilarious as compared to its preceding parts since because this is the closing chapter of the saga and the plot requires to have some sentimental content, as we all know it is never easy to say good bye to the most beloved franchise with its most beloved characters which solely conceived the animation era today. Speaking on the other aspects of the movie like character development and voice acting were in incredible. Lee Unkrich did a great job in directing, excellent character animation, Randy Newman,a veteran composer who having also composed the score for the previous two Toy Story films returns to deliver a great score from the finest of his talents for the grand finale/curtain call. Last but not the least,John Lassester kept up the brilliant production work and also teams up with Andrew Stanton, both taking huge credits in writing one of the best plots of 2010. The movie still keeps up to its theme, excitement, exceeding expectations and definitely qualifying itself as an Oscar material not only for the best animated feature category but also for the best picture category!.<br/><br/>A great family film. Highly recommended."

Cars look as good in real life as they do in commercials for about a month. Medical products show people relaxing on the beach while in real life, many people take one pill to counter the effects of the other pill.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 has no ill-effects. It may cause nostalgia, tears, laughs, generosity, optimism, and happiness. Nothing there that I don't want. There are many films which remain long past their welcome-does anyone like Rocky 6? Saw V? Police Academy VI? Several franchises sustained the energy necessary for three excellent films-among them ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Austin Powers"" (barely), ""Indiana Jones"" (though it slipped severely in attempting to make a fourth film), and ""Star Wars"". Add Toy Story to that list. This film has all the heart, the great story, the fantastic animation, and the great voice work which made the first two films so loved. This film, indeed, flawlessly adds new, well-fleshed out characters while not giving short shrift to characters we have come to know and love.<br/><br/>This film sees Andy going off to college and the toys conflicted about their place in his life. They have different outlooks on the possible fates they anticipate enjoying, but ultimately their fate is appropriately decided and again, I really don't see how anyone could have a problem with this film. It should be satisfying to everyone with a pulse.<br/><br/>Voice work, as mentioned, from all performers, is excellent, and director Lee Unkrich has paced the story just right.

Most of the film details the toys' efforts to escape, but it's bookended by one of the most hilarious openings in film history and one of the most poignant and bittersweet endings.<br/><br/>Our friends at Pixar as usual have their finger directly on the pulse of cultural currents, and it's not hard to read the toys' plight as an allegory for the very real jobless plight affecting so many Americans right now. But more than that, the film captures the happy/sad feeling of growing up and that sense you have when you're an adult that the world contains much less wonder than it did when you were a kid.

When they face the prospect of death together, it's as touching as if they were alive -- and after all, we've grown to know and love these characters too.<br/><br/>For those that liked the first two better, just wait. We had YEARS of admiring them on repeat viewings. I think Toy Story 3 will gain in nostalgia value and eventually be seen as the perfect ending to the series. Even now I'm wistful thinking about that final scene, and the touching concern shown by Andy (and the writers) for our special friends."
"imagiking","8","0","1","5 February 2011"," Toy Story 3: The Pitch-Perfect Finale
","I mentioned in my reviews of both Toy Story and Toy Story 2 being in the original audience toward which these films were targeted. Indeed, it seemed the very same prospect for Toy Story 3, its plot element of Andy's departure for college mirroring my own, due for little over a month later than the film's release.<br/><br/>Picking up some twelve years after the previous installment, Toy Story 3 explores the familiar toys' fears and doubts when it is revealed that Andy will be leaving for college. Many of the characters of the previous films have already been disposed of, and when the remaining toys find themselves mistakenly donated to a day-care centre rather than placed in the attic, they assume the same has become of them, refusing to believe Woody's insistence otherwise.<br/><br/>Following on a highly successful pair of films over a decade later is never going to be an easy thing to do. Purists will bring an assumed cynicism, as so often they ought to; changing factors in audience expectations will surely result in some differences to the stories that were so loved the first time around; returning to something so beloved after so long a time surely cannot be a wise move. Most famously applicable to the first two Godfather films, the classically untouchable critically acclaimed masterpiece duo, there are few arguments to support a late return to a well-remembered franchise. Toy Story 3 handles this gracefully, its opening shot a direct invitation to nostalgia of the first. Naturally, the film is replete with callbacks to the first and second, never forgetting its cherished roots and always delicately careful to avoid doing anything to exploit or shame them. The opening scene is wonderful, another of the fantastical imaginative scenarios of young Andy, whom we thereafter observe aging through the years. It is a bittersweet beginning, the joy we see in the elaborate and hilarious Western parody of an opening scene soon replaced with a lamentative overtone, the inevitable out-dating of these toys dominating the overall mood. Not, that is to say, that the film isn't entirely packed with laughs throughout; many were the times I found myself short on breath. The primary plot takes on the form and conventions of a traditional genre (potential spoilers shall see me refraining from identifying precisely which), and this is a nice structure to give to the film. New characters become as beloved as old, unseen turns keep the narrative fresh, and a certain element of the film is genuinely quite terrifying. A certain scene toward the end of the film is shockingly dark, its complexity startlingly thought-provoking, disarmingly beautiful, and yet further evidence of the piece's resounding overall thematic darkness. Although we may laugh at the escapades in which the characters entangle themselves, there is the ever-present knowledge that at best, they are returning to be placed in a dusty attic for long-term storage. Many have considered this a parental allegory; the idea of ""our kid"" growing up obviously reflects the ideas of being outgrown by somebody whom you've spent years in the company of. For me, as I suspect is the case for many others, the film reflects growing up, moving on, letting go of the past, and saying a fond farewell to childhood. Toy Story was one of the big movies of my earliest years, and here, fifteen years on, it is time for Andy, me, and my contemporaries to leave behind all that the memories of the original film represent. It is the kind of film which likely holds a personal resonance for most everyone who sees it, and certainly a film which bears no age limit, its universality another of the many facets of this fantastic work. Expect a warm trickle down your cheek in the final scene, the pitch-perfect finale sealing the cinematic legacy of this milestone trilogy.<br/><br/>Dark in the vein of Pixar's more modern works, Toy Story 3 manages to combine the well established and beloved characters with a deeply dark emotional story, typically brilliant comedy, and a thought-provoking personal relevance which inevitably endeared me even more to it. Managing even to top the personally cherished Wall-E, Toy Story 3 is not only a worthy addition to one of cinema's most consistently excellent trilogies, it is its best."
"Jonathon_Natsis","8","0","1","1 February 2011"," Seriously, who doesn't love Toy Story?!
","Quite possibly the most anticipated film in almost a decade and a half, the third instalment of the Toy Story franchise seemed like the ultimate money-grabbing operation in the eyes of cynics: here's a film that not only has basic appeal to pre-tweens all over the world, but one which has been released at a time in which those of us who grew up with the first two films have not lost contact with the story or the characters, and are more than keen to find out what happens to our beloved toys. I, however, had complete faith that Pixar would turn out a quality filmas they always do, really. <br/><br/>All our favourite faces return for Toy Story 3, including Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Hamm, the Potato Heads and a whole host of personal favourites. As Andy prepares to leave for college, he delivers his now-forgotten toys to the local day care centre. What looks like a place of luxury from the outset is actually run with an iron fist by the tyrannical Lots-O-Huggin' Bear, and the toys are determined to escape and make their way back home.<br/><br/>A lot of the superficial appeal of Toy Story 3 comes from the allusions made to real life. Every situation the toys find themselves in, in both a sentimental and adventurous context, can be in some way related back to moments we face on a regular basis in our own lives, and it is a significant element in ensuring that each audience member, regardless of age, makes some sort of personal connection to this film. <br/><br/>One of the strongest suites of this film is the characterisation. While we are already extremely familiar with the original gang of toys, the necessary induction of new characters feels fresh, rather than forced. Each new character has their own persona and plays their part in the story. Barbie, Ken and a very special little girl named Bonnie are all in some way integral to the multi-layered plot, but it is Lotso (as he prefers to be known) who makes his presence felt as one of Disney-Pixar's most blatantly evil villains to date. <br/><br/>More so than any other character, it is Lotso who transcends the barrier that may have otherwise prevented my generation from truly enjoying this film. At times, he plays the role of a somewhat generic villain with only mildly despicable plans, and at others he makes you wonder whether or not this film is entirely suitable for children. His involvement in one particular scene leads to the most powerful moment of the trilogy, and gives Pixar the opportunity to show us how closely connected we really are to these computer-generated images.<br/><br/>I like to review films the way Rusty Ryan likes to play poker. That is, leave emotion at the door at all times. I will make an exception for Toy Story 3, though. With an ending that is saddening, heart-warming and utterly appropriate all at the same time, I regret to inform anyone that wasn't in some way affected by the final scene that they have no soul. With the immensely successful Up, Pixar proved that no one does raw emotion the way they do, and that ability to tug on the heartstrings is just as evident in Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>Many people will walk out of the cinema at the end of this film and find that they have a new all-time favourite. While this film didn't quite hit the mark of an instant classic in my opinion, those behind its release must be commended on an excellent conclusion to the trilogy, and I say that because such a complete ending leaves no scope, nor any reason, for this saga to be returned to. The millions snared at the box office will be handy enough, but films like this are proof that a heart still pulses through the body of the film industry.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"

","Today I managed to watch Toy Story 3, yeah I know it's a bit late now for it was shown many months ago but since my office mate just gave me a copy I decided to watch it.<br/><br/>Toy Story never failed to amaze me... I love Toy Story from the very beginning, and again Disney showcased their cleverness with their latest Toy Story offering.<br/><br/>Wow, I really am in awe till now and I just can't get over how splendid the movie was. The movie has a rich storyline. I love how they put depth on the story this time and tackled the issue of moving on and maturity. Like Andy, indeed we will not be forever young but our memories of our good old days are stuffs that we can forever treasure. For me, the third Story is the best and strongest among the three...<br/><br/>Plus Totoro was there, (too bad he didn't even talk...:rofl:) it really made me happy to see Totoro in a non-Ghibli movie.<br/><br/>I'm really glad I did watch this awesome flick...

","I thought Toy Story couldn't be topped, then they made number two, which is on an equal par to the original. When I heard that after a few years, they were going to make a third film, I was worried that it would be disappointing and nowhere near as good as the other two. I couldn't have been more wrong. It is not on a par, it is better, to the point of being on a different level altogether. It is already in mine, and my 22 year old son's list of top five all time favourite films, after just one viewing. Even if your children have grown up (like mine), you will still love this film as much as you had when they were young."

","Yeah, I liked it a lot! Not as much as Toy Story 1, but it's as least as good as Toy Story 2, and maybe even a bit better. The movie has some great, no even better fantastic shades of lights and dark, and the lighting/shading people have done a fantastic job here. One thing I just don't understand is why these producers are putting so much emphasis on stereoscopic effects! I strongly dislike stereoscopic movies, and dislike the fact that I start to recognize scenes that have ONLY been created for the sake of a stereoscopic audience: how $%$#@$#@! stupid is that! Something I really enjoyed were the extras on DVD, and the fact that Andy was still Andy, albeit a bit older now. Way to go Andy! The Mr. Potato-Tortilla character was so darn good and funny, and yeah Lotso's faith serves him well hahahahaha... Ah well, I guess that's it for Toy Story, I'm glad this trilogy is over and hope that Pixar is going to explore something even more exciting."

","I'm a 19 year old student, but i couldn't wait to watch this! I first watched Toy Story 1 when i was about 5 or 6 and my mum and many other adults loved it as much as the kids they dragged themselves along with to see; believing it to be nothing more than another kids film. But of course it wasn't just another film, with it's amazing visuals previously not seen before and wonderful set of characters and storyline to match. Even one or two quirks adults can easily relate to so it had something for everyone.<br/><br/>Number 2 was just as great but the ending seemed a nice spot for the franchise to end, and many years had passed with no sequel, but one day it was announced and i was happy to hear there was going to be a sequel. However i was worried that it would suck. Simply because most sequels to amazing movies don't surpass their predecessors in quality or start getting stale.<br/><br/>To put it simply, toy story 3 is maybe the best one of the 3! it does have better visuals in the movie and amazing colour which is just lovely to look at, but the plot and laughs are still strong, it'll have you gripped as the toys end up on their most perilous outing.

"johnnyboyz","8","0","1","12 January 2011"," Mesmerising and delightfully pitched second sequel, with an astute focus on both absorbing adventure and observant tragedy combining to produce something special.
","Apart from being a cracking slice of entertainment, rich in its sense of adventure, more than competent in its ability to tell a narrative and packed with both genuinely funny and genuinely comedic moments; Lee Unkrich and the team at Disney Pixar's Toy Story 3 is a heartfelt and powerful piece; a film with the perpetual ability to be able to assuredly tap into some pretty raw human emotions and in the most engaging of fashions. Its universal achievement is its study of loss and post-script look at the fact that life does indeed go on after whatever tragedy might have previously befallen you. Here is the third film in a franchise which has stuck to its guns; providing more than mere blunt nostalgia and petty summer frills to an array of fans young enough to remember the first one as a wondrous animated adventure film, by effectively branching out in its overall study of something substantial; simultaneously refraining to pander to new generations of youngsters out for shrill entertainment in a CG animated form. The film is one very much for those whom have grown up with the characters and in-jokes; twelve year old newcomers out for the latest in commodity infused sequel shenanigans whom are not familiar with the other two need not apply.<br/><br/>Lee Unkrich, the latest in a bevy of directors from Pixar to have come of age and take the reigns, does a stupendous job; delivering the goods on several fronts in what is a wondrous animation. The moment in the series we were all told to wake up and realise that the makers behind this fantastic franchise had plans of a much more grandeur nature than first perceived occurs in the first sequel of 1999; such a film shedding its initial direct to DVD approaches to pose the question as to what will happen to Tom Hanks' Woody and the gang of toys whose adventures we adore to follow when Andy, their-then child owner, grows up; goes to college and even ventures off on his honeymoon. Therein was the moment, following a pretty harrowing sequence about a discarded toy with her own back-story, during which the franchise appeared to come of age and that some pretty serious, even philosophical, ideas revolving around what it is to exist as a toy and what one's purpose in existing is when the child owner outgrows you, are posed.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is the arriving at this point in that a 17 year old Andy, who's voiced by the original John Morris from the other two, is packing up and leaving for college; only, his room is being cleared out and certain items may or may not make the journey. ""Skateboard: college; little-league trophies: attic, apple-core: trash"" states his mother in a ruthlessly blunt and cut-throat manner highlighting the frank and obtuse reality of the situation the toys face. After some brief deliberation, they realise they'd settle for the attic – at least they've all got the Christmas decoration toys up there for company. But it is a mix up with certain bags containing certain items which are destined for certain places which acts as the film's catalyst for all things both joyous and tragic to unfold; Andy's toys of old in the form of Tim Allen's Buzz Lightyear and Joan Cusack's Jessie the Cowgirl along with Mr. Potato Head (Rickles); Hamm (Ratzenberger) and Slinky Dog (Clark, after Varney's passing) eventually seeing fit to deliver themselves to a local nursery so that they may be played with over and over by the tots. It is Woody and Woody alone whom knows they were never initially destined for the garbage.<br/><br/>What is captured and not shied away from at all is the apparent descent toward the inevitable; the film's sense of impending doom touched upon throughout, not least during the opening skit in which Woody's train-within-a-game goes over the edge of a destroyed bridge and we think the worst has happened, whereas, after this, the loss of fellow toys from previous films is touched upon instilling a sense of grief amidst proceedings. One scene early on out in the street sees the crushing of several trash bags in the back of a garbage truck, one of which we're initially led to believe contains Andy's toys, in what is another instance upon which the shocking inevitable has seemingly occurred and what the toys have striven to avoid all this time has become a harrowing reality.<br/><br/>The arriving at the day-care nursery simultaneously opens up several tins of several different kinds of worms; at once welcoming and perceived as a Utopian place for all toys to be continuously played with over and over, things quickly descend into a nightmarish Hell-like scenario in which totalitarian rule runs the show. What is refreshing is that in order to get away from the day-care centre, the film must call upon times of old in having the toys work as a group in order to figure out the best course of action; the joy being in the process they go through to help turn the tide back into their favour once again. Ned Beatty lends his hand at voicing the chief antagonist in large, purple, initially friendly soft toy bear Lotso who's anything other than your more one dimensional villain bent on nastiness but, in actual fact, is granted a back-story involving experiences upon which he bases both his stance and ideologies. The film finds that perfect pitch between happy and sad; a bittersweet tale, around which characters we've come to adorn, strive to avoid suffering only to face a a not-so-bright light at the end of the proverbial tunnel. It is a remarkable and gorgeously effective piece on a plateau with some of the best in animated films from recent years."

","""After all the hype for TOY STORY 3, it should give me an actual buzz and an actual woody."" --Bill Maher, REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER, June 2010 <br/><br/>Is it the best TOY STORY ever? Well, that's subjective as a pudding bear on Tuesday, but TOY STORY 3 is another plastic fantastic, wild child, great escape, life and death extravaganza that should thrill Bill Maher sufficiently.<br/><br/>In TOY STORY 2 (1999), Stinky Pete mocked Woody, ""Do you really think Andy is going to take you to college?"" TOY STORY 3 is that very plot line - Andy, now a teen, is headed for college (played by the same voice actor who played him as a boy, John Morris - it's been eleven years between sequels!). He packs Woody in his college bag (Stinky Pete was wrong!), putting all his other toys in a box bound for the attic. Through a mixup, Woody and the toys end up at Sunnyside Day Care Center for kids. <br/><br/>Kids who rend and rip and scream and crush kill destroy... you know, normal kids. <br/><br/>Upon first arriving at Sunnyside, Andy's toys are in Toy Nirvana. Lotso the strawberry-smelling huggy bear (voiced by Ned Beatty) welcomes them with a whole slew of new characters, including Ken (of Ken's Dream House fame, voiced by Michael Keaton.<br/><br/>Already suffering neglect issues, Andy's toys embrace Sunnyside's lifestyle of being common property playthings. Lotso tells them, ""If you have no owners you can never be outgrown, never neglected!"" (Ah yes, the Gene Simmons mantra against marriage.)<br/><br/>Best friends Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) are at odds on whether to stay at Sunnyside. Woody leaves to return to Andy, while the other toys stay - and discover not only the barbaric kids but that Lotso runs the Center like a mafia kingpin, a big doll-baby his muscle, Ken and some monster toys his enforcers. At night, Lotso imprisons Andy's toys (Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Blake Clark as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex Dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as Hamm) - and thus begins Woody's quest to rescue them. <br/><br/>Of course, the magic of every TOY STORY is not in its synopsis, but in the execution of the movie and the depth of its characters. And cuteness. Don't forget cuteness. <br/><br/>Kids will enjoy TOY STORY 3 because it's a great movie, but when they re-watch it ten years from now, they will bawl their eyes out - not only for the nostalgia, but for all the complex minutiae and emotional connections they missed as kids.<br/><br/> As he became Mrs. Nesbitt in TOY STORY, Buzz once again adopts another identity, when his switches are tampered with: Intergalactic Spanish Romancer. Buzz is all over Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack) like cheese on nachos, dancing with rose in teeth, sweeping her off her feet, and valiantly rescuing her from peril, all in the manner of Antonio Banderas at his mariachi man-best. <br/><br/> Woody falls in with a cute owner named Bonnie and her happy happy toys, including a dolly named Dolly, a unicorn, a triceratops and an echidna named Mr. Pricklepants (Timothy Dalton), intent on Shakespearean thespianism.<br/><br/> The perennial abandonment scene (which is sad, but not on the level of TOY STORY 2) features Lotso, doll-baby and Chuckles the Clown hitching a ride on the bumper of the Pizza Planet van. <br/><br/>Safe to say TOY STORY 3 contains the most poignant hammers of the trilogy: themes of abandonment, of age overtaking us all, of the passing of torches, of the wonder of youth, and leaving that wonder behind...<br/><br/>I promised myself I wouldn't cry. <br/><br/>Death comes calling. The most serious circumstance they have ever faced, as Woody, Buzz and the gang inexorably slide slowly towards an iron smelter. Unlike any threats before it, this death is unthinking, unyielding, unable to be reasoned with like a fierce dog or a bad kid, it is overwhelming. And as they struggle vainly against the relentless landslide of scrap metal, Buzz, with his arm around Jessie, looks around and sees Woody. His look is final. It says there is no way out. And wordlessly he stretches his hand toward Woody. Woody takes it. Woody looks to the Potato Heads holding each other. He reaches out to them. They hold his hand. As all the toys join hands, there is no sound, but the relentless scream of metal melting in the maw of the furnace. No words, no tears, only an abiding, crushing love between them. They are not toys any more. They are our friends. We've lived with them for over a decade; now we're going to die with them.<br/><br/>One deus ex machina later...<br/><br/>Though we thought we'd have to hold it in for the incinerator scene, the makers of TOY STORY 3 (director Lee Unkrich, writers Unkrich, John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Michael Arndt) save the best for last and hit us right in the heart with the final scene: Andy bequeathing his toys to shy, generous, tender Bonnie. Just before he drives off, he turns for one last look at his beloved playthings now in the care of Bonnie playing in her front yard, says softly, ""Thank you, guys."" <br/><br/>And thus do we fulfill Bill Maher's criteria: even if most of the movie is chase-action-rescue, the emotional wallops will leave you with that contact high headrush that all good movies aim for and few achieve."

","This was a marvelous sequel in the Toy Story series. It seems that Andy is all grown up now and off to college and no longer has any need for his toys.

They are now starting to feel left out, and after a misunderstanding by the mother, wind up in a ""retirement home for toys"" headed up by Lotso-well voiced by Ned Beatty. Things seem pleasant enough. Unfortunately, things aren't what they seem, especially Lotso. Woody escapes to be back with Andy, but then has to go back to get the other toys and rescue them. This is overall a terrific film and a worthy entry in a great Disney series. I recommend it to anyone who likes Disney films and computer generated movies.

","I missed this on its theatrical release but had the very great pleasure of watching it on DVD at home last night. There is talk that TS3 is a live contender for the overall movie Oscar and I wouldn't argue with that, because alongside Monsters (which won't win) The Kids are All Right, Let Me In and Social Network this is amongst the last year's best.<br/><br/>It's one of the most engaging, laugh out loud funny and deeply moving movies I've seen in a long time. It unashamedly goes for the heartstrings in the final act as Andy leaves home to go to his Freshman year at a US college. And that's what this film is all about, the loss of childhood and what that means to a young man as he comes of age. It's clear from the off that Andy has a degree of maturity that is not normal amongst late teenage boys. He is a sensitive and thoughtful soul who really will be missed by both his Mum and his sister. Dad is never seen, is this a modern day dysfunctional family or is he just always at work. In this respect perhaps it is Andy that has assumed the role of Patriarch and hence his maturity. It matters not because after the establishing of his departure and before the hugely emotional denouement we have a comedy classic full of slapstick, crazy chases and, unusually, a brilliant plot. The script sizzles and the acting (by the usual humans - you know them all by now) is universally brilliant. Having watched TS1 the day before I was impressed with the technical advances in the animation. Pixar just keep getting better. For instance human movement which was a bit out of sync in TS1 has been nailed in TS3.<br/><br/>Randy Newman has made the franchise his own with his bittersweet and mostly beautiful music. Perhaps the highlight in this instalment is Buzz Lightyear's fantastic Spanish rendition of ""You've got a friend."""
"Hitchcoc","10","0","1","5 January 2011"," Stunning Story and Animation
","It is a rare treat when an totally fictional creation has the ability to draw the kinds of emotions from one that these characters do. The whole chest of toys is here, each with its wonderful personality, its anxieties, its over-the-top confidence. The creators did not rush into a made for video throw away, but rather looked at the Toy Story mythos and put the characters into a world where they belonged, with the frailties created by the passage of time and different circumstances based on the human component. It is tightly plotted, tugging at our sentiments all the way. It is also uproariously funny. I would stack it against virtually any comedy being made today--a nice departure from the scatological, anything-for-a-laugh stuff that portends to be funny. Don't get me wrong. It's not a perfect film and I'm not dissing all work being done these days, but if this doesn't tug at the heartstrings, I don't know what will."

But it just kept getting better and better, and much of it was riotously funny.<br/><br/>It is also contains a remarkably ingenious plot. The central escape scenes are both a take-off of the prison camp escape genre and a really good example of it, with tons of clever ideas one after the other.<br/><br/>In spite of my early doubts, I think this is the best entry in the series, a movie that hits the mark in every way, down to a lovely and touching finale."

Both were ridiculously well done.<br/><br/>I'm unsure how Pixar continues to do it, but this movie is simply phenomenal. The humor and animation alone make the movie worth it. But the real kicker is how poignant and subtly deep the story line is. It's about the seasons of life and how we transition, but wrapped in this veil of being a ""kid's story"". That's the sheer brilliance of the film. People literally from 4 to 94 can enjoy this film and be moved by it in different ways.<br/><br/>A perfect end to the best American animation trilogy of all time.

","I watched ""Toy Story 3"" not long after the very disappointing, played out ""Shrek 4"" (sound like a football score) so my hopes weren't high and indeed, half an hour in thought that I was in for a marshmallowy cloying tale with no thrills drama or edge to it. I should have known better of course and even if said thrills drama and edge not unnaturally lacked something in terms of originality, still a satisfying conclusion was delivered with plenty of fun along the way.<br/><br/>Pixar has totally taken ownership of the Disney mantle of purveying animated features that appeal on a basic level to children and the child in adults, intuitively tapping into the latter's fading memories of our own childhoods, never more so in the opening scenes where the toys play out a fully-realised fantasy adventure in the mind of the child in the movie and by extension, the child in us before reality intrudes.<br/><br/>The rest is pretty formulaic with the customary themes of nostalgia, family ties and loyalty reworked, taking in neat comic vignettes on the whole Ken and Barbie relationship, just how destructive and anarchic a children's play-group can actually be and a homage to Latin lovers everywhere when Buzz's controls are reset to (Spanish) factory settings. As ever there are more than enough knowing lines inserted for grown-up consumption, my favourite hidden-away gem being John Ratzenberger's Cliff from ""Cheers"" retort of ""negatory"", but there are a fair sprinkling of other comedic nuggets, while the sequence of Ken modelling his entire wardrobe is surely destined for classic status.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie assumes a universality of remembrance for an American child's infant years which can never resonate wholly with everyone, but nevertheless ""Toy Story 3"" maintains the high standard of its predecessors with its winning combination of great animation, subtle characterisation, action adventure and that magic ingredient of childhood evocation to which we can surely all relate.<br/><br/>Can't see where a further sequel can arise however from the dead-end into which the writers have painted themselves, but I guess I thought that about James bond and Star. Trek too..."

","Andy is going off to college and what's left of his toys are afraid of ending up in the attic or worse; the garbage can. After a mix up with with a garbage bag Andy's toys find themselves being donated to Sunnyside Daycare.

All the characters look better than ever, backed by the consistently amazing voice work of the Toy Story series, and every scene pops with vibrant colors and and toys of all shapes and sizes. In addition to the numerous exciting action scenes, and there are plenty, the humor is another quality that elevates this from just another Pixar sequel. Yeah, some jokes are juvenile and go on too long but a majority of the comedy is amazingly mature and precisely and cleverly spoofs many cinematic cliché's.<br/><br/>Put looking past the fun and excitement of Toy Story 3 is a cleverly written script that deals with getting old, leaving your childhood behind and becoming unimportant to the people who matter to you the most. Though I find the final scene to be a bit sappy and overly drawn out it a touching and cutting analogy for growing up. What aspects of your childhood are left behind as you begin your journey to adulthood? Some part of us all yearns for the years when our lives were simple and our exuberant joy so easy to attain.<br/><br/>Whatever your age and cinematic preferences I believer you will find Toy Story 3 to be a thoroughly enjoyable and shockingly heartfelt adventure seen through a child's eyes.

"thetimegivenus","9","0","1","29 December 2010"," The Best Toy Story Yet!
","I've loved all the Toy Stories, but Toy Story 3 is far and away the best. It also happens to be one of the most enjoyable films I've seen all year. So, without any further ado: <br/><br/>The Story: Andy's no longer a little boy. He hasn't played with his toys in years and, while they're disappointed by this, they're still insistent that what's most important is that they are there for him.<br/><br/>Then they overhear him talking to his mom and find out that he's going to college and they are either going to the attic, the trash, or the daycare center. To cut a long story short, they end up at the daycare.<br/><br/>At first it seems like a nice place, but thing's change quickly. The daycare center is ruled by an evil bear called Lots-o and new toys are forced to stay in the Caterpillar Room, which is inhabited by the young and rough toddlers. The toys decide this is no place for them and declare ""We're bust'n 'outa here!"" <br/><br/>The Good: I always enjoy it when I come across a film with so much good in it that it's painful to write this section of my review. Where should I start and what should I cover? This film is packed full of good messages and themes. Themes of friendship, loyalty, duty, and much more. The toys are all extremely devoted to each other, agreeing that next to being there for Andy the most important thing in life is staying together. Throughout the film the toys will put themselves in harms way to save one another, and friendship is constantly portrayed as a very good thing.<br/><br/>The Bad: The thing I disliked the most about the film is the weak relationship that Barbie and Ken develop. While it is important to the film's plot, it is not a good example of true love and could have been handled better. Also, while I don't consider this bad, I do want to mention that throughout the film there are several tense and suspenseful moments which may be too much for some young children. There are also a few uses of slang language may be offensive to some audiences, but on the whole this is a very clean film.<br/><br/>Conclusion: While Toy Story 1 and Toy Story 2 were both enjoyable, Toy Story 3 is the best of the bunch. I'd have to say I agree with Dove Movie Reviews: ""This film was worth the wait!"""
"policy134","10","0","1","19 December 2010"," How do they top themselves every time?
","It's incredible. The good folks at Pixar have done it again and made what would have seemed impossible. Made a sequel, that tops both number one and two.<br/><br/>The question still remains: What good is a toy when there is no one to play with it? It was the recurring theme of both 1 and 2, but that would have been sort of boring to repeat, if the story didn't go in another way. It does and we get a great prison drama, adventure and even psychological thriller all thrown into one.<br/><br/>The original characters are still here, even Slinky Dog whose original actor, Jim Varney, sadly died. But I think they found a suitable replacement in Blake Clark. There were times when I couldn't even hear the difference in their voices. Along with them are tons and tons of new characters and every single one is unique. They are too numerous to mention, but Ned Beatty's Lotso certainly stands out. I would say, that it is one of his greatest achievements and the guy has hundreds of credits. Also, props to Michael Keaton. He is one of the most versatile actors and can go from lighthearted comedy to extremely serious drama in a heartbeat. Here he does both.<br/><br/>Speaking of drama, I was surprised how dark the back story of Lotso turned out to be. It's not for little kids but I doubt that it will disturb them. Still, it's nice to see that not all things of family entertainment have to be watered down.<br/><br/>And how about that Buzz Lightyear. If you have seen the movie, you will laugh your head off at what happens to him. It's as close as annoying, but still funny as you get, and it is funny.<br/><br/>You have to have a somewhat happy ending in a film like this but for once, it's a great one. It's strange to see something as realistic as this in an animated movie but it makes sense. Which proves that they don't just have great animators at Pixar, but also intelligent writers.<br/><br/>There are not that many movies that I will give top grades but this one is close to perfect."
"booklady400-1","7","0","1","4 December 2010"," Does not quite live up to the hype...
","As a true fan of the first Toy Story, but a reluctant foe of the second, I had a few doubts when I saw the Superbowl previews for Toy Story 3. First of all, why did they wait so long to continue the franchise? And what kind of a story could they pull out when Andy goes to college? (Spoilers are below, folks, just a heads up!) <br/><br/>I decided early on that I would wait it out until the movie was available to purchase and view at home. So, I watched as the world gasped in awe of this supposed masterpiece. As the months went by, I was more and more excited to finally see what all the hype was about.<br/><br/>Even after seeing it, I'm still not sure.<br/><br/>Okay, it had some deep themes. Nonetheless, I've always cared deeply for my own toys, so the whole idea of them all sticking together through fire and flames (literally) apparently didn't blow me away as much it did for others. The best part of the movie for me was the very end. We all saw a side of Andy that had been tucked away somewhere in his soul for God knows how long, and I teared up a bit. I wish more scenes in the movie would have portrayed as much raw emotion, of any emotion, as the end did.<br/><br/>I also loved the cinematography. Some of the best from Pixar I've seen yet. Oh, and the Barbie and Ken scenes made me laugh out LOUD.<br/><br/>My main issue was that I felt that there was something lacking in the main villain. Given, I am a HUGE fan of antagonists. Their stories often touch me more than those of the protagonists. I'm glad we was given a backstory, but I'm still a little confused as to why Lotso had to fulfill his need to become a dictator after he was replaced. Was he just born (or made, rather) that egotistical? Something didn't add up for me, even though I'm glad Pixar developed him as a psycho when Woody saved him and then still intended to kill him. I would have also liked to see more development as to HOW he transformed Sunnyside.<br/><br/>There wasn't much else that was outright WRONG with this movie. I just didn't see why people acted like it was the freaking Mona Lisa of animated films. I mean, nothing made it a bad movie at all. It was just... not quite reaching the next level of raw emotion. Pixar reached it with Wall-E and even Finding Nemo, but not quite with this. Heck, even How to Train Your Dragon was up there. Never thought I'd say it, but Dreamworks outshined Pixar this year.<br/><br/>So, I give it a 7/10 for beautifully executed cinematography, lovable characters, but with a villain and situation that lacked a certain gleam of pure evil and a bit of underdevelopment in some parts. I recommend at least renting it, but I would personally just rent it and leave it at that. When I watch it with my friends again soon maybe I'll like it better. That tends to happen with me for some reason lol."
"Samiam3","7","0","2","29 October 2010"," Great conclusion, NOT a great movie, but entertaining still
","Toys haven't come alive on the big screen in over ten years, which means that Toy Story 3 when it comes, comes with presentation, and promise, but is it a great movie.....no, just a good one.<br/><br/>The problem is not so much that the Disney/pixar crew fail to rejuvenate the life of their toys after ten years, the problem is that frankly, the movie doesn't feel all that clever. It is funny to be sure, but it falls into a couple of unprofessional traps.<br/><br/>The first problem is that Toy Story 3 feels unconvincingly plotted. Not only is it contrived but it doesn't feel like there is much story here. Andy is leaving for college, and plans to put all his toys away in the attic, but in a strange mix up, they end up in the garbage, and through another mix up, they end up in a day care centre full of destructive toddlers. They plan to escape, but it's not so easy, considering some of the larger toys led by a big Strawberry odoured bear, are running the place like a jail, and they DON'T like new toys.<br/><br/>Another problem in Toy Story 3, which is actually typical of a lot of Disney's recent works, is that the studio is no longer able to characterize villains. The likes of extravagant figures such as Jaffar, Scar, Cruella Deville, do not exist anymore. Disney villains today are all manufactured like Toys, equipped with nothing but a sour face, and a stupid motive. My one problem with WALL-E was that Auto (the villain) was arguably Disney's worst, but the Teddy here is a close second.<br/><br/>So if Toy Story 3 fails, then where does it succeed....well it's funny I'll say that much, not as funny as the second, but funny. Mr Potato head, finds a new body in a cucumber, Woody flies a kite (or rather the kite flies him) Buzz gets a reprogramming which allows him to tango romantically. Jesse was the only character who I don't think was given enough to do. Her primary function is to be a love interest for Buzz, but the plot doesn't ever choose to embrace that, so instead she is sort of left tangling by her pull string.<br/><br/>As a conclusion to a trilogy, Toy Story 3 works just fine I think. It uses a device that feels credible and heart warming, and to a degree thematically enriching. This movie is supposed to be about the coming of age, but the ending is where it really delivers this. What would have been better is if the whole movie could deliver it, Toy Story 3 feels a bit over rated. It's funny enough, but it's not enriching enough, and comes across as more a product designed with the intention of making as much money as possible rather than a movie into which some of cinema's best animators can put their heart and soul into. As a money maker, Toy Story certainly gets an A+ but as a movie, I can only give it a B, still worth seeing though."
"ghasl1","7","0","1","26 October 2010"," It's Almost perfect in every way except..
","I liked this whole movie throughout just about when buzz gets his companion Jesse, so what about Woody why no Bo Beep or at least have a new female companion its like watching the jocks get the girls and the friend sits on the sideline and gets nothing that's what made me sad. It's like the opposite of the Revenge of the Nerds.<br/><br/>I know most people were disappointed by this but I still liked it, it's not as good as Toy Story 1 and 2 because sometimes things are best left on there own I don't want to see several years later that Andy gets older and his dog probably has heartworms and probably dies in the next few months along with Andy's childhood.<br/><br/>At least it won't diminish the time we liked the prequels and how we liked Andy when he was young and the toys weren't thrown away or replaced with video games, unfortunately they were all given away or sold off to the garage sale in this movie but that's how it is."
"valadas","7","0","1","11 August 2010"," Again
","This movie is not better or worse than the other first two ones of the same puppet saga which means again that it's also good, a quality enhanced this time by the 3D version. The same technical perfection in animation, the originality, creativeness and inventiveness in the conception of characters and scenes, the great facial and body expressiveness of the former which confers them human features and a sentimental story of fraternity, friendship and tenderness (notwithstanding a few mean creatures precisely to strike the contrast). The visual effects are very impressive. A good movie to be seen both by children and grown-ups. Unfortunately I cannot give opinion about the voices of the actors and actresses that dubbed the puppets because I saw a Portuguese version talked in Portuguese."

It as good, had a few funny scenes, just didn't feel as great as #1 or the other pixar cartoons (WALL-E for example, which was pretty much perfect). I did think Ken was pretty funny, and the story overall was solid. The ending was excellent and made the whole movie worth watching. If nothing else, this should help kids think about recycling their toys before throwing them away! All of the characters had their good points and were enjoyable, the stories were good, and it is a recommended movie by me. I'm sure kids love it more."
"blackfirepro","7","0","1","27 July 2010"," The ""Return of the King"" of the ""Toy Story"" Saga
","After the commercial and cinematic success of their previous film Up, which was completely original, I was hoping for something unheard of, not just another installment in this toy saga. Why bother with this cast of characters we've already used twice? Why not do something new? I still hold to my opinion that they should have been original. But what they came up with was just as good. It's certainly more of a comedy than the previous two films, with much more action and fright than heart and intelligence. But, oh well! So there I was in the theater, hoping to God this wouldn't be a ""third"" movie. But then the opening scene started. It was fabulous. The opening and the closing scenes in the film are the best in the entire Toy Story saga. The opening scene takes place in the mind of Andy, the owner of the toys. He is of course, playing with them. It's a wild, crazy, fun scene that could actually be a film of its own. Anyway, the next montage is documenting the life of the toys and Andy as the boy grows up and eventually looses interest in his childhood friends. And when the montage ends, Andy is getting ready to go to college. His mother orders him to clean out his room before he leaves.<br/><br/>Through a series of unfortunate events (a near death experience in a garbage truck) the toys end up being donated to Sunnyside daycare. That's all of the plot I will divulge. But never mind all this, let's get to the review. I am officially declaring the masterminds behind the Pixar logo geniuses. Everything they turn out from their film factory is a sheer work of art. This is no different.<br/><br/>The look, style, feel, pacing, and general package of the film is such a nice little vignette. It's not complicated or overlong or indulgent in any way. It's colorful and bright and appealing. Of course I didn't see it in 3D. I feel sorry for those of you that did, because you didn't have the chance to see the amazing color palette of the film. 3D is proved to reduce the amount of light let into the eyes while watching a film. But us smart and lucky ones saw it in classic 2D, with all its glory and bright, vivid, attractive colors. Now I said before in this review that the film is much more of a Laurel and Hardy like comedy than a truly heartfelt story. Now this is true to some extent, but nevertheless the writers at Pixar have still managed to craft quite a descent emotional story. It follows that same formula of previous films. Packed with fun and comic relief, but still with a heart at its center (unlike the fool-ridden DreamWorks films such as Madagascar and Shrek). The main theme of this film is rejection. How do toys deal with being abandoned by their owners? More importantly, how do we (people) deal with rejection. The child's play room is a microcosm, with its own wars, struggles and triumphs. What we see on screen in this film is not just a bunch of weird talking toys trying to reach their previous owner, but a study of human behavior as illustrated within these plastic caricatures. This is how deep the film is. It seems very simple and unimportant on the outside, but once you take some time to read into its themes and messages, the viewer will realize the sheer wealth of what happens on screen. But what would be the good if I didn't comment on the less philosophical points of the film. Probably my favorite of the little comedic touches placed on the film is a blooming romance between Barbie and Ken (Michael Keaton). Ken of course lives in his dream house, and one day, while descending the elevator, he meets eyes with Barbie. It's just great. ""Nice ascot,"" comments the infatuated girl doll. And then Ken begins to show off his other outfits. It's just the perfect touch. It is little things like this that make Pixar films Pixar films. Then there are other little bits and pieces that exist for no other reason than to delight the audience. Now I have to say that the film could have done well to be a little less action packed. It's not excessive, but just a little too much if you ask me. Other than that miner point, Toy Story 3 is a very good, genuine film that fits into the series perfectly. Few sagas have managed to extend any amount of excellence into the third act. Possibly only The Godfather and The Lord of the Rings have managed this before. Thise may become one of these series. Each chapter as good or better than the one before. Now I have to say that Toy Story 3 is not the original. But it is a worthy follow-up. The Toy Story films will stand amid the great animated films (Snow White, Beauty and the Beast). Whether this third installment will be considered a great is iffy, but it certainly is worthy of the title Toy Story 3. Now all we (the viewers) can hope for is that there will be no fourth film. I know I sound silly, repeating what I said about this film after the second one. But this film ties up everything so nicely, with no loose ends at all. It is a fitting ending to a series, and I hope Pixar will see this and not endeavor to do more with the franchise. Hopefully they will continue doing original films, not sequels. Nevertheless, this is a very true and genuine film that should not be missed by anybody. It may not be the original, or as good as Up and Finding Nemo, but it is worthy of the Pixar logo at the beginning.<br/><br/>www.colewebbharter.com"

","I always believe that ""Toy Story"" in 1995 was the first brick of Pixar's grandiose castle. 15 years go by, Pixar becomes more stronger and creative, not just in technology innovation but also for the story. Now, for carrying their important icon in ""Toy Story 3"", of course they will bring out the best of them. Two earlier prequels include ""Toy Story 2"" in 1999 was directed by John Lasseter. But for thiz reunion, the Director is replaced by Lee Unkrich, the former Co-Director from ""Monster, Inc."" (2001) and my favorite Pixar of all-time ""Finding Nemo"" (2003). It tells 17-year-old Andy will go to the college soon, now all his beloved toys are in jeopardy. They face a dilemma which is the toys will be given away to charity or being dump in attic. The familiar characters almost share in equal proportion, whether the cowboys Woody (Tom Hanks) and Jessie (Joan Cusack), the space ranger Buzz (Tim Allen), the fussy Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, the dumb dinosaur Rex, the follower Slinky Dog, the pinky piggy Hamm and three little green Aliens, plus introducing new foe, strawberry-scented huggin' bear called Lotso with his vicious gang. In overall, thiz movie is filled with well-arranged story and fun dialogue. From the opening scene, the adventure already rolls with explosive action scenes. The story-telling is very fast, there is almost no breathing room. I almost think that thiz movie is just similar to the prequels before. But something more happens, the ending shocks me. The power of thiz movie is definitely on its 15 minutes of ending (Spoiler Alert!), when Andy passes all his toys to neighbor's kid, Bonnie. He introduces one by one his toys and plays with her. That heartwarming scene is so touching. The ending has made thiz toys a winner.

","I have seen several movies that Pixar has made, and have liked every single one of them. Toy Story 3 is no exception.<br/><br/>The story begins quite a while after Toy Story 2. Andy is now a teenager and is preparing to attend college. Woody, Buzz and the gang have been kept in the toy box, no longer getting the attention that they once did. With Andy leaving the house shortly, that is not about to change.<br/><br/>Since Andy is no longer going to be living at home, a decision must be made about the toys. Other than Woody, the group gets put into a trash bag, with the intention that they shall be stored in the attic. As for Woody, he will be going to college with Andy.<br/><br/>The bag containing the other toys accidentally gets sent to the curb, where the trash truck is headed. They escape and make it to the family car. Woody joins them, trying to explain to them that they were not meant to go into the trash. The toys do not believe that, and decide it's time to move on. In the middle of this argument, Andy's mom gets into the car and heads to the Sunnyside Daycare Center.<br/><br/>After arriving at Sunnyside, the gang is greeted by the building's resident toys. The leader is Lots-O-Huggin Bear (Lotso for short), a very friendly toy. He tells the newcomers how fun Sunnyside is. Each day, the several kids who attend play with the toys nonstop. It's several hours of playtime. Buzz, Jessie, Hamm, and the others love it. After what happened with Andy, this is perfect. Woody is not content, of course. Andy is his kid, and that's all there is to it. Will the group split? Will Sunnyside become their permanent home? Is Andy going to miss them? The voice acting is great as always. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are just right as Woody and Buzz, respectively. Ned Beatty's voice is somewhat unrecognizable as Lotso. Every actor and actress is well cast.<br/><br/>The movie has its share of funny dialogue and the sight gags are terrific. There are also references to the film's predecessors that fans of the trilogy will enjoy. I must comment on one of the new characters. That would be Ken, and he has many funny moments throughout Toy Story 3, such as when he meets Barbie, and when he models clothes for Barbie. You get a good laugh there. You'll also laugh when Buzz becomes Spanish Buzz. It leads to some great moments.<br/><br/>Once again, Pixar delivers good entertainment. The studio really stands out at a time when movies seem to just be remakes of something else. Pixar is really about quality. Anyone can enjoy Toy Story 3. It is perfect for families. Make this one the next family movie."

","I wasn't so impressed by the two previous series before. But then it's Pixar and it's Toy Story, the final. After watching in 2D, I must say that this movie is really great. The movie follows the toys planning a move out because Andy is going to college, but it all stared with a misunderstanding between the toys. When they though they have come to a better place that's when the hell started. The comedy is still there although the seriousness is more added. The screenplay maybe is not very great like other Pixar's movies this time. But the heart is still there or maybe more that Toy Story 1 and 2. The action is genius and in the end I promise you that you will cry or maybe shedding tears maybe because the fact this movie is ended or maybe because of the final scene that you'll see. Worth it!"
"ABiasedEye","9","0","1","19 June 2010"," Childhood Revisted and Contemplated
","I just got back from seeing Toy Story 3. It's the kind of movie that, honestly, I could type an entire five page thesis on. Inside and out, I had an absolutely wonderful time revisiting characters that, by this point, had become like old friends to me.<br/><br/>There are some movies that you just have to admit that your passion for it might be founded completely on bias. I remember my infatuation with Buzz Lightyear as a kid. I remember when Buzz tried to fly out the window but ended up crashing down on Sid's floor. I remember Jessie singing about the days when she used to be loved. Most importantly, I remember that moment at the end of Toy Story 2 when Woody realizes that his place is with the boy that he loves. The first two films, as a whole, are probably some of the most important film memories from my childhood.<br/><br/>So coming into Toy Story 3, my expectations were sky-high. It isn't quite as daringly original as some of Pixar's most recent accomplishments (Wall-E, Up, and 'That Rat Movie That I Won't Bother Spelling come to mind), but it doesn't have to be. This is, hopefully, the final curtain for beloved characters that almost every child from my generation has grown up with. It concludes a series of films that together form the best film trilogy this side of The Lord of the Rings. That's no small feat, especially for a bunch of animated pieces of plastic.<br/><br/>There's a few hiccups in the narrative from time to time. Occasionally the story felt a little too 'gag heavy' than I would have liked, but this is in the spirit of the original films. Part of what makes Toy Story work so well is that it's able to balance heavy-handed sentimentality with childlike wit and warmth. Some folks could easily walk into this and not pick up on some of the more 'indepth' threads. It functions as both a 'wistful action comedy' and an 'analysis on mortality and aging'.<br/><br/>The film's climax is one of the best Pixar has ever pulled off. The entire series comes together in such a bittersweet and satisfying way that it's hard not to shed at least a couple of tears. It's hard to believe that, after all these years, Pixar hasn't managed to lose their touch.<br/><br/>I reconnected with my childhood in those last several moments. I really can't ask for anything more than that.<br/><br/>It certainly isn't perfect, and there's certainly elements that have been liberally rehashed from the original installments, but Pixar has managed to make the first real animated trilogy. Something to cherish, love, and share with the next generation.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Heart melting. Tears flowing. Wallet eagerly waiting to be emptied for another ticket."

I cried (yes, many tears were shed by the end of the movie).<br/><br/>My 10 year old daughter loved it to.<br/><br/>With reviews, I don't like to talk to much about the plot - I think the less one knows the better one can enjoy it.<br/><br/>There were lots of new characters, though for my money Ken was the highlight!! Every scene he was in (especially with Barbie) was just too much! It was brilliantly plotted with very, very funny dialog. enough 'in jokes' that only adults would get (the great escape?), so everyone in the family can enjoy it.<br/><br/>Not too many films one can take the family to see..

Of course, eventually Pixar will put out a bad movie (at least bad by their high standards), but I was confident that this wouldn't be it. ""Toy Story"" is the franchise, and more importantly it's John Lasseter's baby, and John Lasseter would not have allowed a bad ""Toy Story"" film to be made.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes or so, as the gang's current situation was being explained, had me fighting back sobs (I was far from the only one in the theater struggling so), and in the last 20 minutes (from the ""circle of hands"" moment until the end of the movie), I stopped fighting. But the hour in the middle left me kind of...""Well, OK, I guess we HAVE to have a plot."" There were plenty of good moments during that hour, but the whole struck me as somewhat recycled: the ""Do we trust Woody or not?"" moments were too reminiscent of the first movie, and the early arguments about whether they owed it to Andy to escape from the Day Care center were too similar to the ones in ""TS2"" (even though the speakers were reversed). Lotso's backstory wasn't nearly as powerful as Jesse's song about Emily in ""2"", and I think Lotso would have been MORE compelling as an adversary if he were MORE tragic.<br/><br/>Again, though, it started strong and ended PERFECTLY, and whatever I felt was weak about the middle I can easily overlook.<br/><br/>Those who've said that the movie might not really be appropriate for younger kids have a point, I think, but while it could perhaps be argued that the movie should have carried a PG rather than G rating, I wouldn't for the world have wanted Pixar to tone it down to make it kid-safe. Yeah, if your 5 year-old loves the first two films from watching them at home, it might still be a good idea to wait a few years before exposing him/her to this one. Despite leaving the door open for ""Toy Story 4: A New Beginning"", this is a movie about endings. It's about change and loss and saying goodbye, and this shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody because these seeds were sewn in the previous chapter.<br/><br/>I said earlier that it's inevitable that Pixar will eventually make a bad movie, but when they do I hope they fail by trying something too different, rather than by playing it too safe. I'd love to see Pixar make a movie that's DELIBERATELY not intended for children. As it stands, the name ""Pixar"" means both ""You know it's going to be good"" and ""Bring the kids."" But there are things they could be doing with digital film-making other than making ""Family-Friendly"" entertainment. You know, something like ""Avatar"", maybe, except GOOD. Disney established Touchstone as a separate imprint so they could put out movies that were too ""adult"" for the Disney signature. I'd like to see them try some things that would be more appropriate for ""Touchstone/Pixar"" than ""Disney/Pixar."""

","Toy Story 3 is a great addition to the Toy Story franchise but it is far from perfect.<br/><br/>It's a bit on the long side and the story noticeably drags through the first half while slowly building up to its climax. There are some very funny moments interspersed but in general the opening acts of the film are very, very dark. In the preview I saw, Toy Story 3 scared the young children sitting in our row on two occasions.<br/><br/>Once the action starts in the second half with our hero Woody as the necessary savior, the excitement builds at a frantic pace, there are a lot more laughs, and while the plot is unoriginal and the conflict cliché, it is still well written and engaging. There are a couple of hilarious scenes of note involving Buzz Lightyear dancing and one in particular with Mr. Potato Head. Funniest parts of the movie (you'll know when you see them to avoid spoilers).<br/><br/>One of the feats of the first two movies was the emotional attachment to the characters during the movie and unfortunately, it is almost non-existent until the end of the movie. The most emotional scenes in the first acts involve the back story of the new characters and they also are some of the best looking scenes in the movie. However, the last few scenes more than made up for this and while it didn't need to 'save' the movie, it greatly added to the experience and my overall opinion of Toy Story 3. It really is expertly done.<br/><br/>The 3-D is there, it is well done and one can tell it is in 3-D but it doesn't really add anything substantive to the movie. It's a similar manner to the way Toy Story 1 and 2 were redesigned.<br/><br/>It is difficult to evaluate a movie having seen the other 2 repeatedly. As a stand alone movie, it's very good, but not quite great. As an addendum to the first two Toy Story's, I don't think it's quite up to the first one on the basis that it's not groundbreaking. I still feel the first is the best of the trilogy to date but this is still a solid movie and well worth watching with a friend (young or old) or with your family."

","Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) are back. It's been 11 years but these toys have aged well while owner Andy has matured. Receiving little playtime, and with Andy leaving home for college, the toys find themselves sent to Sunnyside daycare. Despite the name, things are not quite as they appear—forcing the gang to reunite with Andy.<br/><br/>I haven't seen Toy Story in about 15 years, and I haven't seen Toy Story 2, but director Lee Unkrich and Pixar guru John Lasseter start everything off in a friendly manner that will please series fans as well as new viewers. This is great news for families with little ones in the target demographic who likely weren't even born at the time of Toy Story 2's release. <br/><br/>Even if you've been keeping up with the series it is evident that Pixar's team has come a long ways with CGI animation. Old characters like Woody retain the same artistic style we are accustomed to seeing. When he comes across a furry monkey playing cymbals, you have to do a double take. Another scene of photo-realism has some of the toys in a garbage bag. If you didn't know any better, you'd swear there was a creature squirming around inside a garbage bag before your very eyes.<br/><br/>A big part of the fun is in how Pixar always finds a creative use for the toys, giving each a brief moment in the spot light. The See n' Say is put to use like a roulette table. Mr. Potato Head steals the show when his parts seek out a new body. There is also a surprising cameo from Studio Ghibli mascot, the Totoro. It's not that surprising considering that Disney has North American distribution rights to their films.<br/><br/>This time around there are a lot of shots of people. Since Andy's relationship with the toys is a big part of the story, this makes sense. My gripe is that with all the people on screen we lose focus on seeing the world from the view of the toys. In Toy Story, leaving out the humans was a practicality; they were tough to render and didn't look very appealing. By cropping them out as much as possible, the movie focuses on the story of toys. Now that Pixar artists can do anything they imagine, they unfortunately overlooked the narrative style that the original mastered. Granted, the movie is largely told from the perspective of Woody and sometimes Buzz or another figurine, but the human faces chip away at the obstacles toys face in a world made by humans. Environments are no longer daunting.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 is the first in the series to be displayed in 3D. By now you've either figured out that you are paying extra to see the same movie, or you are getting a headache.<br/><br/>Still, there's something about the toys that troubles me. Almost every toy has the capacity to talk, even if they weren't built with sound capability. That's fine but how come the dinosaur talks like a grown American male while the horse is reduced to whimpering like a dog? Also, the first film established that the toys can move in the presence of people, yet even when in the most dire of circumstances they still opt to go limp. These movies show an imaginary side of our lives that only exists if we don't look for it, so it's still believable that the toys have a sacred pact to not come alive in our midst. <br/><br/>Toy Story 3 doesn't quite reach the emotional roller-coaster levels of other recent Disney/Pixar films, possibly because of its lighter subject matter. However, the inherent nostalgia value of the toys creates vast appeal. Toy Story 3 is a worthy successor that retains the cross generational humor of the original and effectively wraps up the series. A third installment can't ask for much more."

","Hamm the Piggy Bank: ""C'mon. Let's go see how much we're going for on eBay."" <br/><br/>Pixar can't seem to make a bad animation. Toy Story 3 has all the stunning visuals of its ground-breaking first story 15 years ago, but now it seems dedicated to developing character and crafting first-rate dialogue (see above), and I'm saying that without considering the deft use of 3-D, which doesn't distract yet seems to lend richness, like its characters.<br/><br/>Toy Story 3 boasts the returning voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as Woody and Buzz, who, with other famous toys like Jessie, the Potato Heads, Rex, Ken, and Barbie, are abandoned to day care while Andy goes to college. Empty nesters will identify with the sense of loss for the toys, constant partners of Andy. Andy's mother also suffers the empty nest.<br/><br/>This is another Pixar winner, and it's very good."
