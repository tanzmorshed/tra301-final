"MR_Heraclius","10","48","51","15 February 2020"," Best animated movies ever made
","This film is possibly one of the best animated films of all time as it tells an emotional moving story while being funny. As I said the emotion in this film is full of heart and even though I didn't cry it will make most people cry. The characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is also given development, even more than some superhero films nowadays. Also this film has comedy some Pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. So overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get, it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect. This film in my opinion is the best Pixar film."

","If there's a list of great computer animation movies of all time, Pixar would dominate most of the top positions. Great story, great voice talent, great timing, great for all ages. It'd be hard to pick just one above another and perhaps another viewing of Up may be in order to figure out where I'd place it among so much stellar work.<br/><br/>Up is by far the most emotional human drama of any Pixar movies thus far, very heavy, so much so if you're looking for pure fun with some jaw-dropping chase and/or thematic scenes and no downer moments, Up may not be for you. I saw it in a packed theatre of about a 65% adult, 35% adult split audience and it's the only time I can remember being in ANY animated movie where there was sniffles and watery eyes, and that was within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There's an undercurrent of life after losing a loved one in this movie, which I don't feel gives anything away. It's pretty heavy subject matter, Pixar handles it, like they do everything they touch, incredibly well, but it doesn't make it any less sad to have the material threaded throughout much of the movie you're reminded of it, but I suppose it's up to one's own interpretation of loss and how to place it in your life that perhaps will have an emotional effect on you.<br/><br/>Story is what makes a great movie great. Without story, you don't really have anything, maybe some effects, some action, maybe some cute or clever sight gags, maybe some laughs, hopefully some emotion, where Pixar shines above all others in animation and over a good 99% of the movies out there is they can intertwine it all and do it seemingly effortless, which is an incredible feat. To do this in a few movies is one thing, but Pixar has pretty much nailed this now for their entire career of making movies, that's just simply unprecedented. <br/><br/>I should note I saw the 3D version which, to be honest, didn't really take the movie to the next level. One of the more well known syndicated reviewers had said you're better off seeing the non-3D version on screen, and I actually agree. The 3D glasses added little to nothing to the movie except for an eye-strain headache later in the night. It didn't take away from Up mind you, it just didn't add to it either. <br/><br/>Up is a great movie either way you slice it and it should be noted, the theatre I saw it in gave it a fairly loud round of applause at the end. It's pretty rare these days that an audience applauds after a movie, perhaps we as a society has become too jaded, or too just expecting of the goods or feeling we're entitled to the entertainment. It's nice when a movie hits on all cylinders and elicits such a range and emotional reaction people who don't know each other in a packed room all gasp, laugh, cry, and applaud together. Great movies however can do that and Up is truly a great movie."
"choco_taco","10","381","471","12 May 2009"," Pixar hits it out of the park, again
","I was lucky enough to get a ticket to a special pre-release screening of Up at Pixar studios in Emeryville, organized by the San Francisco Film Society. After a hour-long reception in the atrium of their beautiful main building we went through some rigorous security (metal detectors!) and were treated to an hilarious short (Partly Cloudy) and Pixar's new high water mark, Up.<br/><br/>My favorites to date have definitely been Wall-E and the Incredibles, and Up is another slightly-left-of-center masterpiece. The emotional impact of the beautiful, wordless summation of Carl's life that opens the movie is the bass note that resonates through the whole film and is at least as affecting as the scene in Wall-E when he holds his own hands while watching Hello Dolly. The rest of the movie, of course, is breathtaking on just about every level, especially the tactile quality of all the characters and textures and the completely realized weather effects and action scenes. With no ""new"" technical milestones (fur in Monsters, Inc., water in Finding Nemo, realistic camera effects in Wall- E), the design is the main focus, from the hilariously stylized characters to the amazing setting of the tepui.<br/><br/>As the associate producer who participated in the Q&A following the movie pointed out, the past three Pixar movies have not been easy sells to their parent company Disney (they'll be back in familiar territory with Toy Story 3 and Cars 2), but Pixar's commitment to inventive, story-driven films continues to pay off here. All of the good press is true, and I can't wait to see it again. Thanks for staying true to yourselves Pixar!"
"x-xbecky_nashx-x","10","94","113","7 August 2010"," I felt like a completely new person, truly moving
","Honestly, I found the DVD of this film in my house and decided to give it a watch as I had nothing better to do. Truth is I really should have made the time before.<br/><br/>Although I enjoy all the other Disney/pixar movies, I am at that teenage age where I mainly seek Violence, sex and gore. Thankfully my teenage boredom did me a big favour in helping what this fantastic masterpiece. This film was so fantastically deep, meaningful and moving beyond relief, as soon as I switched it off I rang my grandparents to tell them I love them.<br/><br/>It should be made necessary that everyone everywhere should see this film and I think the world would be a much better place - it really is that good.<br/><br/>100/10"
"guiarRK","10","626","805","15 May 2009"," Possibly the best Pixar film to date.
","I was luckily able to catch a screening a few weeks ago here in Houston.<br/><br/>As an avid lover of Wall-E, I felt Pixar could never reach those heights again.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>UP's story will probably seem peculiar at first glance. An old man as a protagonist? It definitely blew my expectations. The first 5 minutes demolished every other Pixar feature just because it was the first time I cried in a theater.<br/><br/>This just shows how much heart there is to the movie. I really don't want to get into specifics because of spoilers but the movie literally has everything.<br/><br/>Amazing visual effects.<br/><br/>Amazing sound.<br/><br/>Hilarious comedy.<br/><br/>Breath taking action.<br/><br/>Heart.<br/><br/>All those combined equal something special. Today's movies like to blow you away with gimmicks, Pixar is different. Each movie shows soul and UP definitely has it.<br/><br/>I can't wait until it comes out so I can see it in 3d, im bringing everybody.<br/><br/>10/10"
"DonFishies","10","301","382","29 May 2009"," Imaginative, fun and moving - as close to perfect as Pixar has ever been
","Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone – young ""wilderness explorer"" Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.<br/><br/>The fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.<br/><br/>Coming off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.<br/><br/>What makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a ""bird"" named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story – the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl's backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.<br/><br/>But the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun – something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up's favour.<br/><br/>But of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl's facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).<br/><br/>I cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.<br/><br/>10/10."
"steve-bailey-1","10","342","436","27 May 2009"," Drag me to heaven
","UP, Pixar's latest animated feature, is just delightful. But how do you go about extolling the movie's virtues without giving away its surprises? Like the kid at the beginning of the movie, you don't try to conquer the immovable force; you work around it.<br/><br/>The one clue I can give away – because it's the movie's heavily hyped premise – is that Carl Fredrickson, a gruffy old widower (voiced with gruffy old charm by Ed Asner), miraculously inflates enough balloons to use his house as an aircraft. Soon, he finds himself reluctantly sharing his ride with a short-attention-spanned kid named Russell.<br/><br/>I'll also mention a couple of other items that can gauge your potential interest in the movie. One is a gag that is a take-off on a famous painting – perhaps too inside of an inside joke, but typical of Pixar's cheery attempts to appeal to viewers of all ages.<br/><br/>Also, part of the plot involves Carl's long-held wish to meet a Lindbergh-type adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer!). This is another in-joke that's even vaguer than the first one. Cartoon historians know that Walt Disney started in the cartoon biz by creating Oswald the Rabbit for producer Charles Mintz, who then greedily stole the rights to Disney's creation. This gives you a pretty good idea where the ostensible hero Muntz stands in the scheme of things.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I can only offer you some enticing clues about the characters. There's a dog who's the leader of his pack and in menacing beyond measure, until he opens his mouth and gets one of the movie's biggest laughs. There's a huge, awkward bird that is a big laugh-getter at first. Then she becomes a real enough character that – at least in the audience I was in – when she's injured, she elicits screams of fright worthy of Bambi's late mother.<br/><br/>There's surprising, heartfelt emotion, vivid imagery (you can almost touch the landscapes and skies), and a music score by Michael Giacchino that's practically a character in the movie – particularly in a thoughtful montage that takes Carl from childhood to widowhood.<br/><br/>There aren't many (or at least not enough) live-action movies that are engrossing as this cartoon. Pixar Studios has gotten to be one of those movie icons that shouldn't even have to deliver a premise to get funded anymore. The moneymen should just shut up, hand over the money, and trust they'll get a product that will appeal to everyone.<br/><br/>UP is only the second Pixar feature to get a PG rating, only for mildly intense imagery and action – nothing off-color in the least. Again, if you can handle ""Bambi,"" this film should be a breeze."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","57","75","22 November 2009"," Another Feast For The Eyes
","This is another film in which it really helps to know in advance what it is, or more specifically, what it isn't. Then, you go from there. I enjoyed the animated film very much but, some of that was due to the fact a friend clued me in first, saying ""this isn't really a comedy or a film for little kids. Don't expect a ton of laughs."" So, instead of seeking laughs (although I still got them here and there), I just enjoyed the adventure story and marveled at the amazing artwork. <br/><br/>Seen on Blu-Ray, this is yet another example in which you shake your head and wonder, ""How does the artwork get any better than this?"" Then, about six months from now, another will come along and I'll say the same thing. Overall movies may not be better today than ""in the old days,"" but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation. This is another example of that.<br/><br/>The colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning. I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes. From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny/<br/><br/>Back to the story, I found it a combination adventure-fantasy-comedy-suspense-sentimental story, about in that order, too. Generally-speaking, I would think adults would like this more than kids, but I may be wrong. Everyone - regardless of age - will have their jaw drop more than once viewing the incredible-looking scenes. It's really a feast for the eyes. Finally, if you like extras, there are tons of them in the four-disc DVD set."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","115","160","4 June 2009"," Up ""uped"" the bar once again! Wonderful movie
","Seriously, I'm convinced, Pixar is maybe the only movie studio that is providing the best movies around. Who said that animated films can't be considered real movies? Can't be considered an art form? Up is the latest creation from Disney and Pixar, after last year's smash hit WALL-E, I felt like they couldn't at all top themselves and they did it again with this incredibly charming story. Admittingly from the trailer, I wasn't sure this story was going to work as well, but I got the opportunity to see Up this week and was just totally blown away by it's story, animation and characters. The thing I adore about these movies that Disney and Pixar are creating is that they're not just for the kids, but the adults as well, this is something that I could even see an adult seeing by themselves. This story doesn't insult kid's intelligence and is extremely entertaining for anyone to enjoy, to go through this adventure with an old man who just wanted to make his wife happy.<br/><br/>Carl Fredricksen, a quiet young boy, meets Ellie in her clubhouse, discovering together they share the same interest in exploration as their hero, famed explorer Charles F. Muntz. Ellie expresses her desire to move her clubhouse to Paradise Falls in South America, a promise she makes Carl keep. Carl and Ellie fall in love, wed and grow old together in the old house where they first met. Ellie dies of old age before they can take their trip, leaving Carl living alone in their home. After a tussle with a construction worker over Carl's broken mailbox, the court orders Carl to move into a retirement home. Carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to Ellie, and creates a makeshift airship using thousands of helium balloons which lift his house off its foundation. Russell, a Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge, has stowed away on the porch after being sent on a snipe hunt by Carl the day before. After a storm throws them around for a while, they find themselves across a large ravine facing Paradise Falls. With their body weight providing ballast allowing Carl and Russell to pull the floating house, the two begin to walk around the ravine. As they walk towards Paradise Falls, Russell finds a colorful tropical bird which he names Kevin, not realizing that the bird is actually female. They later run into a dog with a translating collar named Dug. They discover Dug's owner is Charles Muntz, who has remained in South America for several decades to find a bird like Kevin in order to restore his reputation after bringing back a skeleton and being called a fraud. Though Carl is initially thrilled to meet his hero, when he realizes that Muntz is after Kevin and will kill to obtain her, Carl takes steps to save the bird and escape from Muntz.<br/><br/>Up is seriously the best movie I have seen so far this year, it's actually one of my favorite movies of all time, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this film. Wither it was the fun and charming story between Carl and Russell, the crazy bird Kevin, or the story that nearly killed me in laughter, the dogs that have collars that make them talk. I don't remember the last time a movie that made me laugh so hard that my stomach hurt, it also made me tear up and smile. If someone ever tells you that an animated film can't be considered a real movie, just show them Up. I absolutely adore this movie, can't wait for it to come out on DVD and watch it again. This is a perfect family film, actually scratch that, it's a perfect film, the animation is incredible, the characters are lovable and the story is magical. Up is going to be a film to be remembered for all time, great movie, go see it.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Another crackling collaboration of Pixar and Disney, and as expected, it is touching, funny, thrilling and amazing to look at and watch. Only a step below Toy Story just because it is not quite as ground-breaking, though the story is even better.<br/><br/>While I love technology and effects, I am first and foremost a story guy when it comes to movies. This has as good of story as any film you will see. My only caution is that it seems geared towards grown-ups, not kids. The montage of Carl and Ellie growing old together is without dialogue and will probably bore some kids. Their parents certainly won't be bored; however, as it will resonate with most anyone over age 40 who hasn't taken the time to chase their childhood dreams.<br/><br/>No question, this film is a barrage of color and eccentric characters, and can even be a bit frightening at times. Still, the key to this one are the stories and quests of the elderly Mr. Fredrickson and the young Russell, trying to earn his badge of honor. From the beginning, Disney has always had a finger on the pulse of youngsters. Here, we aren't given the usual Hollywood garbage of brainiac kids who make the adults look stupid. Instead we are given a pudgy, slightly goofy kid just trying to get his parents to take note.<br/><br/>Special kudos to Ed Asner for bringing Mr. Fredrickson to life ... in good times and bad. He never goes overboard and is quite often absolutely perfect. Christopher Plummer has a limited role as bad guy Charles Muntz. Or is he really so bad? Cast aside by society, he has spent his life searching for redemption.<br/><br/>I am not saying the kids won't enjoy, but I am saying make sure parents and grandparents tag along. You will be entertained, delighted and moved."
"Simonster","Null","190","273","13 May 2009"," Pixar do it again! Up soars to new heights!
","Viewed at the Festival de Cannes 2009 <br/><br/>The opening film of this year's festival, and the first animated film ever to have this honour, Up is truly a film for all ages. The story of the adventures of an old man and a young boy, a flying house tethered to countless balloons, a long-lost (and mad) explorer, a giant bird called Kevin and assorted 'talking' dogs gets funnier and more exciting as it goes along.<br/><br/>This isn't slapstick humour, although there are some lovely visual gags, but deeper, more thoughtful. At times Up is even touching and poignant.<br/><br/>Visually, this is a treat and while I was sceptical about the use of 3D to begin with, it is built into the story so seamlessly that it really is worth the effort to seek it out. At the same time, I can't help feeling the 2D version could be even better because the 3D glasses had the effect of dimming the picture. The use of colour in the film is especially noteworthy, with various palettes used according to mood, character and phase of the story. Character voicing and music are also spot on.<br/><br/>I have no connection with Pixar, Disney or the film whatsoever, even if this review reads like a puff piece. The fact is, Up is an incredible piece of cinema, was a big hit with a very demanding press audience, and is worthy of your time and money.<br/><br/>Anyone who says animated films cannot amuse and entertain, while at the same time delivering any kind of emotion, does not know what they are talking about.<br/><br/>Up is so good I can now forgive Pixar for Cars!"
"Apemangalore","9","182","268","29 May 2009"," One of the finest films I've ever seen
","If Pixar - as a studio - has any weakness, it's that they have no idea how to make a bad film. Again and again they release entertaining movies with not only a terrific sense of humor, but a level of storytelling that has set a standard for today's films, animated or otherwise. While I was obviously extremely excited to see Up, never did I expect it - or, to be honest, anything else from this year - to reach the level of quality of this year's first animated film, Coraline (which, along with last year's Bolt and Wall-E, became one of my favorite films of all time). Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Simply put, Up is a perfect movie.<br/><br/>Easily the most emotionally impactful portion of the entire film, the first ten to fifteen minutes of Up are nothing short of beautiful. Using little to no dialogue, the opening ""montage"" of this film tells the story of Carl and his wife Ellie, and the wonderful life that they share together. Carl is such a lovable character, that you feel for him from the very beginning. Without trying to come off as cliché or anything, you feel the joy that he feels, and when his wife passes away, you feel his loss. By the end of the whole sequence, I was in tears.<br/><br/>This movie is freakin' hilarious. Without a doubt the funniest film that Pixar has ever made, each and every character in Up provides their own bit of humor. Dug the dog (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson) is especially hilarious every single time that he ""opens his mouth"", and yet still proves to be a key part of this emotional roller coaster ride. The movie also does a terrific job at making you feel a sense of wonder, and you just buy into the adventure of these two characters. Finally, I want to give a special nod to Christopher Plummer as the famous wilderness explorer, Charles Muntz, who is easily my favorite Pixar villain.<br/><br/>I love Up. Go see it now, as my review just can't do it justice. Not only is it extremely entertaining, but also gut-bustingly hilarious, and beautifully told throughout. To quote John Campea of TheMovieBlog.com, ""The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that it ended."" The result is a film that's on par with Wall-E and The Incredibles as my favorite Pixar movie to date (which, again, is saying a hell of a lot, considering that they're two of my top 10 favorite films of all time) and while it may take a couple more viewings to say for certain, I have no qualms with saying that Up is one of the finest films I've ever seen."
"michael11391","10","165","258","21 May 2009"," Pixar launches their funniest film out of their tank to date.
","What can I say about Pixar? Amazing?? Perfect?? Got to see this at the Cannes Film Festival in France (went on a trip with my family) and Pixar gives us another instant classic: Up.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on 78-year old man Carl Fredrickson's (voiced by Edward Asner) life who always had a dream of going on a journey to South American to see the wilds of it. He buys thousands of balloons just to attach it to his house to float up in the sky. So, he starts with his journey up in the sky in his house with balloons attached to it. Suddenly, he's not alone and somebody's at the door while flying, it's a boy scout kid named Russell. He invites the boy with him on his journey to South America.<br/><br/>Just brilliant and simple story-telling, beautiful visuals as usual with Pixar, awesome voice work, funny and smart dialogue, beautiful score once again by Michael Giacchino & very, very enjoyable characters. Speaking of characters, the highlight of the film: Dug the Dog. A sort of ""robot"" dog that will have you have you in a lot of stitches each scene that dog is in and that was the case with me. Simply, one of the funniest characters Pixar ever made. Pete Doctor, one of the four Pixar directors (John Lassester, Andrew Stanton, Brad Bird) who directed Monster's Inc (2001) needs and should get nominated for his clever, genius and smart directing of this but if Stanton didn't get the nods for (Finding Nemo and WALL-E) and Bird for (The Incredibles & Ratatouille) which they should of been, then the Oscars are making another HUGE mistake for not nominating this guy for this movie.<br/><br/>Up is the funniest Pixar movie, funnier than the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life & Finding Nemo which were the funniest, in my opinion. The movie is not just hilarious, it's emotional and sad at times. Like WALL-E, it focuses on the character feelings but not as magical as WALL-E. Still, Up is full of emotional, fun and hilarious proportions. Your in for a BIG ride in this!! 10/10."

","""Up"" is a winner, and I couldn't be less surprised. Anyone still putting a limit on how new and inventive they think a Pixar film can be deserves to have their socks blown off. For the rest of us, just buy a ticket and expect to be taken away. This new flick is the work of writers/directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two guys who have each been around the making of Pixar flicks before. Docter was a director on ""Monsters Inc"", a writer on ""Toy Story"" and a co-writer and director on ""Wall*E."" Peterson was a writer on ""Finding Nemo"". Both know the guidelines for success and while ""Up"" doesn't reach the heights of say a ""Wall*E"" or a ""Toy Story"", it's still a fantastic movie because, well, I don't think the people Pixar hires know how to make anything other than fantastic movies.<br/><br/>This one is about Carl Fredericksen (Edward Asner), a 78-year old retired balloon salesman living alone in a house full of old memories. Carl and his wife Ellie met each other as young children, both enamored by the newsreels about adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). They eventually married and planned on seeing the world together, especially Paradise Falls in South America, but life kept getting in the way and before he knew it, Ellie died.<br/><br/>As the world changes, Carl refuses to change with it. When developers threaten to move him out of his house and into a retirement home, the old codger rigs his house up with thousands of balloons and before you can say ""way to go Carl"", he floats away, determined to have the adventure he and his wife never had. He doesn't plan on taking 8-year old chubby wilderness explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai) with him or crash landing on the other side of Paradise Falls, or finding an exotic female snipe (that Russell names Kevin) or a group of talking dogs (one named Dug befriends them) tracking down the bird for Muntz, who it turns out is a sinister villain, but things kinda turn out that way.<br/><br/>You're grabbed instantly. The adorable opening montage of the Carl and Ellie love story is more endearing and moving in its dialogue-less 10-minute entirety than any other romance this year by a long shot. This is another Pixar flick that goes in a daring direction. We next see Carl as a heartbreaking old man, his wife dead and the world no longer needing him. You forgive him his bitterness and you love him for the sentimental streak he has towards the things he and his wife shared together. His crabbiness is a little funny but there are also some heavy scenes early on as well. It sets up a beautiful, multi-layered story about enduring love and learning to live life without limits.<br/><br/>When a thrilling rainstorm crashes Carl and Russell on the other side of Paradise Falls, the two must each harness themselves to the house floating above them. The characters each look terrific and share a good chemistry. Russell is the usual 8-year old kid, talkative, inquisitive, and annoyingly overeager. He is a good comic foil to crabby Carl, his big, rosey smile and plump round stature a counter to the stout, frowningly square-faced Carl. As the two spend more time together, a wonderfully written friendship develops.<br/><br/>The movie is full of visual gags and the talking dog-henchmen are great fun. Muntz, an adventurer who travels around the world in a big blimp, offers a menacingly evil villain to chase Carl and Russell through rough mountainous terrain before the exciting final house vs. blimp in-air showdown. Plus the movie looks fantastic, a lush array of candy color and grand scenery. And the vocal cast, from Edward Asner to Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai each deftly voice their roles. ""Up"" is one of the year's rare treasures, a movie that flies in every way possible and from Pixar, you shouldn't expect anything less."
"CA_movie_fan","10","63","107","12 May 2009"," Pixar produces another Oscar Winner
","Pixar has become the most dependable studio out there for producing reliable films that don't simply continue to raise the bar in animation but set a level of excellence in storytelling that puts most live-action movies to shame. 'Up' represents another change in style, as significant as Wall-E's shift to photorealism, intricate camera effects and darker themes. It effectively blends moments of tragedy with almost slapstick humor, while showing that their understanding of story structure and pacing gets more refined with every release.<br/><br/>Up is about a 70-something ex-balloon salesman who fulfills a lifelong dream of adventure by tying thousands of balloons to his house and flying away to South America. This trip, inspired by his adventure- loving wife who dies before their dream is realized, is forced when property developers attempt a compulsory purchase on his house and try to move him to a retirement home (issues of death and eminent domain in a cartoon?). The problem is that he has an enthusiastic - and fatherless - 8-year old Wildness Explorer stowed away on the property when it takes off. Their adventure focuses on the characters they meet along the way, while our hero Carl is still trying to drag his house to the dream destination at the top of a waterfall.<br/><br/>The opening shows the life of Carl, growing from an young boy, meeting his adventuring-loving girlfriend, their marriage and her death just before their adventure starts - it's an incredibly emotional 5-minute intro that's light on dialog and heavy on visuals, and didn't leave a dry eye in the theater. This sequence in particular was reminiscent of the dialog-free sections of Wall-E which deliver their plot punches without exposition or the need for endless sequences that would take twice as long in live action. But this approach doesn't leave the younger audience behind either, and for such a dark start, all I could see in the audience were kids and adults alike glued to the screen.<br/><br/>I won't give away any more plot details since the film doesn't open for another three weeks, but every scene and character trait is meticulously plotted so that nothing seems too ridiculous or contrived, even for such a fantastic journey. The graphic stylization is also fresh, in the same way that The Incredibles had a very distinct and authentic look. All of this serves to heighten the humor and there are some extremely funny scenes, helped by the way the characters are quickly and believably established (even the talking dogs, but you'll see what I mean).<br/><br/>This is the second time I've been to Pixar to see a pre-release of a movie and I felt a little scared before seeing this one, wondering if their run of first-class work may have hit a plateau. On the surface, I didn't really think a story about a senior in a flying house could live up to Wall-E, yet although the films are as different as they can be, Up is as gripping and entertaining as any Pixar film. Their ability to blends styles and take the audience from laughter to tears in minutes showcases their deep understanding of story, and it's a shame that more films aren't crafted the same way.<br/><br/>Up opens on May 29, and I highly recommend it to everyone. The next two films out of Pixar will be Toy Story 3 (2010) and Cars 2 (2011). By the way, look at for a very funny short film before Up called Partly Cloudly."
"Craig_McPherson","10","30","50","30 May 2009"," Up-lifting, Up-standing, Up-pealing, and quite simply - brilliant!
","Sadly, there aren't enough superlatives in the English language with which to laud Up, the latest offering from the folks at Disney/Pixar. This is quite simply the best movie of any genre to emerge thus far this year. No small praise considering how I've long been adverse to ""kids movies"", pegging them as being shallow, vapid, and simplistic - a personal preconception which Pixar mercifully shattered with 2004's The Incredibles and 2008's WALL-E, which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that for all their acclaim as an animation studio, they are equally brilliant story tellers Up tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner), who as a child meets Ellie, later to become the love of his life. Carl and Ellie find they share a common dream – to one day visit Paradise Falls, a mysterious tropical oasis in South America made famous in vintage newsreels chronicling the exploits of explorer/adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Life, however, manages to get in the way as the two grow up, get married, experience the pain of miscarriage, and eventually grow old, so much so that father time catches up on Ellie, leaving Carl a widower. All of this is conveyed with little dialog in a masterful sequence that had the audience, old and young alike, sniffling throughout.<br/><br/>If you're thinking this isn't the usual stuff you see in ""kids movies"" you're right. But all credit is due to Pixar and the directorial and writing team of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson for realizing that children aren't idiots, and can handle complex, often tragic stories, if conveyed in the proper manner. It's a refreshing change from the over-protective mentality that once saw all hints of violence edited out of Warner Bros/Looney Tunes cartoons.<br/><br/>In Up, characters bleed, there's implied murder, and it's all counter-balanced with some of the most delightfully twisted humor that's as inspired as anything the Zucker brothers ever came up with. The story literally had me careening from being misty-eyed to laughing heartily, frequently in the span of minutes.<br/><br/>Faced with forced relocation to a retirement home, Carl opts for one final gambit, to fly his house down to Paradise Falls with the aid of a multitude of helium-filled balloons affixed to the roof of his house. Along for the ride is Russell (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Scout seeking to add a merit badge to his collection. Eventually the duo are complimented by Dug (voiced by co-director and writer Bob Peterson) a dopey derelict dog equipped by the now aged Muntz with a translator collar that converts dog thoughts to English.<br/><br/>Like WALL-E, Up manages to imbue its characters with depth and humanity, while at the same time tell a story that is mature, delightful, and most of all, terrifically funny. In an era when Hollywood seems only capable of re-boots and do-overs, Up is not merely a refreshing stroke of original brilliance, it is likely the best movie you will see all year.... or until Pixar emerges with their next effort."
"solacewaves","7","11","16","7 September 2009"," The greatest journeys UP are when you're most down
","In terms of animated features, Pixar ventures where very few other animated films have gone before and that is to delve into the lives of the elderly generation. In fact, having any film (animated or not) examine what it is like to grow old and the roller coaster ride that is life would normally mean you are in for some heavy material indeed. This is because true depictions of life are not constantly joyful and grand, it is always hand in hand with tears and hardships. In this respect, Pixar are to be applauded to have dared create a ""kids"" film that explores the circle of life in all its vivid glory and personal heartache.<br/><br/>Those who have scored UP poorly have undoubtedly felt misled, disappointed or even cheated because oftentimes when one thinks of Pixar, one thinks of imaginative explorations of what it would be like if our toys were alive (Toy Story 1 and 2), or if cars could talk (Cars), or if a mouse wanted to be a gourmet chef (Ratatouille), or how a family attempts to be ""normal"" when they all have superpowers (The Incredibles). Previous Pixar stories have always reached the realms of ""brilliant"" because these imaginative explorations are balanced with plot depth, humor and characters which audiences connect to and cheer for. Whether it's an ant trying to show his colony that they should stand up to the grasshoppers (A Bug's Life) or a humble cleaning robot guiding humanity home and trying to find love (Wall-E), all Pixar films are both fantastical and deeply meaningful thus showing their movies are more than just eye candy.<br/><br/>And this is where UP has divided the people. Don't get me wrong, UP has the fantastical and the deeply meaningful in spades, the difference here is that Pixar explores these to the extreme.<br/><br/>Flying a house to South America using thousands of balloons, dogs with futuristic collars that allow them to translate their ""dog"" language into English (or any other human language) and lest not forget they can also cook, a mythical rainbow colored bird and an old man who uses a walking stick in the first half of the film but can do ""Indiana Jones""-like feats in the second half of the film - Fantastical? CHECK.<br/><br/>Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they marry, they discover they can't have children, they grow old together, wife dies, old man lives alone in house which he calls by his wife's name while high rise buildings are being constructed around him, old man attempts to fulfill promise to his deceased wife by flying to South America taking the house with him, and all that doesn't even cover the background story of the boy scout (who's father has left him and now only lives with his mum) who tries to help the old man out - Deeply meaningful? CHECK.<br/><br/>The daring exploration by Pixar of both these fantastical and meaningful themes has resulted in a beautiful, at times humorous, oftentimes heart-wrenching and flawed (but not necessarily in a bad way) film.<br/><br/>Never before has Pixar challenged the audience to such a level. Are you able to suspend belief to the point where you can believe a house can be lifted off by thousands of helium filled kids balloons and yet at the same time be willing to invest in an old man (who himself is flawed in more ways than one) and experience both the pain of love lost and the goal of hope found? Will parents be willing to explain to their young children about life and death? Will kids understand the adult themes? Will adults enjoy the ride or will they feel the movie is too depressing and the events too unbelievable? These are the questions which Pixar has dared audiences to confront.<br/><br/>As for me, I enjoyed the film, I laughed during the bits where you're meant to laugh, and I was moved to tears during the bits where you were meant to be moved (especially the beginning which shows the fast forward life of old man Carl). I struggled at times with suspending my belief of the events in the second half; how both Carl and Russell (the boy scout) manage to do the physically astounding is not to be thought about in depth. All in all, a brave film by Pixar that doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of brilliance but if looked at from above has many lessons to be learned and perhaps, just perhaps examines the flaws in all of us (especially as we get older) and how we should all try to reach UP to greater heights."

","Up is wonderful and well written story that is very well animated for its time. It stands out from other movies not only due to its animation technology but through the uses of character archetypes. Along some ingenious planning throughout the movie which will certainly grip you on your seat for the whole time. Each part of the story fits together seamlessly and as directed by Pete Docter who has shown potential in the past with Monster.Inc. It is no surprise that Up would not have been better. Easter Eggs are bound to be found as this is just another part of the Pixar and Disney family. It ended very gracefully with a happy ending for the two main and primary characters that lies within the movie. I am very glad that I had spent my time and money to watch this exquisite animation.

I also teared up from an emotional, tender scene with Carl and Ellie.<br/><br/>The animation breathtaking, extremely funny and quirky too. It didn't pander to children i.e a kiddy movie, but made sure it entertained 'kids' of all ages.<br/><br/>I actually wondered if the writers of this movie got together one night for pizza and beers and penned out this movie whilst a little intoxicated.

"colinrgeorge","7","5","7","6 April 2010"," ""Up""
","""Up"" may be more emotionally charged than previous Pixar efforts, though almost exclusively in its first act, and is nevertheless a step down in storytelling for the company that last year brought us ""Wall-E"" and before that ""Ratatouille."" ""Up"" suffers in comparison to those films, and happily resigns itself from 'good Pixar' to regular good.<br/><br/>The story follows reluctant protagonist Carl Fredrickson, a 78-year old balloon salesman, who along with his now-departed wife, always dreamt of flying to adventure in Paradise Falls, South America. During a moving, poignant montage of his life, it becomes clear that the opportunity for adventure is passing the couple by. So when the widower Carl is sued and his home threatened, he takes the opportunity to take off, the house held afloat by thousands upon thousands of colorful balloons for the adventure he never had. All goes according to plan until he discovers Russell, an overeager ""wilderness explorer,"" has stowed away beneath his porch.<br/><br/>The second act is the film's weakest, and the adventure advertised boils down to a few paltry miles. After a brief storm sequence, the unlikely pair find themselves on the other side of the canyon, but nevertheless ""three days"" from Paradise Falls. With the floating home strapped to their backs, Carl and Russell begin their trek, only to be sidetracked by the obligatory supporting characters, amusing though they may be: ""Kevin"" a fictional female dodo-like bird with hilarious favoritism, and ""Doug"" a golden retriever with a dog-to-English translation collar.<br/><br/>Where the film finds itself in trouble is in keeping the established themes at the forefront of the story when the arbitrary sequence of events in the second act unfold. The villain, Carl's childhood idol (which makes this guy how old?), a disgraced adventurer by the name of Charles Muntz, is the perfect match as a man who's been corrupted by his dreams, but he's never developed to a satisfying level and receives relatively little screen time.<br/><br/>Muntz's minions are a wellspring of only occasionally successful gags, an armada of translation-collared dogs tasked with hunting down Carl, Russell, and most importantly, Kevin. Their presence in the film feels somewhat random, and not quite funny enough to justify. It's becoming an ironically dirty word in reference to Pixar's work, but it all feels a little too cartoony.<br/><br/>The visuals are as strong as the best Pixar has offered, though shot composition gives everything a sort of flat feel to it (a problem perhaps 3-D was meant to rectify), with characters seldom moving on more than one plane, leaving the environments feeling oddly like stage backdrops.<br/><br/>""Up"" is sadly Pixar's last original film until 2013, but with its glaring screenplay problems, it may be for the best that the studio recharge its creative cannons. After ten feature films, nine completely original, it's hard to leverage complaints against ""Up"" greater than that it simply isn't their best work. It may not be the revelation that ""Ratatouille"" or ""Wall-E"" were, but middle of the road Pixar is still worth the price of admission."
"gerbinator2009","10","9","15","4 June 2009"," UP-lifting
","The negative reviews for this are horrible. The story was not too sad. It was like life is for old people. Their spouse dies, and they live by themselves. That, however, did not happen to Carl Fredrickson. He meets a lively adventurous little boy, and has a fantastic, exciting, and yes perilous adventure in the place of his childhood dreams. This adventure is in the loving memory of his wife, and although he starts out thinking the little boy is an annoyance, they become almost family by the end of the story. This is not a sad story. It is about a lonely old man, and a boy from a broken family making an unlikely and meaningful friendship. <br/><br/>If anyone, says this story is too sad, I point to the ending. Was it sad? No. People compare this to the masterpiece of Wall-E which I think was equally if not more sad. Earth is an inhospitable wasteland, mankind turns into lazy useless blobs. Only at the end of that story is it happy and hopeful, which is the same for UP. UP is an UPlifting masterpiece about hope, friendship, adventure, and love."

","Pixar has its first truly Disney project. <br/><br/>It has all the hallmarks of the Pixal manual: it is obsessed with exploring the third dimension and it has an extremely refined engineering of story. It touches on thoroughly conventional family values in a slightly new way. And it has a strangely relevant short that precedes it.<br/><br/>In this case, the three dimensional explorations that Pixar mastered are rendered in visual three D because Disney's corporate strategy requires it. Its a massive shame. That's because of the unintuitive fact that of all the exploration and innovation that Pixar has done has to do with novelties of the projection into a 2-d screen with a frame. The frame , usually constrained by the physics of the camera, has a broader physics in Pixar-land. But to get audiences to ""read"" the 3D, these extended physics are taken away and what we have is ordinary camera movement and framing.<br/><br/>I may have a different experience when I see this in 2D, but I think not. All the cinematic fun, the adventure of the Pixar spirit, is missing here.<br/><br/>The one thing that is outside the normal Pixar range is the color palette. It much richer here than usual. I think that may have also to do with Disney strategies for dealing with technology threats.<br/><br/>The child here is Asian. That's also a market driven decision.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"tieman64","Null","16","32","7 November 2009"," Bring Back Brad Bird
","The Walt Disney company released a series of somewhat ""groundbreaking"" animated films between 1937 and 1942 (""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Bambi"", ""Dumbo"" etc). Thereafter it degenerated into a purveyor of a formulaic, predictable and increasingly saccharine features. Over the decades it became nothing less than a cultural force, plucking stories from countries all over the world and then skewing them until they fit the ""Disney formula"". Eventually Disney seemed to have stopped making animated films altogether. Each new release was simply an addition to some already existent, homogeneous, ""Disney Land"". This is a land of fairy tales, princes and princesses, wicked stepmothers, dead parents, song and dance numbers, bumbling sidekicks, lots of anthropomorphic charm, the ubiquitous fear of separation and punishment, and some pretty despicable values relating to gender, monarchs and class. Eventually it got to the point where it didn't matter what Disney's films were about. All that mattered were that they conformed to the rules of ""Disney Land"". The stories, the characters, the customer expectations, the brand awareness, all coalesced to form a kind of bland corporate mission statement.<br/><br/>Gradually the company began to shamelessly use its commitment to ""wholesome"" entertainment to market an endless array of toys, gadgets and clothes to children. It all seemed quite innocuous, but beneath Disney's self-proclaimed role as an icon of culture, lies a powerful educational apparatus that provides ideologically loaded fantasies for children and adults alike. Fantasy, for Disney, has no basis in reality, no sense of real conflicts, struggles, motivations or social relations. Instead, ""fantasy"" becomes a marketing device, a form of hype rooted solely in the logic of self-interest and buying. <br/><br/>In the early 1990s, Disney received praise for films like ""The Lion King"" and ""Beauty and The Beast"". The studio had re-found its form, some said. By the time Pixar Studios had established itself as a brand in the late 90s, however, Disney had once again lost its cool factor. Burnt by poor box-office returns, the company started making sequels to its more popular animations and began releasing them solely on DVD or TV. Much later they'd begin gobbling up outside mega-franchises (Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars etc).<br/><br/>Pixar's evolution very much mirrors Disney's. After a string of somewhat revolutionary films, and Brad Bird's two fairly personal features, Pixar has begun a slow spiral into mediocrity, ""Cars"", ""WALL-E"" and ""Up"" representing the company on a downward slope.<br/><br/>""Up"" is about an elderly man and young boy who travel to South America and have a series of adventures. It's a consistently funny film, but virtually every character here is contrived and understood entirely in one dimensional terms. An old man lost his wife, a wife lost her child, a young boy lost his father, a talking dog is bullied by other dogs, a giant bird is separated from its offspring...every single character seems cynically designed or calibrated to quickly illicit unearned sentiment. <br/><br/>Pixar's last film, ""WALL-E"", was no different, death (there are about 4 death scenes in that film), loneliness and loss rolled out like Pavlovian commands. See, ""WALL-E"" is dead, why not shed a tear? See, the old man lost his wife, why not weep? Of course Pixar's films have always been sentimental, but they were sentimental in subtler or original ways. Think the smile which ends ""Monster's Inc"", the food critic's flashback at the end of ""Rattatoille"" or the brief shot of unhatched eggs in ""Finding Nemo"".<br/><br/>Ignoring Pixar's emotional regression, its plots have also become increasingly generic. ""Up"" in particular feels like a cocktail of bits and pieces plucked from ""Ice Age 3"", ""The House of Small Cubes"", ""The Red Balloon"", ""Fitzcarraldo"", ""King Kong"" etc. For a film which features an airship called ""The Spirit of Adventure"", the film is strangely cowardly, content to trade in stock characters and lazy chase scenes. Elsewhere the film champions adventure with one hand whilst exalting the return to Norman Rockwellesque normalcy; everyday life, we learn, is adventure enough. And those who go off on mighty exhibitions go insane anyway. This is very much the Pixar formula. Pixar's characters live in a small world, discover a bigger world outside of their familiar surroundings, and then retreat quickly back to the box. <br/><br/>Beyond all this, ""Up"" is Pixar's attempt to outright mimic Hayao Miyazaki (the director of ""Up"" directed the English voice dubs of Miyazaki's ""Howl's Moving Castle"", another film with old people in a moving house). Pixar/Disney chief John Lasseter has often cited Miyazaki as a key influence on Pixar, but Miyazaki's films have a subtlety and sense of auteurism that these latest Pixar offerings lack. Observe, for example, the gorgeous flying scenes in ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Nausica"", ""Castle In the Sky"" and ""Porcco Rosso"". In comparison, the ""flying"" scenes in ""Up"" are strangely inert. While previous Pixar films have exploited space to great effect, ""Up"" is awash with flat compositions and ordinary camera work.<br/><br/>Still, the film has some good moments, most of them occurring in ""Up's"" first half. Here we're treated to several clever visuals, jokes and powerful montages, some of which seem cribbed from Kunio Kato's ""The House of Small Cubes"" and Michael Apted's ""Up"", the latter a noteworthy documentary series which chronicles the lives of several human beings, from cradle to grave. It's all very sad.<br/><br/>7.9/10 - Worth one viewing. See ""From Up on Poppy Hill"", ""The Girl who Leapt through Time"" and ""The King of Pigs""."

I slightly recalled the situation of Walt Kowalski, performed by Clint Eastwood in ""Gran Torino"". The annoying Russell is responsible for most of the funniest sequences, especially those with Kevin and the talking dog Doug. There are many details and layers in this beautifully sad tale. Further, it is also impressive how Disney and Pixar succeed in releasing one excellent movie after another like ""Wall-e"" or ""The Incredibles"".

"thewittyman-1","10","14","28","16 May 2009"," Up: A roller-coaster of emotion and technical wizardry
","Coming off last year's hit Wall-E, Pixar attempts to sweep the hearts (and pockets) of moviegoers with Up. I had the privilege of seeing the film in Philadelphia two weeks before its release. Since Wall-E is in my personal top ten, I couldn't contain my excitement for the excitement Pixar had in store. But I was a bit worried that the premise of a man and his flying home couldn't translate into a feature. So is Up a worthy addition to Pixar's critically acclaimed catalogue?<br/><br/>Well, just take a wild guess.<br/><br/>Up revolves around 78 year old balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen, who has kept adventure alongside his childhood love Ellie. Meeting as pipsqueaks, the pair shared a lust for escapism and eventually married. Together they had this fantasy of going to Paradise Falls, an elusive world in South America where many wonders lay. But through a somber montage, we see things fall apart and pass away, leaving Carl alone in the house the two rebuilt through their lives.<br/><br/>I should mention that Up has many sad (yet endearing) moments, for Carl deals with emotional loss while trying to rekindle his flame of adventure. After the aforementioned montage, one audience member burst into audible tears; I admittedly had to fight some back as well. When you see Carl wishing to be alone and personifying Ellie through their home, you can't help but feel (insert sad adjective).<br/><br/>But alas! This *is* a Pixar film, after all. As Carl begins his journey through the skies, we're soon treated to blissful wonder, pure excitement, cunning suspense, and, of course, laughable humor. Pixar is the master of manipulating emotions, and a roller-coaster's worth is packed into 96 minutes.<br/><br/>While resting in his buoyant home, Carl receives an unwelcomed addition to his adventure: 8 year old Russell, a Wilderness Explorer (i.e. Boy Scout) who helps Carl for an aiding the elderly merit badge. I originally thought the chipper chubbster would be annoying, catering mainly to the younger audience. However, Russell provides comical relief and has surprising emotional depth.<br/><br/>As the characters' journey continues, we discover the pair is more alike than the 70 year difference would suggest. Along their way we meet a rare (and hungry) bird with a sense of humor, dogs who can talk, and many other surprises that I won't spoil. I honestly wasn't bored at all; even during the slower parts Pixar gives us much to admire.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, Up looks AMAZING. While I didn't see it in 3-D, the 2-D version has plenty to marvel at. Instead of going for realism a la Wall-E, Up tries a more stylized look a la The Incrediblesand succeeds marvelously. I love Carl's squarish head, the vibrant colors, the miniscule details, everything. As a technology junkie, wondering about the programming and rendering used to make the film made my head spin. Things like the scripted physics behind Carl's balloons or the global light reflecting off Russell's chocolate bar were enough to give me a nerdgasm.<br/><br/>The sound is fantastic as well. Again, Pixar gives us a great original theme which is mostly played on piano. It's sparse in emotional parts, loud and boisterous in action scenes. Edward Asner does an exceptional job voicing Mr. Fredricksen. All the technical aspects are what we've come to expect from Pixarwhich basically means they're perfect.<br/><br/>However, I don't think Up is perfect overall. Granted, this is a film about a man who attaches balloons to his house and flies away, but there were moments that made me question certain choices or actions despite Up's fantastical setting. Furthermore, the central villain was a bit weak (not on a moral scale, though) and quickly came into play with little buildup. Though these seem a bit nitpicky, I was brought of the film at a few points and questioned certain things after the movie finished.<br/><br/>Yet these complaints aren't deterring me from jumping on line and putting on 3-D glasses when Up is released. While it's no Wall-E in my book, Up is a film that will take your emotions up, up, and away. It's about loss, love, and realizing the destination isn't what necessarily matters; the adventure getting there is sometimes the most important thing. So take a seat beside me when Up is releasedbut could you get me some tissues this time? Oh, and while you're over there, you might as well grab that Oscar too.<br/><br/>9.2 / 10, rounded up for Pixar's hard work through 10 films"
"MartinHafer","10","10","19","29 May 2009"," A delight...plus it's in 3-D!!
","As I am much more hesitant to give a movie a score of 10 than most reviewers, take my score of 9 as a ringing endorsement for this sweet CGI film from Pixar. In addition, the film is the first 3-D film by the studio and it looked lovely.<br/><br/>The film begins with a sweet but VERY emotionally draining prologue. You see Carl Fredricksen as a very young boy along with his first two loves--the adventures of the explorer, Charles Muntz, and his meeting and falling in love with Ellie. All this is done with a minimum of dialog and it is one of the sweetest segments I've seen in years--and is a first for something this deep and emotional from a computer generated film. Keep a few Kleenex nearby--you'll likely need it.<br/><br/>Then, the film jumps ahead to the present day. Carl is now elderly and alone. His life is quite sad and he dwells on the recent loss of Ellie. Fortunately, the film doesn't dwell on this too long or become maudlin--though it did come a bit close at times. Now, with nothing in his life other than memories AND the court pushing him into a retirement home against his will, Carl comes up with a crazy plan--to float his home away with a bazillion balloons and take it to South America!! Unfortunately, while the plan works, Carl also gets an unwelcome passenger (Russell). Now Russell is an absolutely adorable character--wonderfully rendered and with a fittingly cute voice. You cannot help but love him. But, since Carl is alone and childless and grumpy, he is less than enthralled with this hitchhiker.<br/><br/>Eventually, they arrive in South America and meet some new friends--a bizarre giant bird and Dug, the dog. But, being a family film, you KNOW that there must be some villain and sure enough, along comes a very, very, very elderly Muntz who seems a tad...""touched"". This sets off some very hair-raising adventures and you'll just need to tune it to see what happens next.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, this film was incredible and shows that the same old software is NOT being used but a newer generation with greater clarity and richness. I loved how through the course of the film, for instance, Carl's beard stubble starts to slowly grow in as well as the lovely shading and colors. While I loved RATATOUILLE and WALL-E for their animation, this looked a lot better--plus came in 3-D. I just saw Dreamworks' latest film the week before (MONSTERS VS. ALIENS) and frankly UP looked immensely better--there was just no comparison.<br/><br/>As for the story, it was highly imaginative and strange--in a good way. I can only think of one other film that is like UP at all, and that is the wonderful French live action film, LE PAPILLON. It, too, is about an elderly single man who has an adorable child dumped in his lap and like UP, by the end of the film the old man has essentially been adopted by the kid. Both are rather predictable in that sense, but both also make it work due to brilliant writing, adorable kids and plot elements that are very unique and magical. Heck, in UP, the many dogs in the film can talk AND are excellent chefs--where have you ever seen that before?! <br/><br/>Overall, it's a great film for almost all ages. I did notice in the theater that one kid (about 4) got very, very, very upset when the cute bird was captured--and he screamed and cried for some time. Keep this in mind if you do take young kids to see it--it may elicit come tears though there is no dirty language and the violence is mostly mild. For Pixar, this is among their best."

","Once again, I shouldn't have trusted that preview, or it might have been that the short before ""Up"" was so wonderful, or was it that the mostly silent introduction to our main character was nothing short of glorious... somewhere, though, this film lost its ability to touch in the way other Pixar and animated features have done in the past.<br/><br/>""Up"" is supposedly about achieving our dreams, discovering who we really are, learning to adapt to the changes life brings to us, and so many other themes that it is a wonder we even recognize them, as the film changes from an intimate portrayal of two lonely people to a rather hectic adventure that barely rises above average.<br/><br/>The animation is, of course, superb, and the vocal work by all the people involved is first-rate. Problems arise when we notice than other than the amazing prologue, most of the good stuff has already been show in the preview. The other sections don't quite muster enough emotional power to make us care. For instance, the vistas aren't impressive, the set action pieces near the end don't carry much wallop, and it's hard to have a movie that lacks. The film just feels like some non-threatening film that is paying tribute to movies that had originality and the right tone. I couldn't help wondering what people like Spielberg and Zemeckis could have done with this movie, and the echoes of ""Wall-e"" kept haunting me, as I remembered the lyricism of that movie that made us remember what it is like to be human in the middle of all these choking technology. ""Up"" doesn't quite take you up for the ride, or make you feel ""up"". There is no cathartic moment, no real payoff, and the best moments are the sentimental moments when pictures of their loving relationship is on the screen.<br/><br/>Marketing can do wonders, and this will be a huge moneymaker. Hopefully it will only receive the credit it really deserves, and audiences will be wiser so next, we enjoy something beyond a small, sweet film that couldn't quite give us what we expected."
"ken1848","7","14","29","8 August 2009"," Move Thee Reviews: Up Lets Me Down
","Up is a funny adventure with very well rendered and well animated 3D images. It delivers a message that we, irrespective of age, should never forget about dreams and are able to lead meaningful lives. It also sheds some light on the importance of letting go.<br/><br/>However, some ideas are underdeveloped and puzzling. First, the relationship between the old man Carl and the kid Russell is not well-developed enough. Judging from Carl's indifference to Russell's visit, I do not feel his desire to have children after Ellie's death. Simultaneously, Russell's admiration for Carl as his role model can be further developed so that their very good relationship in the last two scenes can be better prepared. For example, what skills has Russell learned from Carl who used to be an adventurer? After watching the film, some may find the ten-minute Carl-and-Ellie love story much more touching and memorable than the Carl-and-Russell adventure. Second, Carl, who relies on an electric chair to move downstairs and staggers along with a stick, suddenly becomes so strong that he can even climb the ladder with his feet hanging in the air, which does not make any sense even in the created world. Third, it is too easy for them to ""float"" to Paradise Falls, a mysterious place, without scenes showing Carl's prior knowledge on aviation or science, which not only makes the plot contrived, but also the first-15-mintue adventure less exciting. Fourth, why and how does the bad guy invent a device helping his dogs talk with different languages? Fifth, the bad guy should be much older than Carl and I wonder why he is still alive and looks even younger than Carl. Sixth, why does the dog, a loyal animal, betray the explorer, even when he has the upper hand?<br/><br/>On the whole, Up is interesting, visually stunning and suitable for kids to watch. However, the story and characters can be further developed. Wall-E, with robots who cannot speak, is more touching, while Bolt, a Disney animation, is funnier than this one with hundreds of dogs. Until now, my favorite Pixar film is still Finding Nemo. Toy Story 2 and Wall-E rank the second and the third respectively. The rest of my top five are The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Up, despite using two ordinary human beings as the main characters, lets me DOWN."
"Aimovie","5","62","162","2 June 2009"," Very disappointed! Just a so-so movie.
","Am I the only one who thinks this movie is overrated? I was so excited when I saw the 9.2/10 rating late Friday night and couldn't wait to see it the next morning. I told my daughter we were going to see a very good movie on the way to the theater. My expectation was so high and I had been waiting for those good things coming to me throughout the whole movie, then found out there was nothing, no excitement nor surprise in this movie at all! Right now, I cannot recall a single thing which I think is special in this movie. A very so-so movie with a very typical Hollywood ending. There should be better story tellers out there. There should be a better movie deserves such high rating. Even my 7-year old daughter thought this movie was just OK. Very disappointed!"
"literarycherub","6","29","69","30 May 2009"," Fairly uplifiting but highly imperfect
","It was a good movie, but not great. The beginning sequence was well-done, tender, and sweet, but it was not quite as emotionally affecting as I expected. I would have liked to see a couple more scenes of Carl and Ellie interacting with dialog because the scenes with them as kids didn't quite cut it for me...I liked how it set up Carl's instantaneous love for Ellie, foreshadowing the endurance of his love for her, but her character came off as unique (which was good) but also kind of annoying. If we got to see a little more of her character and dynamic with Carl, maybe a scene of her showing some love for him, I think the following music-only sequence and the whole movie would have been more emotionally compelling.<br/><br/>Anyway, Carl as a character was a good protagonist, not the stereotypical, grumpy old man one might expect but instead a quiet, relatable human being. Russel, on the other hand, wasn't the best counterpart for Carl; he had some good moments, but was overall pretty typical and annoying at parts.<br/><br/>And while I liked Kevin and Dug, I didn't care for their introduction and their plots. The fact that a giant bird, a pack of talking dogs, and a crazy old man comprise a large part of the story doesn't sit well with me, especially since the movie at first seemed to be rooted in realism (a balloon-propelled house isn't entirely realistic, of course, but it is not cartoonish like the aforementioned elements are).<br/><br/>I would have overall preferred if the movie kept a sense of realism to it; there are plenty of ways to have adventures without all that hyper-cartoonish stuff. Even Muntz was a bit cartoonish for such a movie. However, while I would have liked the movie better without these unrealistic plots, they ended up working pretty well once the real point of them as a new adventure for Carl--an adventure to bring him and Russel together in a strong way and for a common good--was more firmly established and explored. However, this purpose still could have been accomplished in a less cartoonish way.<br/><br/>As for humor, I didn't find many of the jokes to be funny. Maybe a couple were, but overall, it was kind of weak on humor. Several gags were predictable, and even those that were decent weren't great. I also think the writers thought Russel was a lot funnier than he actually was. And as for the emotion, there were some lines and scenes that seemed forced (for example, Russel's stories about his father), but there were other scenes that got the emotion just right; it worked best when it was understated and subtle.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in the movie was when Carl looked through Ellie's ""Adventure Book"" and saw the photos of their enduring marriage inside with the final note of ""Thanks for the adventure. Now have a new one!"" A very simple yet powerful scene, in my opinion. And while I found the ending to be very predictable and the scene with the badge lacked the emotional impact it wanted to have, I did like the final scene of Carl and Russel eating ice cream and counting cars (unfortunately, it was the first time I felt a real bond between the characters.) Anyway, the end credits were really great too, very nicely summing up the whole message of the film...one of my favorite parts of the whole movie, actually. And this message of everyday life being an adventure when spent with someone you love was really nice, one of the best things about the movie.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the visuals were pretty great. I saw it in 3D, and it utilized the 3D well without overdoing it. The only thing that bothered me a little was that parts of Carl looked strange...his ears and hands mainly. But overall, really nice-looking movie. Oh, and the music (particularly the old-fashioned piano music) was awesome.<br/><br/>In précis, probably worthy of a B/B-. Tentative grade, but there it is. Didn't reach the heights of emotion and beauty of ""Wall-E""; didn't as successfully accomplish the feeling of friendship and fun like ""Toy Story"" did, but still a fairly solid Pixar film."
"pilotom","3","43","108","31 May 2009"," Not UP to par with other Pixar classics
","I own every Pixar film on DVD but I have to say that UP may be the first one I pass on. I was very excited about seeing the film today after reading several good reviews. I think now that perhaps some reviewers out there are letting the Pixar reputation get to them. I can't believe ANYONE would say this is one of the best films of the year. Films like MONSTERS, INC, FINDING NEMO, WALL-E and TOY STORY deserved accolades like that but UP doesn't have the heart those classics did. The film is at its best early on when the characters aren't talking much. We see a montage of the lead character's life as a young Carl meets an exuberant girl named Ellie. We see them marry, live a life together, experience the highs and lows of life and finally, we see Carl loose his beloved Ellie and become a widower living alone in the house that always was their home. This sequence is moving and made me think that Pixar was about to strike another home run. However, at this point the characters start talking more and the story starts to get a bit...much. Carl decides to tie a bunch of helium balloons to his house in order to fly the house off to South America on the adventure he and Ellie were never able to complete together. He unwillingly takes along a young boy scout stand-in (Russell) who ends up on Carl's porch when the house takes off. Russell is determined to earn the patch for helping the elderly required by his troop in order to graduate to senior status. The balloon premise is a bit far-fetched but since it's an animated film, you go with it. However, once in South America, things get progressively weirder. Carl and Russell end up walking through the jungle and mountains with the house strapped to them, floating above. I think I knew the film was NOT going to be the usual classic I was used to from Pixar when they come across a bunch of talking dogs. It seems Pixar, whose done films about animals who can talk and done films just about humans, wanted to mix the two so they write into the story these dogs with collars that allow us to hear their thoughts. The dogs belong to an old adventurer living in the area who is determined to capture a big, ostrich-like bird to prove he's not the fake the world judge him to be decades ago when he claimed the bird existed. The adventurer has hundreds of dogs and not only do they search the jungles for the elusive bird, they also cook for their master, serve meals AND fly planes. Very weird. I think if you're going to make a film about smart, talking animals - make a film about smart talking animals (FINDING NEMO) and if you're going to do a film about humans, do one like THE INCREDIBLES about humans. In UP Pixar tries to mix the two and it just doesn't work. The ONE character who I thought had the most heart and was most interesting, was Kevin, the big bird who doesn't talk, seems devoted to her young and takes an instant liking to the human boy who probably reminds her of her babies. I heard kids in the audience more than once asking what was going on because they couldn't quite understand the story. I suspect UP will not be one of those films kids will watch over and over again like they do with the other Pixar classics. Pixar has some incredibly talented people but in UP I think they spent too much time on ""cool"" ideas and not as much time on developing the story and characters into something we could care about and believe in."
"Destany232","8","9","17","15 June 2009"," An 'Adult' Pixar film.
","I just want to say that although I thoroughly enjoyed this film in many respects, it is not for children. It isn't as though they may not have fun watching it, as the visual effects are quite stunning, or they might not get a giggle or two from a few scenes, it's just that in order to fully appreciate the film you must have been in love at some point in your life...or at least comprehend love to the fullest extent.<br/><br/>I would categorize this movie as a romantic comedy/action thriller for adults had it NOT been an animated film. As you may have heard it is nothing from what you would expect in the commercial previews. However, it is pleasantly unexpected. Had I known a thorough synopsis through the commercials, as some films seem to give everything away in a 30 second preview, I don't think I would have enjoyed the film as much.<br/><br/>The movie touched my heart and as one reviewer said ""I began crying in within the first five minutes of the movie, and I'm not much of a crier."" Well, I certainly concur.<br/><br/>This is a great movie for lovers, perhaps those going through a tough time in a relationship, or newlyweds. For children, however, they will most likely utter the words that my niece did, ""It's not funny."" If you have children that are easily entertained, patient, and can sit still through nearly any movie, take them along to watch with your significant other, if you can. Otherwise go with your partner, a close friend, or even yourself. I promise you'll be brought to tears, but they'll soon be wiped away as scenes become more comedic.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

It was his worst time ever in a movie theater. Certainly I regret taking him to see this film.<br/><br/>SPOILERS START HERE<br/><br/>Sadness (excesive in my opinion), dogs with ridiculous talking gadgets to save film time, an exaggerated villain (who being a hero world explorer becomes a raving-mad animal slaughterer in a split second), a cartoonesque rare bird taken from a Porky Pig episode that is neither funny nor tender and scared the hell out of my kid, a miraculously resistant hose, inconsistent time tables (if Muntz was a grown up when Carl was a kid, how old is he when Carl is 78 years old?), graphic violence and a common place kid of divorced parents to fix the tearful ending.<br/><br/>I certainly do not agree with all these ""best Pixar film ever"" reviews. The story is not solid, everything is excessively explained for an adult film and extremely violent for a children's.<br/><br/>It seems that some executive had the idea of a flying house and nobody knew what to do with that.<br/><br/>Yes, the graphics are great, but then again, Pixar used to do more than that."

","UP is not what I expected, and that is not good. The production values were excellent and the characters even seem to be well developed. However, when the film was about 2/3 finished I totally lost interest. So did my grandson who I took along to see it! (I allow for the fact that the film was not aimed at retired old men!) Others have pointed out the plot holes and nonsensical features (dogs talking through electronic collars? Why not just give them voices? After all, it is a cartoon!) But I think the thing that lost me was the total absence of purpose. One reviewer philosophized that the movie teaches the importance of dedication to a task, even if it takes your whole life. Well, I suppose it suggests that, but the same point could have been presented with a much more interesting plot. I had thought my 5 year old grandson, at least, would enjoy another PIXAR popcorn-ball of fluff. Instead, I think he really only enjoyed the popcorn I bought for him."
"Turfseer","4","35","86","2 June 2009"," Pixar rests on its laurels
","It's gotten to the point that most people assume that whatever Pixar does, it's going to hit a home run. But in the case of their latest 3-D animated story, ""Up"", I'm sad to report that this new Pixar concoction does not live up to the all the hype. For those who are watching a Pixar animated film for the first time, of course 'Up' will seem quite impressive. After all, no other studio comes close to Pixar when it comes to the technical aspects of animation. But ultimately, whether a film is animated or not, it's the story and the characters that make a film great.<br/><br/>It was a bold move to choose an octogenarian as the film's protagonist—on the surface the crotchety curmudgeon, Carl Fredrickson, the elderly Spencer Tracy look-a-like, is the type of character we haven't seen before especially in an animated film. And 'Up' starts off with two very neat scenes: 1) a take-off on the old Movietone newsreels a la Citizen Kane and 2) a lovely montage sequence which chronicles the graceful aging of Carl and Ellie, the girl he's known since childhood, who becomes his wife.<br/><br/>The montage sequence is notably silent and doesn't allow for much character development as to what makes Carl tick. It seems he was always introverted but seemingly happy until Ellie's death. It's perhaps suggested that loneliness has turned Carl into a curmudgeon but with all those happy memories of Ellie, I wonder why he turned into such a sour puss. And that essentially is the problem for most of the film: Carl is simply not very likable. He spends most of his time not acting very nice to Russell, the Explorer Scout stowaway, until the film's climax. But it's quite predictable when Carl finally learns the all-important life lesson that it's much better to be empathetic than uncaring.<br/><br/>'Up' is similar to Pixar's prior effort, ""Wall-e', in that it takes too long to introduce the film's antagonist. In Wall-e, we spend a little too much time observing Wall-e as earth's last operable trash compactor. But even those activities prove to be far more interesting than the flying house in 'Up'. After about five minutes, the house with the balloons becomes tiresome; it's not a very clever idea to begin with and all the smashups as it makes it way to South America, prove to be more repetitious than Wall-e's penchant for turning mounds of junk into perfect cubes.<br/><br/>When we finally meet up with the long lost ""Man of Adventure', Charles Muntz, and we saw that Muntz was already probably 30 years old in the newsreel at the beginning of the film, then we must conclude Muntz would be at least 110 years old when he meets up with Carl. But he doesn't look a day older than 90! Muntz at least has a little more personality than Carl but he's much too mean a character for such a light-hearted story. For all parents who plan to take their young children to see 'Up', be forewarned: Muntz and his talking dogs are vicious and wholly inappropriate for your young children who will probably leave the movie theater quite scared and some even crying! The giant dodo-like bird, Kevin, is much more appropriate for the kids but when Muntz's pit bulls start attacking him in old-fashioned bi-planes (straight out of King Kong), the charm flies out the door.<br/><br/>The film's denouement wouldn't have been so bad had the adventure in South America been a little more engaging. There were just too many scenes of Carl and Russell tethered to the house, huffing and puffing as they try to reach the illusory waterfalls along with the talking dogs. The rest of it was perfectly acceptable: Carl becomes the good guy, realizes that the reaching his goal was an illusion and bonds with Russell back home. The best part of the film are the closing credits which give us a sneak peak into Carl and Russell's life after their return to the 'ordinary world'.<br/><br/>In the end, 'Up' is a tale of political correctness. Two outsiders, the elderly Carl and the obesity challenged Wilderness Explorer Russell, are able to not only defeat pure evil but overcome both the forces of nature and their own limitations. For Carl it's his self-pity and for Russell it's his lack of self-confidence. Ultimately 'Up' falls 'down' since it's all rather predictable stuff. Pixar has become complacent, simply resting on its laurels. There is only one direction Pixar can go from now onand that is up!"
"notjulie","5","27","65","2 June 2009"," Good, but not Pixar good
","What I like about Pixar: they generally cover each of these levels: 1) the setting 2) the story, 3) the characters, 4) drama, 5) humor, 6) visuals. In the case of Up, the humor was not at all on par with previous Pixar releases. But the biggest problem was with the setting of the story, i.e. the world they create. In Monsters, Inc they could invent anything, because it was a fictitious world. In Toy Story, the toys could do anything, but the humans were generally bound to the same physical laws as the rest of us. That's where Up makes a gigantic misstep. The main character is rendered very realistically, visually, but does the impossible for an elderly arthritic at every turn (running pulling a house... excuse me?). Where did the talking dog collars come from? The villain is portrayed as a realistic human, but it makes no sense that he might (living in the rain forest, alone) invent a talking dog collar. He's an explorer, not an engineer. This was clearly just something Pixar pulled out of their ""funny ideas to stick in a movie someday"" jar. They should have looked to see if it fit, first.<br/><br/>There were some moving scenes, stunningly rendered, but as a cohesive long feature it fails."
"CharlesVonFunhammer","4","23","54","30 May 2009"," This movie is fairly weak, but okay
","I'm a big fan of pixar movies, I think finding nemo, ratatouille and Wall-E (though to be fair I didn't like Wall-e either the first time I saw it) are some of the best examples of narrative storytelling in the last 20 years. Simply put, the Pixar clan know how to tell stories.<br/><br/>That's why I was so surprised when I saw up. Now, maybe my expectations are too high, but I found it to be one of the weaker Pixar efforts. And here's a few reasons why.<br/><br/>1. It draws on associated emotion, not real emotion. Much of the sadness in the film (and this is a sad - not happy movie) isn't earned. It comes from referencing other films and our own associations - specifically at the beginning. The opening montage goes by so quickly, as a scrap book, that it falls upon cliché to create the emotion. Granted, for many people this will work, because to be honest, there's something affecting about seeing cartoons go through ""serious"" emotions. Yet, these scenes lack the depth of having our characters go through real actions and real feelings. Things happen, the characters don't do anything - they let things happen to them. (and example is that Russel's (spoiler) parents are divorced. This scene is handled in a clichéd and associated way. So and so's not my mom! Heard that one before...) If you enjoyed the opening montage, watch Mr. Holland's opus - that movie does this same thing better.<br/><br/>2. This movie isn't funny. All of the best jokes are used in the trailers/commercials. Much of the comedy is played too subtly (not subtle, but too subtle) and passed over too quickly. There's never a clear moment of what the movie is trying to make us feel at any given time - which brings me to <br/><br/>3. Tone. Is this a comedy, is it a melodrama? The movie doesn't really know what it is or is trying to say. It's inconsistencies constantly set up a new series of expectations which are never followed through on. It's serious...I'm thinking it's going to ... oh wait, a joke...wait...<br/><br/>4. The narrative. The movie takes about 2 acts to find itself as a movie. Carl meanders though the film trying to take his South America. He wants to put his house down, and every 2 minutes a new complication arrives. Then, in the third act, he battles the old and now evil (how old is this guy supposed to be if Carl is 78?) Charles Muntz. He comes to defend russel and dug, and the bird. He finds a purpose - the movie finds itself as a movie! Finally...but by then we've spent 2 acts trying to get into another story completely.<br/><br/>4A. there are a lot of clever storytelling devices, there is a good story here. It's a matter of the storytelling and dramatic devices the filmmakers use to elucidate that the story that are weak.<br/><br/>5. The characters. Between Carl and Russel (shout out to the Asian community) we have a weak set of characters. The most interesting character, Ellie, dies. Her passive husband is left - the into to him shows how awesome she is. What did she see in him anyway? what did he do? Russel is kind of an idiot spaz. why should I root for someone who's so incompetent? <br/><br/>If Pixar can animate characters with big heads and big eyes, everyone will think it's cute. Great date movies, great for kids, and hipsters. The overall storytelling I felt was pretty weak in UP. It felt like it was rushed off without knowing precisely where it was going - which is a joy to watch in the other pixar movies. Brad Bird and Andrew Stanton make you feel like you're in the hands of a master who is taking good care you - who is guiding you and surprising you, but never doing something you're not enjoying. Up is very muddled film-making. It's not horrible, but it's much weaker than the other films.<br/><br/>cheers."

","The sneak peeks and trailers to this movie did not particularly inspire me to go to this movie. It looked like it was a rambling movie that didn't really speak to the comic or action side to the viewer. A guy puts enough balloons together to lift a house off it's foundation: So WHAT??? He inadvertently picks up a scout as he flies away: Again... so WHAT?? Getting the point of a movie is a big reason to motivate people to go SEE a movie I would think. But this was a Pixar film, and I NEVER miss a Pixar film. So, in a moment of spontaneous motivation (and seeing that 2 out of three spawn were currently in house that morning), I popped some corn, my wife filled some water bottles, and we all piled into the Tan Mini-van and went down to the Metropolitan theater (where I felt confident I would not be met with a sour presentation of this film) to purchase tickets and view this movie.<br/><br/>The last time I went to see an ""3D"" film was an iMax theater with sharks and fish. It was pretty cool, so I was happy to kid about how much the glasses added to the family appeal. We sat down and waded through the kiddie previews and trailers then came an announcement to put our 3D glasses on. The new Toy Story and Ice Age (both up to their 3rd sequel) previews were run. Sorry, when you get to a third sequel that wasn't originally written as a trilogy I can't get excited. The Disney lead-on filled the screen and away we went.<br/><br/>Within the first 10 minutes I was angrily batting moisture from my cheeks. I was shocked. Pixar emptied the climax of the plot first off, but what an opening sequence of events! Without giving too much away, the plot revolves around a core of love and a promise. Remember those ""Cross your heart"" promises? Well, there you have it. The rest is a strange adventure with some odd sub-plots that seem thrown in to keep the kiddies focused. Both colorful and deep, the only real question one keeps throughout the movie is whether the promise will be fulfilled or not.<br/><br/>My wife and I watched through the ending credits (hoping for a surprise tag somewhere. Sadly, no) and saw Brad Birds name come up in the conceptualization of this film, and granted some of his influence if felt. The primary animators are quite diversified and well established, some even old enough to be your father or grandfather. As I IMDb'd some of the talent, I was impressed... and as for Ed Asner playing the primary role: I thought he had died years ago!!! But he's alive, and a great talent for the part. Pete Docter who has been in the Pixar pen since the first Toy Story does an admirable job of making this one and a half hour film both entertaining and thoughtful. There are chases, there are technological malfunctions, there are obsessions, there are fanatics and there are devouts and totally absurd sequences. This movie is no less a study of society than ornithology is a study of birds. Its amazing.<br/><br/>And all through it you get to see how generations meet and interact on a very honest level. I am not young, but I am not old. Each generation will find something totally involving in this film. From an artists point of view the artwork and color are spot on; from a comedy point of view it is not overwhelming; from the heart... well, it's profound.<br/><br/>The audience clapped after it was over. During the viewing, there was a nominal level of noise from the ""too young to even enjoy Dr Suess"" generation but it wasn't distracting. This film is for kids; Well, not just kids... for kids, adolescents, early adulthood, young parents, old parents, grandparents... its for everyone. Highly recommended. Well done, Pixar, well done."
"robehr101","10","8","15","30 May 2009"," ""Up"" flies as high as the house which becomes the premise of the film.
","When I walked into the theater last night for the 9:15 showing of Up I had high expectations. I didn't go in with a half-hearted interest or mild confidence; I was expecting to see something amazing and I wasn't let down. ""Up"" flies as high as the House that becomes the premise of the film.<br/><br/>I admit I was a bit distracted when the movie began; either no one knew the movie was starting or no one cared because they were being VERY loud. But as the movie played on the noise died down and I found myself charmed by an opening sequence that is so emotional that you'd hardly believe you were watching a children's movie. In fact, three fourths of the way through the sequence a younger woman sitting in front of me declared to her friends ""This movie is sad!"" in a voice that indicated she had not been expecting it. That being said this movie is still definitely suitable for little children and although I wouldn't go as far as to call it a children's film (I think pixar is beyond that) it has, as always when it comes to pixar, no course jokes or crude humor.<br/><br/>As the movie progressed past the opening sequence, I almost expected to be let down by what came next; I wasn't. After a touching opening sequence that told the tale of his life, the character of Carl Fredrickson continues to be developed with such care that you can't help but feel sorry for him when the men Nursing Home comes to hall him away; even if he is a bit grumpy.<br/><br/>Since I don't have time to go through the movie section by section (and you probably wouldn't have time to read it even if I did) I'll continue this review by highlighting my favorite bits and criticizing what little there is to criticize.<br/><br/>The scene in which the house is sweeping through the clouds as a storm rages around is truly incredible; the action is actually intense and you don't feel like your watching a happy fairytale in which the characters would never get hurt or die. In general, the action was that way throughout the film. There was one point somewhere between the touching storytelling, the witty script and the epic action that I literally forgot the movie was animated and that has arguably never happened to me before.<br/><br/>The biggest downfall of the movie, in my opinion, were the evil talking dogs. I found Dug to be the only talking dog that really came across effectively; the other ""evil"" dogs had little to no character development, were not memorable at all and were not threatening in the slightest. When they climbed into airplanes to shoot at Russell I found myself rolling my eyes in disbelief; dog's flying airplanes? This small downfall, however, is not near enough to ruin the movie in any way.<br/><br/>Another slight downfall (and I'm not sure if I'd really call this a downfall) is that I would have liked a bit more of a sense of wonder and discovery when Carl and Russell first arrived at Paradise Falls; perhaps they could have discovered a few interesting creatures (besides Kevin) or strange plants. Ultimately I don't think they would have had time for this which is probably why it wasn't there but it would have been nice addition.<br/><br/>As you can probably already tell, my overall opinion on this film is VERY positive; although a bit more of time would have made the film a bit more interesting and well-rounded, in the end, it is not needed and the film still comes across as charming and even epic without it."
"ironhorse_iv","8","3","4","23 September 2015"," Lighten Up with UP! It's up there as one of the best animation movies of all-time!
","What's up? Up is up! It was very successful movie! It even was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. It was the second animation film to do that. Directed by Pete Docter, Up is Pixar's tenth film in their series and their first full-length 3-D film. The film tells the story of an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (Voiced by Edward Asner) whom trying to fulfill his late wife's dream by taking their house to South America. The only problem is, that an earnest Boy Scout named Russell (Voiced by Jordan Nagai) has tagged along, making the simple trip, so much, more complex. Can Carl make it to South America or will his late wife's dreams be shattered? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this movie to be very entertaining. The movie is gorgeous and colorful. Sadly, the 3D isn't worth it, but it's still, beautiful to the eyes. I love the amazing music by Michael Giacchino. I just wish, the tune sound more South or Latin American, than European, because it would make more sense. The movie is unsurprisingly well action part. Great pacing. The film is also well-acted. Everybody did their parts, very well. Edward Asner was a great choice as Mr. Fredricksen. I love his grumpiness in his voice. The use of mostly grunts, make it seem, like his responses come from a protective stance, rather than his own grouchy nature. Jordan Nagai as Russell is just as likable. He has the most lines, in the film, and none of it, sounds too annoying. I guess, there was something, sweet about his voice. You really do hear it, whenever, Russell speaks. I love that the actor wasn't even trying to get cast for the role, but end up, getting it, over his brother who was. It show, how charming, his voice is. The supporting cast's voice acting is just as memorable. Christopher Plummer as the villain, Charles Muntz, the explorer was fun to listen to. Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog, was pretty amazing. His voice in this, remind me so much of veteran voice actor, Dom DeLuise. I also love the cameo from Pixar's own favorite actor, John Ratzenberger in his minor role. As much as I love the voice acting; I really love, how the cartoon characters appear in this film. I like how, they have more child-like appealing cartoony look. The whole over the top celebrity caricatured facial appearances kinda works, because the older computer model for humans, used in Toy Story 1&2 are just way too bland-looking and unappeased. It has that creepy uncanny valley look to it. Anyways, I think, the new model gives the movie, the amount of surrealism to make the plot to work. I really doubt, the film could work, with more realistic facial appearances, because how bizarre, the premise is. While, the appearance of Carl is meant to resemble Spencer Tracy as he appeared in his final film, 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. I like his short square status, and cartoony facial expressions. It makes Carl stand out. Unlike some critics, I also love, how Russell look. He doesn't look, like a kid with Down syndrome. He looks like a normal kid. I think, they were a little too harsh in their judgment. I also love the fact, that Russell is clearly Asian American, but his character lack the typical Asian over-stereotyping. Surprising, it makes the character, so much, more appealing, because it's not stepping over to over-used racial clichés. Charles F. Muntz really looks like, an old explorer, but his character's looks was a bit jarring. I really had a hard time, believing, that he's that well maintain, at his age, when he spent, most of the film, living for so long, outside of civilization. In my opinion, he should have, look, a little more broken-down. Last is Dug. He's a very realistic looking golden retriever. I own one, and they got it exactly right. I like how he closes his mouth and freezes when he notices a squirrel. Funny moment right there. For the story, it's both a hit and miss. I love that the film deals with more adult like drama, than childish antics. Having Carl still dealing with the loss of his wife, gave the movie, so much depth. It was really needed. However, besides the awesome and unexpected genuine tearjerker opening marriage montage, the film goes into another direction, with its absurdity. It's really off the wall, crazy and convenient, that Carl able to travel to South America in the way, he's traveling. The movie takes great artistic license, when it comes to engineering and physics. You have to really, be willing to suspension your disbelief from the rest of the entire film. Especially, when Russell was designed to be the child that Carl and his wife were unable to have, in both a figurative and literal spirit. Another thing, I didn't get about the plot, is how Charles Muntz can be, easily discredited. Clearly, the amount of what he found, in his short life, would give, his statements about the exotic bird, some credit. Clearly, much of the unexplainable questions in the plot, could be solve in the Carl is crazy theory that certain people has latch on. In theory, Carl didn't travel to South America, instead the Balloons are metaphors, reflecting Carl's happy and uplifting memories of his wife. Hints, why he was stubbornly clinging to them and refuses to let go, as if he's afraid he's going to fall. It wasn't until he did, was he able to live life, once more. Other people have notice, some themes similarity in the plot to John Milton's great poems Paradise Lost, Harvey Potter's Balloon Farm by Jerdine Nolen, and most of all, several really obvious references to Studio Ghibli. Overall: It deserve its good praise. A must-watch. Things can only go up from here."

","""UP"" is one of the most wonderful animated feature from Pixar, which included all of the emotions of sadness, heartfelt, funny, whimsical and adventurous which can bring you into tears. It begins with a romance as sweet and lovely as any I can recall in feature animation. Two children named Carl and Ellie meet and discover. They share the same dream of someday being explorers and following the entire marriage life, it began with the love from first sight to widowhood and continues with the amazing skyward journey to Paradise Falls. Finally, I love how this film really touching my heart and I cried every time I watch this movie. It's such a very deep emotional film that no one will ever miss."
"the_one_only_original_me","9","4","6","30 May 2009"," Families should ""Catch Up"".
","For starters, I would like to apologize for the summary description I gave this film (I couldn't resist the chance to use a pun). Now that I've said that, lets cut to the chase; Up is your average Pixar movie...and if you're not familiar enough with Pixar then you should be informed that the average Pixar movie has 1) excellent voice acting. 2)cutting edge animation. 3)great story and script. and 4) heart.<br/><br/>In other words, Up is slam dunk of a family movie. The plot is about the misadventures and adventures of an old man named Carl Fredriechson and a tag along boy scout. But there's more! If you want to know the rest, then go see the movie.<br/><br/>Like all Pixar movies, the voice cast is spot on. All of Up's characters are brought to life with well read lines, vocally emotional undertones, and an assortment of talents. Pixar's trademark CGI animation also breathes life into the characters, all of them are given convincing facial animations and gestures which could match any Hollywood A-lister's.<br/><br/>All of the CGI (which is everything seen in the movie) is done beautifully. The scenery is breathtaking and the jungle sets sometimes look as if they were ripped from an issue of National Geographic. Pixar's signature animation is always cartoonish, yet photo-realistic and of course, ahead of their competition.<br/><br/>What's also impressive about Pixar is that they never underestimate the power of story. Up's story is original enough (talking dogs and a house held afloat by balloons aren't even the half of it) but it isn't just about the physical conflict and events. It is really the story of an old man trying to find redemption in the twilight of his life by fulfilling an unrealized dream. Pixar has mastered the art of throwing tragedy and warmth into the same basket without becoming too heavy handed, and you can feel it in this movie. <br/><br/>Up is also exciting and fun. The sense of adventure is palpable and the humor is charming. The script is also nicely written and clever. This movie is also very, very family friendly, despite its PG rating.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that Up is beautiful, touching, humorous, charming and kid and parent friendly. It is just another grade A Pixar movie. Which means that unless your inner child is completely dead you should see it!"
"gabbarsingh_ab","5","18","41","30 June 2009"," Good concept!!but failed to maintain the momentum
","Yet another movie of pixar with a nice concept but failed to capitalize it...it was surprising that there was not one funny scene in the movie to which i could laugh.It is very disappointing that after a brilliant movie like wall-e with a brilliant concept and perfect execution pixar gave us UP which disappointed me very much...the movie is good enough to watch but this is not what i expect from pixar..this is not anyone expects from pixar!!!overall i am not satisfied with the movie and i don't think it is worth an 8 or a 9.this movie is overrated and i recommend everyone who loves pixar and loves their movies like wall-e,toy story,monsters inc. etc...to avoid this movie!!!"
"RobFreundlich","1","60","167","2 June 2009"," Misleading advertising. Not for children
","This movie is billed as ""the funniest movie of the summer"", with a PG rating for ""some peril and action"". It should be billed as ""the scariest movie of the summer for kids"", with a PG rating for ""a heck of a lot of peril and a thoroughly frightening and upsetting storyline and message"". It's the sort of animated movie I'd expect from Tim Burton, not Walt Disney and Pixar.<br/><br/>Here's what the promos show you:<br/><br/>* bright cheerful balloons lifting a house out of the gray yucky city<br/><br/>* a funny, crotchety old man<br/><br/>* a cute kid along for the ride<br/><br/>* a cute talking dog<br/><br/>* a cute goofy bird<br/><br/>* a standard comical cartoon villain<br/><br/>Here's what's actually in this movie:<br/><br/>* an absolutely charming couple having their dreams shattered. Not to mention the wife being stricken ill and dying just as they have a shot at unshattering the dream (my 7-year-old son was in tears at this point, 15 minutes into the movie)<br/><br/>* an elderly man sent to a retirement home against his will after being deemed a threat to the community because he conked someone on the head with his cane after they broke the mailbox he built with his beloved (now-deceased) wife<br/><br/>* a kid whose stepmother tells him he is an annoyance to his father<br/><br/>* a pack of snarling growling dogs realistically-rendered with glowing red eyes/collars chasing an unknown creature through a misty jungle (somewhat common in older Disney movies, but the scenes last much longer and are more intense than in the older movies)<br/><br/>* a mean, nasty, paranoid, completely uncomical villain<br/><br/>* the same dogs chasing people through a 3-D immersive landscape of cliffs and falling rocks<br/><br/>* the cute lovable dog hero (who, btw, is cartoony) cowering in absolute terror before the pack of dogs (who are, as I said above, realistically rendered)<br/><br/>* the elderly man's house being burned<br/><br/>* the kid being abandoned by the elderly man<br/><br/>* the kid tied to a chair on the open loading ramp of an airborne dirigible, slowly sliding down it toward his death (yes, there is a last-minute save)<br/><br/>* the cute funny mother bird hero being forced away from her babies by the pack of dogs<br/><br/>* and, finally, instead of the happy ending that we've come to expect from Disney/Pixar, when our heroes have saved the day and returned to normal life, there's the ultimate disappointment of all. The kid, you see, has been doing all of this to get his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge and become a Senior Wilderness explorer so that his Dad will come to the ceremony. Kid gets badge, kid gets ceremony, and Dad doesn't show up. Yes, that's right the final message of the movie is ""your Dad hates you""<br/><br/>Watching the promos, would you expect any of this? Do ""funniest movie of the summer"" and ""some peril and action"" even hint at any of this? Do any of the reviews mention any of the stuff I just listed? No, they warn you that ""one character hits another one and draws some blood"" (a tiny little spot of blood on the mailbox-breaker's head), and ""a girl admits to tearing a page out of a library book"" (ooo, the rebel!) and ""a bird gets bitten in the leg"" (yup, a big garishly-colored, completely non-realistic-looking bird). You read that, and you see the Disney/Pixar logo, and you think ""OK, I don't mind that, and my kids can deal it.""<br/><br/>Instead, I had one child clinging to my wife for most of the movie, and another crying and begging to leave halfway through. We stayed because we felt they needed to see the standard Disney/Pixar happy ending. See my last bullet point above to see what we got instead.<br/><br/>Yes, there were funny moments. The talking collars that show exactly what the dogs are thinking are hilarious and extremely well done, and there was a subtle homage to the classic ""Dogs Playing Poker"" paintings that had me in stitches.<br/><br/>But unlike other Disney and Pixar stuff, the scary and sad scenes were more frequent and much more compelling and overwhelming than the funny bits.<br/><br/>I don't usually go on the warpath like this - I figure, if you like a movie, see it, and if you don't, don't. But I am so incensed at how wildly Disney, Pixar, and the media have completely and utterly misrepresented this movie as a light, airy jaunt in a floating house instead of a terror-filled action/adventure movie that happens to be animated that I just have to speak out."
"Vic_max","Null","10","21","6 June 2009"," Good movie; wouldn't call it great though (but you can, that's fine!).
","Perhaps the best part of this movie was the beginning, but after that, it was really more like a long kid's cartoon. Sorry - I know lots of people (including critics) love this film, but I'm just calling it as I saw it. There were no earth-shattering scenes that I'm replaying in my mind, quotable quotes that I will quote one day, nor mind-blowing visuals that I will tantalizingly dwell on. For me, it was just a good movie, nothing more.<br/><br/>A lot of this movie is like Wall-E. There's a lot of focus on a few main characters and their quirky behaviors and mannerisms. If you like that sort thing, great! The action-oriented plot that comes later in the movie was good, but again, not quite great.<br/><br/>A real disappointment was the mysterious, goofy bird that was being sought after in the jungle. A mysterious exotic 'creature' or something would have been far engaging. Instead, we get an ungainly, multi-colored bird that's kind of a cross between an ostrich and the cocoa-puffs cereal bird.<br/><br/>3D: This movie was pretty tame in its use of 3D. It's there, but after 10 minutes, I'll it kind of fades to the background. Just a day later, I remember the film only as a 2 dimensional movie, not a 3D one.<br/><br/>Soooo ... what do I recommend? I recommend seeing it! Even though I give it a 6/10, I know that my view is in the minority of viewers and that the likelihood that the average movie-goer will like it is high.<br/><br/>What I would recommend is, if you care to, give it a fair critical shake after you see it. Think about best movies you have ever seen - remember them clearly, and then ask ... was this one of them ... really?"
"Quinoa1984","10","8","16","31 May 2009"," as they say, Pixar hits it out of the park again!
","Some, and you know who you are if you're reading this, may come across the IMDb page for Pixar's Up (and no, it's not Up! with an exclamation point, as that belongs to the 1976 Russ Meyer X-rated flick), and turn your nose up at it as just another Disney and/or Pixar kids flick. ""An old man with balloons tied to his house flying around with an annoying kid, not enough ""art"" for my taste"" (or something similar to that if not as snobbish). I want to relay an example for you that may get you excited: this is for Pixar a riff on Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo. You might remember that crazy little movie where Klaus Kinski, a dreamer obsessed with opera, decides he has to build an opera house in the middle of the South American jungle, so in order to accomplish this he has to drag his big freighter-ship across a mountain to the other side. It is a leap of faith, but we take it because it's led by a filmmaker with a compelling sense of telling a story with an equally compelling protagonist. Balloons tied to a house, ship across a mountain, not much difference if you ask me, just the degree of the ambition.<br/><br/>But it's not enough to compare it to Herzog, or even really try to. Pixar's Up, directed by Pete Doctor, is original in its intent to make a serious adventure movie that starts off as something quite mature, makes it big leap to kids, and then straddles that line like that guy who crossed the twin towers on the tightrope in the 70s. Take your adjective, this is beautiful, audacious, heartbreaking, heartrending, sublime, hilarious, surreal, inventive film-making, and it doesn't talk down to any age group in its story of an old man, Carl Frederickson, who fulfills his and his late-wife's dream of having a house on a hilltop called Paradise Falls that their favorite explorer as kids flew to in South America. If you're a kid you'll not get any tasteless jokes (there's one poo joke that actually works since it's brief and, dare I say it, funny as hell), and it helps to get you prepared for some of the hardships that may come in life, like, well, the possibility of not having kids and losing your loved one in old age. Rare does it happen that you'll cry in the first ten minutes of a Disney family film anymore. Here's the rarity.<br/><br/>Up is also in the tradition of wild fantasy, like a tale out of the Lost World mixed in with a tale out of Pixar's idols, Studio Ghibli. One could definitely see the kinds of characters like Carl, Russel and the hero-turned-villain explorer Charles Muntz in a Miyazaki film (as Ebert so thankfully noted in his review), but they also remain true to the Pixar tradition that's given them their distinction. They're never card-board cut-outs, and even when faced with certain plot elements reminiscent of Disney fare, such as with the big bird, ""Kevin"", in the jungle they have to help get back to her kids, or the (insane/perfect) comic relief of the dogs that talk with the collars around their necks, its dealt with the kind of love and care that should be given in solid storytelling. Nothing is too frivolous in Up, and there's an undercurrent of sadness to both Carl, for what he's lost and has to achieve without his late wife he's known since childhood, and for Russell lacking a father figure or real mother (this last part is handled really well, watch for ""Phyllis"" mentioned).<br/><br/>Oh, and I forgot, it's animated in the usual tradition of Pixar fare: awesomely. Following on the heels of their arguable top-top masterpiece WALL-E, Up features the ordinary (inside a house, an old man) and the extraordinary (the birds, the dogs, the juxtaposition of a floating house with an airship, something else out of say Howl's Moving Castle) with delicacy and subtly while at the same time grandiosity and the vibrancy possible in the medium. I could go on and on, about how howlingly funny it is or how touching it is in the little moments. But make no mistake, Up is modern film art, even if it doesn't fit into your local art-house cinema. Take the (well-behaved/respectful) kids, take the old folks, take your rotten punk kid. It is what it is- squirrel! Good stuff."

","I watched this film a lot later than it came out on DVD. Im glad i didn't go to the cinema to watch this.<br/><br/>the first few minutes of the film were very well done. they didn't seem emotional at all in my view, but they made me root for the character and i wanted him to succeed. Possibly the scene that made me want to shout at the screen was the bit where the contractors came to take his house. <br/><br/>the storm scene was again very well done. but as soon as they landed in south America, i was met with a wall of one-sided character development, weak storyline, and irrational behavior. maybe if there were more scenes that the old man (i forget his name) had to bond with the two incredibly annoying creatures, i wouldn't be so harsh with this review. but i cant understand at all why he would suddenly risk his life to save a stupid bird that, less than 10 minutes ago, he told to sod off. the dog got on my nerves too. by the end i found no reason why anyone would want to rescue that bloody thing, and i wished it had fallen onto some rocks or something.<br/><br/>the villain was irrational. he seems to undergo an impossible change of character - either he was a schizo, or the script wasn't written very well. one minute he wants to find the bird alongside the old man, next he sees the bird and wants to kill them both instead of asking nicely for it. this sort of insane colour bambardment continues throughout the film, and we get loads of threads in the story which are left untied. <br/><br/>a good script is one where every move made by the characters is one that you know fits the character well, or one that you would be able to transpose onto a real person. in UP, the only rational decsion made is the marriage of that woman to that man.(i forget their names, you see.) everything else said or done is so implausible that the rest of the film dies. I'm sorry, but here are some examples. <br/><br/>the bird is an annoyance to everyone - the dog, the old man, the boy - but everybody loves it. its another example of the annoying thing that everyone likes in Disney films. the old man spends less than a day with that boy and suddenly they are like father and son. the villain guy has no reason to chase the people with dogs. he could simply ask for the bird. but he instead embarks on this needless token battle which ends in his death.<br/><br/>nobody sees the stupidity of the decisions made in the film, and i really hope that this film does not make it into the top 250 - or top 100000 for that matter. this was probably the only pixar film which sunk to the depths of chaep Disney drivel. i despair."

I did have very high expectations of the movie ever since i read rave reviews from the Cannes fest, also counting the exciting preview screened before Terminator Salvation began. The balloons, the lift, the adventure appealed to me instantly, the lover that i am of 21 balloons. it's with this heightened expectation that i approached the movie and was disappointed by every attempt of Pixar's in creating a story out of an idea. That would be the most frustrating part of any writer's work when a grand idea has to be developed to reach it's end. Sadly this is where the writers lost it. They had a planned and riveting story until the old man (Carl Fredricksen) realizes it's never too late to get started on anything. The plaintive note of Carl's early life all played very well with the setting to escape on a long wished for adventure. Yes the story held me in it's sway UP until this point. This point was stretched so far as to include the 70 year old Carl confronting his childhood idol, Muntz ( who should be about 95+) and is seen walking with ease and in perfect health ( did the writers in their right mind think this made sense at all,), a senseless plot about capturing a bird that loves chocolates, which is by the way the central plot( not the balloon adventure that you thought the movie was about.

","For a few perilous moments in the middle of ""Up,"" I began to suspect that the folks at Pixar just might be about to register their first major stumble in the studio's hitherto flawless reign as ""king"" of the computer-animated film (a reign which began with ""Toy Story"" all the way back in 1995). But, like the airborne house that floats at the center of the story, the movie eventually righted itself and sailed off smoothly into the wild blue yonder.<br/><br/>This generally wistful and enchanting film tells the tale of Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man whose beloved wife, Ellie, has recently died, taking their dream - of traveling to South America, to a place called Paradise Falls, and setting up home there - to the grave with her. When Carl is threatened with eviction, he hatches a fantastical scheme of attaching hundreds of helium-filled balloons to the house and flying to South America on sheer wind power alone. This he does, accompanied by an adorable little tyke named Russell, who just happens to be caught under the porch at the moment of liftoff.<br/><br/>So far, so good, as ""Up"" captivates us completely with its imagination, its lyricism and its charm, along with its visual homage to such earlier classics as ""The Red Balloon,"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Around the World in 80 Days."" There's also a stunning montage sequence which chronicles - without narration or dialogue - the complete married life of the Fredricksens, starting with their wedding and ending in Ellie's eventual death.<br/><br/>The trouble for ""Up"" begins to rear its ugly head only after Carl and Russell have arrived at their intended destination. Here they are confronted by a number of strange and exotic creatures, including a hitherto unclassified species of bird and a bunch of dogs who've been given the ability to speak by some sort of shadowy mad scientist who's clearly up to no good in this remote corner of the world. At times, we begin to suspect that once the writers, Bob Petersen and Pete Docter, came up with the idea of launching an old Victorian house into the stratosphere, they never really figured out what to do with it once they got it up there. But the messy mixture of science fiction and jungle melodrama they've come up with is unworthy of all the quality work that has come before it.<br/><br/>Yet, what eventually saves ""Up"" from crashing and burning in its second half is the wonderful voice work by Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai, the soaring and sweetly romantic score by Michael Giacchino, and the theme that sometimes our yearning for adventure can make us so myopic that we fail to perceive the ""adventure"" that's happening right in front of our eyes on a day-by-wonderful-day basis (more shades of ""The Wizard of Oz""). These alone are enough to compensate for the occasional narrative misfires, a made-to-order villain, and an overabundance of drooling, snarling pooches that feel strangely out-of-place in a tender and lyrical fable such as this one.<br/><br/>The animation and backgrounds aren't quite as rich and compelling as they were in Pixar's previous two ventures, ""Ratatoille"" and ""Wall-E,"" but the less spectacular look actually makes ""Up"" a more contemplative, relaxing work to sit through."

","I guess, there will not be too many people who'd agree with me. But that is what I really think. In general, I was really upset. I'll even say that I waisted my money and time, because I payed to get sad, while there is enough of terrible things in this world. I was going to see an adventure and comedy but I saw a blue story about unfulfilled dreams. If you remember a movie 'What dreams may come?', I have the same feelings after this one: this world is unfair. I'd say that this movie is good for kids - it will teach them some generally good characteristics. And movie wasn't funny...it was cute and nice...and heartbreaking . Someone can say, that it is a sign of a good quality movie, when it touches your heart. I agree with that, and sometimes it can be too much of touching. If it had less sad parts but with the same story it would be better."

","Do not take young children to see UP. The movie starts with a depressing montage of an young boy meeting, marrying, and then burying the love of his life. They grow old together, childless, after finding out that she is barren, and then the wife dies. That is how UP opens and it only gets worse from there. There is physical assault, the endangerment of a child, savage dogs, fire, more physical assault and death (again). There is nothing uplifting or redeeming about UP and most of the young children in the theatre had to be carried out crying, because sections of it are dark, menacing and terrifying. The parents I was with agreed that this had to be the product of a disturbed mind and castigated Disney for ever releasing such violent dark content. Nobody had any idea how UP got its rating, with all the violence and darkness. This movie can and probably will damage the Disney brand in terms of how much parents trust it in future.

But the cartoon wasn't preachy, as animated movies seem to have become in recent years. I saw the 3-D version, and I wasn't particularly impressed. Although the 3-D provides added depth, the effect was very subtle. I was hoping for something that popped out of the screen more. I see no need for understatement in a 3-D cartoon, especially one that leans so heavily on the fantastic and implausible. In short, I'm confused by all the praise this movie has gotten, and I think the 3-D version is a waste of time and money.

The story was obviously pieced together almost as an after thought. It was flawed, and at times preposterous.<br/><br/>First, what I liked. The opening 15 minutes. When the young boy and girl met, fell in love, grew old together, and then...well then the rest of the movie happens. Also, very much enjoyed the little boy scout character.<br/><br/>Again, a spoiler alert is called for here. In the opening scene, Carl Frederickson, the 78 year old hero of the story, is a little boy watching a newsreel in a movie theater of his hero, an intrepid adventurer who travels the world in his airship (blimp). Jump forward seventy years later and our 78 year old hero runs into his hero, at least thirty years his senior and the hero looks and acts like a man in his late 50s or early 60s. I mean, Please! Then, the dogs. Oh yes, those cutified, electronic collar talking dogs. Are you kidding me? Who came up with that idea? Ugh!!! We know the idea of ""Up"" came from the Japanese masterpiece ""Howl's Moving Castle."" But how that could have a rating on IMDb of 8.1 and ""Up"" a rating of 9.1 just boggles this person's mind."

After that, the film bogs down to a routine action/adventure, rendered more fantastic, perhaps, than the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" series only because of the lack of constraints that the medium of animation allows. For me, the unhinging of the imagination afforded the creative team was wasted on extravagant but silly, over-the-top, plotting. I don't routinely seek out animated movies, but the word on the street for this one was compelling -- almost irresistible. Worth a look, sure.

MAYBE if we found him to be some sort of Captain Nemo-esc genius with all these other gadgets and such in his lair... but everything else he had was antiquated. On top of that, why was he still alive and physically superior to our 78-year-old protagonist who was obviously much younger than he? It's like they had it all done and some exec screened it; saying ""can you add some humor and action in there for the lowest common denominator video game mentality crowd?"".<br/><br/>Other than that, it was beautiful. The first 20 minutes or so of it was so amazingly wonderful I found myself tearing up. I teared up at the end as well.

"strehlow-1","4","10","24","1 June 2009"," Weakest of the Pixar films
","My feelings on this film seem to go against the vast majority of those on IMDb, but I really did not enjoy this movie. I thought the scenery was beautiful, sure, and that the story was at times touching, but none of the characters were strong or even all that appealing, and storyline tried way too hard to milk a childhood idea and lost steam quickly.<br/><br/>From the beginning it is extremely sad, which would be okay had they not advertised it as a comedy. The comedic relief was lacking, with only one real funny character (Doug) who got annoying quickly. He redeems himself by becoming calmer and more loving, but his counterparts only wear out their welcome more.<br/><br/>I'm having trouble wondering what Pixar was thinking in making the main characters a stubborn, old, depressed man and a dumb, fat child. Perhaps with the latter they were trying to make up for their social criticisms in Wall-E, but it was still a poor choice. I know that Mr. Frederickson had to be old and shows more emotion if he is stubborn and sad for over half the film, but it doesn't make him any more appealing. And if his wife meant so much to him and the story, why was she only in it for 5 minutes? Finally, to briefly touch on the antagonist, his motives were stupid and he should be way older than he was. He has a huge collection of beautiful things, yet is going after a multicolored ostrich. Look at his collection! Everything in there was way more spectacular than that bird that eludes him for so long! Moreover, considering his inventions its baffling to me that he couldn't take a picture or even do things that other characters do easily to find it.<br/><br/>I was not at all satisfied with this film. The animation is great, and the story shows glimpses of true beauty, but it's target audience seems to be those well passed retirement. I think it was easily Pixar's weakest undertaking yet."
"MidnightWarrior","3","23","68","30 May 2009"," The voice of dissent
","I am now convinced that all these people who loved this movie must be trolls. This film DOES NOT deserve the high rating. I repeat, it DOES NOT deserve the high rating. <br/><br/>Before you watch the film, you are presented with a short film called Partly Cloudy. At first it starts off pretty innocent, but then delves into some garbage about how storks bring these awfully cute babies to their parents. And then it goes on to show you that the clouds went on to create these babies. <br/><br/>Absolute garbage! Some of us prefer to be upfront, responsible and honest with our children. We would never teach them this! Granted you have to have a suspension of disbelief to reality when watching films, this kind of theological idea is forced on the audience. Worst of all, it was Unnecessary.<br/><br/>Now onto the film. The best thing I can say about this film is the graphics were spectacular! It's east to see how much money was invested in the technologies to make this product. Next I'll say that my favorite characters were the talking dogs and the bird! They were INCREDIBLE! In fact, they could have made a stand alone film and it would have done very well. Bob Peterson is an excellent voice talent choice.<br/><br/>Now onto the bad. For starters, the content is inappropriate for this film. The first 5 minutes are drama laden, saddening and very, very depressing! Right off the bat, the audience falls in love with Mrs. Fredrickson as a child and onward. For some reason, the script writers don't let this couple achieve their dream of traveling together; every time they save up, they have to spend it on something else. Then they also show Mrs. Fredrickson have a miscarriage. And then later, she dies.<br/><br/>Let me remind you that this all happens in the first FIVE minutes of the film! I kept thinking as I watched this film, ""gosh, this is depressing! I feel terrible!"" Disney films are supposed to leave you feeling like a million bucks! Good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people - this is how it should be in the Disney world. <br/><br/>Second, unless you are an annoying, chubby eight year old or a rigid old man, you'll have a hard time relating to these characters. By the time something actually happens to either of them, it's hard to care about them. Countless times, I found myself rooting for the other, no human, good characters or the bad guys.<br/><br/>You can't get me to like you by feeling sorry for you. And that's what this film does to the main character.<br/><br/>I was expecting something like the pixar film, ""Meet the Robinsons,"" but this was NOTHING like that."
"claudia_lampl5","2","5","10","27 March 2010"," One big disappointment
","I can't believe how much this movie disappointed me. When I saw the first trailers I was already looking forward to it. It looked like a funny movie and the idea felt fresh and unique. After last years ""Wall-E"", which was one my favorite movies and Pixars best in my opinion, I had to see ""Up"" too. I consider myself a big Pixar fan and I had the feeling that I would love this one as much as I loved Wall-E. <br/><br/>After seeing it on big screen I still can't believe how much I was wrong. The trailers, the hype, everything feels so wrong afterwards. But were did it all go wrong? <br/><br/>You see, the first act of the film is interesting and promising. We get to know the dreams and the hopes of our protagonist and I really started to feel for the old man. The problem arises in the second half of the film, which is, in my humble opinion, weak and surprisingly not entertaining at all. That's why the biggest beef I have with this film is the logic in the story. There were many times when I had to ask myself ""How is that possible?"" while watching it. Being 21 years old, I still can appreciate a story with fantasy, talking animals and lots of other stuff not existing in our real world. The only important rule is: It has to make sense in the universe in which the story is playing. Carl Fredricksen is an old man. The first half of the movie we see him having problems walking around. He even needs help to get up the stairs. This is the same man who can drag a house on his back while climbing trough a rocky dessert the other half of the film. I don't care if he had balloons tied on the house, it still must be heavy. Some of the balloons even get destroyed over the course of the film. That alone would make the house heavier as time progresses. Even the bird was able to escape the pack of dogs while dragging Carl, Russell AND the house tied on its back, jumping around like it was just carrying papier mâché instead of real persons (and a freaking house!). Mind you, Carl was even strong enough to climb up a ladder outside a zeppelin. Why? I guess because the plot needed him to. <br/><br/>My second problem with this film was the lack of promised jokes. Interviews led me to believe that this was going to be ""Pixars funniest film"". Yet, all the jokes were seen in the trailers and at the time I saw them on big screen I couldn't laugh because of them anymore. This film is the exact opposite of ""funny"". The first 15 minutes are depressing and heart-wrenching. Russells family story wasn't uplifting either and even in the end I felt more depressed when his father never showed up. Kevin gets bitten, separated from her children and captured, Dug gets humiliated and also physically abused by the other dogs, the house nearly gets destroyed over-dramatically and the main villain, who was actually interesting at first, was just an old, crazy man, shunned by society. This film was Pixars funniest? I highly doubt that. I still think that title belongs to Monster Inc. which is also better in every aspect possible. <br/><br/>The villain Muntz, as I said before, was interesting at first. How old is this guy anyway? He was already an adult when Carl was still a young boy not older than 8. And he still lived when Carl was 80 years old. No explanation on that mystery? The talking dogs were a nice idea but it ended being that when they were able to fly on mini airplanes shooting at our protagonists. The dogs were all menacing (except Dug who was drawn round and friendly) and stereotypical. Making the Doberman the most evil of them all was just the icing on the cake. <br/><br/>Was there anything I actually liked? Yes and I can name it. Kevin. Watching this bird movie and interact with all the other characters was entertaining. She was by far the best character and my favorite. Too bad she gets hurt and shoved aside at the middle of the film. <br/><br/>A final few words to the animation: I saw it in 3D and I was impressed. Yet I still think that the animation and the backgrounds in Wall-E were more breath taking. They draw me into the story whenever I watch it and I have the feeling that I'm a part of the film. I kind of missed that while watching ""Up"". <br/><br/>The traditional short film at the beginning was way better and more entertaining than the main film. And that's quite sad if you ask me.<br/><br/>I had to get this rant of my chest. After hearing that it won at the Academy Awards I was disappointed again. My favorite animated movie 2009 was the underdog ""Coraline"". It had everything I missed in this mess. I prefer watching ""Coraline"" over ""Up"" any day."
"arens54321","10","5","10","10 July 2009"," So Good You'd Think It Was Live Action
","There is something to be said for a mainstream movie for kids that doesn't slap you in the face with obvious jokes and with silly plots and sillier characters. But Pixar's Up avoids all that and manages to deliver a stunning, subtle, smart, funny, emotional, and utterly entrancing film that is as suitable for a six year old as it is for sixteen year old or for a sixty six year old.<br/><br/>From the moment little Ellie grabbed young Carl's hand to pull him along into her world of adventure to the tune of Michael Giacchino's touching and altogether beautiful score I was mesmerized. I watched as Carl fell in love and I watched the montage I had read so much about expecting to be wowed by the animation and by the advances in storytelling Pixar has made, but I wasn't. I was so caught up in the story that I didn't even notice at the time how well it was done. I was in the movie. I was in the meadow with them, I could feel the love they felt. And all the while that score just lifted me along effortlessly into their world. That twenty minutes was a story all by itself. I was moved to tears every time I went to see Up, and I will say that I saw it quite a few times. <br/><br/>But the movie doesn't end with this twenty minutes, it evolves into a funny and wonderfully surprising adventure film, and yet it doesn't lose a drop of the tenderness is started out with. We see Carl as an emotionally devastated old man, lost in grief for his wife, and we see him take this huge adventure in her honor. We watch as he holds on to his wife's memory above all else, and when he does this he doesn't seem like a cartoon hero at all. He seems like our grandfather struggling in the loss of his wife, or our parents struggling through the loss of their parents. <br/><br/>And that's another thing that astounds about Up. Carl never feels like a drawing. He is so human and so amazingly relatable that we can't help but root for him to make it through his journey. That is in no small part thanks to Ed Asner, who does brilliant work as the voice of Carl. But what makes it even more amazing to watch is that the greatest journey Carl takes isn't the one in the house with the balloons. His ultimate journey is the emotional trek he makes through that jungle, going from pathologically holding on to the life he made with his wife to the final realization that he has his memories and it's time to continue with the rest of his life. Powerful stuff for an animated film.<br/><br/>But Carl's journey is not the only part of this movie. There's a funny little boy named Russell who accidentally winds up on the ride, and there are jungle hijinks and yes there are talking dogs, but none of these elements are two dimensional and only there for laughs as they would be if any other studio had produced this film (not that any other studio would have gone forward with a project with a grieving old man as the emotional centerpiece and protagonist of an adventure story).<br/><br/>No, instead of making these characters two dimensional foils in Carl's journey, Pixar gives each of them life. From Russell's absent father serving as his motivation, to Kevin the bird's maternal instincts, these are not frivolous characters. Even the talking dogs are brilliant, because they don't seem like people in a dog's body, they seem like dogs with people's voices, which not only makes them funnier, it makes them more believable. <br/><br/>Now needless to say, seeing as how this is a Pixar movie, the animation is flawless. The colors, the design, the lighting, all brilliant. What was extra wonderful was that the characters looked like they acted. Everything about Carl is boxed. From his square head to his rectangular fingers to even his geometric ears of all things, we see how set Carl is in his life and his ideas and how boxed in to his life he is, and his animation matches. Ellie on the other hand is a free spirit and her animation differs to show that. And there is such wonderful poignancy in seeing Carl's boxy chair next to Ellie's flowing curvy one. Russell's face is soft and open, reflecting the innocence and the possibilities of his youth. And I think it is no coincidence that Russell resembles young Carl quite a bit. Muntz is properly sinister looking, and there is something about the way Doug is drawn that tells us ""dumb dog"" before he even opens his mouth.<br/><br/>I walked out of the theater having experienced on of the most full and satisfying films I have ever seen. I have loved every movie Pixar has put out, except for the Cars which was still better than most other non-Pixar animated efforts, but this one has stayed with me like none other, and that is saying something. I laughed and I cried but more than anything, I was thoroughly and completely entertained. What a movie! Go see it please, it is worth every penny."

Another review I read here hit on the most frustrating aspect – this movie was misrepresented in its advertisements.<br/><br/>This movie is about a man who feels like he has done nothing with his life and as consequence becomes a shut in when his wife dies. We see a montage of their life with lots of sad moments about not having children and the wife's final days in the hospital. Then we meet the boy and find out he is motherless and that his father left him. He hopes getting a scout badge will bring back his father. Uplifting so far huh?! Finally we arrive in South America, where the curmudgeonly old man and whining boy drag a house through the jungle until they meet the old man's boyhood hero. Turns out the boyhood hero is now a murderous evil psychopath who wants to kill the old man and the boy. Mixed in is a playful bird and happy go lucky dog. Oh yeah, the boyhood hero is trying to capture the bird. The boyhood hero's dogs are trying to destroy the happy go lucky dog.<br/><br/>In the end all is well. The boyhood hero plummets to his death and the whining boy's father doesn't come back. However, the old man becomes a new father figure.<br/><br/>I am sure the folks who made this thought they were making a serious film about life meanings, opportunity lost, the dangers of obsessions, etc - they probably succeeded.

There were actually quite a few times the characters only annoyed me. I'm not calling the movie bad, but in no way do I consider it amazing. It's just very average to me, on both an entertainment scale and a cinematic scale. this definitely does not compare to animated classics such as The Lion King or Aladdin.

Colorful balloons, funny looking bird, bright lit sky. The back of the DVD even says it's a fun-filled adventure full of laughter. What we get is a very depressing, sad, boring, frightening and mean-spirited movie with the occasional attempt at a funny scene that lasts a second or two. The only thing that had me giggle was the bird and the scene where the old man imagines dropping the kid from the house.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lack of plot - I agree with other reviewers, it seems that they had a great idea and once they get to their destination this movie hits the drain. Instead of the goofy bird, we get dogs that can talk with collars (I thought they were creepy) and a maniac who wants to kill the main characters to capture the goofy bird. Was this at all in the advertisement or back of the DVD? Nope. And what's up with the adventurer and his age? He looks younger than Carl, but should be about 30 years older. And why wouldn't a collar that makes dogs talk and able to understand humans not be more interesting to show than that goofy bird? Heck, even a collar that makes dogs understand human emotions as well? Nope, only goofy birds are good enough for scientists.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Depressing - The characters aren't likable (except the bird) and there's a lot of violence, sad moments, scary moments... I also thought it was very unneeded with the aggressive dogs. The moment where Kevin is caught in the net and taken away from her babies was also depressing. This whole movie is a huge downer. I don't mind depressing animated movies if they are done well. ""The Land Before Time"" is an excellent movie which faced many difficult things, but had enough humor and charm to balance it. This movie also started with killing off the funniest character, Ellie, by having her grow up into an old lady and die of cancer. Now that set me up in a bad mood from the very start.</li></ul><br/><br/>This isn't a movie I would want to watch again. I could barely make it through the last 30 minutes of the movie.

","...is the first thing I thought when reading the synopsis for Up. An old man borrowed with life attaches hundreds of weather balloons to his house to fly to South America. Along the way he meets up with a young boy scout, a giant colorful bird and a talking dog.<br/><br/>Seriously if I hadn't heard this movie wasn't being done Pixar I would have brushed off the movie completely, thinking it nothing more then a stupid, childish animated movie with one too many fart jokes. Even after hearing that Pixar was attached to this film, I still thought the movie would failed.....oh boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>Up is a masterpiece plain and simple. It's takes a crazy premise and makes it deep, confronting and oddly relatable. Makes otherwise annoying and one dimensional characters deep. And makes the audience look on in awe one minute, laugh out loud the next and then cry their eyes out finally.<br/><br/>There certainly is something to be said about a movie which can make you blubber like a little girl 10mins in only to do it again in the last 20mins. Hopefully I've said enough."

","This is the first time I've been to the cinema in about 18 months. That's having small children for you. So, it's my birthday. 42, since you didn't ask. It's half term, and the cinema is heaving with children; our own son is too small yet for the film, so it's just us adults. We're a little late, and the auditorium is a strange sight as everyone is wearing dark glasses. My first 3D film! Keep up. This is going to be relevant.<br/><br/>I'll try and keep the spoilers to a minimum, but anyone who's even half awake will know that Pixar's latest animated feature follows the adventures of an old man and a small boy who fly a house to South America using balloon power. Up is a beautiful movie. Every scene is lovingly rendered with a fantastic attention to detail- to take one example, the way the use of colour alters during the course of the film as the mood changes.<br/><br/>The film contains early in its running time a scene destined to become a classic of cinema, a wordless montage sequence explaining our hero Carl's life from a child to an old man. One shot alone contains more pathos and humanity than many films this year will manage in total. At the end of this sequence, it would be a hard heart indeed that was not moved.<br/><br/>Once Carl finds his young stowaway, the pace shifts up a gear as the two get involved in an adventure in the mythic location of Paradise Falls where Carl has always longed to go.<br/><br/>On one level, this is a fantastic film, surely one of the best of the year; moving, funny, heart-warming (with a soupçon of the environmental message seemingly mandatory in all such features). All kinds of lessons are learnt. Following one's dreams; living in the moment; the dangers of obsession. Carl's house becomes a very large extended metaphor, taking him soaring away from his old life, but then tying him down when he needs to be free.<br/><br/>And yet, and yet, and yet.<br/><br/>What this most definitely is not is a children's film, especially not younger ones. Fairly early on, a small voice whispered behind me, ""I thought this was supposed to be funny."" Yes, it contains its share of slapstick humour and chase sequences that will thrill smaller kids, but its main themes will go straight over their heads.<br/><br/>For adults, meanwhile, the plot fails on several levels. Yes, I know this is nitpicking, but movies have to follow their own logic. I am fully prepared to accept within the world of the film that a house can be floated by balloons and steered across continents. However, how does an old man who walks stiffly with a cane suddenly start taking part in action sequences? I can accept that someone has invented a device for translating dogs' thoughts into speech- but how do they prepare dinner (or fly planes)? Ultimately, these concerns will fade. My lasting impression will be the beauty of the pictures and the tear rolling down my cheek at the end of the truly amazing montage near the start of the film."

A grumpy old man - my, my, that's never been thought of before. A fat scout, how adorable. Absent father, what a surprise. The entire movie is about loss, that is all. First part is loss of innocence, then loss of a baby, loss of the hope of a baby, loss of wife, loss of will, loss of home, loss of father, loss of dreams. Then when by use of the balloons he does get to his dream place, no one, no one points out that he has to lose faith in the hero of his childhood, he is the explorer who had inspired him and Ellie to want to go to Paradise Falls in the first place! Now he is evil! He also has to be at least 100 years old!! Since Carl is supposed to be 78 and Muntz was his hero when he was 10. The time line is just all messed up, but the whole movie is so messed up. What a pile of junk! Evidently Pixar can put out anything and the clones will line up to praise it and see it, but I won't, never again. I felt robbed since it cost me $11 to see the 3-D version. It was no better. The problem was the plot."

","I came into the movie with an open mind to the story and movie in general. I expected great things because Pixar has made some of the best animated movies ever. The only thing I actually enjoyed about this movie was the plot setup, as the first five minutes of the movie were very sentimental. However, this great setup was quickly turned over by countless ideas that were not appealing at all. I may have laughed only once in the entire movie as the humor could only be funny to small children. It saddens me that this movie could have been great but I was clearly the wrong target audience.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this movie to anyone over 10 years old, anyone with a good taste of humor, or anyone who wants to keep their opinion of Pixar in tact. Up is nowhere near as good a movie as anything else Pixar has created because those other movies captured the eyes of a variety of audiences.<br/><br/>I have no doubts that all the other fantastic reviews of this movie have been written by family oriented people or Pixar employees."

","I finally got around to watching this film after last year it being released. Since its arrival, it had many great things said from critics about it; saying how it was so good and all. Many promos had tags such as ""funniest movie of the summer"" and ""best Pixar film. These both lines are outrageously wrong. Up is nowhere near funny, it is actually quite depressing. They simply showed the funny scenes in the trailer but the actual movie was not funny. Right from the beginning, we see the old man as a kid being forced by his future wife (as a kid) to like him, and eventually it starts from there. They eventually get married, live a happily nice life then a few short scenes of pictures with background music, they show the wife dying in a hospital then there, she is dead. That's not funny.<br/><br/>The characters weren't great. The old man was grumpy, and cruel. The kid was fat (a little under obese), bratty and annoying. He had privacy problems which was well showed in the film. The villain was boring and far too aggressive for a kids movie. Also there were talking dogs and a large bird. There were so many things confusing and not right about the film, such as some scenes that showed blood, and a scene with dogs attacking them. Also a scene where the villain captures and ties the kid (Russell) on a chair trying to kill him by sending him down a ramp (though the old man eventually saves him). I seriously don't see why this film was so praised, it is completely misleading and not great. Bland storyline, and uninteresting plot. It is vastly overrated, and shouldn't be in the top 250."

","Every once in a while a film comes our way that makes us sit and reflect to what extent the talent of creative minds contribute to our enjoyment, be it while watching a film, or a play, or a concert, or any other expression of the arts. This is exactly what we experienced with ""Up"", a positive film that reflects the times we live, and the sense of fantasy in all of us, told in simple terms, but packing a message of hope about humanity.<br/><br/>""Up"", the Pixar creation of 2009 offers a magnificent entertainment for audiences of all ages. The minds behind this animated film were in the right places as they offered us their view of a fantastic voyage to an unknown world that only lived in the imagination of an older man, who in spite of his advanced age, decided to take the road to the unknown because he is at the end of his life and the world in which he lives is not what he once knew. With the help of a boy, he does what he could not have been able to pursue when his beloved wife was still around. <br/><br/>The prospect of living his last days in one of those institutions that cater to the old, the sick and the infirm, Carl Fredricksen opts for an escape. His beloved house serves as the vehicle where he will reach the Paradise Falls in South America. Unknown to him, Russell, the boy scout wanting to get another badge for assisting the elderly, comes along for a trip to the unknown. Little did he know the dangers he and Russell will have to face while at their destination, battling the egotistical explorer that once was his idol. Because of his determination, and with the help of Russell, he ends up being the real hero of the story, having escaped the indignities of the stay in the nursing home.<br/><br/>Pete Docter and Bob Peterson directed ""Up"" using the Pixar amazing technology of animation. Mr. Docter the director of ""Monsters Inc."", also contributed to the screenplay. It the first time Mr. Petersen, a writer, had been involved in directing. Both men show a great talent for working in a medium that presents challenges for even the most experienced men trying to work in it.<br/><br/>Ed Asner's voice is heard as Mr. Fredriksen. It is to the actor's credit to have given his character a human quality that perhaps with another actor would not have the same results. Jordan Nagai lent his voice to Russell, the boy with rare qualities hard to find these days. Christopher Plummer is perfect as the famous Charles Muntz. <br/><br/>""Up"" is an excellent film that will give pleasure to all kinds of audiences as it wants to appeal to the child quality hidden, perhaps, in all of us."
"bob the moo","Null","4","8","17 January 2010"," Hits the heart early and follows up with a tremendously engaging and entertaining adventure
","I keep waiting for Pixar to let me down by delivering a good film that only disappoints by virtue of it not quite being up to the high standards set by previous films and, while Up is not quite as strong in some regards as some of their previous films, it is definitely a very good film that sits easily amongst their impressive catalogue. Up opens with a montage that spans about 70 years but yet succeeds in making you understand the main character and also feel for him and it makes it look like it was the easiest thing in the world to do. Without any pat sentimentality or exploitative tricks or cues, the film is quite moving from the very start and it means that the viewer is right there from the very start.<br/><br/>It doesn't quite keep this up though because, although it does still have an emotional heart (thanks to the good work in the opening 10 minutes), the film is much more about the adventure. This does work really well even if it does all get a little bit silly as it goes along and adds talking dogs on top of flying houses etc, however the key thing is that you go with it , mainly because of how well it hooks you into the scenario from the very start. It also helps that on top of being exciting and engaging, it is also very funny indeed. Full of amusing aspects as well as specific funny jokes, the film doesn't separate some jokes for the kids and some for the adults but rather has good clean material with strong timing and delivery that makes it easily appreciable by the largest range of ages. The talking dog was my personal favourite but generally every character moved things along in regards action, drama and comedy.<br/><br/>Needless to say the animation is brilliant. I did not see this in 3D but it is still gorgeous to behold, with the small personal effects being just as well done as the broad sweep of the fantasy scenario. The animation of the characters is great because it manages to convey such information in the tiny reactions or gestures of the characters – hard to imagine how one would do that in terms of capturing this performance detail not to mention the technical aspects. Asner does great voice work in the lead role, while Nagai does well to avoid being no more than an irritating ""cute kid"" but is actually a good presence. Peterson's timing as Doug is great while Plummer is suitably threatening and of course Ratzenberger gets a slot as normal.<br/><br/>Up is a great film, probably my favourite of the year by some distance. The film hits the heart early with an impacting opening 15 minutes that sucks the viewer in and makes it look easy at the same time, then follows up with a solid slice of family-friendly adventure that is as thrilling as it is funny. Another in a succession of incredibly good films from Pixar."

","I went into this film with extremely high expectations based off the praise giving reviews, and I came out content but disappointed. The best parts of the film was the great animation and the beginning, both brilliantly executed. The sequence about the old man's life with his wife was very touching and sad, and was one of the best scenes in all of Pixar's films. In the beginning there were also great parts, such as when the old man tells the developer, ""Take a bath, hippie!"" <br/><br/>I thought the character of the cub scout was cute and funny, and I genuinely felt bad for him. I thought the scene where the old man soared off with the balloons tied to his house was brilliant, and seeing the house soar was truly breathtaking in its animation and scope. And of course, it was hilarious to discover the little boy is on the house as well. <br/><br/>The film began going downhill when they arrived in South America, and although the bird character and the dog with the pitched voice were funny, the film grew less funny over time and the plot and characters began to diminish. By the end of the film I had lost most of my interest and was left with mixed impressions, and I thought the whole attempt at drama and suspense was overblown. See this film, but see it with certain cautions."

","I was fortunate enough to attend a preview in Denver. It is yet another Pixar that appeals to all. I attended with my 5 year old daughter, 8 year old son and two friends. We all really enjoyed this movie. The storyline was probably a bit over my daughter's head but she was drawn to the characters Dug the dog and Kevin the bird so it didn't make much difference. She was giggling through out the movie over their antics. My 8 year old son was drawn to the idea of a flying house and the adventurousness of the story as well as the characters. Certain parts of the story had my girlfriends and I getting choked up and teary eyed but that aspect of the story was over their head. There are a couple take aways from this movie depending on how old you are and not wanting to spoil it I will leave it at that. I highly recommend this movie! See it as a family if you can.

","After watching the movie, after hearing all the critical hosannas it received, I was quite a bit disappointed by the movie itself. The animation was gorgeous as usual and the images of the floating house were really memorable. What struck me was that none of the beauty of the film had gone into the creation of the story. It was frankly lazy and uninspired. WALL-E was an example of a film in which the plot and the characters were every bit as absorbing as the animation. The best part of this movie was the small, dialogue-free montage of Carl and Ellie's marriage. Very touching. But those few minutes could not compensate for an entire film that chose the easiest story options at every single opportunity. You could see every plot development coming from a mile away. Previous Pixar films did a great job in making even the most sappy, sentimental moments feel special. This movie failed to do that for me."

","I don't think I've ever been so mad at a Disney/Pixar film before! ""Up"" was beyond terrible!! I don't want to give away any spoilers, but there's really nothing to spoil. The basic plot of the movie is this: After the death of his wife, an elderly man (Mr. Fredricksen) decides to fly his house to South America using thousands of helium balloons as a tribute to his wife's life-long dream to live at the top of Paradise Falls.<br/><br/>That doesn't sounds so bad, right? WRONG! My daughter is very sensitive to topics like death, and loss, and loneliness, and depression BUT THOSE ARE THE MAIN THEMES OF THE MOVIE! *headdesk* We should have left the theater after the hospital death scene and funeral home scene, but I thought ""hey, it can't get any worse!"" WRONG.<br/><br/>Just when Mr. Fredricksen takes off to the sky, he learns that a little boy (Russell) has become a stowaway on the trip - he was on the porch just as the house broke free of it's foundation.<br/><br/>Russell is there to provide comic relief, but at the same time we learn that his father has abandoned him, he may or may not have a mother at home, and all his good memories are boring ones.<br/><br/>*headdesk* Oh, they make it to South America just fine and that's when the real ""adventure"" begins. Not. Mr. Fredricksen and Russell become the protectors of a giant endangered bird who is trying to escape from a hunter who has spent nearly all his life in search of the bird. Oh, yeah, the hunter has also been breeding an army of dogs who can talk via a collar translator that he developed.<br/><br/>Please read that last paragraph again. An old man and young boy in a flying house have to protect a giant bird from a man who has an army of talking dogs.<br/><br/>*headdesk* It is that level of ridiculousness that makes you feel like a rube for being taken in by the sentimentality of the first 15 minutes of the movie - when Mr. Fredricksen and his wife meet as children and we see their long, happy life together in a beautifully done montage.<br/><br/>It is that level of ridiculousness that makes me question why Disney/Pixar would have such a heavy hand on the ""death"" aspect of the movie. Oh, it doesn't stop once Mrs. Fredricksen passes away. Throughout the movie, Mr. Fredricksen talks to his wife, gazes lovingly at her old pictures, invokes her name in times of trouble, and makes it his mission to fulfill her final wish at any cost.<br/><br/>Sure, he eventually has an epiphany about what's important to him now, and how he needs to live in the present, not the past, but it is too little too late. My daughter was already scarred.<br/><br/>When the lights came up in the theater, she didn't want to stick around for the credits. She bolted up the aisle, out the door, and went to the car without saying a word. I know that she was trying to hide that she had been crying, which broke my heart (especially since she had been looking forward to this movie for a long time).<br/><br/>I guess I should have done a thorough search for ""Up"" reviews before we went. I know that from here on out I will. I guess it is my fault for assuming we would have a good time at this heavily promoted Disney film. I know that from here on out, I won't.<br/><br/>Shame on you, Disney/Pixar, for being so out of touch with your audience.<br/><br/>Two thumbs down."

Gosh, what originality and what a plodding plot, characters, and empty subsidiary characters!! Yes, you just sit there while old Walt works the sentimentality line he did in the forties and fifties, only with modern animation, eg fat Americans who eat chocolate! Sorry I could not enjoy it more, but you suckered me into the cinema (only £3 each admittedly) and gave me a tired rerun of a lot of other Disney rubbish with superficial modernisms.

I loved both of those, but I have to say that 'Up' was a bit of a disappointment. In the first place I like Studio Ghibli films much better than Pixar/Disney ones. Maybe this puts me in the 'old fart' category, not being over-impressed by whiz-bang digital computer-generated graphics. I find the Pixar visual style irritating rather than appealing, and for me the super-slick, ugly, unappealing visuals tend to overshadow the story-line, dialogue, etc. 'Up' had quite a good story but it tended towards the clichéd and while there were some amusing moments I found myself wriggling in my seat and wondering how much longer I would have to sit there.

If it was for kids then my seven year old was asking how long to go after ten minutes (If it is any good we generally get to thirty). My four year old was in tears when we had to explain that the brilliant goofy exploreress had grown old and died. She then proceeded to ask questions about her all through the film. If there was supposed to be something for adults then the ones in my party left the cinema feeling depressed and not just because they had wasted two hours of their lives and their hard earned cash.<br/><br/>It is alright to willingly suspend your disbelief if a context is created whereby you happily do so, however this film doesn't create that context. We watch a decrepit, frustrated old man on the point of being taken to the old people's home spend the next hour or so dragging a floating house around the Andes. I won't go into the stupid bird, the immortal zeppelin adventurer who turns out to be an electronics whizz/dog breeder/dog trainer and the pointless and contrived action sequences because I'll just end up punching a mirror. I thought the golden rule in cinema was Less is More.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Up is more or less.<br/><br/>Reading the other comments on these boards I become profoundly suspicious, because it seems to me there are innumerable highly intelligent individuals making acute and incisive observations as to how extraordinarily brilliant a lot of extraordinarily mediocre films are.

He goes back to Venezuela, vowing to bring back the creature he claims he saw. Nothing is heard from him in years. Carl and Ellie grow up and marry. They buy an old house and fix it up. The two save up their money to go to Paradise Falls, but end up using the money for problems in life. It's present day and Ellie has died.<br/><br/>This is all told in a beautiful but heart-wrenching montage that will make any human tear up. It's one of the best montage I've ever seen. However, the film focuses of Carl after the death of his wife. He is a recluse. After a problem has occurred, Carl decides to go to Venezuela, as a promise to Ellie. However, he's stuck with an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell. Together, they embark in an adventure to a lost world, all brought to you by Pixar.<br/><br/>Saying that ""Up"" is (yet) another masterpiece from Pixar is getting clichéd by now. At this point, Pixar can do no wrong. What they have done in the past several years was bringing films for all ages to enjoy. ""Up"" is the reason why people go see movies in the first place. Compared to other animated films, ""Up"" doesn't have innuendos for the older audiences. That's because it doesn't need to. This film is fantastic for all ages, the story appealing to many more people than the last two Pixar films.<br/><br/>The rich story in ""Up"" may might as well be the most realistic from Pixar yet. It's poignantly told and there are things in life that are shown here that have never been shown in other animated films before. The characters are lovable and charming and are painfully and surprisingly authentic (well, except for the talking dogs, of course). The odd relationship between Carl and Russell grows as the film progresses. For the first time, the adult is smarter than the child. The film is also undeniably endearing. The film is so endearing, in fact, that you'll cry or choke up in at least three or four different spots in the film.<br/><br/>I didn't see this film in 3D but I can tell you the film works well with or without the extra dimension aspect. The whole look of the film is just wonderful. The colors are exuberant and lively. The animation is pitch perfect. The story is nearly flawless, with some minor problems, including some talking dogs. The score by Michael Giacchino is sweet and lovely. The directing by both Pete Docter and Bob Peterson is really great. Wow, it seemed like every shot of the film moved the story along. Some scenes were hilarious too, filled with witty dialogue. The action sequences were impeccably crafted, I'll admit, including an excellent shot in the very first one.<br/><br/>Overall, what I loved best about this movie are the characters and the story, the two most important aspects to any movie, in fact. The entire film just hits all of the right notes. With films being released these days, it's fantastic to see movies like ""Up"" are being released every once in awhile. I loved every minute of ""Up"" and I assure you will too. It's no surprise for me to say that ""Up"" is the best film of this year but I find it hard another film may be better than it."

I absolutely adored the love story between Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) and his wife, Ellie. It opens up with them as children that aspire to explore the world, much like their hero, Charles F. Muntz (Christopher Plummer). They plan on one day travelling to the mystical Paradise Falls in South America--a promise Carl keeps. It then leads to a four minute montage of Carl and Ellie's lives together. At four minutes and silent, it certainly seems like a life well-lived. It goes through everything from them as children to the time of Ellie's death. Along with its lovely score by Michael Giacchino, this silent montage of life with Ellie is sure to make the viewer weep. We feel the effects of this scene long after it ends. Afterwards, faced with being forced to an old-age home, Carl decides to tie thousands of balloons to his house and float to Paradise Falls like he and his wife had always dreamed about. The house symbolizes Ellie helping her husband reach his destination. It is almost like her spirit inhabits the house. And with the thousands of balloons helping the house float, it is such a sight to behold. True beauty.<br/><br/>Carl meets a child named Russell who wants to help Carl to earn a badge in assisting the elderly, much like an angel getting his wings. When the house floats, it takes Russell along for the ride. They wind up a distance from Paradise Falls, but must walk the house to their destination. Now here is where the movie gets silly: Russell wants to keep a unique kind of bird he calls Kevin, and they encounter a group of dogs with animal language converters that allow humans to hear the dogs speak English. They just annoy Carl to no end. Turns out Muntz, who is surprisingly still alive, has made new dog tools and has been seeking bird like Kevin for years. These action scenes with he dogs and Muntz run on much longer than needed. I gather that was just for the children. Luckily, none of it diminishes what we have come to love.<br/><br/>Carl is a multilayered character that is easy to sympathize with. As a child, he was timid but still wanted to explore. After the death of wife, became more grumpy as his dreams of adventure dies. When his house floats, his yearning for adventure resume from where it was years ago. Carl is torn between his new responsibilities to Russell and wanting to fulfil his dream. He wonders what is more important: a house, or people? The arrival of Russell may make things harder, but the kid is someone Carl grows to love like the grandson he never had. And the bird, the dogs, and Russell may be the perfect ingredients for Carl to have the adventure of a lifetime.<br/><br/>This thrilling, beautiful and hilarious adventure film it one the whole family can savour. Reasons for loving this may differ with the age groups, but nobody can deny the greatness that 'Up' possesses.<br/><br/>4/4"

","In all honesty, I have struggled to find an animated film that is as amazing as this one. Up has all of the qualities you could hope for in an animated film; high quality graphics, convincing voice actors, suitability for kids and adults alike, and a compelling storyline. You feel yourself experiencing emotions with the characters as they go through challenging, fun and frightening experiences. The way that this film makes you feel empathy is incredible!<br/><br/>My dad, who is renowned for hating animated films, was convinced to watch this with me, my mum and my younger sister, and afterwards he actually admitted to being very impressed and saying that he would happily watch it again in the future!

","This lovely film tells the story of Carl Fredrickson, a little friendly widower who lives alone in a house restored along with his late wife, Ellie, whose memory he cherishes constantly. Forced to leave his home, threatened by real-estate interests, to live in a nursing home where he didn't want to go, Carl decides to go on a long journey that always wanted to do with his wife but that life never allowed... and departs with your home through a system that he created and that makes it fly. But the journey is bound to change radically when he meets the scout Russell, eight-year-old, grabbed on his porch, an unwitting passenger on that trip.<br/><br/>Directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two brilliant directors of Pixar Animation Studio behind hits like ""Wall-e"", ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Finding Nemo"", this film has a number of experienced voices and a touching soundtrack, which earned the Academy Award that year for Best Original Score. A curious fact: the place represented as a destination point for Carl's trip - the fictional Paradise Falls - exists on the real life, in the border between Venezuela and Brazil: its Mount Roraima.<br/><br/>The most touching on this film is to see the love of Carl and Ellie, alive even after her death and visible in the way he keeps her memory alive and ever present. Russell's goodness also move us, especially when he is confronted with the harsh ways of stubborn Carl, who sees in Russell a problem. Another deeply moving character is Dough, a friendly and affectionate dog who speaks through a device placed on his leash.<br/><br/>For all these things, ""Up"" is a film for the whole family, is a film that touches us, moves us and thrills. It proves that, if love cannot move mountains can still move homes, and that no one is too old to live an adventure or fulfill a dream."

"revival05","8","2","3","6 March 2010"," A movie about old age and young hearts
","Walt Disney once said that he wanted to make movies for audiences, not just kids. His goal was to produce animated film equal to live action features, movies that were seen and appreciated just like any other movies. One can certainly discuss how well the Disney studio has taken care of this legacy, but the company that kept the innovation going for it has obviously been Pixar. Step by step, movie by movie, the people at Pixar have kept outdoing themselves. To me, Wall-E was them crossing the final frontier, breaking their own roof and kept going towards the stars. That wasn't just a family adventure and it wasn't a kids movie. It was about two machines and the entire human race - a movie for audiences, don't you think?<br/><br/>Up is a companion piece on the same level. It's not about the entire human race, but it's about the entire life of a human being - this is a movie that tries to learn very young people a little something about very old people. In the beginning of the movie we meet Carl, a little toddler with stars in his eyes, dreaming about going out into the world for adventure. Coming home from a Newsreel concerning his biggest adventurer hero, he passes a house where adventurous things seem to be in full motion. Thus, he meets Ellie, a happy gal with equally grand dreams as himself. Now, in any other animated movie this would be our two main characters, kids on the screen for kids in the theater to relate to. But what follows is a montage, spawning decades, and upon the end of this montage we meet our main protagonist - it's Carl alright, but now he's Mr. Fredricksen, a cranky old man. The movie has just outrun the eight year olds by 70 years or so! Hey little Charlie, this is your life Mr. Fredricksen. It's dangerously brilliant.<br/><br/>Our cranky old hero has a warm and colorful life behind him, but he never got to go out on any of those adventures. While there's still time, and while there's certainly nothing better to do, Carl figure it's time for some adventure so he flies away in his house toward South America, the land of his dreams. His only baggage is Russell, the real kid for the kids in the audience to ""relate"" to. Carl finds him obnoxious and even though Russell is your average modern eight year old, I guess the real modern eight year olds in the movie house should understand why by now. Back in the days, all Carl and Ellie knew about South America was that it was ""America, only south"". Russell takes GPS for granted and says ""You're going to South America? You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff."" Russell doesn't seem to have any pure, authentic dreams of adventure in him, and he's certainly not that imaginative, but he does like chocolate.<br/><br/>What follows is an adventure as old fashioned as it is fun and original. There's something very classical about the whole fair; an amazing flying machine that has to be repaired somehow, strange dangers in the jungle and giant zeppelins with the insides of luxurious steamboats. In a sense, this is also an adventure movie about adventure movies - it's part of the adventure to explore jungles, discover strange animals and exciting secrets. Carl knew this when he was eight but now, almost eighty, it's all just a nuisance. He is totally uninterested in whatever they discover. ""Can we keep it?"" Russell says. ""No"" Carl keeps replying and continues to limp along. ""But it's a talking dog!!"" Russell finally exclaims.<br/><br/>Up also has fairy tale touch to it that is woven into the visual dynamic. It feels as if it's taken inspiration both from the films of Miyazaki, and from that elegant French style of animation that borders to realism. The adventure is strange enough to make you fall back into escapism, but at the same time it's all very close to heart. Carl Fredricksen is as believable as Walter Matthau or Jack Lemmon were in Grumpy Old Men. Up seems to salute these kind of cranky old men too, it seems to give an homage to this soon extinct generation of analog, post- war dream weaving. It also seems to be wanting to tell the kids of today that you should really try and be nice to cranky old men, because being one is not the easiest thing in the world. Another thing the movie seems to be telling us is that no matter how lonely and bittersweet life can be when you're at the end of your days, we are all children at heart."
"darknalel","9","2","3","1 June 2009"," A perfect 10 except for just two things...
","Up was I think a slight expansion for Pixar. Right Up in my mind. Their movies in the past hit home well with a wide range of audiences. But this one does even more so. A slightly younger crowd, as well as a slightly older one are easily captivated. This makes for an experience that is just simply amazing, across the board. A tear jerker of an animation, and one hell of a movie. But the expansion of audiences also invites some bad into their otherwise perfect work. I don't wanna give away too much but a high pitched annoying voice and some unexpected plane pilots caused an entire point off for this movie. Nearly two. This may please the younger crowd, but for the older I am afraid it hurt it. It hurt it bad. Besides breaking up the smoothness like a scratching record with this overplayed low-end television trick, it just gives you that gut wrenching feeling in your stomach: They obviously did not preview this movie enough. Now I'm no film critic, but my refrigerator could have caught that one. I mean come on. These moments, and a few more that I cannot seem to remember, leave a bitter taste in your mouth and a feeling of an unpolished work. But besides some absolutely gutter moments, the rest was extremely well done and absolutely a great watch for all ages. And I do mean all."

First, Doug and Kevin where so charming. Well, to be frank the entire movie is amazing charming in its own way, but Doug and Kevin especially. The movements of the bird are just amazing, and the things that the dogs say and do are exactly what you would expect a dog to do, they captured it perfectly. They were quirky and funny and lovable all at the same time, something that the guys over at Pixar are really good at.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was a bit more dark than I was expecting it be, but it set up the rest of the story so well. I felt like this was an animated movie, but really had a lot of meaning to just about anyone who watched it.

"Ryan_Barbakins","10","1","1","15 February 2020"," Adventure is right here!
","This is my personal favorite pixar film. The music, dialogue, characters, comedy, and story have ingrained themselves into my brain forever as something to behold. This film succeeds every time to hit the right emotional buttons for me. This I believe is because of how greatly developed each element is.
A criticism I see thrown around is that the first 10 minutes are great, while the rest isn't. I strongly disagree, because this film isn't only about the first 10 minutes. It is about an old man getting the adventure of his lifetime, hoping to do it for his deceased wife, but eventually letting himself move on from it. The very end of the film when Carl lets his house float away saying ""it's just an old house"" perfectly encompasses this theme.
I can totally understand people not liking this movie as much as me, or preferring a different pixar film over this one (I love just about every pixar film) but subjectively, this film has had the greatest impact on my life, and I appreciate it to the moon and back."

","I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.<br/><br/>While searching a film in order to watch with my family together on friday night, I discovered an animation well-know as ""Up"".
As a big fan of ""Finding Nemo"", I considered/believed that Pixar could never give me a feeling of satisfaction.
I was wrong.<br/><br/>At the centre of ""Up"" is Carl Fredricksen,
a grouchy widower and retired balloon salesman in late middle age. He, after the death of his lovely wife, Ellie, finds himself alone in a world where he is disregarded by people around him and in risk of being sent to a retirement home.
For the purpose of not losing the house he spent his whole life in, he decides to go on one last adventure to complete a lifelong dream he shared with Ellie of traveling to Paradise Falls in South America. So he hooks his house up to thousands of balloons and sets off into the unknown, but all doesn't go as planned when he accidentally picks up a stowaway - a young Boy Scout named Russell, who affects on Carl's life positively.<br/><br/>Up is funny, heartfelt, and never less than entertaining.<br/><br/>There is plenty to like about this movie - from its gorgeous look to a surprisingly touching story.
Even the first 10 minutes are some of the best, and most emotional, sequences of any film in recent memory, but are just the beginning of a movie that manages to interject some laugh-out-loud funny moments with a rather tender back story that tugs at the heart strings."

Edward Asner provides the voice behind Carl, a widowed elderly man who is being forced to leave his home for a retirement home. Instead of accepting his fate he floats his home away to try and get to Paradise Falls: a destination he wanted to go to with his wife. The montage of Carl and Ellie's relationship is both lovely and sad. Their relationship goes through many ups and downs, yet their love remains strong, even after Ellie's death Carl is dedicated to her. The brilliant script and animation are as always with Pixar films backed by an impeccable score. One of the best animated films of all time and more than worthy of joining Beauty and the Beast and Toy Story 3 as the only animated films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

"Lejink","7","1","1","31 March 2012"," High marks
","Another enjoyable Pixar production right here, this time doing for the elderly what ""Toy Story"" did for infants. It does fall a bit too obviously into the formulaic last half hour big chase with the bad guy, which in this particular feature I think was going along perfectly well as it was. Maybe that's just the adult in me, so I'll chalk up the first half of the film for me and the second half for the kiddies.<br/><br/>I particularly liked the prologue in which we get the potted life story of Carl and Ellie, the film subtly making the point that life goes on even when you're old and widowed. I might argue that the feisty Ellie character actually seemed to have more going for her than her more passive husband and that I missed her in the second half. I also didn't appreciate the fact that it was their childhood hero and inspiration who turned out to be the baddie and of course cuteness must have its place in any Disney feature and here we get a double dose with Doug the dog and Kevin the err...big bird.<br/><br/>However the crotchety old Carl Fredricksen is a fine creation and even more so his keen-as-mustard adventure scout assistant, Russell, the film also reminding us that the generation gap needn't be so wide. <br/><br/>While there are fun moments and good laughs to be had, I was most taken with the marvellous animation, as so often is the case with Pixar. In particular the scene of the first ascent of the house with its multicoloured balloons sending it skywards is a visual treat (it's a pity they give this away in the promotional material) as are the first, rainbow-tinged views of Adventure Falls. The vocal characterisations are excellent, with Ed Asner as frosty old coot Carl and young Jordan Nagai as young whippersnapper Russell while the background music is likewise enjoyable and apt.<br/><br/>In summary then, another Pixar treat, although like I said from a purely selfish point of view, I do wish they would abandon the routine mini-Indiana Jones big finish, no matter how flashy and superficially thrilling it might be."
"nathanschubach","7","1","1","31 March 2012"," Convenient adventure story thrills you visually
","Not much to say for a review of ""Up"" except that it was an adventure of a tale filled with adult-undertones in an otherwise child-like movie that knows how to use its sense of fantasy to drive the story home. The music was standard Pixar/Disney fare, which has a hint of obvious, on-the-nose emotional-clichés about it by this point in Disney films. Even though the scenes were absolutely ridiculous in logic, it makes for the best kind of kid's film. This is the updated version of ""Rescuers Down Under"" and ""Flight of the Navigator."" (Basically Disney and Pixar decide over the question ""Does the shot look dramatic enough?"" and goes with whichever logic gets them that shot) Personally, I would have liked the movie better if Carl made the decision to stand his ground in the end and not to go after these accessory characters, and the way they arrive and return to the destinations of home and Paradise Falls is completely by happen-stance. In the end, I gave the movie a reluctant 7 stars, though, because it is fascinating what Pixar can dream up, however implausible the story is."

It has a cliché montage in the first ten minutes to show a lot of time passing and allow for the main character of Carl to be old.<br/><br/>Russel is quite a show-stealing character with his comedic relief and the dog Dug who is a hyper-active upbeat talking dog helps give some comedy too. It's really unlimited in terms of comedy.<br/><br/>It's got a tad bit of romance, and it's filled with tragedy for more than one character. It's a fun movie full of heart. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm sad I didn't take a look at it in 2009 when it came out. But I'm glad I finally saw it. It's one of the best Pixar has ever had to offer."

Such as Russel the cute, chubby, quirky kid who tags along with Carl for the adventure of a lifetime. There is Kevin the bird who simply steals the show, Kevin is really funny and very likable (Kevin is so cool) Doug the dog is genius, PIXAR managed to capture the characteristics of a dog in his voice and Carl goes on a character journey along with the audience.

"moonspinner55","7","1","1","22 August 2010"," Sweet sentimentality and raucous kiddie comedy...not always a sublime mixture, but the intentions are true
","The opening eleven minutes of Disney/Pixar's animated ""Up"" are pure poetry in motion. Chronicling a man's journey in life from boyhood to married adult to lonely widower, director Pete Docter gives us images which are extraordinarily heartfelt, so elegiac in tone they should take an audience's collective breath away. Big dreamers but relative homebodies, an elderly man and his wife live happily together alone in their house until her passing. Faced with eviction, the man gets an amazing idea overnight: attach thousands of helium-filled balloons to his rickety old house and sail it through the air to a revered point in South America. But, as with 2008's ""WALL·E"", there has to be dramatic conflict, a villain, a chase, and lots of outrageous comedy in order to attract the youthful target audience. In a perfect world, there would be a Pixar effort designed to steadfastly avoid this kind of commercial pandering to 10-year-olds. Once the house reaches the next continent, the man, now joined by a chatty juvenile, encounters a rare bird being hunted by a world-renown explorer--the 78-year-old's childhood hero--who fails to live up to his newsreel notoriety. The bird only wants to get back to her babies in their nest (how's that for conflict?), while the man and his kid-companion are held off by a pack of dogs who have voice-boxes in their collars. If this isn't bad enough, at one point the dogs even prove to be flying aces in fighter planes apparently held in storage since WWI (it's a lackluster homage to ""King Kong"", and a highly unnecessary one). The screenplay, written by Pete Docter and his assistant Bob Peterson from a treatment by Docter, Peterson and Thomas McCarthy, is so wonderfully cognizant of an elderly person's traits and attachments to their beloved belongings, to then witness the central character being chased by talking dogs is an insult. And yet, because the filmmakers are wise enough to keep returning to the tale's likable principles, ""Up"" is often vastly entertaining. The detail is marvelous, often beautiful, as is the subtle music score by Michael Giacchino. There are a handful of near-terrible moments in the film which keep it from being a true masterpiece, but Docter and his team are surprisingly honest when it comes to the sentiment. The friendships made and lost in ""Up"" are genuinely touching; and, though the slapstick is noisy and sometimes mean-spirited, the overall intent to somehow steer this vessel to a happily-ever-after ending is clearly evident and commendable. *** from ****"

","Saddened by the passing of his wife, Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) misses the love of his life and only wants to fulfill her dreams of getting to Paradise Falls. Frustrated by the outside world moving in on their place Mr. Fredricksen takes matters into his own hands to escape being sent away to a retirement home. He meets an awkward Wilderness Explorer named Russell (Jordan Nagai) stuck on his porch of his floating house and the real adventure begins.<br/><br/>John Lasseter and the Pixar team have done what they do best by telling a a fantastic story in a way that everyone can relate to. UP shows that with imagination anything is possible even if only a dream. The dream of reaching Paradise Falls lasts all of Ellie, Mrs. Fredricksen's, life and her imagination kept her feeling young all the time. I believe that Ellie's youthful imagination is what kept Carl going so long. They both dreamed of a better place to live atop the falls of South America, somewhere far from where they lived in the growing city. The wish to be in another place for better things reminds me of the dreams and imagination of Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. Dorothy dreamed of a better life in the far off land of OZ and she too traveled by house. Both stories show how dreams and imagination can keep people happy in tough times.<br/><br/>The use of the montage during the first scenes of the film are perfect to show the beautiful life that Carl and Ellie make for themselves. Without a single line of dialog used we get a very clear understanding of the love they have for each other,and it is beautiful. We, the audience, get a glimpse into the love they share and get to enjoy the good times of the life they build together. From the fixing up of the house, to the painting of the simple mailbox, we get to enjoy their love. The montage paints a beautiful picture of the passing time of their marriage. <br/><br/>I also love the use of lighting and color in the film. After Ellie passes from Carl's life things seem dull, gray, and very low key and the lighting reflects that. Carl's life feels empty and the colors and lighting make us feel sort of like how Carl is feeling. As the adventure begins we see more and more color. Carl feels that he is living Ellie's dream and he feels young again. The once colorful life they two of them shared is now presented to Carl and the audience to once again enjoy.<br/><br/>UP is a fantastic film with a story of hope, joy, and enlightenment that I really loved. The story, production, and characters grab your emotions and draw you in. This film is something everyone will enjoy."
"speculatrix","6","1","1","25 July 2010"," first third very good, overall quite a good movie but plot elements jarring
","*Executive summary* I'd recommend the movie to entertain children and younger teens only, really. As an adult, the movie is worth watching but I'd not buy it from other than the bargain bin or pay good money on PPV. <br/><br/>*Analysis* The first third of the movie is really excellent, a heartwarming story of childhood sweethearts who grow old together, the man becoming old and grumpy when wife dies and deciding to run away to follow their original dream.<br/><br/>It then coasts for a while until they arrive and discover the mad old explorer and his bizarre talking dogs. The plot then turns into an old fashioned chase, fight, run sequence, all too predictable.<br/><br/>I puzzled over the point of the dogs and thought back to very old adventure movies where the heroes go off to Africa or S. America and encounter some aggressive/hostile barbaric tribe. Political correctness means such movies aren't made any more, so I guess the screen-writer simply substituted ""native"" for ""dog"" and carried on.<br/><br/>The characterisation of the animals is mostly a bit weak, they're neither just animals nor fully-formed anthropomorphic creatures, the major villain is over the top, and the boy scout grows throughout the movie fulfilling the requirement of all these kinds of movies."

","The madmen at Pixar once again prove themselves the best storytellers on the planet. Or off it.<br/><br/>UP is a unique animated adventure that follows crusty retiree Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) on his adventures in trying to float his house with thousands of balloons to his dream locale.<br/><br/>Another humbling display of Pixar's incredible grasp of story structure. How do Pixar do it? Look at their ratings record on IMDb - every major theatrical release (except CARS) scores 8/10 or above. From TOY STORY to THE INCREDIBLES to WALL-E, it is becoming boring referring to them ""batting another out of the park."" They know no other trajectory.<br/><br/>The first section of the movie is a sad little vignette all on its own. We first meet Carl as a cute little boy, marveling at the exploits of adventurer Charles Muntz (voice of Christopher Plummer). Also a fan of Muntz, Carl's future wife, Ellie (Elie Docter), whom he Meets Cute in a dilapidated house, as she pretends to fly it to an enigmatic South American rainforest plateau called Paradise Falls. A whirlwind montage of Ellie's and Carl's lives as they marry, move into that house and try to keep ends met while still vowing to trek to Paradise Falls ""someday."" He's a balloon salesman at the zoo, while she works in the South American exhibit. Montage rushes through their married life, dark days of miscarriage, old age, and finally Ellie's death, throughout, a picture of their promised destination on the mantel seeming to recede further into childhood fantasy. It stirs simultaneous nostalgia, bereavement and regret.<br/><br/>And it's just a cartoon! As city developers tear down everything around Carl's little house, he resolves to make his fantasy a reality. He attaches thousands of air balloons to his house, rends it from its moorings and takes to the skies, with ingenious steering and sailing mechanisms that were once merely play-acting ropes for young Ellie.<br/><br/>Along for the ride is a plump little Asian-American boy scout, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who was on Carl's porch when he lifted off. It is refreshing that Pixar would create this mixed-ethnicity character, as it has always been the provenance of spoiled blond white kids (which Carl was in the opening scenes) to go on adventures such as these.<br/><br/>En route to the Falls, Carl and Russell encounter a big exotic bird which Russell names Kevin (and continues to call it that even after it is discovered the bird is a mother), a dog named Dug with a special collar that enables him to speak (voice of co-writer-director Bob Peterson) and Muntz himself as a neurotic recluse with his pack of trained collar-speaking hounds.<br/><br/>Using the word ingenious to describe Pixar is like using skank to describe Britney Spears - it's intrinsic; built into every detail of this production, from the logistics of Carl's balloon-powered house to Muntz's airship, to the house-airship chase through canyons, and the endearing little animation details.<br/><br/>Characterizations are, once again, as good as you will find in any drama. Though the movie obviously has a strong kiddie demographic, Russell's pathological need to earn his badges to impress his absent father is far from the usual syrupy guff. And watch how artfully Dug's lovable character is carved out in a few seconds of screen time, through his actions, voice and content of his disjointed dialog--squirrel! This is why Pixar shames Disney when it comes to writing ""real"" characters - Disney's are STILL written as naively as Amy Adams plays Giselle in ENCHANTED (2007).<br/><br/>Pixar writing vets Pete Docter (TOY STORY, MONSTERS, INC) and Bob Peterson (FINDING NEMO) direct, with Thomas McCarthy sharing co-writing credits with them. Creating an action-adventure without overpowering the people at the heart of it.<br/><br/>UP was recommended to me by a screenwriter as an example of the perfect execution of the screenplay form. It is. A whip-cracking put-us-in-our-place illustration of just how a story should be told, with humor, action, poignancy, and every little detail paid off--squirrel!"

","Up manages to bridge that gap between a simple story and a meaningful concept behind the veil of magical effects and imagery which (from the onset) captures your imagination and makes you believe this story all the more.<br/><br/>The presence of such perfected 'animated' cinematography (beautiful surroundings, landscapes etc.) brings to mind only one outstanding feature of this film.<br/><br/>The intelligence behind donating an entire scene which captures a lifetime of partnership without the use of a single word is pure genius. Not to mention excellently executed. This is what stood out most for me.<br/><br/>The tale of partnership, family difficulties, lifelong promises, hopes, dreams and what's most important to ones self is told in a way that makes you shed a tear in joy for the beauty that is this film.<br/><br/>This is a TRUE FAMILY MOVIE! one that will keep the children entertained with a few laughs along the way and one that will surely give adults pause for thought.<br/><br/>9/10"
"merrywood","9","1","1","3 June 2009"," Up gets my sky high rating
","The best cinematic thing the Walt Disney Company has done in the past half century is tie in with Pixar, a group of brilliant animation filmmakers founded by John Lasseter who left Disney for Lucasfilm in the early eighties and Ed Catmull who was made the head the new company's digital imaging at that time under new corporate head, Steve Jobs. We all know of their extraordinary success. The films appear to just get better as the years roll by and fine writers are located and brought aboard.<br/><br/>UP is a quality peer of the best animated feature films ever made. However, somewhat unlike the first two Disney animated features, Snow White and Pinocchio. These two are as yet to be surpassed in enduring contentwhat the great director, Frank Capra, once told me, ""Something to put in their pocket and take home with them."" It's what I call spiritual content, that is, subtext that speaks to the soul.<br/><br/>Thus, unlike the first two classics made under the auspices of Walt Disney himself, however, UP is a bit light in its spiritual core and heavier on action and storytwo good attributes of all Pixar features, and in this case with strong sentiment and heartwarming scenes. However, this lack in formula always shortens the legs of all features, live action included.<br/><br/>Another fuzz-ball in the lens is the contemporary use of well known voices such as Ed Asner, who does a commendable job as the lead character in UP, Carl Fredricksen, but whose voice clearly kicks off real life images from the brain's memory bank which then conflict with the animated character's image on screen.<br/><br/>In 1978 while researching my first place national book festival prizewinner, The World of Animation, at the Walt Disney Company in Burbank, I interviewed several people that had worked with Disney in the mid to late 1930s and was also associated for some years with Shamus Culhane who worked on both of the first two Disney animated features. <br/><br/>As a brief sidebar, Jimmy (Shamus)Culhane's name was left out of the of Pinocchio credits because he quit Disney before that film was released in order to help (and in addition for an erroneous health assumption) the Fleischer brothers in Miami on their first two animated featurestwo films not so successful due to poor scripting but both features that had charm: Gulliver's Travels and Hoppity Goes to Town.<br/><br/>As for Shamus, most of the scene where Pinocchio sets out to school with an apple for the teacher and meets the fox and cat was animated primarily by Shamus.<br/><br/>Shamus and others who were there at the time of Snow White's production confirmed that the reason that Walt Disney used Adriana Casellotti's singing voice, totally unknown, instead of Deanna Durbin's or Judy Garland's in Snow White, for example, was primarily because of the image conflict that does occur with audiences when they hear a very well known voice speaking for an animated character with which we are trying to identify. Today nearly all (but not all) American animation studios use celebrity voices in contrast to the very early years. They also pay top dollar for these voices, a completely unnecessary budget expense.<br/><br/>All that said, UP is a wonderful animated film and not just for children, another idea that Walt Disney had that has often been forgottenthat animation is not just for children. The feature animation from other nations bears this out."

Even though I was wearing the 3D glasses, I don't remember seeing it different from any other TV or cinema movie. I can't wait to see the movie at home on HD. I guess that will answer the question about the 3D thing. in fact I enjoyed some of the 3D previews that I did the 3 D show.

","Any movie that begins with a 10 minute sob story is dumb, dumb, dumb. We went because we had heard UP was a great movie. I will admit the technology was pretty good, but the story ranged from unbelievable to awful. It was disjointed, more like a series of vignettes written by a whole bunch of different people and strung together for 90 minutes. It didn't flow and wasn't the least bit believable. At least Toy Story had a semi-credible story line and Finding Nemo made sense from beginning to end. We wasted $9 apiece for this piece of dreck! That said, the characters Kevin and Dug were humorous, but provided too little humor to carry the rest of the film. Ed Asner is the human voice of a dirge."
"okusandman","4","7","18","4 June 2009"," Adult themes and PG rating (nothing is sacred)
","I'm writing this primarily because of all of the reviews and comments that are playing down what is REALLY in this film with remarks like ""the beginning is a little sad"" or ""it's PG because of some slightly intense chase scenes but it's nothing"" - it's not fair to people who are doing their homework and trying to figure out if it's suitable for their young children. I've never before left anything close to a negative review about a Pixar movie. And even now this is not exactly negative, but it's truthful. I think they went a little too far with adult themes in this film, to the point that I will hesitate before rushing out to see another rated PG Pixar movie with my youngest child.<br/><br/>*****SPOILERS BEGIN HERE*****<br/><br/>The movie starts with the old man as a young boy. He meets a girl, they grow up, they get married. They aim to have children, they put a nursery together, and then - you see the wife sitting in a gynecologist office, and she is receiving news that she is infertile (some argue she had a miscarriage). She's crushed, and he promises her to fulfill their dream of going to South America, and they start a savings for this trip. Over the years, bad things happen, and each time they raid the trip fund. Carl finally realizes they are running out of time and buys the tickets in their old age. But Ellie ends up in the hospital and dies, never living her dream. Cut to now - Carl lives alone, and his home has become an island in a huge construction site. His view every day is dust and dirt, and construction workers and their vehicles. One day a vehicle bumps his mailbox and Carl bashes the worker who came to set it right in the head with his walker. Yes there is blood. He ends up in court, is declared a threat to society, and it is determined he will lose his home and be placed in a nursing home instead. By now I am thinking this isn't my idea of a good time, or a light afternoon with the kids. But I stayed, having faith it would turn around from there. The kid who ended up stowing away as Carl tried to escape his fate turns out to be a child of divorce who has been abandoned by his father. The two of them run into Carl and Ellie's childhood hero, and the hero turns out to be sadistic and deranged and the rest of the movie is spent with them being chased by this ""hero"" as he is trying to kill them. The one good dog Doug, spends the entire movie trying to get Carl to take to him. In spite of his harmless good nature, Doug is also targeted for abuse from Carl (much like the construction worker that was only trying to help). Carl growls at him to go away calling him a ""bad dog"" in a most cruel way, and kids cried as the dog slunk off with his tail between his legs. One little girl wailed But he's NOT a bad dog! He's a GOOD dog!! for ten minutes. The bird Carl and the boy were saving from the demented adventure guy is badly injured as she helps them escape, and she's a momma bird, and there are babies left (more abandonment) if Carl can't get them reunited. She ends up limping in a leg splint. The house itself is beat up, gutted, and almost burned down at one point, before it finally has to be sacrificed for the sake of saving everyone in the film. During the ""happy"" ending, you see the kid getting his promotion to senior scout, all the kids are standing there with dad, and he is there on stage alone. Granted Carl shows up to stand by the kid during this moment, but how many kids of divorced and absent parents do you think need this kick in the head to remind them of what they also don't have? Basically very little is left ""safe"" here - growing old, death, infertility, abandonment, broken promises, losing your home, court sentences, nursing homes, bad news from doctors, unfulfilled dreams, inability to get ahead, missing fathers, disillusionment, kids tied to chairs, birds with broken legs, babies left with no mother, mothers left without children. There are funny moments, and touching moments, but for me it wasn't enough to lift the heavy blanket of everything else that transpired. Of course, I had my little girl with me. I would look at her at times to see how she was taking the movie, and I'd see the bottom lip poking out, and she'd look up at me with those big soulful eyes, and suddenly I would want to wring the necks of the people who wrote certain plots of this film. But I never dreamed I would need to prescreen a movie from Pixar, and so I didn't, and this was where I went wrong. So in closing - how so many people are glossing over this stuff is beyond me. I've seen a few comments from people who feel like I do, so I know I'm not alone in my feelings that Pixar really went for the grown ups with this one. And plenty of adults are screaming about how much they like it, and I say of course they do, the film was written for them. But I think it came at too much of a cost in regards to the kids who have been cheated out of a movie that should have been geared more towards them. Someone speculated that maybe Pixar did it because wanted to be taken seriously- but as a result, I think they valued themselves more than they did the audience. And that's a sad thing to see."

","I (a 16 YO female)was personally really disappointed with ""Up"", as was my mom who saw it with me.

Well, turns out our time would have been better spent elsewhere.<br/><br/>I thought it was cute, but all the jokes were the ones where I would turn to my mom and tell her the punchline before the joke was halfway said, and about 40 minutes from the end told her what would happen, and she agreed.<br/><br/>In terms of ""Best Disney/Pixar Movie Ever Made"", I'm still waiting for something to top ""Finding Nemo."""

","Pixar, used to creating $200m hits were sure to slip one day and this is for sure it. I'm sure there will be a lot of investigations and soul- searching going on after this mess. <br/><br/>The film's basic idea is pretty lame, and then the execution is even worse. There were certainly some promising moments in the film. The couple's cute life in silent mode, the almost cute dog with his squirrel distractions. But they were more than overshadowed by the distractions like the Bird ???, the super-explorer turned villain and the little kid.<br/><br/>All in all quite a disaster, its like it was done by the Pixar trainees without one touch of supervision from the people who made the studio's mega blockbusters.<br/><br/>As an aside, I'm not sure IMDb can do much, but the fake high ratings and fake great reviews for this movie are unprecedented. But when your a studio with x million dollars to invest in marketing, hiring 50 interns for 4 months to write comments for you makes a lot of sense. But of course, as with any useless movie on IMDb. Go to the first entered 4 pages of comments to see the *real* opinions.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled, this movie is a disaster, and not your Finding Nemo or Wall-E."

","The blending of humor and drama did not mesh well. The story relies too heavily on serious undertones and moral values. Likewise, the comedic parts weren't that funny. The opening sequence was downright depressing, ending with the death of Carl's wife. Animated films should be epic (The Incredibles; Kung Fu Panda) or sidesplittingly comical (Finding Nemo). Up played like melodrama.<br/><br/>The sudden appearance of talking canines was unsettling, to say the least. Gamma, the pudgy bulldog, was the most amusing character of them all.<br/><br/>The house should have been made a floating fortress, with machine gun turrets, metal shielding, and the like. Perhaps a lightning rod would have been useful during the thunderstorm (best sequence of the entire film).<br/><br/>Charles Muntz is in pretty good shape for a centenarian (if Carl's 78, he's got to be close)."

The talking collars are maybe believable but come on. The hero of Carl's youth kills people who come to ""steal"" his elusive quarry Kevin? Just one more ""loss"" for Carl and the much missed Ellie. Why does Russell remind me of Dash, check his mouth. Why does the black father at the end look like Ice or whatever his name was in The Incredibles? What happened to Russel's father? Why is Carl there at the end and ""mom"" is sitting in the audience? They needed Russel to be an orphan and they couldn't come up with a story line for it. The whole no child section is just too much at the beginning.

But since so many people tries to shove it in my face to watch it, I decided to give it a try...<br/><br/>Even though I was sceptical as I began to watch it, I thought the beginning was pretty good... until they made a montage about their life. That was just stupid. I thought it would be so much more interesting to have a story about the love between those two, how it developed (but I know it wouldn't be about that, but still). The more I saw of the movie, the more I did not like it. It felt cheesy, and used a lot of annoying movie clichés. Kid follows old man even though he tries to get rid of him, the main person's child icon turns out to be evil, the characters manages to get out of unbelievably difficult situations out of pure luck, old man hates his followers and wants them to leave him but he gets attached to them near the end... there's just tons and tons of stupid clichés I can't stand. The movie doesn't even try to be original. But the worst thing of all, was the dumb, dumb ending before we see what happens to the old man and the boy. I am talking about after the house disappears, we see it has landed RIGHT EXACTLY IN THE PERFECT SPOT from the painting, and the camera zooms out to calm dramatic ending music... this moment was so cheesy, so utterly stupid, I felt like I was going to puke. No, really; I felt it coming down my throat. I found it THAT stupid. I admit, it WAS sort of entertaining. But it's way too serious for kids, and way too cheesy for adults.

","Pixar, who never seems to make a wrong step, steps right again! And this film shows no sign of a studio exhausted for ideas. This is one of their best films in fact. What I love about Pixar is their attention to detail, story, and treating their characters with respect. They make complex stories feel simple and effortless by the mastery with which they tell them. And on top of that, they dazzle the eyes and are just plain fun as all get out. When listening to how they developed the story for UP from the director's commentary on the DVD, I felt as if I as an audience member was being treated with respect and even being nurtured and cared for. They took great pains to bring something to life that would touch my soul and enchant me. Yes, UP has a few dark moments, but the undercurrent is sweet and hopeful, making the experience delightful through teary eyes. It is a must see. <br/><br/>One note of caution: because of the maturity of some of the subject matter, I would not recommend it for little little kids. Perhaps 5 and above would be a good start.

","When Carl was a little boy, he was fascinated with the daring exploits of Charles Muntz, the famous explorer. Then he met Ellie, and she shared Carl's passion for adventure. They had a long and happy life together, but now that Carl is alone, he doesn't want to do anything but be a grump. One day he meets a young scout named Russell and his life changes; maybe Carl has one more adventure in him, after all.<br/><br/>I'd heard this animated film was touching, and sure enough, ten minutes into it, I was reaching for a tissue and sobbing. The movie deals with love and loss, and adults who have experienced this may well get more out of the film than children will. It's all about doing what you always wanted to do and it's very good.<br/><br/>Ed Asner provides the voice of the old codger Carl and I liked him more than I thought I would. Christopher Plummer is the villain who's not really very menacing at all. The little boy, Russell, is a bit annoying in his helplessness and naiveté, but Dug, the dog is so adorable that I would see the movie again just for him.<br/><br/>While not quite as memorable as Pixar's ""Wall-E,"" this movie will leave you with a smile on your face and a lump in your throat."
"jaredmobarak","10","3","6","4 June 2009"," A land lost in time  Up
","Over the years, the studio has gone from heartfelt children's fare to more heady dramas—still with a youthful touch, but deeper and more resonate than your standard ""stick the kid in front of the screen and have quiet for a couple hours"". It began with Ratatouille, a tale so layered that you couldn't remember how vague and almost unappealing the trailer looked, followed by Wall-E, with its power of visuals and emotions overcoming the need for dialogue to tell a heartfelt love story. And now, in 2009, Disney/Pixar brings us one of their best yet with Up. The trailer and studio pedigree may have gotten me in the seat, but the story, barely touched upon in the teaser, is what kept me enraptured and wanting more.<br/><br/>Going in, I was truly unaware of what was in store. My minimal knowledge from the advertisements was that it would tell the story of an elderly, crotchety old gentleman named Carl Fredricksen and his adventures traveling the world in his house, elevated and transformed into a blimp by hundreds of helium-filled balloons. Oh, and about him warming up to the young Wilderness Scout Russell who finds himself on Carl's porch at the time of liftoff. However, right from the get-go, we see how much more Up is going to be. We are first introduced to a youngster in a movie theatre, watching newsreel footage of his hero Charles Muntz and the adventures he took to South America's Paradise Falls. This young boy pretends to be his idol and stumbles upon a kindred soul in Ellie, a little girl dreaming of adventure as well. Through a lovely montage, we watch as these two grow up and become Carl and Ellie: a couple in love, heart and soul.<br/><br/>What I love about Pixar is its ability to throw easy out the window and put the hardships and rough times of life on screen. Life is dirty and full of tragedy, but without those difficulties, the wondrous moments wouldn't be so worthwhile and memorable. Carl spies the money jar, he and his wife now very late in age, and decides to finally get two tickets to Venezuela and live their dream of traveling to South America. As happens, though, the moment he was going to surprise Ellie is the moment where she breaks down, needing to be hospitalized, soon passing on to the next world. Carl, without his better half, becomes a shut-in, wanting to be left alone in the house—the last piece of Ellie that he has. But, when an incident occurs, leading to his arrest and subsequent ruling to move to a nursing home, Frederickson decides to bring the house itself to Paradise Falls and once and for all do the thing he's wanted to for over half a century. And all this happens in just the first 30 minutes or so. There is no one that does cartoon exposition better than Pixar, their stories so intricate and endearing, every character—whether human, animal, or inanimate object come to life—becomes a fully realized creature.<br/><br/>When the actual adventure portion of the tale begins, you are already fully engrossed in the journey, feeling for Carl and his loss and subsequent need to flee. As any old person trying to be left alone does, he becomes short and unfriendly with young Russell once the boy is let inside the ""ship"", and with future acquaintances such as Dug the dog and Kevin the bird, he attempts to be uncompassionate to and unwanting of them. Events in his past will show why he feels this way, but the love we see that he had for his wife and fervor for life previously tell us that he will soon warm up to those around him as Up is not only a journey of adventure, but also of rediscovering one's reason for living. Carl's passion and need to get out and travel is reinvigorated once he acquires someone else to give his heart to.<br/><br/>Besides the wonderful story, Pixar once more shows how their studio is at the cutting edge of computer animation. They do not attempt to render realistic humans because they aren't trying to mimic live-action. Instead, they keep to a stylistic choice throughout, keeping a unique creativity while still holding a place in the real world. The filters used and authenticity to old photographs and scraps of newspaper in the Fredricksen's ""book of adventures"" is astonishing in its believability. I loved the aesthetic of Paradise Falls, including Kevin and his almost dinosaur-like bone structure, but completely bird exterior. Even the voice acting is inspired in its choices and successful across the board. Bringing in Ed Asner to handle Carl was a perfect marriage, giving the role a hard-edged growl, yet still allowing the softhearted soul to show when necessary. And young Jordan Nagai, playing Russell, is by far the best part of the film. His childlike naivety is believable and his speech pattern and boyish mannerisms allow the character to leap off the screen.<br/><br/>Disney's partnership with Pixar definitely kept alive one of the best film studios around. Whether Pixar would have survived to tell the stories it has on its own is a question we won't need to find an answer to. No one else would think to include dogs with collars that allow him or her to talk, let alone have it done in such a disjointed and easily distracted way. The constant train of thought changes when a squirrel or ball come into their view is priceless and the unorganized speech, calling to mind Yoda, really hits home as being exactly how I would have thought dogs would think. The filmmakers got every detail right and show once more why their studio is at the top of cinematic animation and very well could be at the top of cinema as a whole."
"Chris Knipp","7","3","6","3 June 2009"," Let's stop congratulating Pixar
","'Up's' plot-line plays with the Pixar films' cross-generational appeal by having an oldster and a kid as its main characters. It's a buddy picture about the voyage of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), a 78-year-old widower, and Russell (Jordan Ngai), a chubby eight-year-old Asian ""Wilderness Explorer"" who wants to earn an ""assisting the elderly"" badge. The movie ""teaches"" us that we can still realize our life-long deferred dream of exploring South American wilderness if we can just attach thousands of helium balloons to our house and sail away. It's hard to say if up to then Frederickson's life has been fulfillment or disappointment. His wife Ellie (Elie Docter) was a childhood playmate who dreamed of emulating an explorer named Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who has found a prehistoric bird in South America's Paradise Falls plateau. They never go very far. Ellie, alas, can't have children. One day when they're both in their senior years she falls down and shortly thereafter dies. Fredrickson has had a career as a balloon salesman.<br/><br/>The film sketches in the couple's life as sweetness and smiles, yet hints at a world of disappointment symbolized by Ellie's ""adventure"" scrapbook, which was never filled. Poor old Fredericksen won't move to a retirement home even though his little house is now surrounded by a vast loud construction zone. The demeaning practicalities of aging are depicted as something to escape from -- magically. When Fredericksen strikes an agent of the contractors and gets branded as a public menace he's somehow legally mandated to the old folks' home: this is the moment when he flies away, taking his house with him, with Russell a stowaway.<br/><br/>There's no doubt about the exhilaration of an aerial escape, or the charm of the bond that develops between the old man and his dutiful, plucky little sidekick. But Up gets into deep trouble wit the arrival of the dogs, dozens of them, with electronic flashing collars that enable them to talk in squeaky (or sometimes deep) voices, in various languages according to what button you push. Forgive me, but I didn't buy it, and I just didn't see the need. Mr. Fredericksen is sold to us initially as a pretty feeble old man and so the strength and vigor he develops in South America is hard to accept. There's something to be said for a story that ends with the awarding of an explorer scout patch for assisting the elderly. All Russell really wanted to do was help the old man across the street, -- or even just across his lawn.<br/><br/>I want to love Pixar films. Their animated features have moved from strength to strength. 'The Incredibles' was energetic and smart, 'Ratatouille' was witty and sophisticated, and 'WALL·E' was<br/><br/>transcendent and moving. Alas, Up does not live up to that standard.<br/><br/>The house of Pixar has been declared triumphant in the field. Denby of The New Yorker heralds Pixar animations as examples of ""moral fable"" and damns the old Disney ones as mere ""psychological fables"" marked by ""cloyingness"" and ""malevolent overtones."" Well, Up is full of cloyingness and weirdness, and the latter part of its adventure has its fair share of malevolence. Up is a hugely overblown fantasy whose point is lost in endless violations of the laws of biology and physics. Pixar has its ups and downs, features different writers and directors, and to typecast them is dubious. What they have in common is a technology and a look. The look is mainstream, as is the sensibility. If you want something more artistically or intellectually adventurous, you'll go to French animations like 'Persepolis' or 'Fantastic Planet' or F'ear(s) of the Dark;' 'The Triplets of Bellville' blows away the similarly dark American film 'Coraline.' Eastern European animations have a fresher look. The world of Japanese anime is rich, fantastic, and frequently very adult or sexual; it seems to capture the original, fantasmagoric world of comic books better than American comic-based films like the Batman franchise. Likewise graphic novel films like 'Frank Miller's Sin City' go far beyond the tame confines of Pixar or Disney. An adult animation like 'Waltz with Bashir' is in another league.<br/><br/>It's a bad start for 'Up' and not a step in the direction of technical or artistic innovation if you're forced, as you may be, to watch 'Up' in 3-D. The glasses, on top of your own, weigh upon and pinch your nose and the dimmed images with the planar levels they create are as flat and fake-looking as your grandmother's stereopticon slides. This Fifties movie gimmick with its chintzy throwaway plastic specs is unconvincingly heralded as the great new technology. It didn't do much for the creepy 'Coraline,' the fascistic 'U2/3D,' still less for the slipshod 'Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience,' and it only detracted from Zemeckis' watchable 'Beowulf.' 3-D is supposed to look incredibly real, but even granting this dubious claim, why use it for 'Up,' which flaunts its unreality? Its digital figures are like painted toys. Its Paradise Falls looks unabashedly like paper-mâché rocks and fake foam. The Pixar images pop out at you without the effect of 3-D imaging, the colors are brighter, and the experience is more absorbing. Why not let us use our own imaginations? <br/><br/>There's some thrill of adventure in this movie, and certainly the titillation of swooping flights and dives through space, as well as the time-honored animation scare of teetering on a precipice, and going into free fall only to be magically saved. But this, compared to the best Pixar films, gets lost in its gimmicks at the cost of a meaningful tale. Of course a travel yarn is just one thing after another anyway, and there's' no harm in an adventure with the moral of a good deed attacked to it. But that's just what it is, though: attached. And how much richer were the worlds of 'WALL·E,' 'Ratatouille,' and 'The Incredibles'! 'Up' has less to offer to adults than they did."
"mastahdekay","10","3","6","1 June 2009"," Best Animation of All Time
","While I don't regularly leave any comments or reviews for any movies in any kind of forum, this is one I could not resist to leave behind. While watching the trailers, I knew this movie would be big - but based on these trailers, I had no idea that the movie would entail so much drama and comedy. This movie was by far, the best animation I have ever seen. While I had always preferred to see non-human characters in animations, this is one that made an animated human figure more human than motion picture characters. And thus, it is perhaps one of the only movies that I could not resist keeping my tears from dripping. And this happened about 3 times in the movie - and even the short clip that played right before the actual movie!<br/><br/>I don't know if children would enjoy this as much as adults. Perhaps the whole story about the love life and dreams of an old man comes to me in a more realistic sense than would a 10 year old boy. But then again, it really makes me rethink about my dreams and love life, and I must say, this is something that I would recommend everyone to go watch right now in the theaters. If you are guy, don't watch it with your guy friends... If you are female, watch it with a guy so you can humiliate him when he tears up every now and then during the movie... <br/><br/>Pixar is just amazing.........."
"SpudV","10","3","6","1 June 2009"," Pixar Does It Again
","I don't know how Pixar does it, but their tenth movie is as good (or better?) than anything else they have released. I liked ""Up"" better than ""WALL-E"" as the latter seemed a little preachy, and I could not relate well to a beat-up robot, no matter how cute. With ""Up"" you had a widower/curmudgeon (I can relate to the latter!) surrounded by change when all he wants is to go back in time to the way things were. Events force him to make an unusual escape, hence the house flying by power of helium balloons.<br/><br/>I won't give away spoilers, but I will say that Pixar's success is due to their ability to portray relationships and their animation skills. Unlike other filmmakers, they will take out of the ordinary relationships and draw you in where you end up caring about what happens to them. It doesn't matter if it's toys, cars, fish, rats or even robots, the folks at Pixar excel at developing a story built around relationships.<br/><br/>I found myself getting misty-eyed (well, maybe a little more than that) at the first 12 or so minutes, not for the obvious part but simply for the beauty of how the story of Carl unfolded without words, just images. I knew the tragedy was coming, and perhaps that affected my view. The other part that hit me hard is when they found they could not have children, as my wife and I went through a similar thing. We decided to go the adoption route, something Carl takes his time on. ;) The special element to ""Up"" is the talking dog angle. It's what my wife and kids (all animal lovers) talked about walking back to the car. Pixar did not overdo it but integrated this masterfully. The Talking Dug stuffed animal should be a hot seller leading into the holidays, along with the DVD. I might even pay full price for this DVD.<br/><br/>Finally, the story centers on great adventures, the Spirit of Adventure. You'll find yourself wondering if and when you'll start your own adventure after the credits roll."
"D_Burke","9","3","6","30 May 2009"," A Movie Made for 3D Animation- Great Fantasy Film Overall
","I'll be honest. I was prepared to be disappointed when I went in to see this film. As I said in my review for ""Wall-E"" last year (which is at this link if you want to read it: ""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/usercomments-293""), Pixar is the only 3D animation studio that has not made a bad or even mediocre film yet. I was a bit skeptical about ""Up"" not because of the recent news that Disney is worrying about its commercial appeal, not because of the unrealistic plot elements (and there are some), but because after nine great movies, a misfire could be on the horizon. Fortunately, ""Up"" is far from a misfire. Like the other Pixar movies, it takes an intriguing, original plot line and creates a masterpiece of a story with humor and heart.<br/><br/>The main character of this story is someone who has the least potential to be made into an action figure, which is probably what is making Disney stockholders nervous as of the date this review is being written. Carl Frederickson is reminiscent of Peter ""Ralphie"" Billingsley (from ""A Christmas Story"" [1983]) as a child, and a cross between James Whitmore and Mr. Magoo as an elderly man. Although his image won't send kids flocking to toy stores, it doesn't really matter. Some great movies have been made with senior citizens as the main characters (""Cocoon"" [1985] and ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" [2002] come particularly to mind), and it's about time Disney make one.<br/><br/>The most appealing thing about Carl Frederickson is his character. From the moment he appears on screen, audiences immediately get a sense of his happy times and times of loneliness through a clever series of montages in the beginning. There were probably many old men in Hollywood who could have supplied his voice, but Ed Asner was perhaps the best choice. Asner gives Frederickson a voice that is curmudgeonly without being too off-putting, similar to his Lou Grant character from 1970's TV.<br/><br/>In the first 20 minutes of the movie, you grow such an attachment to Mr. Frederickson that you can't help but feel like cheering when his house takes off with the help of balloons he spent all night blowing up. Therein lies the point of the movie where you really have to suspend disbelief. Of course this number of balloons can't pick up an entire house, let alone be blown up in one night without really careful planning. And if you spend too much time wondering how the floor of the house didn't stay on the ground, along with the pictures and other breakable assets in the dwelling, you will miss the point of the movie, not to mention the fun of it. The house is really a symbol of seeking new adventures while hanging on to where you came from all along, at least at first.<br/><br/>The basic premise expands with the addition of Wilderness Explorer (or Boy Scout, minus the legal ramifications) Russell, arguably the Donkey to Mr. Frederickson's Shrek (sorry, Disney, but it's true). Russell is a very funny character, and doesn't miss a beat from the moment he comes on screen reading his Explorer book verbatim. The two main characters played off each other very well with witty dialogue and precise comic timing. Take away the comic relief of the talking dogs, and the down-to-the-hair strand awesome CGI animation, and you'd still have a great film with these two characters alone. The Russell character simultaneously adds a lot of well-needed heart to the film, actually making even me feel bad for the potential extinction of the otherwise annoying bird companion Kevin.<br/><br/>In an emerging subplot, Kevin the bird is hunted down by a Charles Lindbergh/Howard Hughes-inspired adventurer named Charles Muntz, voiced with the right touch of menace by Christopher Plummer. The Muntz character is perhaps the first Disney villain who you don't want to be a villain, especially after seeing the faux newsreel clips in the beginning of the movie. He's a self-made man who's spent his life chasing a dream, sort of like Mr. Frederickson is by dragging his house to South America. He's also killing a bird that many, including Frederickson, finds annoying. However, if it hadn't been for the perfect moral balance between him and Russell, it would have been very hard to root for Mr. Frederickson until the end.<br/><br/>The movie, on the whole, is probably more over-the-top than any other Pixar film made to date. You know many kids in America have a toy collection as diverse as the ones Andy has in ""Toy Story"", and that humans could create a smart robot like ""Wall-E"" someday. But anyone who spends their time wondering how Mr. Frederickson planned to survive after moving his house to the South American clip, or how the hose he's pulling doesn't break off the house, is missing a great fantasy adventure with many awe-inspiring takes on life. To paraphrase the theme song to ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"": ""If you're wondering how he eats and breathes, and other science facts, repeat to yourself 'It's just a show, and I should really just relax'."" On a personal note, having just lost a grandparent who, in the last years of her life, refused to go to a nursing home because she loved the house she had lived in for nearly 40 years, I'm sure the setup of the story will strike familiar tones with many older audience members. I know it did with me, which is why the film was so touching and heartfelt from beginning to end. Hey, I may even be in that situation one day where I love a house so much I would even consider flying it away. If I actually considered doing it, I would hope that 50 years from now they would have more advanced flying equipment to do it with."

","I went into this film amazingly enough knowing absolutely nothing about it except that it was Pixar's newest release, that it was 3D, and of course that it was called UP. I have to say Pixar tops itself again. As a fan of traditional 2D animation, 3D animated films have always been a rough pill to swallow. Even if I really like them I still have a twinge of despair that they are in the 3D medium. I don't want to say that I am completely transformed and now love 3D, but Pixar always does a great job in lessening that pain.<br/><br/>I found Up to be a very heartwarming film. We got a glimpse of Pixar trying to play with the heartstrings in Wall-E, but they definitely have some far more emotional moments in Up. But with the great laughs and story included. I found it to be a fantastic ride that will have you almost in tears one minute and then laughing out loud the next. Great story. Great voice actor. And great Animation. Well done Pixar.<br/><br/>If anyone could get a stubborn old traditionalist like me to enjoy a 3D film, it's you..."

From the miscarriage of a child and message of not being able to have children, to the death of his wife, to the burning of his house and being shot at by the explorer trying to kill him and his friend, this movie has so many inappropriate things for children. Lucklly some children will not be able to figure this all out for themselves. But if they are like my son, they will be asking you questions all the way home.

"howaboutno-995-310366","1","12","42","8 May 2014"," Why I personally believe this movie is trash.
","I, like many others have heard marvelous reviews on the movie Up. But I was extremely let down so much that I was unable to even finish the film. I stopped it when Carl trashed Ellie's memory completely.<br/><br/>The movie was meant to portray their relationship as something strong and special. Throughout the first half of the movie Carl has been fiercely trying to protect their home which he refers to as his wife. But, that all changes when Russell, the very annoying, spoiled, obnoxious child takes off. Carl decides in a split second to take everything inside his house (which hold ALL of his memories of his wife and their time together) and toss them out of his house via the front door and windows resulting in everything being broken.<br/><br/>That scene destroyed the whole meaning of the movie for me. I couldn't connect at all with Carl or care for him in any way. There were many ways that Carl could have followed Russell without ruining the only thing he had left of Ellie.<br/><br/>What message are we honestly teaching our children these days? If you have something special that was given to you by a deceased loved one that it's okay to completely and utterly destroy it?<br/><br/>There was a great deal of other things that I didn't like either. Like the relationship between Ellie and Carl in the beginning. I dislike the impression given to me on that first day. Ellie is very loud and obnoxious and really has no regard for Carl. She forces him into a dangerous situation that results in him breaking his arm. She then sneaks into his room that same day, but not to see if he's all right. Instead she shows him her adventure book and then forces him to promise to fulfill her dream of going to Paradise Falls. Then afterwards we watch them grow through wordless scenes that are difficult to connect with due to the fast pace and lack of detail.<br/><br/>Another scene that was meant to be emotional but fell short was when Carl was prosecuted as a 'menace' for cutting a guy's forehead. It wasn't explained very well at all and why would he be forced into an old people's home? The worker DESTROYED his property and when Carl was trying to retrieve it the worker FOUGHT him for it. So the worker was in the wrong much more than Carl. It was just such a bizarre scene that left me going... wait... what?<br/><br/>I also dislike how Carl left for his adventure. The movie portrays the couple constantly trying to get to Paradise Falls. Then she dies and Carl doesn't get inspired by Ellie. The ONLY reason he left was to run away from the authority. He was forced into that situation and then decided to leave. There was no special meaning to it or heartwarming connection.<br/><br/>Personally, I believe they didn't even need the scene of him smacking that worker on the head. Why couldn't Carl decide on his own to complete their adventure? Why did he have to be backed into a corner in order to finally leave?<br/><br/>I also disliked the scene when Carl meets the man he has idolized his whole life, Charles. But he doesn't bother telling him about the bird even though Charles was humiliated and had spent his whole life trying to find the bird in order to return his pride.<br/><br/>Carl chose to hide the bird instead of revealing it to Charles who, at this point, hadn't shown any sinister qualities. How does that make ANY sense? They could have played that scene completely different and ended with the same result. Carl could have tried to help his 'hero' (which would have made a ton more sense) and tell him about the bird. But explain that it has babies, and that Charles should take them all together. Charles could have demanded to know where the bird is, and Carl could explain that the bird trusts them and so it'd be easier if they go alone to get it. And then Charles could go crazy and believe that Carl is trying to steal his glory. You get the exact same result, but it makes much more sense.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a kids movie. I do understand that, but I have a limit and other parents should too. There is no lesson to be learned in this movie. It's just another story poorly portrayed and bunched together. It's something to waste time and distract your kids with pretty colors and funny scenes, but nothing more."

","My wife and I saw Up in 3D last night. Just us 2 adults, no kids. We have seen most of the animated features in recent years and liked most of them. I thought Up was decent, not great, but OK. My wife HATED it!<br/><br/>I agree with pretty much everything *negative* that has been said on this board about the movie, but I haven't seen mentioned the thing that bothered my wife the most: there are NO female characters past the first few minutes! The only female (human) even in the movie is Elie, very briefly as a tomboyish child in the very beginning, then as an adult in a short, silent montage. So by 5 minutes in, it's all guys. I guess the bird was female, but that fact is so far from obvious that she gets named ""Kevin"" by the little boy. (Maybe some of the dogs were female too, but you couldn't tell.) I didn't even notice the lack of female energy until my wife pointed it out but it's true, and I think it contributes an overall imbalanced feel of the movie.<br/><br/>As for the 3D, I thought the scenery was very nicely done, but the overall use of 3D was more subtle than many other 3D movies. I don't remember any ""coming out at you"" shots at all; most of the 3D images were at or behind the screen rather than in front of it. I think this may be why many have commented that they didn't even notice the 3D. Also there were too many ""flat"" scenes that might as well have not been in 3D, such as long closeups of items in a scrapbook and long segments of black and white old newsreel style footage on a TV screen.<br/><br/>So I'll average my 7 opinion with my wife's 1 and say 4 out of 10."

","Up was definitely a good, quality movie. The visuals and landscapes were very bright, defined, and full of wonderful detail and description. Easily the best aspect of this movie, story-wise, was the early montage showing Carl moving through life from a young child, to marriage, older adulthood, up through the death of his wife. Though you didn't know this character too well at this point, you felt for him rather deeply by seeing his life progress, start to end. This flow of life from childhood to old age is an immediately identifiable aspect of the movie. Anyone with a depth of personality and a reflective side, can identify with this. It is Film-making at it's best. We all know the feeling. The vibe and feel one gets when at weddings, graduations, funerals and any place at which one can be witness to the fast flowing nature of life and the reflection that naturally comes with such moments.<br/><br/>Unfortuntaley the rest of the film did not live up to the emotional weight that this scene created. The movie took turns for the inane and silly, without enough in place to ""ground"" it to the worthy beginning. The bird Kevin was sort of random and odd, as was the talking pack of dogs. These 2 plot creations would seem to be mainly geared towards the child audiences that any animated film is sure to garner. The weight and meaning from the beginning was lost in these campy moments.<br/><br/>Carl's hero, Mintz, as an aged, obsessed, evil, egomaniac seemed to be out of nowhere as well. It appeared to be like something out of a week-day cartoon. The movie again lost its direction and focus during these parts, particularly as Carl was attempting to get his house over to the falls. Once you make it within eye sight of the falls, you're there! As the film ended, some emotional, weighty moments did occur, culminating in Carl's friendship with Russell and the pictures shown during the end credits. There were not enough of these moments and too many moments that went for the ""silly"", specifically scenes with the dogs, the birds, and, Mintz.<br/><br/>I definitely understand the affinity for this film, yet I do not feel, when taking into consideration the loss of focus and random/silly moments in the film, the drive to describe this movie as one of the best Pixar movies of all time. Ratatouille, Wall-E, The Incredibles, for starters, were all more complete and quality films with more of a consistent flow, from cover to cover."
"nichtssagend","4","3","7","17 December 2009"," Way overrated
","The first 10 minutes are great and heartfelt, but the rest of the movie is just standard kiddie-animated-action-movie fare, but without any really funny gags or interesting or quirky characters. It seems for a lot of people the central premise/moral of the story touches a nerve, but that one idea alone isn't enough to lift the movie above an average rating.<br/><br/>The animation is very good, as one has come to expect from Pixar, but sorry, the bar has been raised - in 2009 this level of quality has become the norm, i.e. average.<br/><br/>The character development is good for Carl Fredricksen, but lacks depth for Russell and also for Charles Munts. Carl is really the only person in the movie who you kind of get attached to, but again, mainly due to the first 10 minutes montage of his life.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't contain a lot of humour - the one it does have seems forced and silly (dog voice collars, the bird swallowing Carl's walking stick, etc. - yawn). This movie is nowhere near the league of Pixar greats ranging from Toy Story to Wall-E. For other studios this might be considered good, but for Pixar I would consider it average at best."
"Mrswing","6","3","7","3 November 2009"," Beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, technically marvelous... but too inconsistent
","Up has some of the saddest moments ever seen in an animated feature since Bambi, great visuals, wonderful imagination, some great gags (though not as many as in other Pixar films), and a positive message. <br/><br/>So why wasn't I swept up in it? <br/><br/>I had real problems with plot holes and character development, this time around. The appearance of the fantastic in a fairly realistic story (hoisting the house up by the balloons) was too big a leap for me. And Carl's conflicts with boyscout Russell, snipe Kevin and dog Doug felt sort of gratuitous, though my wife pointed out correctly that his problem was he didn't want to admit anything new into his life after his wife died. But then, the conflict with the builders wasn't the best way to get that point across (better if Carl lived in a wonderful neighborhood but shut everyone out of his life, instead of living in a situation where he was a clear victim). Similarly, once he meets Kevin and Doug, it's just bizarre he doesn't use them to help him get the house to Paradise Falls (as they both were clear assets in that respect). Finally, hero-turned-villain Charles Muntz should have been far older than Carl (at least 35 years between them) and his 'heel turn' was so extreme and so illogical, it just didn't fit the theme of the film. <br/><br/>Though it would have been an extreme downer, the film would have made more sense if it had been the fantasy of an old man about to be shipped off to the living hell of a retirement home. But that would have sent all audiences home in a state of depression... <br/><br/>It's clear to me that Pixar should develop an animated feature project intended primarily for an adult audience. Twice, now (here and in WALL-EE) they take mature subject matter with a real edge, and then they back away from taking it as seriously as they should. And end up with a manipulated feel-good ending, which diminishes the film as a whole (unlike, say, Toy Stories 1 and 2, Finding Nemo and The Incredibles)."

","The only reason I give this is a 5 is because the short (Partly Cloudy) that preceded ""UP"" is immensely enjoyable. It is also the highlight of the whole experience.<br/><br/>Up starts with a seemingly cheerful and cute story of boy meets girl. Unbelievably that lasts an entire 5 minutes! Cute story comes to a tragic conclusion and we're left watching a grumpy old man and a retarded fat kid for the rest of this saccharine-infused drudgery.<br/><br/>The funny parts aren't that funny. The bird isn't funny, the dogs aren't, and the retarded kid certainly isn't. One gets smiles, but no belly laughs. Bad guy isn't bad enough. The tension is telegraphed and insipid. The only laughs I heard in the cinema, after the brilliant initial short, came from a 3 year old in front of me, and it was seldom at that. Her bigger sister wasn't laughing. And for anyone older than 5, their brains must seriously be challenged to think any of it more than mildly amusing.<br/><br/>After the hype and the obviously mindless appreciation shown by so many reviewers everywhere, I thought it was time someone set the record straight.<br/><br/>Where's the excitement of The Incredibles, the dialogue of Finding Nemo or the warped humour of Monsters Inc.?

","PIXAR has done it again! They've mixed in: a funny idea, state-of-the-art animation, wonderful characters and a heartwarming story.<br/><br/>This movie is really a triumph. Starting with Carl and Ellie's love story and their life together and continuing with Russell, the good hearted little boy who really just wants to help Carl; you really embrace the main characters in an incredible way in the first few minutes of the film. I'm not going into any further detail about the plot, wouldn't want to ruin it for anybody.<br/><br/>The animation is flawless, the amount of detail that they go into is unbelievable, it is incredible how now you can actually almost feel textures. A perfect example of this is when you see Carl's stubby two day beard. Amazing! <br/><br/>This movie is for big and little kids as well, I went to see it with a buddy of mine from work and we laughed through the entire film, and we're both in our 30's.<br/><br/>This film is, without a doubt, one of PIXAR's best yet!"
"JasonGOrtiz","10","3","7","7 June 2009"," Oh, Pixar!
","You've ruined the way I look at movies! <br/><br/>I mean, after 2001 I found it impossible to watch any animated feature and not compare it to the the breathtakingly beautiful visuals, flawless storytelling & inspired creativity of ""Monsters Inc"". Even Dreamworks' best entries into the animated feature category, great movies like ""Over The Hedge"" and ""Shrek"", could never quite reach the bar that you selfishly set so high.<br/><br/>Damn you Pixar!<br/><br/>If that wasn't bad enough, within the last few weeks I saw ""Wall-E"" for the first time, AND was able to see ""UP"" the day it came to theaters.<br/><br/>Well, not only can I not watch an animated movie without comparing it to everything you've put out, I now can't watch ANY MOVIES without comparing them to your work.<br/><br/>STOP IT!! You're setting the bar WAY too high! <br/><br/>How in God's name are filmmakers supposed to compete with something as perfect as ""Wall-E""? And then follow it up with something that's just as good, but totally fresh and different as ""Up"" is? It's just not fair! <br/><br/>OK, I got a little carried away. But Pixar is definitely due it's praise. ""Up"" is, much like ""Wall-E"", a complete movie in every sense of the word. There's really nothing missing. Within the first 15 or 20 minutes, you've already laughed, cried and everything in between. THIS is what going to the movies is all about.<br/><br/>The story that unfolds in ""Up"" is engaging and as far from boring as possible. The plot is always moving forward at just the right pace, telling it's story in such a creative way that you almost have to pause and think ""How the heck did they think of that?!"" It does deal with some pretty heavy subject matter and could have potentially crossed over into territory a little too dark for a ""family"" movie. But it's handled with such care and sensitivity that it never feels inappropriate. The montage in the opening moments, detailing the relationship between the main character and the love of his life, is so moving that it could crack even the most stone-hearted viewer.<br/><br/>The characters here are what really stand out to me. They are presented with as much depth and detail as any flesh and blood actor can convey. Pixar has never shied away from creating characters with layered personalities, complete with shortcomings and flaws. It's this ""real"" approach to character development that makes you forget you're watching an animated movie. While you may not have experienced the exact situation that confronts Mr. Fredrickson, the film's elderly protagonist masterfully voiced by Ed Asner, the emotions that he expresses are immediately and profoundly relatable. Even in moments that find him doing his best ""Grumpy Old Man"" routine, you never question his intentions or stop rooting for him. The other central characters, Russell (An eager wilderness scout looking to earn his final badge by helping Mr. Fredrickson) and Dug (A canine that has been given the ability to articulate his thoughts into clear, albeit goofy English) both provide well-placed comic relief and end up fitting perfectly into Fredrickson's world. Both are have their own minor subplots, that give depth and credibility to each. I found the one dealing with Dug's conflict between allegiance to his original ""master"" or doing what is clearly the ""right thing"" to do, particularly effective. Kevin, a flightless female (No, that's not a typo!) bird who is the mother to a few little fledglings, is brilliantly brought to life without ever speaking a word and adds some emotionally gripping moments. She also happens to be one of the most hilarious characters I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this: ""Up"" is just really fun to watch. It's equal parts moving, funny and exciting. It's pure fantasy that feels real. It picks you up out of your chair, strips away that part of your adult self that blinds you from the true wonders of life and for an hour and a half it allows you to see the world as a kid again. It's more than just a movie.<br/><br/>After I left the theater, I couldn't help but be reminded of how I would feel after experiencing Spielberg's early work when I was a kid. When I saw ""E.T."" for the first time at 5 years old, it was all I could think about for the next few weeks! I would replay it in my mind over and over again, reliving every moment of excitement, heartbreak and sheer joy. As I sit here, a month from turning 30, I have to admit that unfortunately that type of experience has become all too rare. But for the second time in as many years, Pixar has managed to relight that passion in me. I am forever grateful for that.<br/><br/>Thank you Pixar."
"Fatmadxb","10","3","7","5 June 2009"," Beautiful movie, recommended for everyone.
","I'm a movie junkie, but I was never a fan of animated ones (3D). Even if they were PIXAR's work I'd usually be a bit disappointed. But when I saw the trailer for UP I just had a feeling that this would be PIXAR's best. I went to watch it today with my whole family, age ranging from 5 years old to 50 years old. And I swear that everyone enjoyed it.<br/><br/>At first I thought it would be the happy animated movie everyone enjoys to watch. But it was deeper than that, it had a message that I believe touched all the audience.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Mr.Frederickson life story with his beloved wife. They shared everything from love to dreams. They always dreamed to have a great adventure in South America. But in the end it was just a dream, and time passed by, as they got old together, and unfortunately his wife passes away. The story of their love is remarkably touching I am 18 years old but I still shed a tear, and my heart ached me.<br/><br/>Later on Mr.Frederickson sets his mind on achieving his wife's and his own dream by flying all the way to paradise falls. But with a pleasurable surprise Russell a young wilderness explorer tags alone. We see their fantastic adventures as they head to their destination. Throughout it they meet many friends a dog called doug and a bird called Kevin.<br/><br/>They move bravely through the obstacles to reach to Mr.Frederickson's dream destination.<br/><br/>Over all this movie gives you more than a few laughs, smiles and tears.<br/><br/>It gives out an important message that friendship does not have any limits, dreams can always be achieved, tomorrow is always a new adventure and mostly it teaches you to let go of the past but not to forget it.<br/><br/>This movie has it's very own special place on my list of favorite movies. I truly loved it and recommend everyone to watch it."

","Two very unexpected things happened to me while viewing ""Up."" First, I cried. I actually found myself misty-eyed over an opening set piece in which our hero meets, marries and loses his wife to old age. There is no dialogue in this sequence. The entire story is told in images and music. I had no expectation of being so moved by a ""kid's movie."" The second unexpected thing that happened to me? I grinned with delight. As our hero lifted off into the sky in his floating house, held aloft by thousands of balloons, I had to resist the urge to squeal like a small child. The scene was so well animated, and the idea seemed so inspired, it was as if every shred of cynicism I had about movies was vaporized. ""That's right, movies CAN be magical!"" I thought. ""Up"" will dare you to enjoy the movies the way you did as a child. It will also remind you that kid's movies can have substance and still entertain young, easily distracted minds. Pixar has somehow managed to produce nothing but quality films over the past decade, despite being powered by a multi-billion dollar corporation most associate with overzealous commercialism."
"diac228","10","3","7","30 May 2009"," Pixar delivers yet again. They must be cheating or somet---Squirrel!
","However they do it, whether it is by steroids, stem cell, Egyptian secrets, Babylonian water, or selling their soul to some monster, Pixar has been providing hit after hit, success story after success story since 1995. Surely they don't profit as much as their rival Dreamworks, but Pixar's films have lasting appeal that can and will span decades and generations to come. I severely doubt a century from now we'll remember Shrek or Madagascar the same way. Pixar's strategy has always been top provide tugs at the heartstrings for every time they deliver a laugh. This mix of comedy and drama has served them well in the past, with Finding Nemo and the Toy Story films being the absolute best examples. Up on the other hand, has overwhelmingly more drama and sad moments than laughs. If you can survive this little shift of film-making from Pixar, then you are in for a treat. Up is yet another grand film from the company that seems to do no wrong and it has great appeal for moviegoers of all-ages.<br/><br/>Up is about Carl Fredrickson, a retired bitter old man whom is still reeling from the loss of his wife. Since children, they had a dream about going to Paradise Falls, a secluded location in South America. In her honor, Carl heads out on a quest to South America using his house, and thousands of balloons. Accidentally accompanying him is Russell, a trusty boy scout. Along the way, they'll meet all sorts of characters and more adventure than they could have ever imagined. Written by Bob Peterson (Responsible for Finding Nemo, need I say more?), the film explores themes of loneliness, letting go, life and friendship. The script excels with plenty of adventure, funny moments, and sentimental moments that will make you sniffle a bit.<br/><br/>Forget 3-D. It's a stupid trend that will soon go away. The movie looks absolutely beautiful in 2-D and does not need any special effects for it to be appreciated. The people and animals themselves are composed of different shapes, representing their personality. Unlike in other non-Pixar efforts, realism (in terms of people) wasn't attempted, instead focus was on detail. The movie is amazingly detailed, but the production didn't demand as much complicated animation like in Wall-E and Ratatouille. Nonetheless, the film looks great, and yet again proves that Pixar is on top of the animation heap.<br/><br/>The main strength of Up lies in the action and its characters. The film has plenty of exciting and perilous moments that keep you guessing how it's going to end. And then, there are the hilarious characters. Carl himself is likable, but doesn't provide as many laughs as Russell, and the eventual animals that are involved in their quest (especially the hilarious dog Dug with the special collar). Up falls more into the category of The Incredibles rather than Wall-E or Ratatouille because of its immense amount of peril. There's nothing wrong with that, just telling you it's not the Pixar fare you've seen in recent years.<br/><br/>Like previously stated though, Up is a very tough pill to swallow in terms of its dramedy. The first ten minutes of Up are among the most heart-wrenching in recent memory, and towards the climax we have another moment in which you can't help but feel that lump in your throat. This sort of heavy sentiment has not been present in any non-Pixar animated film this decade, not even Shrek. It is hard to make a cranky selfish old man likable or sympathetic, but like in Finding Nemo with Marlin, knowing the past definitely clears all confusion and answers all the questions we would ask about their challenging personality.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Pixar strikes gold yet again, and in the form of a very creative story about an old man searching for adventure. All the elements that worked in all the Pixar films of the past are present here, and associated with a superb musical score by Michael Giacchino. The only reason you wouldn't like this film is if you don't like Pixar at all---in which afterwards it will be followed by questions concerning your taste in film. Ranking this film, I'd place it somewhere between The Incredibles and the original Toy Story as one of the 5 best they've ever released. How do they do it? It has to be steroids, there's no other explanation.<br/><br/>When you're with Pixar, the quality of film has nowhere to go but Up.<br/><br/>Highly recommend."

"moviesleuth2","6","4","11","30 May 2009"," Solid Pixar movie, but not there with the greats
","Toy Story. Finding Nemo. Wall-E. Based on its pedigree, it is not unreasonable to go into a Pixar movie with high expectations. However, Pixar's newest film is a disappointment compared with its past efforts. That being said, a less-than-expected Pixar movie would not be construed to mean that UP is a bad film. It's good, but not great.<br/><br/>Carl Fredrickson (Edward Asner) is a fan of the famed explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). His friend and future wife Ellie, is also a fan. Together, they plan to go to Paradise Falls, just like their hero. However, circumstances prevent them from doing so, and after Ellie's death (and the inevitable future of a nursing home), Carl gets his chance. However, he has an unexpected stowaway: a Wilderness Explorer (think Boy Scouts) named Russell (Jordan Nagai).<br/><br/>The film works, I guess, but it's plagued by a number of problems. FIrst and foremost, it has some logical deficiencies. The premise of ""Up,"" a senior citizen traveling to South America in his house lifted into the sky via thousands of helium balloons (the size of balloons that one would get at the zoo), requires a sizable suspension of disbelief. I had no problem with that, or with any unbelievable acts associated with it (such as a senior citizen and a boy who couldn't be more than 10 pulling the house by themselves). I did think about them, but I was willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt. However, I was not able to ignore the film's handling of the villain. I couldn't understand why he did anything that he did in the film (I'm treading carefully to avoid giving away anything). The villain acted in ways to service the story. This severely hurts the film because it runs with the idea that didn't work in the first place.<br/><br/>More importantly, it fails to really connect with the viewer. Pixar films like ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Toy Story"" worked because they established a connection between the viewer and the characters. ""Up"" tries, but ultimately fails to do so. The film is all about adventure, but except for one scene, the film failed to get that energy flowing through me.<br/><br/>At least the voices are good. Edward Asner makes a good Carl Fredrickson. He acts exactly like a cantankerous old man, complete with the cane and arthritis. However, he does grow a heart. Newcomer Jordan Nagai is excellent as Russell. Russell is an energetic young kid, but he has a tendency to talk nonstop. Carl finds him irritating, and the dialogue is hilarious. Christopher Plummer is unrecognizable as Charles Muntz, the famed adventurer, and that's all I'll say. The best vocal work goes to Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog. He's hysterical. If a dog could talk, I'm positive it would sound exactly like Dug.<br/><br/>I won't stop you from going to see ""Up."" It's fun, but don't expect another ""Wall-E."""

The movie actually has a lot of material that will keep younger audience more than satisfied, ""Up"" will very much appeal to older viewers. This project is very dynamic, and has really a lot going on in it, but at no time does it lose control or dynamic. The movie was fantastically organized and designed, and definitely everything happens in proper timing. What I think is also very good feature of this project, and directly responsible for its success is that it focuses on a small number of characters.

","I'm sure my review will go unnoticed, as i've listed it as a 5/10, but I couldn't help but put my 2 cents in on this one.<br/><br/>I have a love/hate relationship with this movie. It really was good, great effects/graphics, great characters, some humorous parts.....but, I was constantly being reminded of how endlessly depressing the story line is.<br/><br/>I marked this as ""spoiler"", but again, if you don't want the movie spoiled then I wouldn't continue reading.<br/><br/>I am a 23 year old male, who has been brought up in a ""tough"" world. I've been raised to believe that a man who cries is a weak man, therefore, I rarely shed tears or openly show remorse. This movie may have brought out years of held back emotion. The writers of this movie did a satisfactory job of dragging you into the story, and making you realize how much the main character and his wife are in love. They basically don't have anything in life but each other. And in the story not only does the wife die, but it even points out that the couple were unable to have kids. While I realize these are parts of life, they probably don't belong in a children's movie.<br/><br/>Probably 15 minutes into the movie, I can't even see the screen because i'm fighting back tears as if my OWN wife had just passed away. Then, just when I think the movie can't get any more depressing, here comes a scene where a construction worker is assisting another while backing up a truck. The worker tries to stop the other from running over the old mans mailbox (which the movie emphasizes that he and his wife made, with their hand prints in paint on the side). After seeing his mailbox get ran over, the old man becomes enraged in trying to keep the worker from touching/fixing it, and accidentally ""bonks"" the worker on the head. At this point i've given up holding back tears, and i'm crying like an infant. Then the man is forced to go to court, where he is THEN forced to vacate his house (the house him and his wife fixed up and lived in almost their entire lives).<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the old man stares into pictures of him and his wife, ensuing melancholy music and depressing expressions.<br/><br/>I realize the movies motive, and realize that it gets upbeat for the most part later on, but it is extremely difficult to get over the first 30 minutes (or so) of this movie.<br/><br/>A lot of people would say that this isn't a children's movie...but I beg to differ. I think it should be strictly viewed BY children, as most of them probably wouldn't understand the glaring depressive vibe this movie gives off. At the end I probably had red eyes and a smile on my face, but I still cannot get over the chilling first half of the movie."

When I came out, you better believe I was satisfied.<br/><br/>The reason Up is this good is not only because it is hilarious, but at times it touches your heart.<br/><br/>Also, there is a character that pretty much everyone will love. Carl Fredericksen, a grumpy, yet sweet old man, was amazing. Russel, an 8 year old Boy Scout determined to get every badge, was one of the funniest characters. The child actor was great.<br/><br/>If you have a dog, or any pet for that matter, then Dug, a talking Mafia dog outcast from his peers, is for you. His facial expressions and funny lines make him lovable. Whereas with Kevin, a giant bird looking to find her baby chicks to save them, is just plain sweet.<br/><br/>Overall, at times, Up was as magical as traditional Disney films, sometimes intense, sometimes emotional, but always entertaining and always hilarious.<br/><br/>Pixar certainly knew what they were doing."

I rest my case. <br/><br/>Okay, to be fair, maybe most kids won't notice the love story, the illness, the dying and that's fine, but this is not the Disney I came to know through the years. Not at all. <br/><br/>The story continues and things happen and you forget about Ellie for about 2-minutes; then Carl, who always has Ellie on his mind, remembers something about her and there you are again reaching for the Kleenix. I must say it is astounding how fast we latch onto the deep love emotion and at every reminder of Ellie we are reaching for those pop-ups. We just don't like to see good people sad, even if they are cartoon characters. <br/><br/>Later on in the story we meet Charles Muntz (Plummer) an Explorer type who is on the search for a bird no one believes exists. And, we have talking dogs. When Muntz mentions out loud that meeting Mr. Fredrickson (Carl) is a real treat the dogs go wild. This was a funny scene with Muntz saying he has to be careful about using that word. I'd say it was the funniest scene in the movie. The dogs do provide some humor at times. <br/><br/>The voice of the dog, Alpha, was also supposed to provide some humor, but at times Alpha sounded like one of the Chipmunks and at other times, when Muntz adjusts the electronics in the collar, he sounded like.well, I really don't know. With either voice he was very difficult to understand. So much for humor there. <br/><br/>Oh, when Carl lifts the house UP into the air Russell (Nagai), a Cub Scout, looking to win a merit badge for helping elderly people, comes along too. I suppose he was supposed to be comic relief, (Carl is depicted as a grumpy old man), but the dogs win this hands down. Russell is used to move the story to places Carl doesn't want to go at times. Russell hopes his father, who he rarely sees, will finally make one of the Scout presentations. The father never shows. Where's that box? See?<br/><br/>Why would I watch an animated cartoon again? Wall-e was a disaster, so why? I had to see what others saw in here that prompted it to be nominated for Best Picture. I now know these people are useless and crazy, and I will never watch another animated cartoon movie even if, by law, it is the one movie I must watch before I die. I'll go along with Animated Feature category, but not Best Picture. Best Picture? No, let's leave Best Picture to the humans, not animations. Give me a break. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

","Carl Fredricksen (Asner) sets out to Paradise Falls to fulfil his life long dream by tying thousands of balloons to his house, but is unaware of Russell (Nagai) on his porch.<br/><br/>The only way is up for Pixar. We say it year after year but there is simply no stopping the mighty animators from producing yet another masterful picture.<br/><br/>Last year Wall-E brought about their biggest ever gamble by reducing the dialogue to a minimum and telling the story through physical humour and scene settings with enough semiotics to appreciate the earth's decline.<br/><br/>And now there is Up. The first 3D picture to open Cannes film festival went down a treat with critiques and fans alike and now in cinemas across the world smashing records once more, they really have soared.<br/><br/>I must confess, seeing the trailer I was slightly apprehensive and concluded this was it, this was where Pixar would go down. Carl seemed grouchy, the puns used appeared ordinary and the plot seemed exceptionally thin. I hold my head down in shame for judging this on its trailer.<br/><br/>What we have here is yet another wondrous ambition of life that will break the heart, make the kids laugh and make you feel ultimately rewarded.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of Carl in the cinema as a young lad watching his hero on screen sets the tone for the film's central dream concept as Carl meets a fellow youth and the pair share the same adventurous spirit. After an hilarious fall and a sweet how you doing moment the film dives into a silent montage of their life together and when Carl hits a stopping point his life falls apart and until he has no choice, does the house start to fly and the adventure well and truly begins.<br/><br/>When watching a Pixar or a Disney picture you have to bear in mind the realism of situations. The unlikeliest is high but this is meant for entertainment and it certainly delivers it. The physical science of whether the house can fly based on helium balloons is open to the guys in the labs but this is an imaginative attempt to portray childhood ambition and it succeeds through this.<br/><br/>From talking dogs to an undiscovered bird this has adventure written all over and the fun never stops once the house is up. Russell provides that childhood innocence and ambition to give Carl food for thought and with flying dogs, an explorer with a deadly secret and charming dialogue this spells happiness for the entire family.<br/><br/>As more and more animations are now made with 3D in mind this picture was evidently more focused on the plot. Impressive but there are exceptionally few moments with actions coming out at you, like in Coraline or Monsters vs Aliens.<br/><br/>Irrelevant in my opinion as we have here the best animated picture this year with a charming plot with humorous characters and marvellous ambition."
"david-5145","8","2","4","28 October 2009"," A lovely addition to Pixar's franchise
","When I saw the first clip of this movie on the WALL-E DVD, my first impression was, this is crazy, seeing a house rising into the sky by a lot of balloons! I liked the idea of using an old man as the main character, from the moment he said ""afternoon"" in the clip, it felt heart warming. When I first heard about the plot, everything fell into place, and the message behind the house was beautiful. I did have another reservation with the relationship between the old man Carl and the wilderness explorer, Russell, but when I went to see it, nearly everything worked.<br/><br/>The beginning is definitely one of the best parts of the film, the montage we see on Carl and Ellie's time together was a joy to watch, right through to the end, and it was the first time a film brought a tear to my eye at so early a stage of the plot. As I've already said the message of freedom and being able to do the thing you always want to do in your whole life, was beautifully shown through the flying house. What I was concerned about before hand was the relationship between Carl and Russell. From seeing later clips of the film, I was worried that the film was going to be hampered down by ""the main character and his sidekick"" gags, especially when you add in a bird that won't go away, and a witless dog. Yet the film doesn't fall into that trap, yes there are still sidekick gags, but the creators don't overdo it. What's more, in a way the characters, Russell, Kevin and Dug, are not like the usual dumb sidekicks you get in any short TV cartoons, they're natural sidekicks. Russell for instance is the kind of kid with curiosity and the idea that everything is a game, which would lead to trouble. There are action sequences in this film that takes you on a helter-skelter of a ride, and when I left the cinema I felt I had a great time. To anyone, this film would seem to be defying the laws of science, and it's not just because of a flying house. Yet, I didn't care about this because this is a children's film! The gags were great, yet there was one on the dogs voices which, though it was hilarious, I felt was a bit camp for Pixar's standards.<br/><br/>The Mis-en-scene was beautiful. Obviously the two contrasting settings in this film are the city and the paradise falls. Paradise Falls is of course the main attraction and we see a ray of colours from the natural setting, compared to the grey and organised city. The music meanwhile was charming.<br/><br/>From other reviews, I heard that the 3D graphics didn't show anything amazing. For me I didn't think it was bad. It definitely didn't pop out of the screen, but I thought it was better than Coraline. I found that the airborne objects, like the house, seemed to stand out more and I enjoyed it There were however a few problems I had with this film. Firstly, there is the matter of the self-improvement in this film. In many of their other films, Pixar has used more than one self-improvement. In WALL-E for example, as well as the robots want for love, there was the human's self-improvement to find their humanity and return to earth, which fitted in nicely. In this film, it was clear that Russell had a self – improvement to progress in life, namely to become a senior in the wilderness explorers. However, once we got to Paradise falls, the creators seemed to let this self – improvement sit, and although there were moments, such as the time when we hear Russell talk about his relationship with his father with Carl, there weren't many signs of development. Once you add up the sidekick gags and the helter-skelter action sequences, they seemed to take over the whole plot. We only return to the self-improvement near the end, and at that stage, Russell had improved by then. I enjoyed watching Carl improve, yet it didn't balance with Russell's improvement, along with the many things that was going on. Also, there weren't many twists to the plot. The villain was defeated (so no nod to ""Ratatouille""), and it was predictable what the dilemma in the second half was going to be (so no nod to ""WALL-E""). In the end the plot was just the usual plot line you get in any normal film. Also, after seeing the last three films, I was looking forward to a song in the ending credits, and was disappointed when that didn't happen Despite these, the ending for Carl was lovely, and in essence, the things that make Pixar's films great are there. The film didn't bowl me over like ""WALL-E"", but I found it to be a charming film."

","Carl Fredericksen is an elderly widower whose house is in the middle of a building site. Rather than be evicted to the local old folks home, he ties thousands of balloons to his house and literally flies away to South America for an adventure. However, unbeknown to Carl, he has a well-intentioned stowaway on board <br/><br/>This is Pixar's tenth movie in, and the quality of their work is quite simply outstanding. Up is a wonderfully original story about an irascible old man, a likable fat boy, a talking dog and an embittered adventurer from a bygone age. It's a crazy, almost farcical plot, but yet the characters are so carefully observed and real seeming that you are swept along by the beauty of it. The wordless montage of Carl and Ellie's marriage at the start is an extraordinary five minutes of animation. Russell, the Boy Scout do-gooder, is a genuinely great kid - he's goofy, a little sad and he keeps the story moving nicely. The Lost World environs - lush groves, rocky tepui plateaus and dazzling waterfalls - are all rendered with exquisite detail. Although the story takes some swallowing, nothing about the movie seems forced - Carl's growing fondness for Russell, his reluctance to let go of his past life, his resolve to help rescue the rare bird - all flow as smooth as silk. Most importantly, it's hilarious throughout, with comic scrapes aplenty, crazy situations, lots of madcap moments (""Squirrel !"") and genuinely funny characters. The small voice cast are great; eighty-year-old Asner and eight-year-old Nagai make a lovely team, and co-director Peterson steals the movie as both Dug the heroic Golden Retriever and Alpha the scary Doberman. Deftly scripted by Docter and Peterson with actor Thomas McCarthy, and featuring a beautiful score by Michael Giacchino which weaves in and out of the action, adding much suspense, humour and pathos. In the Pixar tradition, the movie is preceded by a wonderful short film called Partly Cloudy, directed by Peter Sohn. Do not confuse this with the 1976 Russ Meyer movie of the same name, or you may never recover !"
"TheFilmBloggerdotcom","8","2","4","11 October 2009"," Pixar's most mature and bravest effort to date...
","By now it is somewhat passé to mention Pixar's track record as a film studio; the effortless consistency of their output shames virtually all others in the film industry, whether animated or live action. Since their inception with the seminal Toy Story (which, I would argue, remains their best film), Pixar has seen meteoric success with virtually every consecutive release. After the daring and audacious WALL-E, Pixar had a lot to live up to with their next effort, and while Up is a little more routine, it is still another valuable entry into the animated canon with all of the heart and soul that you would expect.<br/><br/>Up revolves around Carl Fredricksen (Edward Asner), an old widower who, after having a violent outburst against a construction worker who broke his prized mailbox (which he built with his late wife), is forced to move into a retirement home to live out his days. However, he's not about to go quietly; he attaches hundreds of helium-filled balloons to his home, causing it to take flight, with sail set for Paradise Falls in South America, a trip he had been planning with his wife Ellie, but she died of old age before they could go. Things become more complicated when Carl realises that Russell, (Jordan Nagai), a young Wilderness Explorer, has stowed away on the ""ship"", becoming Carl's unlikely sidekick.<br/><br/>If judged solely on its first reel, then Up is the film in Pixar's canon that can legitimately challenge Toy Story's claim to supremacy. The film begins with the same daring promise that made WALL-E one of Pixar's best films; it features an uncharacteristic (and dark) opening that cleverly traces the several tragedies and injustices of Carl's life, while remaining vague enough not to upset children. In the prologue montage, Up observes the problems that many couples are faced with, such as the difficulty to conceive, and of course the universal inevitability of death and of being alone, and the fact that Pixar chose to even glance over this at all is a testament to their artistic integrity. This isn't an easy film to market as a result, and the fact that there aren't many Carl Fredricksen figures in toy shops is all the more power to their stature as tellers of powerful stories rather than manipulatively cute animations mechanically rendered for profit. As Pixar have proved with the Toy Story films in particular, they care about their predominantly young audience, and won't condescend them. As beautifully realised as it is heartbreaking, Up provides one of the best prologues in any Pixar film, and exemplifies that they're capable of dealing with humanistic themes directly through human characters, as well as through anthropomorphised animals. <br/><br/>While Carl does often pore over pictures of his deceased wife, and there are frequent reminders of the inevitability of death, Up is also replete with the exuberant charm and visual brilliance that one expects from Pixar, although in this stead it does also become a more familiar adventure romp. Of course, genuine charm oozes out of every frame as Carl and Russell arrive in South America and meet a host of weird and wonderful animals, but it's clear that the chance for greater depth has been squandered for fear of not tinkering with the success of formula. This isn't so much a complaint as it is an observation; as a clever kids film that's going to entertain tots and their parents, it is tactful enough to allude to mature issues while also not veering too far from the comfortable norm. It's not that one expects pomp and profundity, but given how much Pixar have gotten away with here with a U rating, it would have been nice to see them totally go for broke.<br/><br/>Although not nearly as ambitious as WALL-E from a visual perspective, Up is a stunningly rendered film, and those watching the 3D presentation in particular will doubtless marvel at the exhaustive attention-to-detail and resplendent character design. For all of its aesthetic flair, though, what really holds Up together is the earnest voice performance of Edward Asner, whose nuanced vocal work forms the film's heart and soul, making this irritable old coot with a broken heart seem animate beyond his rendered bounds. If the Academy is prepared to consider voice performances, he would certainly be among the first in line to earn a nomination. While the film itself may earn a Best Picture nomination under the revised 10-film category, Up isn't Pixar's best. Nevertheless, it delivers the goods and boasts expectedly incredible visuals. Not to mention, Carl is among the more relatable and personable characters in the Pixar catalogue, and it's difficult not to become entranced and captivated by his heart-wrenching story. As such, it's easy to argue that this is Pixar's most mature and bravest effort to date."
"writers_reign","8","2","4","11 October 2009"," Heaven Can Weight
","I don't as a rule 'do' animation but the English press were virtually unanimous in four-and-five starring this one so I figured what the hell I'll give it a try. It does actually give the impression that some thought has gone into it not to say daring in the storyline of a widower realizing - in the nick of time to borrow Noel Coward's phrase - that life is for living and lighting out in a house propelled by helium-filled balloons for South America. Not least effective is a lovely montage sequence that takes our hero from childhood through dating, marriage and loss of his much-loved wife. To put this at the top of the show and risk alienating the kids was brave indeed. The 'action' may take some swallowing - we are, after all, talking geriatric here - but is easily overlooked. A fine effort."
"jburtroald95","9","2","4","27 September 2009"," Remembering its genre, it is a remarkable achievement.
","When Pixar first introduced the concept of purely computer-generated feature films, little did they know that they had created a ravaging ravenous monster that only they – and DreamWorks – would be able to tame. Forgetting that Pixar's philosophy has always been that you should always take time and care when working with this technique and that storyline was absolutely paramount, other companies gave in to the temptation to exploit the revolution and whip up several second-rate CGI flicks that were so enticingly easy and inexpensive to make.<br/><br/>Computer animation has almost driven quality children's animation to extinction. It has been the death of cartoons, and the decline of claymation. Though the two aforementioned animation giants have thankfully managed to continue producing such wonderful specimens as 'Toy Story' (1995) and 'Shrek' (2001). The last fourteen years have taught us that only these two companies can manage to get it right, that only they can tame the monster.<br/><br/>Now Pixar's offerings did falter after 2004, but they regained their footing last year with Wall-E and have sustained that success with Up, an exhilarating yet also deeply moving film. It tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Jeremy Leary at the beginning, but mostly by an amazing Edward Asner) a man who dreamed of adventure as a boy, a passion that saw him meeting and later marrying the sweet Ellie (voiced quite well by Ellie Docter, the director's daughter). The two share a long and beautiful marriage in a cosy little house that the couple decorated together, but after many years Ellie dies in hospital next to a very broken-hearted Carl. Though after her death Carl holds on relentlessly to their house and all of his photos and memories of her, he also goes on to attempt to fulfil her childhood dream which was to have a house in a lost land in South America.<br/><br/>The story of his marriage is told quickly and with little dialogue, though still with much grace and emotion. This is of course so the exciting adventure he embarks on – which involves him taking off in a house tied to a million balloons – can be given most of the screen time, as it is more of a crowd-pleaser. Though the winsome themes are not forgone at that point, and more depth and more fun arrive when we are introduced to young ""wilderness explorer"" Russell (voiced perfectly by Jordan Nagai) a naive and extremely animated boy who ends up tagging along to assist the elderly Carl.<br/><br/>There is also a villain thrown in – perhaps unnecessarily, though he does give us a fair bit of enjoyment and is a major supplier of the story's complications – with his own story that is first mentioned and begun to be told at the beginning, and waits in the wings until near the end where he reappears and starts being nasty to the two heroes. He is explorer Charles Muntz (voiced splendidly by Christopher Plummer) who surprisingly is Carl's childhood hero, a ruthless tyrant obsessed with hunting down, killing, and taking back the strange bird-like creature that stalks these lands in order to prove he has seen it and has made it to the lost land.<br/><br/>Remembering its genre, it is a remarkable achievement and one that reassures us that Pixar is still the best. It even manages to surpass Wall-E, which very visibly tried too hard to incorporate meaningful messages and to be a masterpiece. Although it succeeded, it didn't do so anywhere near as naturally and effortlessly as Up did."
"m_shankar20","9","2","4","20 September 2009"," A humane story amid a color riot
","It is difficult to get the image of that flying house suspended by countless colorful balloons off your head, once you see Up. I guess, it would stay with me for the rest of my life.<br/><br/>Up easily climbs up to claim a place amongst the finest animation films ever. Not surprisingly, it comes from Pixar, the team that gave us Wall-E, Ratatouille and Finding Nemo. Also, after a quite a long time, its about 'people' as against a garbage-crusher, a rat and fishes respectively earlier. Up is as colorful as an animation film ever was. What a color riot! Some frames just stay with you, the mastery of their composition impossible to miss.<br/><br/>The choice of characters itself breaks clichés. A grumpy old man as the hero and an amiable obese kid as his ally completely contrast against what one would have thought would be the choice for characters who are supposed to be on an adventure trip to South America. Both characters endear themselves to us as the story moves along.<br/><br/>Two things that stood out for me - (a) The initial sequence that chronicles the life of Fredrickson and Ellie together is a master-stroke. As it ends, it leaves the eyes moist - and all that without a word spoken. (b) The closing shot with the house perched besides the paradise falls - it is one for the textbooks; probably one of the best closing shots ever.<br/><br/>Not to be missed at any cost."
"rzajac","Null","2","4","7 September 2009"," A different feel from other Pixar films; but still good
","A friend warned me that I would feel disappointed by ""Up"". He said it just wasn't as clever and complex as Ratatouille or Wall-E or other past Pixar offerings.<br/><br/>But another friend saw it, and recommended it, so I behooved myself to check it out.<br/><br/>I agree with my first friend that ""Up"" is a narratively relatively modest undertaking. But I also feel that what it does achieve is notable.<br/><br/>It's taken a while for certain aspects to come to the fore in my mind. However, I did immediately notice one honest and useful moral: For all his exertions, Fredricksen doesn't get to really have an adventure until he lets go of a frozen, romanticized version of ""adventure"" that got stuck in his character makeup at an early age. I thought it was great how the story sets this up and creates the situation where he has this breakthrough. Very nicely done.<br/><br/>And then there were other interesting things the film achieves. The pacing of the story is odd. In a way, it's hard to say whether this reflects daring or ineptitude on the parts of the folks responsible for the shepherding the narrative. But, in the end, I have to say there was something grand about the way the story rolls along slowly and yet also with a lot of strength. It's as though it aspires to be operatic; with an emotional depth that tries to match the breadth of the spaces and times involved. Sort of like ""Waiting for Godot"" meets ""Dennis the Menace""! I should mention that, about halfway through the film, the pace gets picked up, and stays ""up"" for a long time; a bit ""too much"", in my book, and quite likely a nod to the kid customers in the audience.<br/><br/>And then there's that whole side story of Fredricksen's deceased wife (no spoiler there; you see this coming from a mile off). Very nicely done.<br/><br/>With the proviso that, indeed, you will see something a bit different from prior Pixel work--no harm in variety!--I can recommend this movie."
"Sebastian_Berlin","7","2","4","21 August 2009"," No milestone in movie history.
","I was exited to see this movie, as it had rapidly climbed to 26th place on IMDb's Top 250 before it was released here in Germany. Maybe those expectations ruined it for me, as expectations often do, but I really don't think this movie deserves a spot this high. Okay, it's funny. But so are Monsters Inc., Wall-E, Finding Nemo and countless others. The story is imaginative and entertaining, but no magic. The plot tries to push us through a wide range of emotions, but the movie's sugar-coated, candy-like look and slapstick nature kept me from identifying too much with its fairly shallow characters. A while ago, I saw ""Spirited Away"", a movie that touches the soul, takes you into a land beyond your wildest imaginations and leaves you with magical, dreamlike images you won't forget for a long time. Compared to movies like that, ""Up"" seems like your typical ""let's all have a good time"" - Disney family entertainment flick. Which is perfectly all right, and I will gladly give it a 7 out of 10, but this movie is definitely no milestone in movie history."
"Jay_Exiomo","9","2","4","20 August 2009"," Buoyed dreams
","Typical of Pixar's adeptness in conveying stories, the first few minutes of ""Up"" pack more wallop than a whole two-hour tearjerker could, as it charts Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) and childhood friend Ellie through the decades, from their role-playing days as intrepid travelers to their marriage, and eventually, Ellie's death. Pete Docter's animated tale is an elegant combination of humor and pathos that perfectly captures the rush brought about by adventure, the uplifting quality of friendship, and -- at once a reminder of Disney's ""Bambi"" and Pixar's refusal to compromise its narratives -- the pain of losing someone. It's a profundity that's both delicate and penetrating.<br/><br/>78-year old Carl and his wife Ellie had kept a scrapbook of their planned adventures and always dreamed of going to the fictional Paradise Falls in Venezuela, where their childhood hero, the adventurer Muntz (Christopher Plummer), has famously traveled. For some reasons, the expedition doesn't materialize and Ellie soon dies, leaving Carl alone in the house, with the latter about to go to predatory land developers. Inadvertently bringing along the pudgy Wilderness Scout Russell (Jordan Nagai), Carl decides to fulfill Ellie's wish as he ties thousands of balloons to his house and floats to South America.<br/><br/>Advertised as Pixar's first foray into 3D, ""Up""'s candy-colored palette and graceful portraits of Carl's house floating in the sky benefit from the additional visual depth, though the increasingly silly travails of Carl and his slapdash tour is filled with buoyant energy that keeps it from resting entirely on the technology's novelty. Centering on the theme of one's continual search for purpose, Carl learns of how holding to the past keeps him from reaching his destination and from setting off to new adventures, a moral that Docter fortunately doesn't overplay, but rather is represented in splendid visual metaphors. It may be too easy to call it an elevation to animation but there's no escaping the fact that, for all its jaunty adventures and affectionate regard to relationship, ""Up"" -- pardon the obvious description -- doesn't let down."

","Pixar does it again. I've watched almost every Pixar movie and it seems that despite the potentially least interesting, least commercial subject (an old guy flying away in his balloon-covered house), they just can't go wrong. It's another great film, exquisitely animated and downright beautiful to behold. What makes Pixar films, and ""Up"" in particular, so special? My theory is that beyond the amazing 3d computer graphics, it boils down to likable characterizations and heartwarming humanistic moralistic stories that don't consider their audiences stupid with a dash of good humor and a pinch of wonder added for good measure. Basically, Pixar films like ""Up"" usually have ""heart"" without feeling forced or fake. The life story of the old guy presented at the start was a wondrous touching piece of work accompanied only by beautiful evocative music. Actually the music in ""Up"" is noteworthy for its emotional effectiveness throughout. The story might appear a bit simple in hindsight but it works beautifully and touches on several universal themes and values such as grief, friendship and acceptance. It has its sad dramatic moments but overall it's quite fun, funny and dare I say uplifting. This coming from a guy who's usually allergic to ""feel good"" movies. It even has an underlying romantic background that makes everything more special.<br/><br/>Why is it that Pixar movies, ""Up"" being the latest case, often have better acting than most live-action films? Is it because of slightly-exaggerated animated emotions, the top-notch voice-acting or the incredible facial expressions and body language? I do wonder how ""Up"" would keep the interest for younger children. The pace is sometimes intentionally slow (old guy being a bit slower) and it does have quieter introspective moments. Some places might be up over their head but I think the lovable enthusiastic bumbling boy scout and dog would certainly help keep their interest and it's likely they will be fascinated by the graphics and grumpy old guy. I think ""Up"" can appeal equally to adults and children alike and if the high praise from every corner hasn't convinced you yet, it's definitely worth watching and owning eventually. I certainly want to see it again. Grandparents in particular should see this with their grand kids, or even alone if they don't have any, as they might find it inspiring. My only exception to my high recommendation would be for those few who have disliked Pixar movies in the past. ""Up"" probably won't change their mind but then again why not give it a try anyway?

","I saw this with my boys (6 and 9) and we all loved it. I won't say any more about the movie itself as it's pretty well covered, but I do want to say how surprised I was at the quality of the 3-D version. As with other reviewers, I have until now avoided 3-D releases as I always find them disappointing. I was blown away by the new digital 3-D in this movie as well as the trailers which were also presented in 3-D. The new glasses were comfortable, if a little large for my 6 year old (they need 2 sizes) and I didn't experience any eye strain, nor did I have to take them off during the movie. I also didn't have that irritating headache that I always get after viewing the ""old"" 3-D format. If you haven't tried it yet, you should. You may still prefer the 2-D version, but I think you'd have to admit that it's light years ahead of any previous 3-D attempts. <br/><br/>Chris"

But there are a few specific moments that truly held me in awe that such scenes could happen in an animated film.<br/><br/>(1) The opening montage. What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's beautifully done. The first of two times I actually broke into tears.<br/><br/>(2) The moment when Carl discovers the additional pictures in Ellie's scrapbook. Like the opening montage, a wonderfully executed sketch of a life lived in love.<br/><br/>(3) The moment Carl realizes he has to let the house go. Incredible that they were able to get such expression out of that square little face, but why should we be surprised? It's Pixar, people.<br/><br/>Truly, this is not a film for kids. I doubt we'll see much in the way of merchandising or toys or sheet sets or other stuff to sell this tender-hearted little movie. But it's not for the kids.

","This is officially my second favorite film of the year so far (behind Drag Me to Hell). I saw it in 3D and it, like all Pixar movies do (except Cars), blew me away. It falls just short of becoming one of my favorites, but it comes pretty damn close.<br/><br/>The animation is amazing, not so much in the detailed or ""It-looks-so-real-"" department, but just by the amount of stuff that's going on on screen. When the balloons first pop up from behind Carl Fredrickson's house, it's an amazing sight. The physics, the color, reflections, everything animation-wise in this movie is PERFECT!!! The voice acting in this movie is also incredible. Now while every single critic has given special recognition to Ed Asner, I want to give it to Bob Peterson who created my favorite character of the year (surpassing Insectosaurus), Dug the Dog. Peterson's speech patterns, dialogue and personality create an adorable and memorable character that I consider Pixar's next Dory (formally Pixar's most quotable character).<br/><br/>If anything, my only complaint is that the villain felt rushed into the film, and his motives weren't really clear to me. But that was probably because I didn't take my medication that helps me focus.<br/><br/>Up is amazing, just plain and simple.<br/><br/>FULL PRICE"
"Argemaluco","9","2","4","11 June 2009"," Another excellent film by Pixar
","Some years ago,when the animation studio Pixar announced the increment on its volume of production,many of us had the fear that the effort of making one movie per-year (instead of making one every two or three years) would reduce the quality of the screenplays.The results partially confirmed that.Cars and Wall-E were solid films,no doubt,but by my humble point of view,they were not as polished as the other films from Pixar,but Ratatouille was great,and it's my second favourite movie from this studio (the first one is The Incredibles).So,I did not know what to exactly expect from Up.The result was another excellent film by Pixar.This movie is funny,very satisfactory and owner of a remarkable dramatic deepness.The main character is among the best ones from the history of Pixar,because he is very rich on the psychological detail.The visual aesthetic from Up helps to conciliate the fantastic and realistic elements from the story very much.The design of the characters complements their personalities and makes them as expressive as any human being.The moment from the movie in which the house is floating with the help of thousands of balloons is truly extraordinary.What I mostly appreciated from this movie is that its authentic beauty is on the story and its message.The title from this movie is very appropriate...I lead to the conclusion that it does not only refer about the house going ""up"",but also to the emotional evolution from the main character.The action scenes from this movie are very exciting and funny,because they put an old man and make him a hero,who results much more interesting than many heroes from blockbuster action films.The fail I found on this movie is one : near the ending,the screenplay has a forced element; I think that should have been done on a more natural way.But,that is not a too important fail,and the only reason I noted it is because the movie establishes a very high standard of narrative quality.Up is an excellent movie which is highly recommendable for people of any age."

","First it must be said that Up is a good movie. It doesn't fade next to Ratatouille, Wall-E or any other of Pixars greatest. It is fun for kids as well as adults, it makes you care about the characters, the animation is flawless and the plot keeps your attention every second. Still, Up is one of the strongest arguments for closing the vote until the hype has passed (Maybe until the movie has been released on DVD?) Along with movies like The Dark Knight, Star Trek and the other Pixar Wall-E it makes me more and more certain that this is the solution. Don't get me wrong, I loved both Wall-E and the Dark Knight, but there still is no way that they're as great as the ratings say. Besides, Star Trek was plain awful. Slumdog Millionaire is probably the only hyped movie I can think of that has landed on an appropriate rating in the end. Anyway, I recommend Up, it is a good movie you and your kids probably will want to see again and again if you are a Pixar fan, and if you're not I recommend it all the same. 7/10."

","Up {dir. Pete Docter, 2009} <br/><br/>****/**** <br/><br/>Pixar's Up is the best film of the year so far, by far. In telling a simple adventure story, they cover ground that they had yet to cover before. Both the humor and heartbreak of the film seem completely more mature than any of Pixar's previous works. The film is perfectly paced and structured in a very careful way to allow each moment to have a satisfying and slightly surprising. Pixar continues to amaze not only with their technical bravado, but with their thematic courage. Up is definitely in the uppermost echelon of their work, a hilarious, and in turns heartbreaking, work of great magnitude and power. Visually the film is rich and thrilling and emotionally it is satisfying. I cannot wait to see it again!"

","Upsy daisy! It's time for you to wake up and read my quirky pun-induced film review of Disney Pixar's ""Up"". Not up for it? Come on, it will lift your spirits up! OK, enough uppers already! Do not want it to be a downer for you guys. ""Up"" is yet another creative Pixar tale about a lonely geriatric widower named Carl Frederickson who fixates on fulfilling his deceased wife Ellie's wishes of flying their house to a paradisiacal land in South America. This idea might not fly with many, but grumpy Carl just wants to be happy by his lonesome in his own isolated South America Paradiso. However, Carl did not expect a junior wilderness explorer to come along for the ride. What's up with that? Russell is the aforementioned boy scout who accidentally gets stuck in the house during Carl's upward liftoff. Nevertheless, Frederickson was in no mood to be ""bringing down the house"" even with Russell on board. Frederickson and Russell end up landing in the paradise land (house and all), and there they befriend a talking dog named Dug and an eccentric female bird who Russell names Kevin. Their nemesis comes in the form of the devious explorer Charles Muntz who masters a pack of menacing talking dogs. So therefore, Frederickson and Russell are confronted with plenty of ""ups"" and ""downs"" during their adventurous experience. There are many humanistic elements in ""Up"" such as aging, loneliness, acceptance, and detachment that many kids might not be up for; but provides invaluable life lessons on character education to our future generation. ""Up"" does play with your heartstrings plenty, so bring a hanky! The former Mr. Grant, Ed Asner, was granted a perfect role to voice as Frederickson; that impressed me Ed Asner! (Only ""Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" fans got that pun upper). Bob Peterson's tender & uplifting screenplay was superb while Pete Docter doctored a successful directorial uperation of ""Up"". Big Thumbs Up for ""Up""! ***** Excellent"

","When asked if Disney's Pocahontas was historically accurate, one critic replied, ""It's got a talking raccoon, for God's sake."" So here. Old Man Fredrikson lifts his house off the ground with thousands of toy balloons. An 8 year old with a GPS navigates the house to South America, steering with a coffee grinder attached to two shower curtains. When they get there, Fredriksen meets his childhood hero from the 1930s, who is still upright and vigorous, albeit embittered and paranoid, at age 100+. Just go with the fantasy, talking dog collars and all. There's always plenty going on in a Pixar film.<br/><br/>I'll skip over the love story, which stands out, to a couple of less conspicuous points. I loved the dogs, who spoke what we'd like to think are dog thoughts. And anyone who thinks they lowered the tone of the movie should consider the wide range of dog behavior that Pixar left out and most animation studios would have wallowed in.<br/><br/>I also loved the contrasts between the 8 year olds: Carl and Ellie delighted with a few found objects and their imaginations, and Russell laden with every piece of gear money could buy. And the contrast between the two views of nature: Muntz, wanting to catch it and put it in a museum Teddy Roosevelt style, and Russell wanting to leave it in place. The manly hero of 70 years ago has soured into a fascistic bully by modern standards. The politics are a lot more subtle than The Incredibles or Wall-E, but they're in there just the same."

","Thinking about it brings tears to my eyes again. I took my 5 year old daughter and her friend. From children's perspective, it was very entertaining. They were laughing and talking about dogs for long time. Some fighting scenes scared them a tiny bit, but not much. From adult's perspective, it was really deep, unpredictable, and touching. The best thing for me, personally, was that I dreamed of going to Guiana highlands all my childhood. From the trailer, I had no idea that's what this was about. It was really exciting for me that someone from Pixar (the studio I respect more than anything else! and my dream place to work!) also had a similar feelings for Guiana Highlands.<br/><br/>I never thought Pixar can top the heights of Wall-E, but apparently, they can do it again and again.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend it to everyone!"
"RainDogJr","9","2","4","5 June 2009"," The Great Gig in the Sky
","Last year's Pixar production had the best possible reviews, I remember going to see WALL*E expecting to experience what for many people it was: the very best Pixar film. I loved WALL*E as much as you fellow reader but I don't consider it the very best Pixar film, it is not even one of my 5 favourite Pixar films, hell I haven't felt desires to buy/rent its DVD, I haven't felt desires to watch it for the second time. I just saw Pixar's latest production (in 3-D and it looks, as expected, just wonderful!) Up (Peter Docter directed it being his second Pixar film. His other, the 2001 Monsters Inc., is my second favourite from Pixar) and for me is just as wonderful as WALL*E and Ratatouille (another film I haven't seen since I saw it for the very first time on the big screen back in 2007) but like those two films it is not one of my most favourites from Pixar.<br/><br/>Anyway, the preview I saw of Up didn't allow me (thankfully) to see any characters but only the main ones: the old man Carl Fredricksen (voice of Edward Aisner) and the kid Russell (Jordan Nagai), the preview showed the old man with his floating house and later realizing that he had a guest. But Up actually begins when Carl was younger than Russell, when Carl met Ellie (Elizabeth Docter), the girl that just like him loved adventures, loved exploder Charles Muntz, the girl that eventually became the woman of his life. All of what Carl and Ellie shared is fantastically told, is realistic, touching, is a really great part of the film. <br/><br/>The director Peter Docter said this: ""the message of the film is that the real adventure of life is the relationship we have with other people, and it's so easy to lose sight of the things we have and the people that are around us until they're gone. More often than not I don't really realize how lucky I was to have known someone until they're either moved or passed away. So if you can kind of wake up a little bit and go, ""Wow, I've got some really cool stuff around me every day"", then that's what the movie's about"". Ellie passes away, then we move to the present with Carl, the present is still realistic and also sad, no country for old men certainly, the destiny of Carl is to go to a retirement home but then the extraordinary begins, then the dream of Ellie as kid of having her clubhouse in Paradise Falls is the one and only objective of Carl and well Carl will not leave his house and is satisfying as hell! <br/><br/>Like almost everybody I knew that at one point Carl was going to use lots and lots of balloons to make his house fly so for me the ""weird"" stuff began once Carl and Russell (he is a hilarious character, you will love him and well he being a wilderness explorer was trying to earn the ""assisting the elderly"" badge ended in Carl's house) arrive to South America, I was like ""talking dogs in the middle of the jungle?"", this stuff with the dogs is really hilarious. It works like with the elderly (Carl certainly and also Charles Muntz, yes Carl will meet his hero who now owns the bunch of dogs and lives in Paradise Falls just to capture a weird bird that Russell calls Kevin!), I mean on one hand we have the extraordinary: talking dogs, all the amazing movements that Carl and Russell do in the course of the film, the dogs being chefs, etc. And on the other hand we have the realistic moments (apart of those from the beginning of the film, from the story of Carl and Ellie) : the dogs being totally controlled by that who has the ball or the food, the elderly having problems to fight (hilarious scene!), etc. The deal is that the film always works, and well Up is just another triumph for Pixar! 9.5 out of 10"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","2","4","3 June 2009"," The first CGI film that truly has something for everyone, and it's all brilliant
","After tackling rats with chef skills and voiceless robots on journeys of self-discovery, leave it to Pixar to make the star of its latest film an elderly man and continue to defy Hollywood's long-held belief that animated films have to zero in on children and concepts that can be marketed into hats and toys and backpacks. Heck, in ""Up"" even animals talking are explained rather than simply taken for granted. But what sets it apart from other Pixar gems is that it's the animation studio's most inclusive for-the-whole family adventure to date.<br/><br/>It's no surprise to anyone anymore that Pixar leads field in terms of computer-generated animation and while ""Up"" continues this tradition, that's not its specialty. ""WALL*E"" is still more of a spectacle and innovator. ""Up"" is Pixar's proof that they can combine beautiful, heart-filled storytelling with laughs for every age group and adventure and action to boot and *still* make a killing at the box office.<br/><br/>On premise, most analysts wouldn't predict a film about 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen ballooning his house to South America to honor a promise to his late wife to be even close to a box office success in the genre of animated family films, but attach the name Pixar and anything is possible. Dogs with collars that turn their thoughts in words and the dynamic between a young boy scout named Russell who accidentally was on Fredricksen's porch when the house took off and an old man prove to be more than enough for great comedy and entertainment.<br/><br/>Sure, the plot itself once they get to South America leaves something to be desired, and the feasibility of an old man who can't walk down his stairs being able to hold onto a dangling rope with a boy, a dog and a large bird on the other end will fail to suspend many adults' disbelief, but there is never a moment devoid of something clever or meaningful in the entire film. The fresh and humorous concept proves quite forgiving as does the touching motivation in the story of Carl doing this for his dead wife. The montage through their years together is incredibly powerful for happening so early in the film. Pete Docter and Bob Peterson do an excellent job, though obviously Pixar's constant success must be credited to John Lasseter. <br/><br/>Next to ""WALL*E"" whose innovation, imagination and genius themes might never be repeated in animated film, ""Up"" is Pixar's best to date. There is honestly something for everyone: the elderly will relate to Carl's struggles with aging, loss and unfulfillment; children will find plenty of physical humor to enjoy between the hysterical dogs and Russell's slight lack of smarts; and the ages in between will find the story touching and the concepts and their execution nothing short of genius. And for once, Disney is even politically correct/inclusive in the diversity of characters."
"JimD73","9","2","4","2 June 2009"," Tragic, Mesmerizing and Utterly Hilarious, One of Pixar's Finest
","Pixar has never disappointed (so long as we block Cars from our memory). After Wall-E, the bar was set higher than ever. Wall-E was a beautiful haunting picture, made not for children but more for people willing to absorb the imagery without needing to be guided by dialogue. Despite the success of Wall-E, I think Pixar realized how it may have alienated children to some extent with its long first act, and has included more colour and dialogue in their next picture, Up. However, even if a slightly less mature picture at times than its predecessor, Up ranks among the best Pixar films to date and may actually be its most haunting.<br/><br/>Up is the story of 78-year old widower Carl Frederickson. After the death of his wife, he finally decides to do what they always dreamed of doing and having a house on Paradise Falls. However, when his houseship has an unexpected passenger in young boy scout (sorry, ""Wilderness Explorer"") Russell, his journey becomes something else entirely.<br/><br/>Carl is probably the most tragic character Pixar has ever made, possibly even including Wall-E. The opening montage of his life is probably the single most tragic thing I've ever seen in an animated feature. Even Russell, the requisite annoying-yet-noble child, has his share of tragedy surrounding him, also dealing with themes much more mature than the standard studio. It's a tale of a man trying to live his life in its twilight, and its done wonderfully.<br/><br/>Of course, no kids want to see a tragedy, so importantly, Up is very funny. There's a man with an army of talking dogs, from which much humour ensues (particularly from Dug, the ""SQUIRREL!"" dog from the trailer, as well as Alpha, a Rottweiler with a malfunctioning collar). Then there's the large-bird-thing Kevin, also producing some very funny material. Despite the tragedy of the whole story, you really can't help but be entertained, and certainly this is a very funny movie.<br/><br/>I do have my complaints, however. The climax seems too stereotypical, a pitfall of all kids movies. It works, however, even if it doesn't blow away. Also, as a physics major, I have some issues to settle with the mechanics of walking around dragging a flying house, but its a pure fantasy movie, and eventually i coerced my brain into shutting up in that respect.<br/><br/>One final note: the 3D aspect. I did see it in 3D, and was very impressed. Unlike most 3D movies, there was not a single ""OMG 3D"" moment in Up (forgive the expression). The use was subtle, yet did add a degree of immersion to the film. It also made the dogs that much more frightening at times. The movie definitely is very good in 2D, but the 3D gives it an extra layer, even if not necessary. If the idea does make you queasy, go for the 2D, because the 3D does not drive the soul of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Up is a triumph. Pixar seems more focused than ever with these last few films, and I'm absolutely loving it. If this implies that Toy Story 3 will be the best yet, bring it on.<br/><br/>NOTE: There's a 3D Toy Story 3 trailer attached. That makes it worth admission alone.<br/><br/>NOTE: The short film before the movie (as standard with Pixar) is not their best, but its very cute and works its magic to warm you up for the film."
"joeb4513","9","2","4","1 June 2009"," Pixar Takes Crap, Turns To Gold
","Pixar is truly an amazing animation studio. Over the years it has produced classic films with great lessons for all (not just the wee ones) in Toy Story, The Incredibles, WALL-E, and now Up. With the success of their latest film, Up, I am convinced that the big wigs over at Pixar Animations could take a dump and literally fashion it into gold (which is apparently safer to own than the dollar these days).<br/><br/>Frequently Pixar seems to amaze the masses, even those pesky critics, with their beautiful animations and relevant story lines that touch the heart of every individual. I myself, a 22 year old male, had to recruit every ounce of testosterone in my body to not blubber like a baby during the sad introduction of Up. These days it seems like the ""kid"" movies that Pixar puts out are far more relevant and important than what Hollywood traditional puts out. Frankly, I'm sick of all the movies showing me a post-apocalyptic future where every day we get a day closer to a real-life episode of ""Life After People."" Hollywood needs to take a lesson from Pixar and start making some films that go beyond the trials and tribulations of a man battling robots in the future. Sure, blow 'em up movies and fart movies serve their purpose, but Pixar seems to be the only studio putting out films that contain touching drama, hilarious comedy and stories that are relevant to our everyday lives. They were able to get me to care about a freakin' robot in WALL-E, for crying out loud! Whereas if I were to go see Terminator Salvation (which I won't), I'm sure I could give a flying hoo-hah about John Connor.<br/><br/>What amazes me the most about Pixar is how creative the films are. I am dumb-founded as to how they take an idea that would probably get laughed at (not in the good way) initially, and turning it into something we as people can relate to. Imagine how the pitch meeting probably went.<br/><br/>Writer: So I have this movie idea where an old guy fills his house with a bunch of helium filled balloons and floats to an unexplored paradise.<br/><br/>Pixar: That sounds like crap... But luckily everything we touch turns to gold, so go for it.<br/><br/>We can't wait for the next one, Pixar. Keep the shorts coming before the feature (they should do this for live action films, too!."

","After living in his home for most of his life, Carl is suddenly surrounded by skyscrapers and construction. They want to buy his house so they can tear it down and build a retirement home. He will have none of this and decides to use thousands of balloons to literally lift his house 'up' and soar to a place he's been dreaming of going since a kid.<br/><br/>There's a bit more to the plot, but I don't want to divulge that information. Going into the film not knowing about it might have a stronger impact on you. Up, which is yet another fascinating film from the geniuses at Pixar is vibrant with colour, full of laughs, tugs on the heart strings and is an adventure for both kids and adults. I never thought a film that had to really old characters in the lead roles would appeal to the young ones, but Up surprised me. In fact, it really surprised me, hearing about the concept I thought that Pixar finally had a dud on their hands. Nope, not this time.<br/><br/>Up is one of my favourite Pixar films, up their with last years Wall-E and The Incredibles. The film is unique and inspiring. I doubt you'll find such quality film making from any other animated film, Pixar has set the bar time and time again. Up, while not visually stunning or powerful as last years Wall-E takes a different route and uses vibrant colours to draw attention to itself. The characters are cartoonish and the story itself could never be based on any reality and for a film about an old guy in a house with balloons, it's mighty adventurous.<br/><br/>Every Pixar film has a message that their cleverly slip into the excitement and Up is no different. We go on this journey with Carl and the young boy scout Russell, Carl at first does not like Russell, nor does he want him around. These two characters are at opposite ends of each other, one old and quite, the other young and talkative. Of course by the end of the flick they bond. Also along for the ride are two side characters, Kevin the colourful native bird of Paradise Falls (they place Carl wants to finally see) and Dug, a dog who can mysteriously talk. Dug is not the only dog who can talk though, the place is full of them, all trained to open doors and fly planes. They all heel to their master Charles Muntz, who has spent his life trying to capture Kevin.<br/><br/>Up is not only funny, fun and exciting, it packs a few emotional scenes too. Some people might want to bring some tissues, while it's not a sob story it is one of the few Pixar films that have moved me. What happens to Carl happens to everyone, so you can relate to him. You are immediately grabbed by him and his story and the film has more emotional punch in ten minutes of dialogue free montage then most dramas or romance films today can say for themselves.<br/><br/>There are a lot of words to describe Up: Delightful, endearing and whimsical are a few, but one I will choose to employ is heart. Along with Wall-E, Up has the most heart out of every other Pixar film I've seen. The film has a PG rating though, only other Pixar film to have this is The Incredibles. The Russell kid is shot at and people die, at times I was thinking would kids be scared of this? I don't think so, nothing horrible ever happens that could traumatize a young one in my opinion.<br/><br/>I did not bother to see this film in 3-D, I've heard it doesn't give enough 'pop' to warrant the additional money on the ticket. Seeing it at a regular theatre will not hinder your viewing at all. All the voice acting is top-notch and perfect casting with Plummer and Asner. See Up in theatres while you can, it is one of the year's best."

And by this point you should have enough sense to check it out online BEFORE taking your kids to see it and already knowing that many animated films are not for kids. Furthermore, did you even look to see that it was indeed rated PG? Now about the movie, I found it to be quite good. As long as you're not planning to drag all your kids to it, you will likely enjoy it.

From this perspective, Pixar is an outright fairytale factory. Whether it's the naive ideal of its movie content or its reputation that hasn't faded for more than ten years, the little table lamp that is bouncing around is probably the farthest away from the words disappointment these years.

The older you are, the less you are not your own, but live for the people who care about you and the people you care about. Guarding the memory of the house and the lover for the rest of his life, this is his biggest wish, turning up the wish of the dead wife, I think Carl is full of guilt, I just want to do more for her, do it earlier. But when it seemed that even the last house full of memories would be taken away, Carl fled. That 's right, he was to fulfill his lover 's last wish, but more importantly, he could n't imagine life that he could n't even live in his memories, so he took all his memories-the house, and fled to the beginning of the memories. An old man like Martin Crane, locked himself in the memory of the most beloved, refused to face the reality, unwilling to face his life, and gambled on the rest of his life in the most romantic and crazy way. This is love and perseverance, but also despair and paranoia.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Memories of loved ones are the most precious, but when the memories confine the soul and make people unwilling to love others anymore, it becomes a stubborn illness. Russel, Kevin, and Dug were all in the eyes of Carl at first. It was just a trouble that hindered him and his memory. He only cared about his house and moved it to the waterfall. Everything else it's none of my concern. But they three All are objects that need to be cared for: a child eager for his father's love, a big bird chased and killed by a ""bad guy"", and a dog looking for his owner. In the end, the whole movie is not about the story of a romantic messy old man flying across the sea in a hot air balloon made of a house to realize the wish of his dead wife, but how a sad old man can regain the fulcrum of life and the object of love . Finally, as the house fell into the waterfall and Carl's loneliness and self-blame, he would never forget Ellie, but he would not use remembrance to numb himself, because he was going to accompany a little boy to count the cars on the road.<br/><br/>
In the worst words, this is a story of salvation.<br/><br/>Perseverance, trust, hope and love are the eternal themes in Pixar movies. They are not to tell people how great these ideas are, but to let the audience re-understand these excessive abuses and even distortions along with the protagonists 'experiences. The humanity that controls our lives all the time. This sincerity will not disappoint."

","Though the sentiments of the movie were great, the storytelling was poor. The movie begins with a brilliant montage and sets the stage for a strong redemption arc. After the first scenes, the film does not concern itself with any element of realism despite there being human protagonists. The army of talking dogs is quite obviously a disappointing crowd-pleaser. Who doesn't love dogs right? The narrative is further bogged down by a mediocre villain who's life-long motivation is to capture a chocolate-loving ""beast"". The final ""fight"" scene was abysmal as well. The last moments were emotionally potent, however, as Carl and Russell fill the father-son void that both of them lack. It was charming to see Carl overcome his attachment to the house that symbolizes his grief and angst towards the death of Ellie.<br/><br/>All-in-all if the quality of the narrative matched the character development, Pixar would have another classic."

","This film is possibly one of the best animated films of all time as it tells an emotional moving story while being funny. As I said the emotion in this film is full of heart and even though I didn't cry it will make most people cry. The characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is also given development, even more than some superhero films nowadays. Also this film has comedy some Pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. So overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get, it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect.

","This is another film in which it really helps to know in advance what it is, or more specifically, what it isn't. Then, you go from there. I enjoyed the animated film very much but, some of that was due to the fact a friend clued me in first, saying ""this isn't really a comedy or a film for little kids. Don't expect a ton of laughs."" So, instead of seeking laughs (although I still got them here and there), I just enjoyed the adventure story and marveled at the amazing artwork.<br/><br/>Seen on Blu-Ray, this is yet another example in which you shake your head and wonder, ""How does the artwork get any better than this?"" Then, about six months from now, another will come along and I'll say the same thing. Overall movies may not be better today than ""in the old days,"" but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation. This is another example of that.<br/><br/>The colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning. I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes. From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny/<br/><br/>Back to the story, I found it a combination adventure-fantasy-comedy-suspense-sentimental story, about in that order, too. Generally-speaking, I would think adults would like this more than kids, but I may be wrong. Everyone - regardless of age - will have their jaw drop more than once viewing the incredible-looking scenes. It's really a feast for the eyes. Finally, if you like extras, there are tons of them in the four-disc DVD set."

The general idea of the movie is very original and the plot does a great job in entertaining the viewer. The characters are relatable and well characterised. It would have been truly an amazing movie if not for those dogs. They are so frustrating because they are so childish in a bad way. Being for children is not a problem and indeed I love animated movies but these dogs were terrible and they are used like the random NPCs you have to fight against in every videogame. And this is very bad because the messages that the movie tries to convey are important and mature and the dogs are really out of place.

","Because of the entanglement of love, they put aside the adventure of traveling around the world. The stream of water is old and old, and the life of each other has been completed, and it can withstand any dream miss. Because of the stumbling block of memories, even if she died as a photo on the wall, even if he had changed from a young boy to a stubborn old man, he would have to take a once-used common hut and set sail for their childhood aspirations. The hut is the carrier of cherished memories, and the shackles of the closed heart. The adventure is a dream to get what you want. It is also a rebirth to reminisce the past. Because of a journey that has not been lost, this old man who has fallen into solitary life because of his love and death has experienced a new partner. The occasion, found a new fulcrum and new sustenance.
The first ten minutes of the film described Carl's most of his life and Allie's life. I think many people's lives are similar to the first part of the film. When we were young and ignorant, we all cherished dreams of ignorance. Slowly, we are slowly worn away by life's expectations and dreams.<br/><br/>As Wang Xiaobo said, life is a slow process of being hammered, and finally it becomes like a hammered cow.<br/><br/>Their love is always with them, no matter what happens, the two are snuggling and accompany each other.<br/><br/>Ordinary life, but they live unswervingly, this is the simplest appearance of love. In fact, in addition to love, there are friendship, affection and nature's love. These are the seven emotions and six desires that run through a person's life. We all have to face, Carl handed over the answers to his life questionnaire about love.<br/><br/>Yes, Carl has become an old man, but with his love and dreams, his heart is full of blood, he was still the dream chasing boy. I think, as long as people remember their original dreams, it's never too late to start. May we run away for half our lives and return to our youth.<br/><br/>Regarding adventures and dreams, an old man talks about the story of a young maniac, and the dream youth and memories of an adult. The ten-minute short film and the adventures and love of Carl and Ellie throughout the film are enough to become classics, making the main line of the film seem bland. Life is an adventure, the end of this journey is not a great spectacle, but walking with you"

It's a fun, family film. The story is interesting and very engaging. However, the movie falls into two very obvious sections for me and I will review them as such.<br/><br/>The first section is the development of the story, right up to the point they reach Paradise Falls. This section is brilliant. Really great viewing. The beginning flashback sequence with Ellie is absolute perfection. It harkens back to the WALL-E and Ratatouille-esque silent story telling technique. It evokes a real sense of emotion while watching.<br/><br/>The second section is where Up loses steam for me. I think the humour becomes overly slapstick and for me, was hit and miss at times. Doug the dog provides comic relief and the ""point"" joke I found funny. However, I felt Russell became very silly. He is obviously an intelligent boy, but some of what he says and does doesn't reflect this.<br/><br/>However, in saying all of this, I think Up ends strongly. I really appreciate what how it wraps up and it redeemed some of my earlier grievances.<br/><br/>Overall, Up is brilliant.

","This is what the CG studio does best; dreaming up a playful, preposterous premise (whoah, way too many p's in a row there) and then riffing on it in all sorts of clever, emotionally resonant, visually incredible ways. In this case, of course, it's a cute little airborne house, suspended from a mass of festively-colored helium balloons on a sort of farewell voyage to South America.<br/><br/>The filmmakers don't dwell on the science of this and neither do we. It's just too much fun to second-guess, a slice of childhood imagination come to life, which fits Up's warm narrative like a cozy winter glove. That sense of freshly-rediscovered adventure, a renewed link to the open-minded optimism of our earliest memories, that's what drives the plot and binds us to the cast. Right from the picture-perfect opening scene, arguably the best dialog-free montage ever, it's got us locked in for the long haul. Even when the second act sprawls, threatening to devolve into a broad adventure tale, trailing a long tail of recurring gags, we're thrown a thematic bone to keep it all together, neat and tidy.<br/><br/>The traditional climax may feel just a hair on the flat side - the villain dispensed in a manner befitting a James Bond evildoer - but the story's real apex arrives just before the closing credits, when the preceding ninety minutes of small details and callbacks finally pay off in a rich, appropriate farewell."

"isaacj-26329","10","0","0","7 March 2020"," Perfect.
","There are very few movies that I can classify as being pretty much perfect. It is so refreshing to watch this movie. It has such a beautiful and original story. Plus Micheal Giacchino's absolutely gorgeous score. When I was thinking about what makes this movie so great I came up with 3 things. 1st: The opening sequence 2nd: The symbolism and 3rd: The characters<br/><br/>The opening sequence:
This film deserves an entire section just for that montage at the beginning. It is so heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. It is so perfectly woven together. How it starts with Ellie waiting for Carl to get up the hill and then it switches with Carl waiting for Ellie. And that's what makes this montage so good. You go from feeling happy to sad in an instant and it feels completely natural and you don't feel jolted around. Like when they are decorating their baby's room and it is light and colorful and then the ""camera"" pans over to a dark and gray room that feels small and without any dialogue and you can perfectly understand that it is a miscarriage.<br/><br/>The symbolism:
I absolutely love the symbolism of this movie. For example after Carl chooses the house over Kevin and he finally makes it to Paradise Falls, the audience doesn't feel satisfied. When Carl goes through Ellie's adventure book and see's that she actually did fill in those pages that she was saving because that was her adventure and she writes to Carl ""Now go have another one."" This is when Carl's ark is finally complete and he throws out all the stuff weighing the house down. Signifying that his memories were weighing him down and that he is letting go of them. It helps the audience understand the story better and it makes the scene more emotional and the audience feels that satisfaction that wasn't felt at the beginning of the sequence.<br/><br/>The Characters: The other two things I've talked about could not be happen without the audience being able to buy into the characters. The characters in this movie are memorable and real. What makes this movie so good is that you can buy into Carl's character the first second you see him in that theater. Probably one of the best character moments in this movie is when Carl and Russel are sitting by the camp fire and Russel tells Carl about his memories with him and his dad and when he says ""Phyllis says I bother him to much"" to which Carl replies ""You call your mom by her first name!?"" Then Russel says ""Phyllis isn't my mom"" Its at that point where Carl realizes that Russel isn't just trying to be a Senior Camper he is doing it so he can get those memories back with his dad. But Carl knows that that wont happen because Russel's dad left him. This scene doesn't just develop Russel as a character it is the point that starts to change Carl's heart.<br/><br/>This movie makes me laugh every time. Smile every time. Cry every time. The story was so carefully written and the animation is beautiful. 10/10 this movie is Perfect."

The animation is good, with an interesting use of color, but nothing breathtaking. Everything in this movie is very good, but not great.

","Up, an animated Pixar film, truly captivates its viewers from the very beginning and tells the story of an old man finding a passion for life again through the adventures with an unlikely friend. Carl, whose voice is played by Edward Asner, is an older man who lives on his own, and is rather grumpy and upset with life after the passing of his soulmate, Ellie. Upon getting stuck with Russell, an upbeat boy scout an eager sense of exploration, they both embark on a journey to Paradise Falls while floating away in Carl's house. This movie is sure to excite both young and old members of the family, as it explores the practical nuances of life and getting old. The beauty of this film is the relatability and how plausible a lot of the underlying themes are for people to experience within their life. One will be hooked almost instantly, after being enticed by the cinematic editing and heartfelt moments of watching Carl's and Ellie's life together. Losing a life-long spouse, dealing with old-age and loneliness, and trying to find the beauty in life after hardships are all things that Up does a fantastic job of covering all while taking viewers on a beautiful adventure with Carl and Russell.<br/><br/>Russell, whose voice is played by Jordan Nagai, is a thoroughly bright spot throughout the film. Upbeat and charismatic, viewers seem to really enjoy the message Russell seems to give off; Never stop exploring and seeking things out in life. In essence, never let the child inside you fully die. While the friendship between Russell and Carl is quite odd, it is often times hilarious, especially at the beginning of the movie, and it truly shows a beautiful contrast of people's perceptions of life. His bright and bubbly attitude is only exemplified throughout the film, by subtle que's such as the bright colorful balloons used for the ship to float away, and the overall beautiful, fluorescent nature of Paradise Falls. This use of specific bright and bubbly colors shows a sense of progression or newfound appreciation for life again by Carl.<br/><br/>This film is sure to be an emotional rollercoaster, and genuinely speaking, the first five minutes of this film are in my humble opinion, iconic for Pixar. The film is one for everyone, and while there are moments of undoubtable children ""magic"", the story for this film is so magnificent, it will keep everyone intrigued throughout. In contrast with other children films, there are little that draw this much personal emotional pull. While films like Wall-E have been a big hit in the past, the relatable thematic nature of love, loss, and recovery is one everyone can connect with."

","Up left me sobbing with a smile on my face. It brought me back through all the stages of my life and had me imagining what new adventures and sorrows are yet to come. There is something for every age to connect to in this film. The uniqueness of this film is its ability to blend real dramatic content with whimsical imaginative adventure. Life is an adventure, with unexpected turns and twists and if a change is embraced happiness can be found again even after great sorrow it the powerful theme of this film.<br/><br/>Up, much like Mary Poppins, blends adult emotions with childlike whimsy. Mary Popping illustrates the importance of looking at life as an adventure and teaches adults to embrace change to find the happiness they too often leave behind in childhood. Mary Poppins takes the Banks children on whimsical adventures and helps Mr. Banks change. Mr. Banks ultimately finds happiness again by spending time with his family. With similar themes and techniques, both films leave their audiences lusting for a new adventure and appreciation of what they have.<br/><br/>Up begins and ends metaphorically and literately with the spirit of adventure. Carl Fredricksen, played by voice actor Ed Asner, it introduced in a movie hall, as he watches a film about the great adventurer Charles F. Muntz, played by Christopher Plummer. Muntz travels the world finding exotic animals on a blimp named the Spirit of Adventure. Carl meet and falls in love with Elle, played by Elizabeth Docter. Carl and Elle live a beautiful life together filled with good and bad times. They get married, buy and fix up the old house that was once the abandoned home they made their clubhouse in childhood. Scenes of sorrow are intensified using lighting techniques. They try to start a family, but Elle has a miscarriage which causes her great pain. The scene at the doctor's office when she receives the bad news is filmed from the dark hallway looking into the doctor's office, when she reflects, she sits outside in the shade. They move their focus to save for a great adventure to South America to follow the footsteps of their mutual childhood hero Muntz. As the years go by, life happens, and money is needed for unexpected expenses time and time again. When Carl finally manages to get the money together, they are elderly, and Elle ends up in the hospital where she dies. Again, lighting is used in the room before she dies is bright and the scene following at the funeral is dark to match the mood.<br/><br/>In this beginning montage, this film does an incredible job of invoking emotion. The deep sadness I felt for Carl after Elle died, made the transition of the film from dramatic and realistic, to fantasy easier to accept. When his house lifted in the air carried away by balloons, the sadness lifted with the house, because it brought the childlike whimsy felt when Carl and Elle first met back alive. This transition in the movie where Carl decides to have a new adventure emphasizes the central theme of this film by deciding to accept change and take another adventure.<br/><br/>The scrapbook Elle started as a young girl titled ""My Adventure Book"" is used as a visual motif throughout the film. Every time the story takes a turn and hope it needed to change and start a new adventure the book is pulled out. Music is used to intensive this visual tool, when Carl opens the book music in the background plays in the background that is associated with his love Elle. Her spirit for life is what Carl throughout the film leans on to find courage, and this powerful motif reminds the viewers of that spirit for life and courage needed to try again. After bringing the house to the spot Elle imagined so many years, he is left feeling unsatisfied and pulls out the book once more. He realizes Elle had filled pages with memories from their beautiful life together, leaving him with the advice to go out and have another adventure. The boy who by accident joined Carl on his trip to paradise is Russell, played by Jordan Nagai. Russell upset with Carl for not helping the Bird he named Kevin, goes off on a rescue mission alone. Carl realizes it is time once again to be brave and goes after him. Carl and Russel save the day and manage to return home.<br/><br/>The film ends with Carl standing in for Russell's father at the merit badge ceremony. The look on Russell's face when Carl pins the Elle badge on him is reminiscent of Carl's reaction years ago as a child when Elle gifted it to him. Carl, Russel, and Doug the dog played by Bob Peterson, are shown happily enjoying life together. The motif is brought out one last time and photos of the new adventures are added to ""My Adventure Book"". Carl was able to find strength through Elle even after her death to go out and live life again, to be courageous and because he was willing to change, he found happiness again with new friends."

"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","6 September 2019"," About dealing with the past
","First of all, the silent opening of this film is one of the finest pieces of cinema I've ever seen. The initial meeting between Carl and Ellie, their life together and the loss at the end, is a story in and on itself. Pixar is often at its finest when there's no dialogue. And this is the crowning achievement in that. Sure, there is some dialogue at the initial meeting, but after that it's pure visual storytelling. And it is glorious!<br/><br/>If only the rest of the film could have been as good. And yes, I'm taking the mickey out of you. Kinda. It's still a really good film, suitable for all ages, while still retaining that core of values, depth and wisdom that marks all great Disney/Pixar films.<br/><br/>That being said, I'm not a huge fan of the storyline. Going to South America is fine and the fact that it is achieved with balloon is just one of those precious things that just works despite its innate insanity. Put then we get introduced to the dogs. And the birds. And Christopher Plummer's character. Which all put together leave me with mixed feelings. They're good on their own. The dogs are fun, especially Alpha and Dug. Plummer's character can be both charismatic as well as menacing. The bird is... well okay, the bird is just silly, frankly speaking. Put it's the mix of them that has the hiccups. This movie could have been this great pulp adventure. Especially if you just kept the Plummer character and got rid of the rest. Put it's not. It's simply... silly.<br/><br/>Not to say that the silliness doesn't work. It also helps a lot that both Carl and his junior woodchuck partner in crime Russell are both fantastic characters. Carl especially is one of my favourite Pixar characters of all time. Perfectly curmudgeon, but still extremely likable and sympathetic.<br/><br/>I honestly think that I might like this movie better as a whole if it didn't have that opening narration. But it has and it is so good that the rest of the film pales in comparison. Still, very much worth a watch and one of Pixar's better ones."

Along the journey he accidentally picks up a young stowaway named Russell(Jordan Nagai) who's basically a boy scout trying to earn his next badge.

The scenes where Carl's house flies in the sky and over various landscapes looks awesome! The characters are interesting. Carl's a grump and it's perfectly understandable as to why. Russell's adorable and funny to watch which can be hard to do for kid actors. Muntz's minions which are dogs are also funny to watch. The leader of the trio sent to find the bird later revealed to be Kevin is lead by a dog who's collar is messed up so when he talks he has a high pitched voice and it's hilarious! The story can get dark at times but for the most part it's heartwarming and funny. With that being said check this movie out."

","Up is an adventure film which made with Disney's classic animated formula. But when viewed from the way to tell, this film has a feeling amidst Monster Inc and The Incredibles. Synopsis this film does seem rather strange, because it presents a theme that may not be common. But in fact this film is very good, and presents a lot of humor.<br/><br/>This film is a story that tells the adventures of Carl and Russell who spend their floating time above the train forests of Venezuela. They have tempers, problems and obsessions.The difference in the character of Carl and Russell as a central figure in the film also becomes an attraction. Up also presents a sad opening scene and can make the audience take part in the atmosphere. Besides that, the character's animation seems cute and adorable that appeals to the audience.<br/><br/>This 96-minute film has a fast tempo story, but it can still be enjoyed and is not impressed jumping up and down. Even in the first ten minutes, we will feel a solid groove and no pause at all. The biggest pause we find when we are in the middle of a movie. Film Up is like teaching us to care more about our surroundings, and to always get up even after many failures. All the hidden meanings are inserted in such a way well.<br/><br/>Because Up is an animated film, the quality of the voice is something that must be considered. Voices like Edward Asner, Jordan Nagai and Bob Peterson, the three of them managed to turn the atmosphere on well, while still playing the role they played. Overall, this film is very worth watching for all fans of the film."

His wife had a dream to go to Paradise Falls in South America. Unfortunately, the wife left him first after being hospitalized. This scene what makes this movie so touching.

Then, Mr. Frederickson decided to fly his own home to South America using thousands of ballons tied to the fireplace. Unexpectedly, it turns out accidentally Russel also carried away. The two of them then traveled in the jungles of South America to look for Paradise Falls.<br/><br/>Walt Disney always presents movies that deserve a thumbs up. Story after story that was presented, never made the audience bored and even disappointed. One of them is 'Up'. Up is an adventure animation film made with Disney's classic animated formula.

All of the hidden meanings are tucked in such a way that they don't look patronizing, but still highlight the messages that the film Up has.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Up movie goes to the list of films that are mandatory to watch. Especially if you remember Pixar's big name which has become a quality guarantee for an animated film with an interesting quality plot and a large number of meanings found in Up. When else can you enjoy movies that contain, adventure in the wild, adventure with flying balloons, and deep moral messages. Because movie Up is a film that can be watched by all ages, so you can invite anyone to watch this film."

","5 July 2009. ""Up"" attempts the difficult fusion of both children and adult elements in the same movie and usually succeeds marvelously at both. This sharp, 3-D animated movie handles both roarously funny scenes along with dramatic emotional scenes dealing with love, growing old, and the issue of what's important in life.

But ""Up"" in attempting to have it both, both serious grown-up issues and thoughtful scenes, it brings with it an expectation of a tighter reign on more realistic scenes regarding chases and escapes while thrilling go beyond plausibility, breaking the suspension of animated realism, which when 3-D is used actually increases the need for virtual practical sequences. Overall however, this movie is captivated with fabulous colors, the action is riveting, the plot outline decently strong and in some instances even more intimate than Coraline (2009). 8/10."

","Everyone has big dreams. But what if those dreams are put off? Perhaps children, bills, work, even life can get in the way of people's aspirations. Carl Fredricksen's dream? To finally travel to Paradise Falls in South America in memory of his wife. The story provides a fresh and thoughtful take on the ""adventure of a lifetime"" that many young people crave. It diverges greatly from other Pixar films as it does not rely on outlandish characters or an unrealistic plot to keep watchers interested. Up mostly remains true to life, allowing for audiences to empathize their struggles. The film is heartwarming but is not afraid to show the grittier sides of life. Pete Docter, the director, is able to artfully balance emotional moments in the film with whimsical exhilaration which makes this movie so special. The film allows individuals to realize the morals and themes of the story on their own without feeling degraded by oversimplification. People of all ages, especially teenagers to older adults, would appreciate the light and fun approach to the serious topic of making the most out of life. For animated films, Pixar's Up represents the pinnacle of storytelling by conveying dynamic characters and a compelling plot.
 Up is intriguing due to its fresh, but familiar, storyline that allows audiences to engage in the key aspects of the movie. Just within the first ten minutes of the film, we witness Carl Fredricksen's entire childhood and adulthood leading up to the present day. The introduction contains little dialogue aside from the first interaction with his childhood friend and future wife, Ellie. Their first meeting in the clubhouse is light and humorous, a nice contrast to the following. This scene introduces the ""grape soda"" pin, Carl's reminder of his wife and the adventures they experienced together. After, the film cuts to a montage of Carl and Ellie's later life. All the landmarks of one's life pass before onlookers without dialogue. The melding of mellow piano music with the near dream-like scenes moves the audience to empathize with the sweet then tragic life. The film fast-forwards to a Carl now tired and grumpy with his home being encroached on by skyscrapers. Before he is forced into a retirement home, the unfortunate fate of many senior citizens, he wishes for one last adventure. He promised Ellie when they were younger they would see Paradise Falls in South America, but their plans were always put aside for more pressing issues. Their dream was ultimately never realized as Ellie fell sick and passed away. So as a final homage, Carl straps thousands of balloons to his house which floats away in the wind towards his destination. Little does he know, his adventure is abruptly interrupted by Russell. A Wilderness Survival Scout, Russell becomes a beacon of naive, hopeful spirit which reflected Carl's own childhood. The two maintain a humorous yet personal relationship throughout the film, resembling one of a grandfather and grandson. Along with talking dogs, a rare bird, and a driven explorer, Carl's straight-forward journey to the waterfall becomes more than he bargained for. The movie continues the exciting adventure to achieve his dream while contending with his stowaways and new antagonists.
 Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal found Pixar's Up to have a superficial plot and lacking some of the trademark weight that audiences expect from Pixar. However, The animated film contained a meaningful characters and story that allowed the readers to feel the quest for new beginnings on an emotional level without belittling the audience. The film contains many difficult themes such as loss, purpose, and love. The beginning exposition of Carl Fredricksen's life is heartwarming yet sets the bittersweet tone of the movie. With nearly no dialogue, we get a deep understanding of Carl's character from his childhood to time as a widower. The film has plenty of artistically planned depth and tough choices, yet it is unique to many other Pixar productions as it does not dismiss the moviegoers' intelligence by forcing morals into their face. The story rather guides audiences to make the connections and sculpt an understanding own their own. Although Mr. Morgenstern may have found Up to fall short in regards to other Pixar movies, Up displays a level of maturity, simplicity, and thoughtfulness yet to be seen by other animated films.
 The adventure of an old man and his newfound companions may seem far-fetched, but the characterization make this story profound. The ideas are well thought-out into an intelligent film that speak to the meaning of life. Although many teenagers and older adults may find the theme of this story irrelevant, it is an important question for an individual to ask him or herself. Just as the audience saw in Carl's life, all people have dreams deferred. Yet the reaction to such setbacks is unique to the individual and it creates a beautiful narrative as people saw in Up. Carl represents the best and worst within the audience's journey to find the adventure of his life."

I guess it is a roundabout way of telling me that I am a grouch!<br/><br/>The film starts with a segment of Carl and Ellie from childhood to old age. It is the junior Carl who is shy, slightly awkward, a pace or two behind the frenetic and energetic Ellie. As life goes on, they could not have children and it is Ellie who slows down as they get older and she passes on, leaving Carl on his own.<br/><br/>It is all about Carl rediscovering that zest for life and having that adventure he and Ellie dreamt about all those years ago. This is a fun and imaginative film, slightly surreal and off beat. For a film called UP it actually keeps its feet on the ground in terms of story and emotion."

","I'm not particularly a fan of animated movies, but once settled in I can generally find them entertaining and worthwhile. The same can be said for ""Up"", the tale of an old widower curmudgeon who inadvertently hijacks a stowaway on his sky-bound home as it lifts off for a lifelong destination called Paradise Falls. The film is colorfully rendered, and if you're a guy who once might have been involved in Scouting at any level, you'll get a kick out of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) sending his young hitchhiker Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) on a hopeless snipe hunt. When these things occur, I find myself in the underdog's corner, and when Russell finds a snipe and names him Kevin, the adventure really gets under way. It's too bad Carl's childhood hero turned out to be a villain, but that sets up the challenge of saving his new found friends from a diabolical, mad scientist, and find a way to get back home. Oh yeah, can't forget the cute canine pal along for the ride as well. His name is Dug, and is sort of the comedy relief character along with Kevin, and has a big hand (paw?) in making the save for the intrepid travelers. For it's efforts, ""Up"" won a Best Animated Feature Film at the Oscars in 2010 against some worthy contenders. In it's own way, the film has something for young and old alike, and if you're feeling down for any reason at all, you might even find it up-lifting."

","I like an adventurous adventure. I've heard everyone needs someone to look up to - and Carl Fredricksen idolising famous explorer Charles F. Muntz certainly demonstrates this, as does Muntz vowing not to return until he captures an exotic bird at Paradise Falls. Carl befriending a girl named Ellie, also a Muntz fan is interesting to watch and I like two would-be explorers sharing their desire of a great adventure together.<br/><br/>I was moved by Carl and Ellie's emotional experiences during their years together. They realised their dream of visiting Paradise Falls, but I wasn't expecting Ellie to fall ill and die. Some may think that because elderly people are elderly, they're adventures are over. But that's never a guaranteed fact: I'd seen the posters for Up before I saw the film and when I first saw the thousands of helium balloons lifting Carl's house up to the skies, I was truly amazed. Russell, a young Wilderness Explorer who visited Carl in his effort to earn his final merit badge, becomes an accidental stowaway as he frantically pleads to be let in but is denied by Carl at first, which I found hilarious!<br/><br/>The house flying through a thunderstorm is tense to watch, but the flying house survives and lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and walking it across the mesa is a good idea. I love the tall, colourful flightless bird known as the mythical ""Snipe"", whom Russell names ""Kevin"". The Golden Retriever named Dug, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak is also great. The pack of aggressive dogs led by Alpha, a Doberman Pinscher, are fun to watch. I was taken by surprised that Alpha had a funny voice, which turned out to be broken wire in Alpha's collar. I wasn't expecting Muntz to become the film's villain in his search for a giant bird. I was concerned for ""Kevin"" and Carl's house, when Muntz forced Karl to choose between saving it or Kevin. I was relieved Carl saved his house and that he and Russell reached the falls, but I felt for Russell and I was also concerned for Kevin. Carl looking through Ellie's childhood scrapbook is another fantastic moment - looking back at memories can be very powerful and have positive reminders of happy times.<br/><br/>When one adventure ends, another adventure begins. Russell going to rescue Kevin lifted my spirits - as did Carl lightening his house to take to the skies once again. The final showdown on Muntz airship is tense, but fun to watch. I was relieved once more when Carl freed Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddling Alpha with his cone of shame and becoming the dogs' new leader made me laugh and proud. Muntz falls to his death and Carl's house descends out of sight through the clouds. Carl could not have said it better, ""It's just a house.""<br/><br/>After reuniting Kevin with her chicks, Carl and Russell fly back to the city. Carl presenting Russell with his final badge: a grape soda cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met is a proud moment. I was very pleased that Carl's house landed on the cliff beside Paradise Falls, fulfilling his promise to Ellie. Towards the end of 2009, I had a feeling that a powerful experience was approaching. And Up certainly played a flying part leading Up to that powerful experience!"

","It was all right, I mean the story was good but I tend to over think movies and compare them with reality which makes movies worse. Yes I know that the shift from reality makes these movies, movies. For example Star Wars (or any Sci Fri movie for that matter) would be sh!t if you compared it to the real world. But Up however looks like it's supposed to look like the real world, if that makes sense. Now before we start this may contain spoilers it just depends on how much you know about the movie. First off Pixar animations admitted to have calculated how many helium balloons would have been needed to lift up and fly away with the house and yet didn't animate enough balloons in the film, what were all the calculations for? And also did you just happen to have a bunch of helium balloons cramped together in a chimney and if so how did the house not take off already (it's been a while since I saw the movie, I remember most of it with my photographic memory but I can't remember if this was explained in the movie). And lastly, if you think about it the old dude basically kidnaps the little Boy Scout and just flies off."

","UP is a Pixar movie that has Ed Asner's voice for Carl Frederickson who is an old man that has dreamed of going to Paradise Falls, South America his whole life. After his wife Ellie dies he gets into some trouble and is sent to a retirement home. Before they can take him there he uses balloons to lift his house and floats all the way to Paradise Falls. Carl ends up with a stowaway boy named Russell voiced by Jordan Nagai and ends up having the adventure of a lifetime. During this big adventure they end up meeting up with Carl's childhood idol Charles Muntz voiced by Christopher Plummer. Charles is an adventurer that was discredited and disappeared to Paradise Falls to regain his good name. As Pixar only makes animated movies with themes that seem to engage all ages the closest related theme I can relate to this is the theme of Despicable Me, where the older person in each end up loving the child or children involved. Although this movie uses computer-generated imaging it engages people of all ages with the antics of Russell and the crabbiness of Carl. They have all the typical problems of a grumpy grandfather type and that of a young boy even though they are not related. The dialog between Carl and Russell is typical for the age difference between them. They argue and fight about almost everything. <br/><br/>The lighting used for this movie is both high-keyed and low-keyed. The low-keyed lighting is used mostly during the scenes in South America where as the high-keyed lighting was used mostly in town before the adventure really starts and when the house is floating through the sky. The adventures are plenty rich with ups and downs. They are a combination of comedy and excitement. Carl and Russell end up saving a bird that Carl thinks is a nuisance to begin with. Then a talking dog comes into the picture too. This also makes Carl more irritable. Both animals are comical and almost believable. A villain that makes Carl not so grumpy with Russell also enters the picture. Pixar did an amazing job on this movie with a story line that could just be believable. You have grumpy old Carl and annoying little Russell against the wondrous world of Paradise Falls. With both of them trying to overcome their own obstacles in life. Written by A Anslow"

","My chances of seeing this film were so slim until one day before I graduated from middle school at the time, I saw this movie with my younger sibling along with some friends of his from elementary school, hoping that we would have a great time. Then, after the movie ended, we had such a great time. Never, and I mean, never have I seen another masterpiece from Pixar and this is in the same depth as the Toy Story trilogy, The Incredibles, Monsters INC and Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>The characters are very likable. Carl Fredricksen is a charming old man and I liked his attempts to reach Paradise Falls to make his deceased wife's dreams come true. Russell is also likable and the scene where he explains that his parents are divorced made me felt sorry for him. Dug, a dog with a device that can allow him to speak, is hilarious as is the humorous moments with him and a prehistoric bird named Kevin is also great and I liked the way he runs so fast which makes his speed much more incredible than you would expect from other animals. I also like the dogs, but I like the villain Charles F. Muntz as the best character in this film. The reason why I like him is because you think that he might by a good protagonist, but when he explains his evil ways of capturing the bird, you know that's the reason why you'll have a great villain to love. The voice cast, including Edward Asner, Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagai and Bob Peterson (the screenwriter for the film) voiced the characters pretty well.<br/><br/>The story is very original. It had some heart-wrenching moments including the beginning part where Carl's wife dies after so many attempts of getting some money to go to Paradise Falls and it's so sad that it would always make you feel sorry for Carl. It also has some witty and hilarious dialog including the moments with the dog leader's voice which sounded like a chipmunk along with Dug, but not only that. It has some intense action moments with the characters which is also a good thing throughout the whole film. The music from Michael Giacchino is also pretty good too. It has a great mixture of light-hearted moments and some intense moments.<br/><br/>What stands out the most is the animation. It is so beautiful you can see that every detail is unique and realistic, but the strongest aspect of the animation is the look of Paradise Falls because it really wows you to see that it can take your very breath away in about a few seconds. The character animation/design is also beautiful and I like the way some of the human characters and animal characters are supposed to feel like actual people in every ordinary lives.<br/><br/>Overall, Up is Pixar's another masterpiece in the history of animation and it's great to see that a year later, Dreamworks Animation made their masterpiece ""How To Train Your Dragon"" and it's also a great film to watch just like this one."

","The movie ""Up"" is another wonderful Pixar film. I found it to be very entertaining as well as giving a good storyline for people of all ages. However the beginning was not my favorite I did however overly enjoy the rest of the movie. I loved the fact that the film was very bright and cheerful and full of adventure. Carl (Edward Asner) is a stubborn old man that is stuck in his ways and really does not seem to like people. Russell (Jordan Nagai) is a wilderness explorer who is bound determined to get his assisting the elderly badge. However, Russell did not know that he was about to be on a wild adventure with a 70 year old man, in a house flown by balloons. Carl did not expect to be on an adventure with anyone else, let alone run into a talking dog and a bird that Russell named Kevin. The theme to the movie ""UP"" is to never give up on your dreams and what you want out of life. Russell will not give up on getting his assisting the elderly badge and Carl will not give up on Ellie's dream. The theme of this movie matches the theme in the movie the ""Incredibles"", with never giving up on your dreams and what you want out of life. There are many techniques in the movie ""Up"" that show us the theme of the movie. The lighting is very bright and cheerful that goes against the gray old face of Carl. The angles in the movie make you feel like you are a part of the action. When they are flying in the air and have to go a different direction, you feel as if you are in the house as well. The angels also help you too see the reactions off all of the people involved. I think that this film gave you a good sense on the fact that if you stick with what you want to do in life that in one way or another you can and will get the job done. Russell and Carl were both faced with tough obstacles that kept getting in the way of what they wanted to accomplish but they always seemed to get through them. I think that this is a good kid's movie on how hard sometimes you have to work just to get a wilderness explorer badge."

","In the beginning of the animated film, Up, we are introduced to two young, enthusiastic and very different children who share a passion for traveling and their hero, renowned traveler and explorer Charles Muntz. This connection leads Carl Fredricksen, voiced by Ed Asner, and Ellie to become best friends as well as husband and wife. Their passion for travel never abates and they spend their life saving money to travel to Paradise Falls. Unfortunately, as it often does, life gets in the way and their dream is never reached.<br/><br/>Fast forward many years and we find an old, stubborn, grouchy Carl as the world has changed rapidly and left him disgruntled and refusing to change with it, reminiscent of Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon in Grumpier Old Men. Refusing to sell his house he mistakenly causes harm to someone, which gets him in trouble with the law and he is forced to live in a retirement community. Refusing to let this get in his way, he manages to inflate thousands of balloons tied to his house, which causes his how to rise up and float away. His destination: Paradise Falls. It's at this point that the theme of the movie really begins to pick up: no matter what happens, life goes on and you should enjoy every minute of it because you don't know what will happen next.<br/><br/>While flying to Paradise Falls, he hears a knock on his door, and unbeknownst to him, a local member of the ""Wilderness Explorers"", Russell has accidentally been brought along. Having no choice but to bring Russell along, he navigates them safely through a massive thunderstorm and almost arrived at his destination. Many balloons were lost in the storm and although still floating, it is not able to fly at high altitudes so Carl and Russell must drag the house to its final location.<br/><br/>On the trek across the mountainous terrain Carl and Russell encounter an exotic bird and a talking dog that is trying to capture the bird and return it to his master. During this trip the exotic bird runs away because they encounter many other talking dogs and they are escorted to a remote cave where Carl is united with his idol, Charles Muntz, who has spent the better part of his life searching for the elusive exotic bird that has befriend the group. Upon learning this Carl finally shows some emotion and spends the remainder of the film trying to prevent Charles from harming the bird.<br/><br/>This film used amazing computer graphics and enhanced colors to bring a mesmerizing setting to the viewer's eye. The focal point of this movie was the balloons that Carl used to float his house away and you can tell special attention was given to the creation and design to create an impressive display on the screen. The vividness they used also translated into Carl and his grumpy face and the transformation he goes through and without this superior artwork, they would have been unable to truly capture the essence of Up and the central theme of the film of how life goes on and to not waste a minute of it."

He meets Ellie, a neighbor who shares his passion for nature. When they grow up they marry, but are unable to have children. He sells balloons and she works at a zoo. They have always intended to travel to South America to verify Muntz's claims to clear his name. The best laid plans of mice and men prevent it and Elle dies, leaving Carl alone. His house is surrounded by a new development, but he refuses to leave. He injures a construction worker in a dispute, and receives an eviction notice. <br/><br/>He comes up with the idea to attach thousands of helium balloons to lift the house into the air and fly it to Venezuela and fulfill his dream of finding Muntz's bird.

I highly regret that my family and I went to see Disney's farce of ""G-Force"" instead of this in theaters. Don't get me wrong, ""Up"" has plenty of humor as well, but this film goes one step more and plays with your deeper emotions. This film explores the theme of letting go of the past and embracing the future. There's plenty of drama for adults, plenty of fun and action for children. Be cautious of letting very small children watch this, but it should be fine for most kids. By all means, watch this movie. It's a testimony to the power of animation."

","Adventure is out there! Or so Carl Fredricksen (Edward Asner) once believed. After his beloved wife of many years, Ellie, passes, Carl begins to regret not travelling with her on their great adventure: to Paradise Falls, South America. Feeling lonely and increasingly closed in by the rest of the growing world, Carl ties thousands of balloons to his small house and takes off into the skies toward South America! So begins Carl's final adventure, which is the subject of the wonderful film by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson: Up.<br/><br/>Not long after ""take off"" Carl finds a stow-away aboard his house, the young ""Wilderness Explorer"" Russell (Jordan Nagai). Carl has no choice but to continue on with his new companion, and together they embark on a thrilling adventure. There are chases, near escapes, dastardly villains, talking dogs, and giant birds, but the real discovery for Carl is that life is the greatest adventure of all. This is the primary theme of Up.<br/><br/>The high point of the film actually comes toward the beginning during a prologue (of sorts) that details the lives of Carl and his wife Ellie. The technique used is a wonderful montage depicting how they meet, their marriage, and all of the joy (and heartbreak) that follows. This short opening truly captures Carl and Ellie's love of adventure and the realization that their greatest adventure would never come. Only later, after travelling to South America and all appears to be lost, does Carl realize the true adventure was all of the time spent with Ellie.<br/><br/>Another technique used by the film to heighten the sense of adventure is the angles used in certain shots. The angles used when on the porch of Carl's house, or on top of an airship, add a great feeling of verticality that makes you believe the characters are in real peril. Even though it's an animated film, the danger is palpable, even though you never truly believe one of our ""heroes"" would fall.<br/><br/>Like Wall-E before it, Pixar's Up is a much more personal story. We do not follow a huge cast of wise-cracking talking zoo animals. Instead we follow an old man and a young boy on their journey. Their journey is Carl's journey, and Carl's journey leads him to discover that adventure is not ""out there""; his adventure has been his entire life."

","It's amazing how Pixar keeps making great animated films. They are somehow able to find that magic of compelling storyline, heart-felt characters, great voice actors, lively and light-hearted animation, and meaningful musical scores. Whatever magic potion they've got over there is really working. Dreamworks has been hit and miss. The other companies pale in comparison.<br/><br/>Where to begin? How gutsy was Pixar to have a septuagenarian as one of its lead characters? And to top it off, deal with emotional gut wrenching themes of loss; through miscarriage, death of a loved one, and potential loss of a lifelong home. They spice things up by adding a young boy who's dealing with his own issues of abandonment, emotional distance from a father, and striving to achieve. Wow. Heavy stuff for a kids film. And yet Pixar pulls it off, making a film highly entertaining for young ones (my 6 yr old was captivated) and their parents.<br/><br/>Just when you think things are getting too heavy, a change of pace comes along with the introduction of a group of dogs with collars that allow them to ""speak"", as well as the antagonist of the story.

","Now there are things that couldn't be done with live actors but CGI has changed that and it left me wondering why this very lovely story was produced as an animation. For the first half of the story there seemed no earthly reason why, and even in the second half I was still wondering.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was in the marketing as a 3D production that we are treated to camera angles and shots that would be quite difficult to achieve in live action and that is a pity because the story stands up on its own and is overplayed in many of the animation sequences. Fortunately it doesn't spoil the entertainment value but I am left thinking it reduces what could have been a great film into a good one.<br/><br/>Yes the spectacle is, in places, a visual treat, but there is something missing in the personalities that the film doesn't quite make up for. And so I am awarding it seven out of ten for entertainment value, with three out of ten deducted for trying to divvy up reasons for three dimensional viewing."

","First off, let me jut say that this is not my favourite film from Pixar. ""Finding Nemo"" and the ""Toy Story"" movies, especially the third one, go into that slot.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Up"" does not disappoint. It is basically about a 70-year-old man who decides to tie thousands of balloons to his house and go to a beautiful place called ""Paradise Falls,"" a place where he had always dreamed to go.<br/><br/>Everything is beautiful here, but what truly makes the magic of the movie is the acting. You really feel for the characters, and their voices, especially Ed Asner's character. After going through a lot of things in his life, you can just tell from the start that he has always loved adventure, but has always been stuck in the same old house. Christopher Plummer, whose character does not come in until later on in the movie, is great is the movie's antagonist; I've only really known him from ""The Sound of Music,"" so it was great to see, or should I say ""hear"", him play something else.<br/><br/>All in all, a very beautiful movie. The only reason why it was not as good as ""Finding Nemo"" and the Toy Story movies is simply because of the fact that I grew up with those movies (except for the third toy story, in which I re-visited my childhood when watching that movie). But, overall, I can't complain here. 9/10 for me."

I was literally feeling for these animated characters, it was almost scary. This movie contains so much heart it isn't even funny. Aside, the film starts and get ready for an adventure of a life time. Pixar has ONCE AGAIN proved that they can combine elements for both kids and adults without being to lean on it. I sincerely love them and hope they continue with their projects. Up, in fact, is not my favorite but is up there with Walle and Ratatouille. Pixar has many imaginative ideas such as a family of superheros, a cooking rat, or a trash-cleaning robot but never have I heard of an animation of an old man. But only Pixar can pull it off. People become skeptical and irritated of the introduction of the dogs. For one, I think those people thought as Up as an adult film. NO WAY! Up is obviously a kid's movie and that is what it was marketed for, but the balance between both is great. The animation is beautiful, with comparing to their earlier projects is mind-blowing of how much improvements they have made. Well, that is mostly it. Up is a great step up for Pixar and I suspect better and more mature movie from them. You know, ones that do not include dogs flying planes. But aside from that, the film is near-perfect. 9/10."

","Up is a fantastic story about love and the spirit of adventure. When a cautious young Carl (Jeremy Leary) meets the adventurous Ellie (Elie Docter), the two begin a sweet and loving relationship that lasts until Ellie's death. A short time later Carl (Edward Asner) realizes that the outside world is no place for him and he decides to chase the dream that he and Ellie shared. When faced with having to move from the home that he and Ellie built, he blows up thousands of balloons with hopes of flying in the house to Paradise Falls. This begins a wild adventure that includes a stowaway (Russell voiced by Jordan Nagai), dogs, and a strange bird.<br/><br/>This beautifully told story shares a story of two people who love each other very much and who share a common dream. Even when Ellie dies, Carl finds a way to show his love for her by going on this journey to Paradise Falls. This theme of never ending love is not overdone and is shown in a way that children and adults can understand and appreciate. <br/><br/>Carl's journey to Paradise Falls reminds me of the journey Jack Nicholson's character Edward takes at the end of the movie The Bucket List. After his friend Carter (Morgan freeman) dies, Edward takes Carter's ashes to the peak of the Himalayas to complete his bucket list for him. It was a truly majestic moment that made me want to laugh and cry at the same time. <br/><br/>The use of a musical track as the characters grew old together was very appropriate. It was upbeat and lively when they were young and seemed to slow and become sad as Carl and Ellie aged. By the time Elli dies the music had become very soft and distant.<br/><br/>Even though this was an animated film, the use of lighting was very effective and interesting to watch. An example would be when Carl is flying the house through some white fluffy clouds when suddenly the clouds become dark and ominous. This let me know that trouble lay ahead and made me wonder if Carl and Russell would ever make it to Paradise Falls. <br/><br/>With all of the tools available to make a good film, I believe that the writers and producers use of these tools in moderation let the love story be told in a way that was both entertaining and effective."

","Up is a touching computer-animated film that the whole family is sure to love. The film opens up with Carl Fredrickson (voiced by Ed Asner) as a young boy who happens upon an abandoned house where he meets Ellie his future wife. The night he meets Elle he makes her a promise to one day fly her to Paradise Falls and he spends the rest of the movie trying to keep that promise.<br/><br/>Carl and Ellie marry and spend their days saving for their trip to Paradise Falls and growing old together. Carl and Ellie eventually save up enough money for their trip, but Ellie dies before Carl can fulfill his promise to her. The film continues with Carl a crabby aging widower who happily spends his days alone in his house. However, after being forced into a retirement home by the courts, Carl decides to fulfill he and Ellie's lifelong dream and head to Paradise Falls in South America. In order to keep his promise to Elle he decides to take her with him by tying thousands of balloons to their house and floating it to South America. Content to be on his way, Carl is shocked to discover he has a stowaway aboard his floating house. Carl is inadvertently joined by Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai), a short attention spanned chatterbox who happened to be at Mr. Fredrickson's house while attempting to earn his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge.<br/><br/>Carl and Russell are off on their adventure and although along the way they hit a few bumps and encounter talking dogs, a childhood hero turned evil, and a brightly colored rare bird named Kevin, Carl refuses to give up on his childhood promise to take Ellie to Paradise Falls. The unlikely pairing and age difference between Carl and Russell provides for much of the films humor and the relationship that is formed is much like that of a father and son.<br/><br/>This Pixar/Disney team makes films that are nothing short of incredible and this film is no exception. There were many techniques used to create such an amazing film, such as the musical score and the viewpoints. The music really set the tone for the film; the songs that were chosen really amplified the mood at that specific point in the film. For example during the montage in the beginning the music is happy and uplifting while life for Carl and Ellie is happy, but during the disappointing moments in their life (a miscarriage, sickness and death) the music changes and becomes much softer and slower. Another technique used to add to the overall viewer experience was the director's use of subjective viewpoints. There were certain scenes that made the viewer feel like they were right there with Carl. The best example of this was when Carl was looking through Ellie's scrapbook in the beginning of the movie, if felt as if the viewers were right there looking over his shoulder, turning each page and feeling every feeling Carl felt.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie is appropriate for all ages; it is a wonderful idea to teach both children and adults that no matter their age, dreams, promises and goals should have no have expiration date."

To take off on his trip, Carl ties thousands of helium-filled balloons to his house and it lifts up to the sky. The angle that the camera has on the house is awesome, because you can clearly see the house floating up into the sky with all of the balloons attached. However, what Carl doesn't realize is that there is a little wilderness explorer named Russell attached to this porch. Carl and Russell eventually become very close as they enjoy their journey to Paradise Falls. Carl shows Russell about how to survive in the wilderness, and Russell shows Carl how to have some patience. As the movie moves along, the house eventually lands on Paradise Falls.

"s_decker2010","8","0","0","1 May 2011"," Up addresses tough issues
","The film Up is about the journey of a man named Carl Fredricksen, voice by Edward Asner, and a young boy named Russell, voice by Jordan Nagai (Docter, 2009). Carl Fredricksen married the love of his life and they both loved adventure, even as children. His wife's name was Ellie, and her dream was to live at a place called Paradise Falls and Carl promised her that one day they would live there. After Ellie passed away Carl set out on a journey to take their house to Paradise Falls and fulfill the promise he had made her. <br/><br/>While traveling to Paradise Falls in his house, which he had rigged to float by using balloons, he acquires a new companion named Russell. After a treacherous journey they finally reach Paradise Falls. While they are on the last leg of their journey, Carl and Russell have to deal with some unexpected complications. These complications involve a rather large bird, a very loving talking dog named Doug, Doug's not so loving dog companions, and their elderly master. The dogs' master is a man named Charles Muntz,voice by Christopher Plummer. Muntz thinks that Carl and Russell are trying to steal from him and orders them to be killed. Russell and Carl barely escape with their lives, and unfortunately Carl is not able to fulfill his promise to Ellie. Through Carl's journey he makes a very important realization. He realizes that sometimes there are more important things. For Carl, Russell and his safety was more important than getting his house to the top of Paradise Falls. He also realizes that even though he has lost his wife, he cannot stop living. <br/><br/>Carl realizing that there were more important things than his journey and that even after death life must go on saved Russell's life. When Carl understood that life must be lived and not forgotten, he made a large impact on a special young boy. Throughout the film Russell mentions his father, but he never has very much to say about him, except that he is hardly ever around. Carl became like a father to Russell, which was exactly what they both needed. <br/><br/>When I am thinking about the theme of Up, there is another movie that instantly comes to mind. The film P.S. I Love You starring Hilary Swank, Gerard Butler, and Harry Connick Jr., has a similar theme to the film Up (La Gravenese, 2007). They both are about finding life after death, and about having to find your motivation to move past it. After Hilary Swank's character loses her husband, played by Gerard Butler, she has to find motivation to move past her husband's death and continue on with her life. This is exactly what Carl Fredricksen has to deal with when he loses his wife. In the end, both Hilary Swanks character and Carl find ways to go on living their lives and they also find ways to change the lives of others. <br/><br/>In the film Up, the directors use lighting to influence the emotions felt by the viewers in different scenes. When Russell and Carl reach Paradise Falls, the lighting used is bright and so are the colors used. This is done to give the viewers the feelings of happiness and jubilation. This scene varies greatly from the scene where Carl and Russell first meet Charles Muntz. In the scene the lighting is a lot darker and so are the colors. This is to give the viewers a hint at what is to come by Carl and Russell meeting Mr. Muntz. The directors also use background music to help add character to the film. When Carl is looking through the photos of him and Ellie, the music in the background contributes the feelings of sadness, happiness, and a hint of loneliness. During the scene when Carl and Russell are having dinner with Mr. Muntz, the music in the background adds a lot of tension to the scene that can be felt by the viewers watching. Another example is when Carl is trying to save Russell from Mr. Muntz. The background music in the scene adds excitement and anticipation for the viewers and has them waiting for what will happen next. <br/><br/>This film did a really nice job of expressing its theme. The directors put a very colorful and exciting story to it and made it come to life. Death can be a very hard thing to deal with, but death of a loved one does not mean that life is over. Each person must find their own motivation to carry on and go on living life. There are things in life that may seem extremely important to us, but sometimes we can be deceived. People can be tricked into thinking that something should be the most important thing to them, while it should really be something else. Just because something is important to you does not mean that it is alright to over look other things that may be of equal if not more importance."

","Up will lift your spirits! Another great success from Pixar, Up is an excellent family film that people of all ages can enjoy. Up takes you on a journey through life and its surprises. Written and directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, Up approaches life from a more mature angle. According to yahoo.com, ""Carl Fredricksen spent his entire life dreaming of exploring the globe and experiencing life to its fullest. But at age 78, life seems to have passed him by, until a twist of fate (and a persistent 8-year old Junior Wilderness Explorer named Russell) gives him a new lease on life."" In this heartwarming story Carl, a 78 year old man, and Russell, 70 years his junior, develop a great friendship through their obscure journey. When watching this movie I was struck by the reality of the beginning sequence of clips as Carl and Ellie travel through life with big plans that they strive toward. They have a continual goal they are attempting to reach as a couple. This dream however must be put on hold while their life continues to hit bumps along the way. These different bumps are events each member of the audience can identify with, to some degree. As audience viewers watch a connection is formed between then and both Carl and Ellie. This connection can most clearly be felt when Ellie passes away and Carl is seen walking home alone. Not to leave the movie goers in a slump the movie quickly reintroduced, a few years later, to Carl as the old ornery man across the street all have come to fear and love. Determined to fulfill the dream of his late wife, Carl fills thousands of helium balloons and lifts his house from the ground into the air. Comfortable in his sailing-house-air-balloon floating above the earth he hears a rap on his front door. His unwanted guest is none other then Russell. Russell is a Wilderness Explorer trying to complete his last task as a Wilderness Explorer, assisting the elderly badge. In an attempt to earn his badge Russell ended up on the front porch of Carl's home as it took off up into the sky. They arrive near to their final landing spot and decide to walk the floating house to its destination before the helium runs out. Their adventure continues as they meet new friends and old friends and make new enemies. Carl and Russell grow together in learning how to trust and respect one another. <br/><br/>This adventure kid's story is a great family film that reminds people of all ages to refocus on the important things in life and some of the sacrifice to get there. The movie ends with Carl and Russell eating ice cream watching the cars as they drive by. Both of the main characters have changed because of their journey together. Together they sit in communion; neither is left on their own and they now have a new hope and goal of friendship in community. They have finished the journey and accomplished the task they were striving toward."

Two other unwanted company joins Carl on his journey to paradise falls.<br/><br/>It's a film that the entire family can enjoy. Whether it is in the theater or just at home it is worth the entire 96 min. As young adult I am fan of Disney Movies and Up has been added to my list of favorite movies. At times we live our lives but we do not take time to stop and smell the roses. We chase dreams but we don't appreciate the journey. For Carl meeting Russell took him on a detour that taught him how to appreciate the small everyday things in life. Life is a journey that is full of adventure and at times the path we are on are not quite what we had planned. We need to have the spirit of adventure to fully experience each path we travel on the journey.<br/><br/>We all have a dream of being on the mountain top with our own little house on top of paradise falls. We might set out to pursue one dream like Carl did but along the way we find something of more value that we would have never thought of.

","*SERIOUS SPOILERS* <br/><br/>I'm amazed at how many Hollywood movies today explicitly acknowledge the power of cinema to shape minds and lives. Since this is now a trend, how can Pixar be far behind ? This film opens with a film within, the documentary on exploration which is seen by our hero as a very young child. The notions of mystery and adventure, conflated with the larger-than-life celebrity figure of Charles Muntz, burn themselves into the child's consciousness. They virtually define his life and existence. Along the way, he meets a girl who is similarly besotted with Muntz and the fantasy he represents. They get married, and their mutual love is founded on the film they both saw and fell in love with. Soon they get swept in the grind of everyday life, but they keep their dream alive. When she dies, leaving him an abandoned old man, he attempts to transform their dream into reality.<br/><br/>So the movie begins, but the rest of it is more or less generic animated fare. And its oddly more Disney than Pixar. Sure, the animation has the usual high level and the color palette is much wider, but the comedy and action sequences are rather tame by modern standards. I actually think that 'Kung Fu Panda' (which is quite lowbrow) is more effective as an action comedy, and has a far more rousing third act. I'm surprised they didn't try to make this deeper, or extend the self-reference to the entire film. Too bad. But that opening was very nice."

This is followed by a remarkable sequence of these two over the next 50 years, which could be taken from the movie and turned into a popular animated short in animation shows.<br/><br/>The movie moves easily from wildly, amazingly funny to non-maudlin touching. There are incredible ideas in the film that I won't spoil for you, and wonderful visuals, most notably a scene in which a mass of balloons throws brightly colored shadows. This film is both one of Pixar's funniest movies, and the one that feels most like true art. It is a movie everyone should see."

","I've finally got to watch Up, and from the beginning, I wasn't disappointed, but I was more or less saddened... I mean, I know every good story has to have a back-story, but this puts a man's whole life into ten minutes, and it's very, very sad. Cute, but sad. The man's wife (who, to add to the sadness, passed away) always wanted to take their house to Paradise Falls, a waterfall in South America. He does so, by equipping his house with thousands of balloons. During the journey, he meets an overly-hyperactive boy-scout-type kid, a bird that's definitely taller than I am, and a dog (with a collar that allows it to talk) who is the runt of the litter...<br/><br/>But what really made it click was the ending, after they lose the house to the villain, who plummets to their death. We find that the house was placed, perfectly, next to Paradise Falls, the way the wife would have wanted it... It deserves every award and accolade it's received, though I do not believe it's suitable to be called a children's movie. Animated, yes. Family, maybe. Children's movie, no."
"MaxBorg89","9","0","0","5 June 2010"," Pixar keeps going up (pun not intended)
","More than the consistent quality of its work, Pixar has a certain boldness going for it. What other animation studio could possibly get away with a film where the main character is a rat (Ratatouille), or one that is practically silent for the first 40 minutes (Wall-E)? Up is another impressive gamble, since it does what few other ""kid's movies"" have tried: having a grumpy old man as the protagonist.<br/><br/>The old man in question is Carl Fredricksen (Edward Asner), a retired loner whose house is about to be demolished. Unwilling to move to a retirement home, he does the unthinkable: he decides to go on an adventurous journey he has dreamed about since childhood, and takes the house with him thanks to a lot of helium balloons. The only problem is, a boy scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai) has come along for the ride, which takes the unlikely duo to South America, where all kinds of strangeness await them.<br/><br/>The great thing about Up is that, once again, the filmmakers have put story over technique, so while the picture may look gorgeous and boast a visual inventiveness worthy of alive-action adventure flick (including the chance to see it in 3D during its theatrical run), directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson (aided by The Station Agent's Thomas McCarthy in the screenplay area) never lose sight of what really matters, i.e. a captivating plot and believable characters. In fact, the reason grumpy old Carl works as a leading man is that the film's opening act, which establishes his background, makes him instantly relatable, thanks to a narrative bravery that surpasses Wall-E's wordless first act and even beats the likes of Bambi and Dumbo in the tears department. It's a tough act to follow, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume the film runs out of steam after that scene.<br/><br/>And yet this isn't the case, and it's all due to that unmistakably Pixar combination of thrills and laughs: from the perfect balancing act of Carl and Russell to the peril represented by one Charles Muntz (a textbook Disney villain voiced by the terrific Christopher Plummer), Up has something for everyone, including a brilliant spin on the age-old cartoon conceit of talking animals and bizarre sidekicks (a giant bird named Kevin, anyone?). It's an exhilarating ride that never ceases to entertain and move, a new confirmation of the fact that John Lasseter truly is the new Walt Disney.<br/><br/>In short, Up is a new high for Pixar, with yet another example of good storytelling used to make an improbable premise into an animation masterpiece and a gruff old fellow into an iconic character. It's like Eastwood's Gran Torino, but with more heart and lots of hilarious talking dogs. What's not to love?"

","My favorite Pixar movies are the ones who have (in my opinion) the very best characters. Monsters, Inc., Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, etc. My least favorites are the few that have the most uninteresting characters, like Cars. Not to say that Cars is a bad movie, but it didn't leave a memorable impression on me like those other movies did. Up fits somewhere in-between those two categories. It has some great characters, they just don't happen to be the main ones.<br/><br/>I'll just come out and admit it - I thought Russell was an annoying little brat. Carl was a likable enough protagonist, but Russell really hurt the movie, for me. Kevin and Dug, on the other hand, are a big part of why I still ended up liking the movie a good bit. They're some of the most flat-out hilarious characters that Pixar has ever made. Most of the comedy in Up involves one of those two animals, in some way.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful movie, no one can deny that. It's so bright, vivid and colorful, that anyone who's watching it on DVD or an SDTV is really missing out. Up is basically a commercial for running out to get a shiny new HDTV and a Blu-Ray player. This movie is an absolute visual and technical marvel, and it's also a good family film. Pixar's record of quality remains spotless."

","As with Wall-E, I couldn't help but feel less than enthusiastic while viewing UP. It's a well put together package, of course, but rarely have I felt that the emotional responses the film makers were going for were so forced. Many of the bits were amusing, and many came off as trite and trying way too hard to inject some humor or cuteness into the proceedings. For a viewer such as me, simply parading cute looking characters on the screen is not enough to warrant the masterpiece status that Pixar seems to get with each film. That being said, the film was beautiful to look at, no argument here. It had some moments that truly clicked, such as the opening montage. In fact, as predictable as the movie's story arc was, the first third of UP was enjoyable.The one thing that really did bother me during my viewing was that I consistently had to say to myself ""it's only a kids movie."" Which is fine and all, but should a movie with such mainstream and critical acceptance really need this sort of free pass to be considered great? It seemed a scene couldn't go by without a major continuity error (by the way, WHY ARE THERE CONTINUITY ERRRORS IN AN ANIMATED MOVIE) or some new level of ridiculousness that betrayed the previous set rules of the film's universe. It was as if I was playing a kids game where the rules keep changing. I expected the overbearing sentimental themes seen in the beginning and end, but between the physics involved in an old man pulling a hose along by a garden hose and the whole ridiculous talking dog storyline it eventually came to a breaking point. There are ways to show sentimentality in a way that doesn't obviously manipulate the viewer, and pointing this out doesn't mean I don't enjoy an emotional story arc. Give me Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc any day over a film like this, which seemingly exists for those that need inspiration to be beat over their head repeatedly for 90 minutes."
"imagiking","7","0","0","1 April 2010"," Up: Just Fine
","Pixar's newest and arguably most well received film, Up swept the world with its mix of comedic and dramatic elements. Positively received by critics and crowds alike, it comes with a daunting reputation.<br/><br/>Carl Fredricksen is a curmudgeonly pensioner, living alone in an increasingly urbanised environment following the death of his wife. When construction work damages his DIY mailbox, Carl strikes out, and is condemned to a retirement home as a result. Unwilling to leave his home, he uses thousands of balloons to lift the house away and fly to South America, as he once planned with his wife.<br/><br/>The first ten to fifteen minutes of Up have become amongst the most famous scenes in recent cinematic history. Conveying a life of love and loss without words in such a short and simple scene, Pixar may well have accomplished their best work here. It is endearing, emotional, and engaging, immediately allowing us to forgive Carl's gruff exterior and meanness. After the involving start, however, things begin to follow a standard formula, with wicked villain, threatening henchmen, catchphrases and general conventions of children's films. This may be appropriate, given that the film is just that, but the potential purveyed in the opener unfortunately goes largely untapped. The remainder of Up, following its strong start, simply fails to live up to what it might have been. Jokes are mildly amusing, plot is insufficiently entertaining, characters are less than enduring. Though it functions just fine as a children's movie, it leaves a sense of disappointment behind it.<br/><br/>With a strong start, Up promises much but fails to deliver the best. Entertaining despite this, it works as a way to pass the time and entertain the kids. Its beginning taken as a short might have made Pixar's best film, but as a whole it keeps the audience happy, if not thrilled."

","Films like Up, with computer-generated animation that captures every tiny human gesture and expression while still presenting a parody of the face and body, are so far removed from traditional animation that they might as well be given a genre of their own. That's not intended to denigrate the work of the likes of Pixar, but simply to point out that what we have here isn't so much another form of animation as another form of non-human images. Where Up! loses the kind of warmth human animators were capable of drawing into their characters, it redeems itself by delivering an emotionally-anchored tale of adventure that relies heavily on it's lead character's melancholy state of mind to keep the audience on board. To this end, Up! is more of an adult's film with elements added to keep the kids entertained rather than the other way around, which is usually the case with films like this.<br/><br/>Ed Asner voices the character of Carl Friedrickson, a lonely old man who misses the recently deceased wife he has been with since childhood. He also regrets that they never managed to embark on the kind of adventures they dreamed about when watching newsreel of famous explorer Charles Muntz. All this is shown in an opening vignette that will nail the viewer's backside to their seat more firmly than an entire tub of superglue. Threatened with eviction to an old people's home, Carl decides to launch his house into the sky with the help of 20,000 helium-filled balloons and drift away to Paradise Falls in South America, which was the dream destination of his late wife. Things don't go quite to plan when Carl discovers he has a stowaway on board in the rotund form of Russell, some kind of wildlife ranger who just needs his 'Help the Elderly' badge to become a senior wildlife ranger.<br/><br/>Beneath the adventure is the rather less exciting message that it's OK to live a life of ordinariness and routine, and that a life lived with the right person is a journey and adventure in itself (Not quite sure I'm inclined to agree when I'm stuck in a five mile traffic jam on the A428 or washing the dishes, but I'll let that one go). As Russell says, with an innocent insight that belies his youth, it's the small stuff you miss when it's no longer available to you, like sitting on the kerb with your dad, eating ice cream and counting red and blue cars.<br/><br/>The film looks incredible, almost to the point that you're drawn away from the story at times to gawp at the growing stubble on the old guy's chin, or the fur on the talking dogs that form the old and embittered Muntz's guard. It isn't really intended to be an out-and-out comedy – it certainly isn't simply out to get as many laughs as it can – but there are a few laugh-out-loud moments and a refreshing lack of sentimentality despite it's essentially emotive subject matter. Definitely worth an hour-and-a-half of anybody's time."

The best line in the entire film ""I finally get to meet my childhood hero, and now he wants to kill me"". Seriously, this should have been a PG-13 movie. Pixar films were more upbeat before they teamed with Disney. Now with Disney, their films have an added drama to them. Disney is great at musical animation storytelling, but I wish they had left Pixar alone.<br/><br/>The story isn't that great, although the love story between Carl & Ellie is admirable, ultimately it's about the widowed Carl and an obese stowaway but determined boy scout, Russell. Their encounters with a strange bird and a talking dog lead them to the villain in the movie, who probably should have had more screen time. There was no explanation of why he needed all those talking dogs.<br/><br/>I thought the animation was superb but the scenarios when the main characters were put in peril, were a little too unbelievable.

","When ""Tin Toy"" and other animated shorts first appeared from Pixar, it was like a breath of fresh air in the world of CGI. Instead of more robots, they boldly took on the challenge of rendering natural subjects, including human beings. The slightly drunken-looking wobbling of some characters (maybe, again, to avoid the precise, laws-of-physics appearance of most other computer animations of that time) was a bit distracting, but the images of flexible objects (like babies) were break-through accomplishments.<br/><br/>Now, almost thirty years later, the technology has advanced considerably (close-ups in ""Up"" of fabric, fur, and hair, are stunning). But, it looks as though Pixar has hired one set of CGI characters and now has them all fulfilling their multi-movie contracts. If you saw ""The Incredibles,"" you will feel as though you've seen these characters before (perhaps, if you've also seen ""Toy Story,"" the same way you felt you'd seen those characters before when you saw ""The Incredibles""). In a way, even ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Cars"" look like they all came from the same factory as this film. Well, they did, but... why should they? The exaggerated features, cartoonish proportions, and overstated gaits (a kind of bunny-hop if the character is young, a Frankenstein's-monster sort of lumber, if elderly) are starting to look very familiar. (Although, inexplicably, given how far the technology has come, the designers feel compelled to include elements, such as Mr. Frederick's slightly polygonal ears, that appear to be concessions to the computer's historical role in films of this kind.)<br/><br/>The story itself is flawed, alas. No spoilers here, but it did seem that the main character's emotional responses to events around him were inconsistent, as were his physical abilities. He chooses sides in the (dramatically necessary) conflict, but not the one it seemed that he would have, at least not at first. Also, while the idea that he can fly his house via thousands of helium balloons is well within the accepted tropes of the cartoon genre, it lingers on way too long and becomes an intrusively absurd aspect of the whole film, with scene after scene making it harder and harder not to say, ""Oh, come on now!"" In fairness, there are a couple of moments that will bring tears to adult eyes, proving that this medium really can deliver emotional content. If only there were more of that, and less of the outright nonsense, I'd have scored this film much higher.<br/><br/>Pixar broke the mold, decades ago. But now they've replaced it with a new one. What once seemed so daring and new, has become ho-hum and commonplace. A cynic, just maybe, would say, ""Hey, they know what sells."" A shame, given that an animator--using a computer or not--is, in the end, not limited by the laws of physics, but only by our willingness to suspend our disbelief."

"EUyeshima","9","0","0","17 December 2009"," Human-Sized Pixar Adventure Impressively Balances Character Depth and Genuine Thrills
","I have to admit there are two reasons I took an immediate personal liking to Pixar's 2009 sure-fire contribution to the box office, the Emeryville studio's impressive computer-generated artistry reflecting the most dependable cash cow in the industry. The first is the unique casting of an Asian lead character, a cherubic, hyper-curious nine-year-old Japanese-American Wilderness Explorer stowaway named Russell. The second is the reference to Fenton's Creamery, which is a two-minute walk from my former home in Oakland. Beyond those two points is a surprisingly mature, sometimes melancholy comedy adventure that focuses on a 78-year-old protagonist whose self-proclaimed destiny is to visit a mythical place that he and his wife have dreamed about ever since they first met. Before the kids start moaning, you should also be aware that there are more than enough exotic animals, talking dogs, acts of aerial derring-do, and miscellaneous Indiana Jones-type thrills to counterbalance the film's more sentimental moments.<br/><br/>Co-directed and scripted by Bob Peterson and Pete Docter, the movie opens during the Great Depression when a young, shy boy named Carl Fredricksen meets tomboyish Ellie in an abandoned house that she has turned into a clubhouse. They discover they are both aspiring adventurers who dream of meeting intrepid explorer Charles F. Muntz and going to Paradise Falls in South America. An impressively executed montage follows as we watch Carl and Ellie grow up, get married, and grow old together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes a solitary curmudgeon unwilling to sell his home, which is the same house where he met Ellie, amid the high-rises being built all around him. An unexpected altercation occurs after a construction worker accidentally knocks over Carl's mailbox. Forced to move into a retirement home, he hatches a plan to tie thousands of helium-filled balloons (a dazzling effect) to his house and float away to Paradise Falls. What he doesn't count on is the appearance of Russell on his porch early in the flight, and together, they face a series of adventures involving a large flightless bird in iridescent colors searching for her chicks, a lovable golden retriever named Dug who expresses his thoughts by way of a voice-activating collar, and Muntz himself, who has become a Captain Nemo-like figure deep in the jungle with his massive zeppelin.<br/><br/>There is a refreshing emotional economy to the story. That's why the 96-minute film doesn't feel as ambitious as ""Ratatouille"" or last year's ""WALL-E"", but at the same time, there is a deeper emotional resonance in the dilemmas presented since they feel so human-sized. Even as the film becomes more formulaic in the second half, it maintains the limited perspective of its main character as the rudder. I feel that's the key difference between this and other more populated Pixar confections. The vocal work is terrific, especially since Ed Asner (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"") perfectly captures Carl's gruff exterior without resorting to cheap sentiment to reveal his vulnerability. Nine-year-old Jordan Nagai provides the right energetic bounce for Russell, while Christopher Plummer has a field day playing all the various shades of Muntz. Peterson himself does stellar vocal work as both Dug and the squeaky-voiced Alpha, the German shepherd leader of the dog pack. Younger children may be bored by the film's more deliberate pacing and even at the idea of cheering a septuagenarian, but the more patient ones will be well rewarded.<br/><br/>The 2009 DVD is chock full of extras beginning with the obligatory short that that preceded screenings of the movie, ""Partly Cloudy"", a charming concoction in which clouds fancifully give birth to animals. Another five-minute short focuses on Dug's misadventures. Several pieces deal with individual components of the film, for instance, each character's development from inception to on screen character, how Carl and Ellie's house evolved, and how all the balloons and Muntz's zeppelin came to being. There are alternate endings dealing with what to do with Muntz at the end, as well as one that expands on Carl and Ellie's backstory. Also included are an interesting making-of featurette, a documentary of the filmmakers' visit to the Tepuis Mountains in South America to research the film's overall design and storyline, a piece about composer Michael Giacchino's score, and the various trailers for the film."

","Up is a film that focuses heavily on emotional story elements as well as epic-scale action scenes with a beautifully tropical setting. Everything you see in the trailer is pretty much present as you would expect, but the problem is that other than the masterful introductory fifteen minutes or so, nothing is there to surprise you or make you feel 'blown away'. The action scenes were fun but they somehow stole from the feel. To quote quite the unlikely source for such a phenomenal line... ""It's the boring stuff I remember the most."" That could not be more appropriate to describe Up, as it was the small, slower-paced scenes in the film that really made it stand out in the moments where it did feel special. When the child speaks of his father, and especially any moment referring to the old man and his beloved wife... these story elements that really focus on the characters is what won the show for me. Sadly, that is constantly broken to a degree by another scene that, despite its epic-scale in adventurous action, strangely felt unwanted when I'd rather just listen to the characters talk. That's strange for an adventure film for all ages, but I believe that was the film's problem.<br/><br/>Up... should not have been so heavily themed on adventure. The characters are too well developed and interesting to do that. Some adventure is mandatory and even appreciated, and I am not saying I didn't enjoy the action we got. The problem is, the balance was off, and it simply left me over-exhausted from high-flying venturing and starved for more character development.<br/><br/>Ultimately, while I greatly enjoyed Up, it simply did not live up to such gems as Ratatouille, Wall-E, and The Incredibles."

""Wall-E"" suffered from the same syndrome slightly; but the theme of environmental awareness in that film was universal enough, and integrated wholly enough into the action sequences, that the schizophrenia of it all was easy to overlook. In ""Up,"" I would have preferred to just continue the story that's set up in the opening moments without the kid movie tangent, and that's what ultimately made ""Up"" a much less memorable viewing experience for me than other recent Pixar films.<br/><br/>I wonder how long it will be before Pixar forms a unit that makes animated films strictly for adults, as they seem to want to.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","Up is one of my favourite movies for many reasons. It is about an old man who lives his life dream by flying to South America with his house, elevated by thousands of balloons. This movie is very sad at times, and made me emotional. At other times, the movie can get very exciting, for example the time when the old man flew with his house to South America. Sometimes, the movie could also become thrilling, and occasionally scary, like the time when a huge storm came upon the flying house.<br/><br/>The music of Up is exceptional, and adds to the movie's effect by a very large amount. It adds to the movie's emotional times and exciting times as well.<br/><br/>The visuals are fantastic and very detailed. Being 3D, the quality of the movie almost made me think it was real. This movie probably had the best 3D I have ever seen The plot of the movie was very moving. I felt all sorts of emotions. The characters, like the little boy, the talking dog, and the big bird, were very original. All characters made me laugh.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was very good, and is worth watching, even buying. I highly recommend watching this movie. My rating for Up is 9/10."

","What i most loved in the movie Up, is that, when ever the couple was free, they would hold hands and sit in front of each other in comfortable sofas and be reading. This something which is very doable, but then in today's generation with multiple channels of entertainment who would be holding hands watching cinema, television, surfing the net, playing farmville, tweeting, talking on cell phone, SMS, MMS, and many more ways, but not reading or writing letters.<br/><br/>Loved the eccentric Carl Fredricksen 80 year old uncle type of character, even at this age he has dreams that are unfulfilled and he wants to achieve them. Complete Kudos to Edward Asner for his voice for this character. Carl is actually an inspiration.<br/><br/>You cannot write a review without mentioning Disney and Pixar together for this one.

","Pixar's UP is about a widower who decides to fly his house to a falls in Venezuela in memory of his late wife. To do this, he ties helium-filled balloons to the house, and off he goes. Joining him on his crazy adventure is a neighborhood kid, and along the way they pick up a talking dog and a rare jungle bird being hunted by a crazed explorer who gets around in a dirigible. This is some nutty plot, but it works. The animation is superb, the story line quite touching. Ed Asner plays the widower and Chris Plummer is the bad guy. Highly recommended, mainly for kids and their moms. I suspect most dads mayl have a tough time sitting through this whimsical flick."

It speaks with so many messages I agree with.. and in such a non message-driven way: this is like hearing a story a true hero, while yourself finding more than one way to connect with their plight. There is a message to feel good sharing with your parents; adventure NEVER ever stops, and loving someone (your chosen beloved for life) is about wishing that their adventure is never ending... There are things we miss out on automating our lives... and reaching too hard for the future or clinging to needily to the past - both things can prevent us from living the moment.

","Pixar films tend to all follow some similar plot archetypes. A hero or protagonist that we are shown is inevitably flawed, but towards the end of the movie we see has changed their ways a great deal and has endeared themselves to the audience. While ""Up"" follows this trend it does so in a more mature way then its Pixar predecessors. The film follows Mr. Fredrickson and details an adventure he goes on inspired by his late wife Elie. Their marriage is shown to be an adorable one and they have been through the trials of realizing she is infertile. The subject matter while not inappropriate for younger children to see may be a bit over children's heads. The film can cross multiple age demographics because of its emotional undertone and message delivered through lovable and flamboyant characters and adventures that children will enjoy. ""Up"" was a great movie and enables parents and children to sit through the same film and still come away with something."

","Meet Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner), a grumpy old man who wasn't always so grumpy. Meet Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai), a well-meaning yet bothersome young Wilderness Explorer. Who would have ever thought that an animated film about these two characters would have become one of the year's best films? I can still remember watching the first teaser trailer, in which the plot was only vaguely introduced, and scoffing at the very idea of it. Though the marketing eventually won me over with its charming animation and vivid sense of humor, I stand now and humbly admit that my original suspicions were undeniably false. ""Up"", a tale of love and adventure, is wonderfully creative and downright lovable. It begins with a young Carl meeting the future love of his life, Ellie (voiced by Elie Docter), a precocious child who shares his love of famed explorer Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer) and The Spirit of Adventure, his iconic airship.<br/><br/>He and Ellie had vowed that, following a lifetime of saving, they would travel to Paradise Falls, the land that Muntz discovered on his first major voyage, and have unimaginable adventures. Soon, however, the real world got in the way and there savings had to be used on flat tires, damaged roofs, etc. Following Ellie's death, Carl becomes a lonely recluse who carries out his day-to-day routines simply because he has to and not because he enjoys them anymore. After a misunderstanding with a local construction worker, Carl is ordered to move to a retirement community, a sentence that he believes is absolutely unbearable. Tying thousands of colorful balloons to his home, on the morning he is supposed to leave, he finally takes off for Paradise Fallswith little Russell accidentally on his porch! Together, they sail across the sky on an adventure to a place beyond imagination where dogs talk, birds are huge and comical, and a man from Carl's past waits with a dark scheme up his sleeve.<br/><br/>Please read my full review on my blog: www.whathappensincinema.blogspot.com"

From the minds of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson comes a timely and endearing story of Carl Fredrickson (voiced by Ed Asner), a grumpy widower, who is a hold out in the middle of major construction. He is not about to sell the home he shared with his devoted wife for decades. Carl and Ellie met as children both with dreams of following their adventurer idol Charles Muntz(Christopher Plummer)to a land of the lost, Paradise Falls in South America.<br/><br/>After being forced to go to an old folks home, 78 yr old Carl attaches thousands of balloons to the roof and heads his home due south to find Paradise Falls in South America.

Carl is as grouchy as Russell is full of joy and excitement.<br/><br/>This animated feature is emotional, funny and a pure joy to watch and is meant for the whole family. I don't even recall any juvenile potty humor that is usually obligatory for such flicks. Loneliness is bittersweet and the adventure itself is uplifting and touching. Definitely a feel good movie.<br/><br/>Other voices you may or may not recognize: John Ratzenberger, David Kaye, Elie Docter and writer/director Peterson voices Dug, the dog."

","When it comes to Pixar movies, one can usually flaunter into a box office, casually ask for the ticket and dip one's hand into one's wallet without fear of regret two hours after said event. One might not feel comfortable treating oneself to a single ticket to a children's animated movie, but then again, you could just pretend you're on the other side of the world for a moment and revel in this momentary state of consumerist bliss. This state of ease that is accompanied with the now annual event of catching the latest Pixar movie is one that has taken over a decade to emblaze upon the cinematic landscape, but it's a trait that has been well earned and deserved nonetheless. You see, in amongst the remainder of the year's children's movies, animated and so forth, consistently significant and memorable are those penned by the guys behind Wall-E, Toy Story and Finding Nemo. In fact, to say that such films are in a league of themselves—no, another ball game entirely is not too much of an overstatement if any. This almost universally accepted truth is so obvious; so accepted as the norm that it has this critic questioning why he's devoted so much space to restating it.<br/><br/>But you see, there's a reason that I and many other film-lovers, critics and casual fans will so often draw focus onto the fact that Pixar above all others, stand a fair distance above those that challenge them. The reasoning is simply that when one does take that ticket stub and takes a seat in return, two hours later, you'll no doubt leave knowing that what you saw was:<br/><br/>1. Worth your money. 2. Not a children's movie at all. 3. Definitely made by Pixar.<br/><br/>Up, which is the latest in the long list of movies now made by the studio, may not be their best work, but it's got the same consistency and lovable charm about it that one associates with such movies. Sure, the kids will love it, but best of all is that you yourself won't suffer the consequences of falling asleep mid-way through. Instead, directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson deliver something akin to the studio's work last year (Wall-E) and give audiences a tale that will bring a spring to your step as well as make you think, feel and care for its characters. Indeed, if you had to pinpoint the sole area where Pixar so often excel where other children's animated adventures fail, it would be in this sense of character and humanity. Rather than bludgeon the screen with flat caricatures and cliché jokes that reek of kitsch (although there are a few notable, disappointing throwbacks to these stapes in Up), Docter and Peterson give ample screen time to their characters which allows them to breathe and feel human—the movie's first act, which acts as an extremely poignant and sweet fifteen minute ode to love and the passing of time, most strongly achieves this and so early on too.<br/><br/>If there is one drawback to the feature as a whole then, it would be the middle act which follows in the path of such a sombre, reflective and highly emotive opening. Placed within the confines of your average movie, such shenanigans and slapstick adventures would probably exist as the feature's highlight, but here the inclusion of certain elements (such as talking dogs—yeah, yeah, I know it has to please the children too, but c'mon) only work against the grander, more refined areas of the story. Yet for every talking dog and lame antagonist ploy in general, there exists a counter-weight in favour of imaginative story-telling and awe-inducing imagery that will have you mesmerised by all the colours, vivid details and lifelike quality to the otherwise very stylised and cartoonish animation. Audiences who shelf out a little extra for some 3D glasses will probably enjoy the visuals a little more but not by much—to its credit, Up uses the third dimension sparingly and without awkward ""Omygoditscomingatme!"" contrivances; it's nice to see everything so crisp in three dimensions, but it certainly isn't mandatory in order to have a fun experience either.<br/><br/>When it comes to pure storytelling, Up's screenwriters played their game basic, but not without some distinct charm and originality. While the general arc is very much the same as most animated films and Pixar's movies in general (get lost in an adventure, which in turn allows the characters to become more human and closer to each other), the writers spread enough character work entwined with some genuinely thrilling segments throughout to make the experience something of its own, albeit not quite as refreshing as earlier works. This small truth is something of a tagline price to the renowned and admired stature briefly touched upon in the opening paragraph; Up certainly is a Pixar movie—and a great one at that sure to please those who enjoy the studio's work thus far—yet it's not something to get overly excited about. Instead the movie works as a humble and affecting expansion on the tried and true formula so far developed from within. If that sounds a little underwhelming, don't let it deflate your balloons; Up nevertheless does what it sets out to do and does so whilst retaining that signature charm that audiences have warmed themselves up to for over a decade now; this is cinematic comfort food for sure, and as long as Pixar up the ante following this somewhat refrained piece, one can remain optimistic the next time your wallet is taxed for a movie with the name Pixar alongside side its credentials.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","Pixar and Disney have again come up with the goods with the funny and touching movie.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes show a young Carl Fredriksen (voiced by the legendary Edward Asner), fascinated by the explorers he sees on newsreels. He meets a kindred spirit in Ellie and we see their life together until she passes away. This segment lets us see Carl's character and is very moving.<br/><br/>Carl continues to live alone in his house until a run in with a developer sees him destined to be shipped off to a retirement home. Facing this prospect he decides to go to Paradise Falls, an almost mythical place he and Ellie had always meant to go to but never did.<br/><br/>Here the film really takes off (see what I did there?) as Carl opts to travel via his balloon-fuelled house. Only when he is in the air does he find that a boy scout in search of a last merit badge for helping the aged has become an unwitting stowaway.<br/><br/>Our odd couple eventually land near their destination but trouble awaits as they cross swords with an unexpected jungle resident.<br/><br/>I didn't see the 3D version but the animation is still brilliant with the colours of the jungle amazingly vibrant. The story is also excellent. We empathise with Carl and his young friend as they reveal their stories and come to rely on each other. The chase sequences are straight out Indiana Jones and breathtaking (even in non-3D). While there is a ""message"" it isn't rammed home at the expense of making the film enjoyable.<br/><br/>One small complaint would be the film is perhaps too long at over 90 minutes and dragged a bit towards the end. So, while it is not as good as the peerless ""Toy Story"" it is a very enjoyable film for all ages and well worthy of being listed with the other Pixar classics."

Oscar stuff! As for the movie, it is not only funny but also quite heavy on emotions. It deals with life as a hole and many small children will make some hard questions to their parents after watching this.<br/><br/>However, these subjects are dealt with gracefully and those question would need answers eventually. Pixar's just doing you a favor! I found two flaws in it that take the perfect 10 away (like WALLE deserved):<br/><br/>1 - Not Pixar's fault, but the Portuguese distributor decided that the 3D version would be in Portuguese only. Most ""grown-ups"" I know wanted to see the subbed one with the English voices (as we usually see movies in Portugal) but instead we had to miss out on the original voice work to get 3D. VERY disappointing.<br/><br/>2 - The movie is a little unbalanced. The first 15 minutes of the movie brought the hole theater close to tears (it's that good! - lots of grown man crying). The rest of the movie could never recapture the emotional weight of those first few minutes... loads of laughs though! Definitely worth viewing independently of your age."

","Technically this is a wondrously perfected piece of animation. Seen in 3D it is on occasion very close to real - the coat of one of the dogs was very lifelike for example. As an entertainment I don't think its intended audience is really children. It's for parents and other adults who are generally child friendly. The story effectively pokes and evokes emotional responses. I cried at one point and it was evident to me that the whole audience at the cinema I attended were also similarly affected. This is an incredible feat for animation - but not unknown. The heavy emphasis on sentimentality however, I found detracted from the Lost World Adventure story that it should really have been about. Admittedly, the Venezuelan scenes were beautifully done, the was even a rainbow on the waterfall - as occurs in life, the subdued mood created by the first segment of the film could not be erased. It's a lovely piece of work - but don't go with a child who has recently lost a grand parent."

","As a child Carl Fredricksen (Edward Asner) was always interested in adventure. He shared this passion with his childhood friend and sweetheart Ellie. They were both fans of the explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) and when they married they had always planned to travel to South America. Yet through the opening montage of Up we learn that Carl and Ellie weren't always able to fulfil their life goals together, such as travelling or having children. In the present day, as a cranky old man and a widower, Carl is still living in the same house and neighbourhood. He wishes to be left alone, particularly when he is bothered by a young scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai). Yet following an altercation with a construction worker, Carl is set to be moved out of his home. To avoid being put into a retirement village he attaches hundreds of balloons to his house to fly to South American for an adventure, unaware that Russell is onboard as well.<br/><br/>The superiority of Pixar films to other animated features is evident both visually and thematically. Where others regularly indulge in the monotonous idea of the smallest person can who make a difference, Pixar films such as Up, refreshingly delve into much deeper and more mature territory. The montage at the beginning of the film, which details Carl's life and marriage to Ellie, is a fine example of this. Without dialogue, the film proceeds to visualise its central theme: that life itself often detours our real ambitions. Certainly one of the most powerful moments from the montage is the juxtaposition between scenes, where Carl and Ellie are painting a baby's room together and yet in the next passage they are grieving in the doctor's room, suggesting that Ellie lost the baby and was unable to have children. This is a surprisingly emotional moment in the film, offering a level of poignancy rarely seen in animated pictures. Details such as this are significant in adding depth to Carl's persona and self-containment. In a lesser film he would have merely been a caricature of a crabby old man. Yet here he remains as someone who has suffered in life and is looking for the adventure he has always missed out on. In a script that is regularly funny, Up has a stronger sense of emotion and character development than most animated pictures, including Wall-E.<br/><br/>Though other animated films feel regularly derivative in their visual style and character design, Up benefits from a wonderful burst of colour. The balloons rising into the sky are particularly beautiful to behold on the big screen. This is a really splendid film to look at and it must be even more spectacular in 3D. Yet perhaps the most visually intriguing aspect of the film is also it's most subtle: the inside of Carl's ageing house is decorated with dusty old furniture and photographs on the wall. It is this very homely look that provides the film with a rather sweet metaphor of Carl's ongoing attachment to the memories of his wife. It is also reflective of Carl's conservatism, which in contrast to Russell's innocence and childish behaviour, provides the film with some very funny moments. Both Carl and Russell are voiced superbly and remain utterly believable. There are also some surprises from the characters that they meet along the way and thankfully, like Wall-E, the film refrains from using notable celebrity voices. Perhaps only the film's villain could be slightly too dark for much younger children though.<br/><br/>Up is a very sweet and fun adventure film for both adults and children. The attention to detail in the characterisation and the willingness for Pixar to explore much darker and more interesting elements of life deserves particular praise. Though much of the action of Up is fast, exciting and visually dynamic, it is the emotional core of the film that adults will relish most. This is an animated film that truly soars."

","This is a charming movie, agree with most of the other posted comments. As a former resident of Venezuela, it was also great to see the tepuis (flat-topped mountains) of the Gran Sabana to the south of the country represented in the movie. Paradise Falls, are of course Angel Falls, the tallest on earth, falling off Ayuntepui mountain, and Charles Muntz, the villain of the story, has his resonance in Professor Challenger of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous book ""The Lost World"". In the book published in 1912, Challenger also finds a rare animal, in this case a prehistoric flying reptile, on a journey to South America. He reports his discovery back in London but is ridiculed, and returns to capture the beast and bring it back to prove his skeptics wrong. Conan Doyle is widely believed to have taken the tepuis of Venezuela as his inspiration for the book, specifically the huge mountain of Roraima whose summit has exactly the same rain and wind shaped rock formations that appear in the movie."

When, The dogs are chasing Kevin, Russell and Carl, that scene was superb and Awesome. Even, the last scene was cool and superb. When, the house gets A storm attack, that scene was cool.

"kyle-cruse","8","0","0","17 July 2009"," After three lesser entries, well deserved
","Pixar has, in my opinion, delivered the finest computer animated films to date. However, Pixar's three entries before this film (""Cars,"" ""Ratatoille,"" and ""Wall-E"", though most people will disagree with me on the last one) were, I feel, lesser entries. The last three did not have the overall appeal value that the previous films (""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" etc) had. ""Up"" is a pleasant surprise in nearly every way. What a fantastic concept this film has, featuring a house floated away by a massive amount of small helium-filled balloons (I mean, who doesn't think it would be neat to have their house fly?) Of course, a great concept deserves an equally well-written plot and screenplay, and this film pulls off both of those. The film involves Carl, an old man trying to keep his late wife's dream alive by going to Paradise Falls to prove that their childhood hero, explorer Charles Muntz, was not lying when he said he had traveled there. Along the way, he picks up a young boy scout and a few animals to continue the journey together. This film features who is probably the all-time greatest movie dog character, Dug, a dog who says just what he thinks due to his automated voice collar. What a brilliant concept, rather than the overused one involving animals talking with moving lips. There's too much to share about this film in one review, but the most important thing to say is that I recommend it. It's visually stunning and full of laughs, excitement, and real emotion, with characters we learn to care about. If you're one of the few people who hasn't seen it yet, now's the time, while it's still in theaters.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"
"KUAlum26","8","0","0","2 July 2009"," A somber,wistful heart at the center of another buoyant PIXAR film
","Widower Carl Fredrickson(voice of Ed Asner)feels like his time left could best be spent fulfilling the dream that he and his wife shared:namely,to fly off and explore the wilds of South America. A balloon salesman for a good part of his adult life,he decides to use his inventory to lift and carry away the old home that he shared with her for the forty some years they were together. And why not? The house is surrounded by a massive re-urbanizing development and there's considerable pressure on him to sell his beloved home. Rather than do that,he's set on taking his dreams in tact with him to do the things that he lived a lifetime putting off.<br/><br/>The plans seem great. One hitch:a chubby,overly chatty World Explorer Scout named Russell,who is doggedly intent on helping Carl to finish his badge accumulation.<br/><br/>The rest of the story is the main motor of this latest offering by the revolutionary studio. A struggle to navigate to the mythic falls point of the region(they miss the target,landing on the far other side of the plateau),as they are joined by a mythic wild bird and a voice-collar speaking hunting dog,defending against the hunting wishes of a lost explorer(voice of Christopher Plummer),whose singular vision to chase HIS aspirations have turned him into something g far less noble than he once was or appeared.<br/><br/>This is a nice,sometimes inspired,sometimes funny,somewhat maudlin story that has nothing really wrong with it(save a suspension of disbelief over,among other things,the physics of a balloon-carried old-style home being carried,in tact,over thousands of miles). Director Pete Docter and co-writer,co-director Bob Petersen(who voices many of the dogs in the story,particularly Dug,the afore-mentioned dog that greets the intrepid travelers initially)supply a perfectly smart,engaging and entertaining film. I,personally,couldn't quite warm up to it as wholly as past PIXAR adventures(Toy Story,Buig's Life,Finding Nemo and WALL-E come to mind),but I still found this easily very entertaining and reasonably endearing(the dogs with talking collars particularly tickled me). Some rather depressing,adult themes and a longer-than-expected opening might test the patience of some,but this film largely is able to,like its title,stay buoyant throughout."

","After having a long time of not watching animation movies, I pretty much thought that my love for animation was over.<br/><br/>But then came Up and that love sparked back up.<br/><br/>In Pixar's tenth featured film, we start off with Carl Fredricksen as a child who adores Charles Muntz, a famous explorer. He is inspired by Muntz and wants to become an explorer like him one day. Then after walking through his town, he meets a girl, Ellie, that has the same passion for adventure in the wildlife as Carl does. They get married and go through a happy marriage for a long time. Now I do not know if this is a spoiler or not, but I am being safe by saying this may be a spoiler to some of you. Eventually, Carl's wife dies in the first ten minutes of the movie from old age. Carl is very depressed about his wife's passing because the two of them wanted to travel over to South America and plant a house on top of a mountain there for the two to live in. So one day, the day before Carl is about to be sent over to a retirement home, Carl ties thousands of balloons to his house which lifts him in the air, away from his town and towards South America. Everything is perfect for Carl, except he gets a knock on his door and finds out a boy scout, Russell, was on the porch at the time of the take off. Now Carl must deal with Russell and a series of other misadventures while in South America with a talking dog and a exotic bird.<br/><br/>Up really stood out to me as being one of Pixar's finest films ever made. For one thing, the story is very unique and original. Also, (if you really study this film) the movie talks about complex themes that is simplified for children to understand such as aging, struggles and feelings after the death of a loved one, and the eagerness to go out of your normal life. The cast for the voices were perfect; Edward Asner being Carl and Christopher Plummer being Muntz. And like every Pixar film, the sound editing was great and very detailed. <br/><br/>I have a rating system that I use to judge movies. 1 being the worse and 10 being the best. Then I have low, middle, and high within the 1-10 range. So an okay movie would receive a mid or low 6, but a really good movie like Up would get a mid or high 8 for me. And that is what I would give this film, a mid 8. If you thought this comment was useful, do not press ""yes"" but instead, use this as an impetus to watch Up and have a great time because that is what this movie does; gives you the 96 minutes to focus your mind away from your life and into this wonderful movie."

"n-mo","1","10","38","11 November 2013"," ... am I supposed to care?
","For the most part, Pixar films seem almost totally immune to criticism. I'm not really sure what it is, but Liam Colle might have given us a hint when he said of the studio's repertoire: ""These are not kids movies that parents can sit through. Pixar makes grown-up movies that parents don't feel guilty about letting their kids watch."" I think people think they're SUPPOSED to like them because of the ""cute"" factor, and I also think that the 3-D animation ties into this.<br/><br/>Because, let's face it: Disney animated classics such as ""Sleeping Beauty"" would not have worked so well or at all with live actors. Neither would Pixar's. But Disney of old (and I insist well on this point!) could get away with the flashy, fantastical, imaginative storyboards precisely because the animation was beautiful and fluid. Pixar's is flat, sterile and robotic. The elements all look plastic. This is just part of the limitation of 3-D rendering. Sure, this worked for Toy Story, because all the characters WERE plastic toys.<br/><br/>But stories about actual characters fall flat, because we simply can't relate to the characters. That leaves the cuteness and threadbare humor (if you are the sort who finds this stuff funny, and I am not) to sustain the film, and I have to opine that it is a really sad state of affairs when the adults of our society consider cuteness sufficient power for sustaining a dramatic narrative.<br/><br/>Now for ""Up"" itself. The beginning part is dreadfully depressing, and might work for a live-action art house film, but I can't imagine a child (again, this is NOT a kids' film, but it is marketed as such) sitting through it without crying. The second half of the movie leaves us with a grumpy old man and an incredibly annoying kid stuck in a tangle on an extraordinary adventure, trying to extricate themselves from a problem that the kid caused. There is no meaning, no feeling: just cuteness, if you aren't sufficiently annoyed by this point.<br/><br/>""Up"" really should have been two movies: one picturesque live-action film about the old man, with no extra-possible situations, and one plasticky CGI film about a random lonely old man and a kid. The latter would have been utterly ignorable but still would have garnered the praise of critics. And such a cleavage would have avoided the film we actually got, which was the latter with connotations of pretension toward the former, adding insult to injury.<br/><br/>Pixar... just go away, please?"
"bobj1","1","13","57","8 March 2010"," The Worst Animated Movie in a Long Time
","First I would like to say that I was never sad in this movie. I felt nothing for these characters. The old man was a grumpy and mean character. The little fat kid was annoying. I wanted to punt that kid whenever I saw him. The villain was boring and stupid. The animation is good . The main character was boring and not funny. Ill give it one thing: the plot line was mature, but is that good for a kids movie? Do you want kids to see a pack of snarling red-eyed dogs coming at them in 3D? I expected a good movie like Toy Story. Toy Story had good characters, a good villain, and a good plot line. This movie (I thought) was bad, with boring characters, an adult plot line and annoying at times."

The animals are the funniest part Alpha rocks. The soundtrack is nothing to remember. The graphics are good in 2D but the story and music could of been much better.

"dbborroughs","7","4","12","6 June 2009"," Some thoughts on why I think this is a near perfect film but one I like but didn't love
","The newest Pixar movie is infuriatingly near perfect. Don't get me wrong, its a good movie, but its one of those movies where if you can work out the perfect way the story should go- thats what you'll see. The opening montage of the life of Ed Asner's character with his wife is as damn near a perfect arc of a life as you'll likely to see...and the tears come exactly on cue. through much of the film when you see certain visual images or verbal references, you realize that you'll see them later on. Its a perfectly constructed film, possibly the most perfectly constructed film that Pixar's made, but at the same time it's the most artificial. Pete Docter has fashioned the most perfect of animated, nay, of any films from all of the best stuff in the world and he forgot one key thing, heart and emotion, real heart and deep emotion. Yes I was moved and yes I was carried along, but at the same time I didn't feel completely part of it. I didn't really feel the real emotion. I didn't feel the emotional connection of Wall-e and Eva, I didn't feel the joy of Peter O'Toole's food critic at the end of Ratatouille. the ""Claw is our Master"" in Toy Story is still better then ""look a squirrel"". I know I've complained about almost every Pixar feature, but even in the bitching there was real emotion and not manipulated emotion.<br/><br/>I'm annoyed, I wanted to cry at the end, I didn't.<br/><br/>It is one of the best of the Pixar movies, but I liked it I didn't love it.<br/><br/>(And yes while the casting of Christopher Plummer is choice, they shouldn't have made him look like Kirk Douglas unless they were going to use Douglas. I know Douglas has medical problems but, damn it would have been nice to hear him leaping into action.) (and perhaps the one real flaw...too many dogs)"
"megatom5","10","3","8","29 May 2009"," Amazing Pixar film
","I've been a pixar film since 10 years old ever since I first saw toy story and fell in love with those characters. Ever since then I've become a bigger and greater film fan and pixar I feel has kept up with that. With Incredibles they did one of the best superhero movies and with wall-e I felt they had made a sincerely great entry into the scifi genre. Up is an action/adventure movie on par with the early Indian jones movies, except for the exception that the main character is about as old as the latest Indian jones movie. This is honestly one of pixar's sadder films. I am tempted to say darker but the film is honestly a light hearted adventure once it get going. The first 20 minutes are sheer sadness though. Not since the Lion King have I felt such empathy for an animated character. From the first scenes you know that it's headed toward eventual tragedy, but this is where the story of Up picks up from. It begins with a tragedy then moves into an action adventure, unlike any film I've ever seen before. I love the characters I love the setting, I just genuinely love this movie. It's got a true blue heart but it's not afraid to make you laugh, cry, and feel the intensity that the characters feel. Additionally the Disney 3-d is amazing, this isn't the type of movie where I felt that they went out of there way to make it 3-d (i.e. Beowulf My Bloody Valentine) but the effect is quite riveting. On top of a fantastic film you get a 3-d preview of Toy Story 3, which honestly had me giddy with joy. Especially after seeing how great Up looked in it. I feel like Pixar keeps getting more ambitious with their films, Wall-e contained a blatant political message, while this film is significantly heavier than any animated film I've seen. It's about remorse and lost time, and is a reminder of why we should live our lives to fullest."

The characters are all immediately lovable and the stunning 3-D visuals are amazing! The opening scenes are beautiful and many people in my showing were crying at the touching beginning. The story is so original and the talking dogs are so cleverly done that it hardly seem far-fetched at all. Alpha, the lead dog was hilarious with his high pitched voice, and it was awesome how much the dogs still acted like dogs. Kevin the bird gave a great deal of laughs as did Russel the Wilderness Explorer.<br/><br/>This is pixars first attempt at making a movie with realistic humans as the main characters (Incredibles doesn't count since they were superheroes) and it is above and beyond successful. It is amazing how the studio can create a grumpy old man that the audience will easily connect with and find charming. Up deserves a 10 out of 10 and everyone of all ages should see this as soon as possible!"

But what can I say - they have set the bar so high that it is not a surprise when they fosbury flop right over it. The animation is 10/10 or maybe even an 11/10 in reverence to Spinal Tap. In short the animation is top notch.<br/><br/>Now, we move on to the story. The story, where do I start? It's got everything you'd expect for this type of film, a strong moral, triumph over tragedy, action, adventure, a flying house, talking dogs, an evil villain (is he evil, or just misunderstood?!)....... Maybe it's just me, but I thought the story was too confused, too jumbled, had too many things going on and just too, well, silly I guess. Yes, I know I said silly, what did I expect, Shakespeare? But, for me it crossed the line. All genres of films have a line of silliness (for want of a better phrase) they shouldn't cross. Of course, the line is in a very different place for an animated film compared to say a historical drama. But, nevertheless - there is still a line. And, in my mind Up crosses the silliness line for an animation.<br/><br/>There are elements in the film that are very good.

It can make you laugh and cry in the next second. I love all the characters and the story. It's like a movie that tells you too appreciate life and enjoy every second of it. I had moments in the movie when I was about to cry but I didn't, although I had tears in my eyes. I had many moments when I laughed really hard. And moments when I didn't know what would happen. You can see how much technology have developed because it sometimes looks like reality in the movie. I love all the colors and everything! <br/><br/>There are also two other small movies that's extra and they're really cute and funny. Love the extra film with the clouds, it's really good!<br/><br/>Well, everyone should see this movie UP if you want your mood to go up! ;)"
"ngeunit1","10","2","5","18 June 2010"," Just an Amazing Movie!
","This was overall just an excellent movie. There is nothing negative that I have to say about this movie so I will just jump into a few of the things that I really liked about it. First, Doug and Kevin where so charming. Well, to be frank the entire movie is amazing charming in its own way, but Doug and Kevin especially. The movements of the bird are just amazing, and the things that the dogs say and do are exactly what you would expect a dog to do, they captured it perfectly. They were quirky and funny and lovable all at the same time, something that the guys over at Pixar are really good at.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was a bit more dark than I was expecting it be, but it set up the rest of the story so well. I felt like this was an animated movie, but really had a lot of meaning to just about anyone who watched it. There were some really hard-hitting moments, most in the early part of the movie, that really got the viewer emotionally attached to the characters. And I think that is important for the movie to work.<br/><br/>The only negative is that some of the events that occurred once they landed were a bit predictable. But it was still a fun ride the whole way through. None of this movie felt like filler or boring for even a second from the opening to the credits. The whole adventure feeling of the movie was exciting and engaging. And the progression of Mr. Fredricksen throughout the movie was heart-warming and satisfying.<br/><br/>Overall, this is just an amazing movie, and unquestionably my favorite animated movie I have ever seen."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","2","5","17 May 2010"," In my personal opinion, this is Pixar's funniest and most poignant film
","I love Pixar and feel they have been pretty consistent. True I do prefer Toy Story over Cars and Finding Nemo over Ratatouille, but I find their films amazingly animated and thrilling. I thought that after the first two Toy Story films, that Pixar wouldn't be able to make a film to top them. WALL-E, yes I loved it, came pretty close, but in my opinion Up is Pixar's masterwork. And why do I say that? Because it is widely imaginative and astonishing in its emotional range.<br/><br/>First of all, the animation is stupendous, beautiful backgrounds, beautifully drawn characters and stunning colours. The scenery and sights are just fantastic, down to the colour and visual detail that went into the film. Michael Giacchino's music is stunning as well, simple yet melodious and sublime. And I do have to concur with the majority about the opening montage; Finding Nemo had some beautiful moments and WALL-E's haunting isolation moved me close to tears but this opening montage was so poignant and utterly heart-breaking. It is quite simply one of the most beautiful and effective beginnings ever to an animated film.<br/><br/>I have heard complaints that the story meanders when the talking dogs are introduced and that they were irritating. Can I respectfully disagree? What I loved about Up was how widely imaginative it was, in short why shouldn't a dog talk? It's an animated film, why does it have to COMPLETELY realistic? Elephants don't fly, look at what Disney did with Dumbo.The story, back on target was well written, thrilling and startling with a sense of adventure with enough action and high-flying escapism for kids and adults. The script had some truly hilarious and surreal moments, while Toy Story had wonderful sophisticated dialogue, the dialogue in Up made me laugh and it made me cry.<br/><br/>And finally the characters, I loved them all, grumpy old widower Carl, stowaway Russell, eccentric adventurer Charles Muntz, the big bird and the hilarious Doug. Russell may be a tad annoying at first, but he grows on you. The voice acting is exceptional- Carl is voiced with real demeanour and depth by Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer, the wonderful underrated actor he is, is superb as Charles Muntz. But I do have to give mention to Bob Peterson, he is simply brilliant as Doug, he is really funny when he needs to be and never overdoes it.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a wonderful film. There may be controversy over how Beauty and the Beast is no longer the only animated film to be nominated for best picture. Beauty and the Beast has been and always will be my favourite animated film and one of my favourite films of all time (The Lion King is a very close second), but Up is a great film and does deserve an award of some kind. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Neucosa","5","2","5","7 March 2010"," Pixar living off of their previous successes
","The first 15 minutes of the film are beautiful and perfect. The heart and soul of those minutes are completely in line with the excellence that Pixar has been able to produce through their many films. I would recommend anyone seeing those minutes as they are so appropo for any human film-goer to understand and enjoy.<br/><br/>Then there's the rest of the film. So lackluster. The characters are feeble. The story is nice and well-told, but relatively boring. If I had never seen other Pixar films, perhaps I would think this film would be an achievement, as opposed to something derivative and unimaginative. When reviewing that portion of the film, it's somewhat hard to remember individual instances that take place. This aspect is completely unlike other Pixar films, or for that matter, other animated films in recent years. The story is just not interesting. The characters are not interesting. The dialogue, the same. What in the story is compelling? Not much. There's no real story envelope of excitement. It's flat and somewhat dull, which for me, as a Pixar fan, is a great disappointment. <br/><br/>Watch the film, but treat it fairly."
"ailtorres","3","2","5","8 February 2010"," When will Pixar make great art?
","Wow! The programmers at Pixar should be proud that they have fully mastered the creation of hair, clouds and realistic facial expressions. Up is a fine movie. It makes you laugh and cry. Wait. Why is there a cute dog with a collar that can make him talk? Where did that bird come from? Why is she so naturally friendly to humans? Why, all of a sudden, does he do tricks and look cute? Oh, I forgot. This movie, like all other Pixar movies, is for kids.<br/><br/>Come on, Pixar, the Toy Story generation is all grown up. We know you have finally mastered making realistic looking computer animation. Looks great! Now, challenge yourselves to make something with some depth and complexity. Try making ""Maus"" into a movie. Or even something like ""Sin City."" Imagine that. Or are you afraid it won't make money. I know you make double or triple the money off your movies because kids bug their parents and adults have to pay full price! Plus, the kids want all the toys and they are not satisfied until they buy the DVD or Blu-Ray and watch it again and again.<br/><br/>As far as Up is concerned, it is what I call ""generically"" good. It has a smooth beginning, middle and end. However, this is not the most realistic Disney movie (we are referring to Cars here...a movie about TALKING CARS!). Why is that old adventurer so nuts...just because they didn't believe he stumbled upon an amazing creature? If they hadn't of briefly mentioned that crazy guy in the opening of the movie, the third act would have made absolutely NO sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>So, challenge us, Pixar. We can take it. Making movies for kids is great but when will you finally cross over to great art?"
"jhunt709","10","2","5","28 October 2009"," With their run of success maintained by their latest feature, Pixar is one balloon that definitely hasn't burst.
","How can you tell a feature length story about a man who tows his house around for the duration of the film? Furthermore, how can you have said feature length story's central character be an elderly male who may not be youthful enough to appeal to children, and who also may not be marketable enough to sustain a production line of tie-in merchandise? The answer; ask Pixar.<br/><br/>Early promotional material from plot summaries to teaser trailers did not interest me in Up as much as the studio's previous endeavours; I personally prefer animated films about inanimate objects or animals as opposed to human beings (an example being The Incredibles; highly enjoyable and well-made but my least favourite Pixar film simply for the fact that there were no talking toys, monsters, bugs, fish or cars). Having not seen Up in cinemas early following its release, I finally made my way to a viewing, glad to be extremely surprised by what the film had in store for for a Pixar fan wondering if this was possibly going to be their first release which did not garner my full enthusiasm. Taking off my 3D glasses following the film, I could have hung my head in shame.<br/><br/>When Carl Fredricksen, an elderly man living alone in the house where he grew up with his deceased wife, is threatened with being placed in a retirement home, he escapes by attaching a myriad of colourful helium balloons to his fireplace. Floating away from the city, he discovers Russell, a young wilderness explorer, has become an inadvertent stowaway on his front porch. Following a dangerous storm they land in South America and become caught up in a hunter's search for an elusive wild bird. Though the characters may not immediately strike you as likable, they soon gain your appreciation and before long you're backing them as they take on the enemy and his pack of hunting dogs (who communicate in the most novel, entertaining and laugh-out-loud manner you may have ever seen in a film about talking dogs).<br/><br/>The outstanding technical achievements of the film aside, Up is a complete marvel in terms of storytelling. Whether it be within the script or shown with equal clarity in a visual manner, the journey of Carl Fredricksen as he sets out to fulfill the wishes of his dead wife is conveyed as hilarious and heartfelt in equal measure. That audiences are shedding tears at the BEGINNING of the film is a testimony to the sheer depth of character development, achieved not through complex dialogue but by means of a montage of images detailing the protagonist's life with his partner. Such emotion resonates throughout the entire film; Pixar have not grown complacent despite their success and must be applauded for continuing to take daring risks not only with their productions themselves, but also with the conflict and trials that their characters face within them. At times I found myself wondering if Pixar were really going to let certain events play out with such potentially devastating outcomes.<br/><br/>By far my favourite artistic aspect of the film was the house; tethered to Carl and Russel as they trek towards their destination, it illustrates how Pixar see a potential roadblock and overcome it with such creative ease. Not once does the floating house become a burden to the film throughout its entire runtime; not once was I concerned that it was becoming tedious. This, coupled with the home signifying a great deal of Carl's life-long relationship, ensures that what could have been a weight on Pixar's shoulders is something carried through the events of the movie well and with relevance.<br/><br/>Pixar clearly understand the elements that make a film a classic. Toy Story is arguably their only film to date to have achieved classic status (and it's about time, nearly fifteen years after its release), however in my opinion the majority of the Pixar canon is only waiting for time to be able to honour its legacy. Up rightfully earns its place in this majority.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Drazzan","10","2","5","18 October 2009"," Emotionally Breathtaking Adventure in 3D
","Ever since I had my mind completely blown away after seeing ""Toy Story"" for the first time as a kid, Pixar has never let me down. ""Up"" is no exception.<br/><br/>However ""Up"" is something more different than it's predecessors. Right after a emotionally tear-dripping 15min long introduction, you'll notice that Pixar has shifted to a different gear regarding their storytelling. Following the non-dialogue approach from ""Wall-E"", ""Up"" is all about emotions. – This is not to say that ""Up"" lacks dialogues (Russell will keep you more than occupied on that front) ""Up"" is simply more focused on to give rise to multitudes of emotions throughout the story, many of them sub-consciously and again without the need of any unnecessary dialogue. It leaves the emotions completely to the audience.<br/><br/>As for my experience of seeing ""Up"" in 3D for the first time, Pixar blew my mind again after all these years. Seeing the incredible depths of ravines, feeling the wide panorama of Paradise Falls tropical landscape and nearly ducking for Carl's house flying past only inches over your head is a experience that kept my heart-rate way over average pulse. (I must confess that I actually tried to touch Dug's tufty fur for a moment. Good thing that it's really dark at the cinema so that your neighbour won't give you a strange look as you're fumbling with your hands in thin air).<br/><br/>Even though the 3D-glasses diminishes the colorfulness of movie only slightly, this didn't stop me at all from grasping for air when experiencing clear-blue sky, lively green vegetation and characters sparkling with colors, especially Kevin.<br/><br/>""Up"" is definitely my new favourite Pixar-movie as the story certainly has ""grown up"" since ""Toy Story""'s often screaming and attention-seeking dialogues and humour.<br/><br/>... So, should you pay a extra buck to wear a pair of 3D-glasses when watching ""Up"" at the cinema? –Hell, even I (who's wearing glasses normally) put on the 3D-glasses atop of my regular glasses with a big smile on my face."
"Donatien3","10","2","5","29 September 2009"," Brilliant!
","After last year's 'Wall-E', which was brilliant despite virtually being a silent film, Pixar have outdone themselves with 'UP' (which, like 'Wall-E' was released in time for the school holidays).<br/><br/>The story is fairly simple. Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) is a old man mourning the loss of his wife, Ellie. After an accident sees him about to be shipped off to the dreaded retirement village, he ties a number of balloons to his chimney and uses his house to fly to Paradise Falls, a place Ellie dreamed of going. Coming along for the ride is young Asian-American boy Russell, an over-eager and slightly annoying Wilderness Society Scout desperate to get his last ""assisting the elderly"" badge. From there the pair's journey is sidetracked by a rare bird named Kevin, an adorable dog named Dug (one of an army who can talk through a special collar) and Carl's childhood hero Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer), who will stop at nothing to capture Kevin for his collection.<br/><br/>As a story, 'UP' is fairly conventional; all the main characters overcome obstacles to reach their goals and experience events which change their life forever. Like most Pixar films, the real appeal is in the details and characterisation. The history of Carl and Ellie is outlined in a touching montage at the start of the movie which establishes Carl's motivations without hitting you over the head or cynically stringing out the emotional power. The characterisation of Russell is also well fleshed out; at first he seems like an annoying little nerd, but as the movie progresses, we see he's just a lonely little boy desperate for his father's approval, much like Carl is desperate to keep his memories of Ellie alive with his trip to Paradise Falls. For me, the standout character is Dug. Not only is he absolutely adorable, if a bit dim, but the talking doesn't detract from this. The dogs talk like you assume dogs would actually talk (they get excited at the sight of tennis balls or when they hear the word ""treat"" and get distracted by a passing squirrel). Along with Kevin, the dogs provide the majority of laughs.<br/><br/>There's also plenty of action, especially when Carl and Russell try to escape the clutches of Muntz. These action scenes, though, are probably a bit scary for really little kids.<br/><br/>Overall, UP is a brilliant film. While it was released in time for the school holidays, it is more than just another silly kids film. The plot, while conventional, isn't boring and there's plenty of humour, action and some touching moments. More importantly, UP has appeal across all ages and has something for everyone."
"gili-2","5","2","5","27 August 2009"," Why is it?
","That every protagonist in a Disney/Pixar movie must have superhero capabilities? Why would a man who lived with this charming woman his entire life and sells balloons in a zoo, would be grumpy and dislike children? Had the characters been more reliable, and the action scenes more realistic, the film could indeed be lovely. All the noise, fight choreography and barking drowned the potential of this film. For example, when the old man catches the house by lassoing the fire hose. I know that my aged mother would not succeed in such a drill in the first attempt. Instead of showing 10 such scenes, one fit that coincides with his capability as a balloonist would be much more adequate."
"Monotreme02","9","2","5","21 August 2009"," Another masterpiece from Pixar
","Looking back, I can't help but to immediately notice a very interesting pattern in my past movie reviews. This is the third Pixar movie I have written a review for, and this will also be the third consecutive time that I will open the review with the following sentence: Pixar have done it again. Once again, they have proved that no animation studio – and no live action studio either, for that matter – can come anywhere near the sheer and utter quality of their entertainment, purely and simply put. Pixar have proved once again that they can take a concept and premise that doesn't sound particularly attractive at first, and turn it into a masterwork of cinema. They have proved that unlike their animation studio contemporaries, Pixar don't need celebrity voices and characters specifically designed to be packaged and ready for delivery to toy store shelves, and they certainly don't feel the need to patronize their young audience members by injecting into their films jokes that only parents can understand. And they have proved once again that unlike most live-action studio output, it is still possible to create compelling, dramatic and irresistibly entertaining cinema from original screenplays without falling into formulas, clichés or any other kind of compromise for the sake of the audience. In short, Pixar have once again proved that they are the best film studio working today, period.<br/><br/>So what makes a Pixar movie tick? What makes this studio's output so consistently better than that of pretty much all the other film studios today, animated or otherwise? I think the answer can be summed up in one simple but crucial word: characters. For Pixar, as for all the great screenwriters both past and present, a film begins and ends with its characters; create compelling and identifiable characters and you can pretty safely bet that an equally compelling story will come along with them. Within the first ten minutes of this film, you know you're in for something different as you see Doctor portray in a completely dialogue-less montage an entire life-long relationship, from the shy childhood beginnings of our protagonist Carl and his soon-to-be-wife Ellie and through their ups and downs, hardships living a complete life together, and finally her eventual death, all the while their childhood dream hovering above them but never quite coming to fruition. It is a heartbreakingly beautiful and poignant sequence, probably the best ten-minute block Pixar have ever created, and while the film does take a slightly different direction from there, it doesn't cease from still bringing up very poignant topics throughout, including hardships of old age, unhealthy obsession, divorce, a child's rejection by his father, and other such resonant, real-life experiences that one wouldn't expect to see in a children's film. Here within lies Pixar's secret, which is additionally exemplified in the story and the humor in their films as well: they don't patronize their young audience members by providing two planes of existence in the film – jokes and plot points for the kids and another set for the adults – but rather, Pixar manage to find the subjects, plot points, visual gags and jokes that both children AND their parents can relate to. For example, I'm nowhere near being a parent yet, but I can imagine this film serving as a very good starting-off point for important parent-child discussions, such as divorce, deteriorating old age of grandparents, and where babies come from.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that there is simply no studio quite like Pixar. Only they could represent more genuine human emotion and feelings in a silent, 6-minute short film than any major Hollywood production of the past 10 years (the short preceding the film, ""Partly Cloudy"", is one of Pixar's all-time best in my opinion, in terms of hilarity but also in terms of poignant emotional resonance). Only they could take a premise of a man tying helium balloons to his house and flying it to South America and turn it into one of the most dramatic, compelling and irresistibly entertaining films of the past few years. Only they could take a film whose protagonists are a grumpy, sour 80-year-old widower and a chubby, 8-year-old obnoxious Asian child and turn it into one of the most massive box office successes of the year. And for that, they deserve all the praise in the world, and them some."
"DICK STEEL","10","2","5","7 August 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Up
","Much has been said about the opening montage, and I fully agree that it's an extremely touching sequence in itself, bringing out and establishing the lonely character of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), a man living out his twilight years, finally deciding to take the plunge and fulfill a lifelong dream and a promise made. If the first few minutes doesn't make you cry, then you must have a heart of stone, or never loved before.<br/><br/>What transpires in the film is more or less captured in the trailers already, with Fredricksen lifting up his home with thousands of helium filled balloons, off for his adventure of a lifetime, only to find a stowaway, little wilderness explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai) scared stiff on his front porch. While the boy offers to become Carl's sidekick for that final badge of honour to be promoted to senior explorer, little did he know that he too is up for a crazy adventure in South America, joined by a talking dog Dug (Bob Peterson) and an endangered bird, to Carl's dismay as they detract him from his mission.<br/><br/>While seemingly implausible in many ways (for instance having the flimsy contraption the size of a house with perishable balloons survive a mean thunderstorm), in order for the narrative and plot elements to work, you have to accept what's going on with a pinch of salt. Pixar has so far never disappointed me with its films, and Up continues the company's successful box office juggernaut by reminding everyone that it's all about the story first, the strong characters next, and animation just going about getting the job done.<br/><br/>It's a moving tale about loss and the prospect of letting go. Essentially it's a Carl Fredericksen story, where through the interaction with his new found friends, as opposed to fiends such as contractors and developers eyeing his property, discover new meaning to life, and a second chance for that sense of adventure that's been buried by life's unfortunate ups and downs. While a chapter has been closed in his earlier life of companionship, herein lies another opportunity to live out a new adventure, no point sitting around and mope in self pity. It's quite uplifting in that it's full of hope, yet dishes out enough nostalgic reminiscence that makes you all warm and fuzzy inside.<br/><br/>There were two moments that I particularly enjoyed, outside of the opening montage. The first was that parallel with The Fountain, where one is tasked to complete a beautiful experience by making new ones, on one hand never to forget, but on the other never to make a crutch of an excuse out of it, and to move on. The second was how life as depicted unfolds itself in phases, where the unexpected can crop up and derail even the best of intentions and plans. But so long as you have someone to share the spoils with, good and bad, then perhaps everything else is tolerable.<br/><br/>If there's a complaint about the quality of the 3D here, then I must say that amongst all the 3D live action and animated ones shown here to date, Up is unfortunately most disappointing of the lot because there wasn't much sequences that maxed out its 3-dimensional ability. You might just be better off with the 2D version, to save some cash for films that are truly designed to envelope your senses, rather than just to provide some depth of field.<br/><br/>Up is utterly moving, a romance story if you'd like in its inner core, filled with plenty of lovely moments that never lose you, and punctuated with adequate and well timed comedic. The short film that preceded Up, called Partly Cloudy, also served as a great appetizer to the feature, and reinforces the notion that a simple tale about a stork and a cloud that addresses the perennial children's question on where do babies come from, and without dialogue at that, can still move you if told in a way that's sincere and full of heart."
"wealthintelligence503","10","2","5","29 June 2009"," Poetry in Film
","I really loved this movie and was surprised by how deeply it touched me. It may be a comedy, but underneath, it's quite an emotional film about the loves that define one's life and how to move on and live after losing people that matter.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the story of two children in the 1930s who share youthful adventures and grow up to become husband and wife and share a life together. They hold on to the dream they had as children to fly away to South America in search of Paradise Falls, and set up a change jar to save for their trip. As time and normal trials challenge them, though - infertility, illnesses, home repairs - their dream eludes them until they are old. After a rich life together, they are finally ready to go on their trip - but the wife dies of old age, leaving our main character, Mr. Friedrickson, alone and crotchety, regretting the adventure he was never able to give his wife. The rest of the movie shows his attempt to make good on a childhood promise he made, and his movement from regret and memories back into an adventure of his own - life - and new people (and pets) to care for.<br/><br/>The film's creators expressed both the fragility of life and the unbreakable bonds of human love with simplicity and power - making us laugh all the while. A beautiful film."

","I originally did not plan to see ""Up"" fearing that it would not be any good. Then again, Pixar has done well the last two years with ""Ratatouille"" and ""Walle"". For the heck with it, along with some friends, I went to see it last night. The theater was packed, specifically with parents and their little ones. From start to finish, there was hardly any noise in the theater, except for the constant laughter. What I'm saying is, is that ""Up"" delivers.<br/><br/>What's nice about ""Up"" is that it is not only great for kids, but also for adults. I've been noticing lately that Pixar has been incorporating mature themes in their films. Without giving too much away about the plot, ""Up"" deals with things that every person encounters, the loss of a loved one, and the sense of helplessness it brings. Heavy subject matter, but it doesn't make the film too mature nor does it make it syrupy. <br/><br/>The message the film delivers, the ability to go fulfill a childhood dream and go on an adventure, if even you think you've outgrown it is brilliant. Watching this movie made me feel like a little kid again. Well done. <br/><br/>The voice talent is wonderful. I did not recognize many of the cast members' voices, which I think is a good thing, because a big celebrity like Eddie Murphy or Mike Myers can divert from the intended story. The animation isn't corny nor is it over the top like in ""Happy Feet."" Michael Giacchino's score adds a whole new level to the film. It helps propel the story. When the movie hits a sad moment, the music makes you want to cry. When it hits a suspenseful moment, it makes you want to grab onto the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Rarely do I give a perfect, but ""Up"" deserves one from me. Two Thumbs Way Up for Up! It makes you feel sad. Makes you feel exhilarated. Makes the time fly by. It makes you laugha lot. <br/><br/>My rating: **** out of ****"
"IanIJM","10","2","5","20 June 2009"," One of My Favorite Films of All Time!
","Okay so listen ... I went into this film with lower expectations than I do most Pixar films. I had heard the rumblings of reviewers that it was a fantastic film, but speaking honestly the previews did nothing for me. I couldn't figure out who I was supposed to root for! The kid looked annoying, the old man looked like a grump, and for some bizarre reason his house was floating on a bunch of balloons! On top of that, I thought Wall-E just totally SUCKED and, while I thought Ratatouille was a little bit better than that, I didn't really like that one much either. So to me, Pixar was on a slide and the previews for Up did nothing to disabuse me of the notion that the slide was continuing.<br/><br/>Wow, was I wrong! Pixar has produced an absolute MASTERPIECE of an animated feature. Up has not only become my favorite Pixar film, but also one of my favorite films of any genre, animated or live action.<br/><br/>Anyone who can walk out of that theater and claim not to have been touched by Carl and Ellie's story is either lying or dead inside. And for me, a guy who's about to turn 40, the underlying theme of life being what happens while you're busy doing other things just resonated with me tremendously. I could all-too-easily envision myself as Carl one day and it touched me deeply.<br/><br/>Prior to this film, I could count on one hand the number of films that had made me cry ... and all of them were typical ""guy cries"" ... Field of Dreams, Brian's Song, Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Well after Up, I've had to engage a 2nd hand. Not only did I cry, but I cried multiple times! Pixar does an AMAZING job of making you truly care about Carl. How they can inspire those emotions in people with nothing more than a bunch of dots moving on a screen I have no clue, but they do it and they do it in spades.<br/><br/>Run ... don't walk ... to see this film. See it two, three, or four times. But do yourself a favor ... skip the 3D. It takes away from the true beauty of this film, which is not the visuals, but the story."
"jpriest75","8","2","5","18 June 2009"," A Bone To Pick With Pixar
","I went to see Up last month on the weekend of it's release, and I must say, I was a bit disappointed. While the film did possess a group of quirky, lovable, and original characters, as is typical of Pixar, the film lacked in other areas. Seeing as how Pixar films are my favorite animated films, I cannot let this travesty go unnoticed.<br/><br/>The film starts with a young boy watching a documentary in a movie theater about an explorer named Charles Muntz. The boy idealizes this man, but his methods are frowned upon by fellow explorers due to his lack of follow-through; he is never able to bring back specimens of rare creatures that he supposedly finds on his expeditions. Muntz vows to travel to South America and not return until he has captured a beast.<br/><br/>The boy, named Carl, goes home and meets a girl named Ellie with wild red hair and an adventurous attitude. The two become close friends, grow up together, and get married. A montage reveals the long, fruitful life they shared, ending with Ellie's death. Carl, deeply crushed by this, swears to fulfill Ellie's dream of traveling to faraway lands. So, when a construction crew threatens to send the now-elderly Carl to an assisted living home, he ties hundreds of balloons to the roof of his house and succeeds in lifting off and sailing away to the clouds. Little does Carl know, a wilderness explorer named Russell has stowed away underneath the porch and hung on for the ride.<br/><br/>People who are used to the happy Pixar films of the past will be a bit set off by Up. The first third of the film is more dark than anything else, but luckily it is followed up by a happy ending.<br/><br/>The aspect of the film that ruined it for me was the talking dogs. Now, before anyone reading this automatically shuns it, please hear me out. While Doug was extremely funny and possibly the greatest part of the movie (aside from Kevin), the army of talking hounds came across as a bit corny, especially the incredibly annoying chipmunk voice.<br/><br/>Another part of Up that bugged me was the agility of the old men. For Christ's sake, these eighty-some year old guys were climbing up the side of blimps and flying houses, running through jungles and on top of mountains, and SWORDFIGHTING! (That part really got me). For a Pixar film, Up was very lenient in terms of physical believability. And to people who will argue, ""It's a kid's movie, relax,"" or, ""It's an animated movie, relax, you wouldn't ignore it if The Dark Knight, an eighty year-old man came and saved the day by coming in and smacking the Joker with a steel walker. Of course they wouldn't. All other Pixar films, even though almost every one has either fantasy of sci-fi elements, has kept in close respects to basic physics.<br/><br/>I have taken the time to write everything that I didn't like about Up, but it was not a terrible movie. It still has very funny dialogue and an intriguing visual style that make the film an enjoyable one to experience. Although it is definitely not Pixar's bets, as some comments suggest, it is entertaining and fun. If you are a fan of Pixar films or animated films in general, I recommend Up. You will most likely enjoy it more than I did.<br/><br/>My rating: 5.9/10.0"
"houstonsrb","10","2","5","6 June 2009"," Excellent!!
","Took my 7 year old daughter to see Up(3D) this afternoon. What can I say: visually-excellent; stylistically-excellent; story line-simple but beautifully done; score-wonderful; characters-superb/interesting ... as the story unfolds I felt a full range of emotions (some, I felt deeply -and I'm a 42 year old man's man). Actually, I could relate to this story on so many levels (e.g. experiencing great loss; deferred dreams; deep regrets; the struggle between holding onto the past versus moving forward in life; spirit of adventure and letting go of self imposed obstacles to finally reach for my dreams; something that at first seems an imposition but turns out to be of great value; and much more) . Who could ask for more in an animated film. ""Up"" is a must see - one of the best animated films ever in my opinion. My daughter loved it too :) We give it a 10."
"Qanqor","9","2","5","6 June 2009"," Beautiful
","Surprise! The curmudgeon is in the mainstream for a change: I loved this film. Much more than I expected to. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about it, everybody else has already done that. A fun adventure, some good comedy, and a surprising amount of heart. Never in a million years did I expect to be as moved by an animated fun movie like this as I was. Yes, there were a few nits I could pick on, mostly involving the villain, but they are easily overlooked given all that I liked about the movie.<br/><br/>The problem with writing review for films I love (which I don't do very often) is that I never want to say too much, lest I give anything away. Better to just go see it yourself. But be warned: it's not all sunshine and light, there's some definite sadness in there as well.<br/><br/>Out of curiosity, I read some of the ""Hated It"" reviews to see what people there would have to say. Very interesting. The main complaint seemed to be from parents who found it too heavy for their kids. Perhaps that's a valid complaint, I don't know, I'm not a parent. But it raises the interesting thesis that perhaps I, as an adult, responded to the movie so strongly precisely because it is a more adult film than your typical children's-fare animated movie. But I don't think that's a bad thing at all."
"bearfaceproductions","10","2","5","6 June 2009"," Up really takes Pixar Up
","I thought Pixar had lost me since the movie Cars. I saw Wall-e and I didn't like it. I thought that Pixar had gone down and will never redeem themselves. But I was wrong. Up is such success and pure Disney Pixar Magic. The adventures of these characters is so original and so well made out. The plot and sequences really amazed me. This masterpiece will go into the Pixar legends. A great story for boy and girls young and old. Up is an Oscar worthy film. On the other hand, this movie has some intense things for small viewers and deserves the PG rating. Even though this movie may be rated PG, is a good film that I recommend for anyone who wants to see a really well made animated film.<br/><br/>Good Job Pixar. You really surprised me once more."
"ennieday09","10","2","5","3 June 2009"," A heart-warming story with adventure, laughs and everything a great movie should be
","I saw this today with my friends and i wanted to watch Sam Raimi's Drag Me To Hell instead but my friends talked me into seeing this, and boy was i glad they did. Pixar has delivered some timeless classics like Toy Story, Monsters Inc. Finding Nemo, and the most recent Wall-E but this one has to be by far my favorite. Walking into the theater i was expecting a typical kids movie with a couple of laughs, crazy scenarios and funny characters but i got much MUCH more than that. The short film Party-cloudy couldn't have been a more appropriate warm up of what was to come in this movie because that short film had me tearing a little. <br/><br/>The first 5 minutes of this story gave me such a nostalgic feeling of when i saw Bambi as a kid couldn't help but cry. The start of the movie had me moved with having Carl and his friend Ellie venture into the start of their lives and the close and unconditional love they shared for each-other. An amazing and almost too perfect couple put in a Disney film you think they could never have such a tragic event happen to this couple. But sadly, the animators of Pixar leave you bawling with this tear-jerker. The simple things about this intro really got to me like how they showed when they were kids and Ellie flew a balloon with a paper attached to it into Carl's room and Carl did the same thing to her when she was in the hospital. After his wife died, your heart sinks and you think to yourself how can i watch the rest of this movie after witnessing such a depressing moment? The scene afterwards with the bulldozers almost crushing his mailbox with their handprints on it and then wacking the guy in the head was almost hard to watch. <br/><br/>But of course Pixar pulls it off again and takes the audience on a surreal adventure with great witticisms and characters. Russell's character was well portrayed and brought a lot of comedy and a great companion to Mr. Fredrickson. The dog 'Dug' brought a lot of great humor to the film and lines that had me laughing out of my chair at times. And the character of Charles Muntz, Carl's once childhood hero and now enemy was a great addition to the plot. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie defines what real family movie is. It is literally for any age out there and you will enjoy it no matter where, when or who you are watching it with. A movie like Up will be frozen in the Pixar vault for a long time and other movies to come will have to be greatly designed to beat this classic. 10/10 easily"
"rjyelverton","10","2","5","31 May 2009"," ""Up"" is beautiful
","I have now seen ""Up"" twice in three days. On Friday night, per my usual movie-going routine, and today with both kids and wife in tow. I wanted to share this film with them and laugh and cry and delight with them. This movie is that good and people are soon gonna be spreading the gospel of ""Up"" bringing friends, family, neighbors to share this film with them. ""Up"" is a movie about things, big things, scary things, but it also features talking dogs so your whole family will be entertained. It's a blockbuster that respects the intelligence of the audience and continues to display Pixar's masterful storytelling economy. Watch any given Pixar film a few times and you'll be amazed at how almost each line of dialogue or dialogue-free image moves the story forward, works as foreshadowing, and underlines the film's themes.<br/><br/>""Up"" is also beautiful. And painful. And exuberant. In its first fifteen minutes we experience most of the life of Carl Frederickson, husband of Ellie, balloon salesman, and dreamer. We see him go from quiet child to crotchety coot in a very short span and the speed with which his life passes is painfully swift. Carl and Ellie make grand plans, but life keeps getting in the way. Soon we are experiencing life alongside senior citizen Carl who decides to fulfill a childhood promise to his sweetheart Ellie and undertake a safari to South America.<br/><br/>Carl turns his home into a sky vessel in a beautiful scene that will have you grinning from ear to ear. As he sets off on his trip, he discovers stowaway Cub Scout Russell, an earnest young man with, like so many Pixar heroes before him, a generous spirit. Their journey very quickly, in what will be a surprise to no one, gets complicated and dangerous.<br/><br/>The film reaches a heartbreaking emotional crescendo in its first act making the standard adventure elements of the second and third seem almost prosaic in comparison. This bothered me less on the second viewing when I was more tuned into the film's comedy, inventiveness, and consistent beauty. I was also able to observe the care with which each image is constructed. The placement of characters and objects on the screen always serves a thematic purpose and decoding these was a real pleasure. There's metaphors aplenty in this tale and unpacking all of them is instructive. I also took the chance to enjoy the craftsmanship, voice-acting, animation, and score. The score, by Michael Giacchino (of ""The Incredibles,"" Star Trek,"" and ""Medal of Honor"" game series) is exquisite and will surely prove to be one of the year's best. (I'm listening to it once again as I write this.) ""Up"" is a grand achievement that grapples with loss, love, and the utter necessity of connecting and giving one's self to others. It's a brave movie that will make you laugh and cry and not feel bad about it in the morning. Go see this one soon and take someone you love."
"judywalker2","7","2","5","31 May 2009"," Sometimes I think Pixar is more for adults than kids
","I saw Up today and I've been waiting for it to come out. But sadly I thought I would enjoy it more than I really did. It started out great. I agree with most of the critics that the montage showing the two lovers growing together and the loss of the wife was really something akin to the ""When she loved me"" scene in Toy Story 2. And the end of the movie was very touching but in between it was predictable and I have to say very boring. <br/><br/>Needless to say the animation was, well PIXAR, can't say anything bad about it. The colors were brilliant and the characters lifelike as usual. But the last two movies made by PIXAR were more for adults than kids. My grandson was bored with this movie and WALL-E especially after all of the popcorn was gone."
"zetes","10","2","5","31 May 2009"," Ah, Pixar. What I wait for all year long.
","And they don't disappoint at all with this outing. It's probably not their best work. That's Wall-E. It's not as tightly plotted as other Pixar flicks, and the villain, in particular, could have used more work. But so what? Really, I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since, well, Wall-E. The prologue of this film, especially its second sequence, a completely silent (except for score) exploration of a long, beautiful marriage that gives us a novel's worth of information in a mere 8 minutes, is so remarkable that I could not hold back tears. In a way, that's a minor flaw as well. The film never quite tops those first 10 or 15 minutes. But the remaining 70 or 80 minutes are a ton of fun, and touching in their own way. Pixar shows Disney that cute animal sidekicks can be completely charming and hilarious. Dug the dog who talks with his special collar is constantly hilarious, as is the goofy bird, nicknamed Kevin. Like I said already, the villain is weak and could have been more thoroughly characterized. But it's not too bad - that's made up for with his more villainous talking dogs. Villainous they certainly are, but the way they talk, still thinking like dogs, is always worth some big laughs. And there's also a cute kid who is in no way annoying. Pixar proves once again that it has more imagination, wit and charm than anyone else working in the medium today. And that medium is not animated features, but cinema itself."
"griffolyon12","10","2","5","31 May 2009"," Get Ready for Adventure!
","Up is another piece of true artistry from Pixar. It's the story of an old man named Carl, who has become a grumpy old man after the death of his wife. When he is threatened with the possibility of being put into a retirement home, Carl attaches hundreds of balloons to his house and the house takes flight into the sky. Carl begins to steer the house towards his and his wife's childhood dream, Paradise Falls in South America, where he plans to live out the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Up truly is an excellent piece of film-making; it resonates more so than just about any other film in the Pixar catalogue. Here director Pete Docter has tailored a film that will both make the audience laugh, and cry. Though the film finds its strength in its themes. With this film Pixar has dared to deal with some very heavy themes, such as growing old and one's childhood heroes not always being what we want them to be. The themes are expertly handled by Docter, never feeling heavy-handed, but it is Docter's amazing ability to let the emotion of a scene to play out is what makes this film a true stand out above many other recent animated films. Now this should not fool one into thinking that Up is not a great film for the children as well, because it is.<br/><br/>Up is first and foremost an amazing adventure film. It's action packed, filled to the brim with pulse pounding action sequence after another. Another one of Up's strong suits is its comedy. It is quite possibly the funniest film Pixar has ever made, a large part to due with the wonderful cast of characters within this film. You grow to love Carl Frederickson and the rag-tag crew that follows him. Of course what makes Up a film for the ages is its sheer imagination. No other film in recent memory has sweeped me away into its world quite as well as Up has. The film's world is unique, endlessly filled with original idea after original idea. Who would have ever thought of a house flying through the air, or making a 78 year old man the hero of an adventure story? The guys at Pixar did and it paid off big-time.<br/><br/>Once it is all said and done Up is one of the finer films of the year, and definitely stands amongst Pixar's best (but is there really a worst). While it is sold as a children's film, many adults may find themselves enjoying this film more than their kids, thanks to its often serious subject matter. Though children will love the films flat-out hilarity and its high octane adventure. Up is a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>I give Up a perfect 10 out of 10!"
"cheryllynecox-1","10","2","5","31 May 2009"," Squirrel!
","Dazzling sequences that capture both wit and imagination are perfectly realized by Pixar. Surrendering to ""Up"" and its conceits was like participating in a dream or hallucination, I believed almost everything I saw, and responded with enormous belly laughs, sighs, sobs, and gasps.<br/><br/>I was especially captivated by the dignity and fully realized characterization of the anti-hero and the relationship he develops with a would-be stowaway. The Kevin bird's antics are hilarious, and Dug, the dog's stylized lines delivered with a Rainman cadence were perfect. It won't surprise many people when the exclamation of ""squirrel!"" becomes a part of our daily lexicon.<br/><br/>Now that I own a pair of 3D glasses, I anticipate seeing it again with other loved ones."

","My wife and I didn't know if we were going to see this Pixar/Disney film because it just didn't look all that interesting to me in the movie trailer... I was wrong! The movie is darker than any other Pixar movie and it has a more adult theme... keep that in mind if you are planning on bringing your children! The villain is VERY bad and the way they ended his character in the movie was not appropriate for children under 10! In fact, my wife and I were wondering why they didn't portray his character having an epiphany and turning back to good.<br/><br/>All in all a very good movie, never drags and the story is quite sweet... but don't forget it is dark and mean at times and that could make it difficult for small children!"
"ranger1354","10","2","5","30 May 2009"," A Truly Transcendent Animated Film
","As an avid fan of all Pixar movies, I had very high hopes for the release of Up, a movie which I believed would continue the Pixar tradition of presenting a message for all age groups within a medium that appealed to younger viewers. What I received surpassed that expectation and so much more, soaring to a new level of film within the animated realm and proving, I believe, that animated films such as this can compete with any potential best picture release.<br/><br/>Up is based in adventure, yet the depth of the characters and the emotional texture that is woven throughout its presentation exceeds any sort of single genre. I laughed, I sighed, I even cried at the range of human emotion which this remarkable film manages to elicit from viewers. See this movie with a friend, child, girlfriend, or wife, just see the movie and I promise you will not be disappointed."
"Fendertyterman","9","2","5","29 May 2009"," Pixar, You've Done it Again!
","Every year, it is tradition for me to see the newest Pixar movie. I own all of them, and consider them genius works of art. Up doesn't disappoint. It has earned a rightful place among The Incredibles, WALL-E, and Toy Story. Up tells the story of 78 year old Carl Fredrickson. The film starts off similar to WALL-E, in which there is little dialogue. Within about 10 minutes, the movie makes you feel like you have known Carl your whole life. You really feel his pain for his deceased wife. The story continues on with excitement and suspense. A boy scout named Russell becomes a stow away on his house, and they eventually meet a rare bird that Russell names Kevin, and a dog with a ""talking collar"" named dug. The main villain of the film puts quite a twist in the story, and is a great bad-guy, achieving Syndrome-like status among Pixar villains. His pack of dogs is a huge, but humorous addition to the story. The man has his own army of these ""talking"" dogs. The animation is incredible, and has its own unique style. Michael Giacchino provides another great soundtrack. The music is old-fashioned. It sounds similar to the stuff you hear when you walk down Main Street U.S.A. (for all of you Disneyland fans out there!). If you are a Pixar fan, this film will not disappoint. It isn't Pixar's greatest film, but it is still an amazing film. If you aren't familiar with Pixar at all, oh well. See this film! Take a date, take your kids, go with some friends. No matter who you are, you will love this film."
"Iecoventure","1","9","45","30 December 2011"," This should be called DOWN.
","I'm assuming everyone who has rated this movie with such adoration must relate to the boring story of this tale, which is a sign that a lot of people are not living up to their potential and making the most out of their life. <br/><br/>My biggest critique is that the story was meant to inspire a life without regret and started off with realistic circumstances but half way through the movie they weakened their purpose by taking the plot in a whole new direction and making everything suddenly unrealistic. Instead of demonstrating that life has unforeseen incidences that can get in the way of your dreams and show how to overcome those hurdles, Pixar and Disney decided to crush those dreams AND any hope for the future. First of all the couple gets married, than tries to go on a dream trip in quest of meeting their adventure hero but house repairs consumes their savings making it difficult to leave. The point of this is obvious, don't wait for tomorrow for tomorrow may never come. But then the wife has a miscarriage! Granted this has happened to many woman but what's the point of showing that? It's not like it's something that can be controlled. What's the lesson of this and what is it doing in a children's film? I know tragedy is a big part of storytelling history but usually death is the main motivator not miscarriage, that is one step away from a still born. Then the couple gets old and the woman dies and the man is left to survive on his own.Surely this happens too again reminding us that we may die before we reach our dreams but she was old and so basically at this point the message seems to be ""if your lazy your whole life and stay in the same house and same neighborhood, you're gonna waste your life"". Well okay but then the second half of the story is completely unrealistic. An annoying young boy decides to suddenly hang out with the old man and no one cares about the missing child. The house can fly miraculously and off they go to the place he always wanted to go with his wife only to find out that his lifelong hero is a phony and a poacher. Some fake colorful bird shows up displaying pixars latest modeling and texturing skills but it's more ridiculous than meaningful. Sure this movie was ""different"" and bold but in my opinion the worst film they've ever made. I just hope my negative review will help to deflate this overinflated idea of a good movie."
"jamesguyconstruction","4","3","11","19 June 2009"," Out of balance.
","Blockbuster animated films need to walk a line between being eye-catching and silly enough to be fun for kids, while being smart and deep enough to be rewarding for adults. Any violence should be, well, cartoonish. This film didn't balance between being a kid movie and an adult movie well at all.<br/><br/>The animation was flawless. Ed Asner was perfectly cast and depicted. The silly stuff (Squirrel!) was there in painful overabundance. The film was eye-catching beyond description, especially in 3D. The story of the main character's loss of his dear wife, though, was gut-wrenchingly sad, and must have been utterly confusing to children. The fight scene where the too-evil explorer was shooting real bullets at a child with intent to kill him was far too violent and real for children. The villain's death was unnecessary.<br/><br/>Since I won't be showing the film to a child, I looked at it from a purely adult perspective, and found too much childishly silly content to make it a good film for my tastes."

"charliejennifercheng","3","2","6","9 December 2014"," Pixar's Downfall is from its own ""UP""fall
","Usually I do like Pixar movies,Toy Story,Monsters Inc,Bugs Life and The Incredibles.Even Cars is not that bad as a film,if seen a second time its actually quite a decent good movie.And yes,many people has said that Pixar's downfall did start with a particular sequel named ,Cars 2.Yes I agree it is really bad, and so as Brave.However,there is a movie from Pixar that has actually been a strong reason for Pixar's own downfall,and ironically,the title of the movie is ""UP""<br/><br/>So we started with a scene with the first montage that chronicled the main protagonist of the movie,Carl,and his own time line.And then later,Ellie comes in.Yes,this is what I have to agree,it was very touching and was hardly anything seen in any animated movie.Then we have the funeral scene and the first half of the movie was pretty good,except,until the house on balloon scene,everything turns awry bad.<br/><br/>Look,I've seen the movie twice,but this is the first time I don't really enjoyed a Pixar movie that badly since Wall-e or Brave or worst Cars 2.Okay,the first time I watch this movie,luckily I was watching it in Fox Premium Movies not in the cinemas,I switched of the channel after that balloon scene and the scene where they went to Paradise Falls.I mean that was two years ago.Then again,two years later,hoping that I'll appreciate this movie again,I watched it in my laptop,and thank God I did not rent or purchase it, again the same thing again.As how pretentious the story tries to be,or how hard it is pushing to be one,it will always be very misguided.<br/><br/>Even the character portrayal is pretty bad also.The voice acting is not good and the goals of what the characters were were also very bad.Also the animation is pretty that bad by Pixar standards too.Compared to the awe inspiring ones from Toy Story and The Incredibles,no less they are created in the years where CGI animation was not as advance as today,they still managed to hold up time compared to this movie that shows Pixar's own laziness in character design.And yes,contrasting to what many people say about the portrayal of Russell,I am deeply offended by the portrayal of him,and being a Chinese born Malaysian,I am offended by how stereotypical he was portrayed,because his annoyance reflects on how many of us were portrayed,as annoying and loud Asian people.<br/><br/>So if possible try avoiding this movie.Luckily,the day after watching this pretentious crap,I do watch Big Hero 6,which is another movie that features Asian characters and which has a way better animation and storyline than this one without trying to feel pretentious at all,and yes I am really satisfied with it,giving that it has a way better representation of Asians than Up really has.So try perhaps to avoid this movie,or maybe watch if you are okay with this one.Storywise,it is not pretty bad,but it was mediocre at Pixar's standards.<br/><br/>Overall,it is just a over-hyped overrated movie that was hyped for the wrong reasons.And it is also very offensive too.Also on its side,it was the cause of why Pixar falls so badly."
"CaptainPronin","10","2","6","8 November 2010"," A masterpiece
","All the films made by Pixar are simply great. I loved all of them. And ""Up"" is not the exception, being an incredible movie, with lots of humor and heartwarming scenes, excellent voice performances, incredible animation, and beautiful music.<br/><br/>'Up' merely cements Pixar's reputation as the most intelligent and innovative film studio of the moment. From the incredible opening 10 minutes, destined to be a cinematic classic for ever, to the touching final scene, I was completely and utterly entranced. <br/><br/>A film for all ages and one that perfectly sums up the love and laughter that only the very greatest films can manage to pull of. <br/><br/>""Up"" is one of the most beautiful and captivating films ever made. It definitely deserves all the praise it receives, and certainly, it deserves even more."
"TOMNEL","10","2","6","6 June 2009"," Pixar's most emotionally involving film. Best flick so far of 2009!
","Early reviews of Disney/Pixar's Up made some statements that I myself could not believe. The main charge in almost all the reviews was that the audience was crying within the first ten minutes. This seemed impossible to me, that an audience of people could become so emotionally involved in a film within ten minutes as to start crying...I was wrong. The opening to this film is heartbreaking, and possibly one of the saddest scenes to be featured in a film. And they pepper these little scenes throughout. This movie is very emotionally involving, and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Carl Fredrickson (In his old age, voiced by Ed Asner) at one time was a kid with dreams of being an adventurer, visiting strange and exotic lands. As a child, he met Ellie, the girl of his dreams, and he got married to her. They had a life together, tried to have a baby, and as life went on, the explorer dreams went farther and farther away. After Ellie's death, Carl has become a bitter old man. Now 78, all that Carl has left is his house, which construction workers want down. After an accident where Carl injures a man, Carl is forced into an old folks home, but he isn't going. Being a retired balloon salesman, Carl has plenty of balloons left, so he ties his house up and takes off for South America where he and his wife dreamed of going. Unfortunately for him, boy scout wilderness explorer Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) came along for the ride. Adventure and chaos ensues while trying to get his house to the exact spot in South America.<br/><br/>This really is an excellent, if not almost perfect picture. The characters have such depth, as is true with most Pixar main characters. Carl is a mean old man, but he is definitely likable, and it's easy to see the motivation behind his anger and bitterness. Russell is another deep character, written to be the comic foil, and to be a cute little kid, and to be the child from a broken home who has problems. These characters contrast so perfectly and have excellent chemistry, and are just well written in themselves.<br/><br/>In many ways this is a touching film. Lot's of character development is featured, mainly from Carl, but from others too. Carl is such a tragic hero, and all he wants to do is set his house down where he and his wife dreamed. Carl's wants and needs should click with anybody who has nostalgia and just wants to live their past. He's a broken man, trying to redeem himself, for himself and for the memory of his deceased wife. It's really a sad tale in itself, but with the normal Pixar magic, it's also an uplifting, funny, entertaining film that will definitely be remembered as a classic.<br/><br/>Pixar has yet again raised their bar even higher. Up is a beautiful adventure film filled with rich characters, great animation and very real emotion. Possibly Pixar's best picture yet, and that's including the amazing Wall-E. Best picture thus far of 2009! <br/><br/>My rating: **** out of ****. 99 mins. PG for some tragic scenes."
"moviemanMA","10","2","6","5 June 2009"," Pixar soars to new heights
","Up is everything you could ask for in a animation film and more. This is Disney/Pixar's first film in 3D. I have been a bit wary about the use of this technology, but I can't deny that it looks breathtaking here. There are no cheap effects and it is only used to make the film look better, giving it more depth and character. It's not just eye candy and it doesn't take away from the story.<br/><br/>The story follows Carl Frederickson, an elderly man who has had a dream for most of his life to fly to South America to see Paradise Falls, the place where his favorite explorer, Charles Muntz, last visited. When life pushes him to the limit, he decides to take matters into his own hands. Being a Balloon salesman, he transforms his house into an air ship, tying on hundreds if not thousands of balloons to life him above the landscape and off to Paradise Falls. Unfortunately for him but fortunately for us, he has a tag along. Russell is a young Wilderness Explorer (like a Boy Scout) who happens upon his house just as he lifts off. The two are stuck together until they reach the falls.<br/><br/>Along the way we encounter a strange bird of paradise Russell calls Kevin as well as a dog named Dug who has a collar that allows him to talk. All distractions and annoyances for Carl but friends to Russell.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful story that makes you truly happy when it's all over. I thought WALL-E had some deep and profound messages like staying ""green"" and the dangers of obesity, but Up talks about fertility, life and death, companionship, fatherhood, as well as the generic loyalty, the importance of friendship, and having fun.<br/><br/>Like all Pixar films (especially lately), there is always one aspect of the animation that is constantly being tested and glorified. In Finding Nemo we see how the water effects the objects in it as well as the light. Ratatouille showed how fog and shadows can create mood. Monster's Inc. focused a lot of attention on texture and interacting with the environment (like Sully's fur). In Up we get a lot of depth perception and panoramic views thanks to the 3D technology. There are times when I caught myself practically drooling over how beautiful a shot was. They really do a fantastic job in animating.<br/><br/>Another big aspect of the production that has great importance is the voice acting. I think Ellen DeGeneres's voice acting for Dory in Finding Nemo is one of the greatest on screen performances of all time. The voices in Up capture the feelings of the characters perfect. Ed Asner voices Carl. He is grumpy, determined, but there is a lot going on under the surface that slowly rises up as the film progresses. Jordan Nagai voices Russell and gives exactly what we could possibly ask from a child actor: to be himself. Even the co-director and writer Bob Peterson does a great job as the voice of the dog Dug (also the voice of Mr. Ray in Finding Nemo). Other talents like Christopher Plummer, Delroy Lindo, and John Ratzenberger, the only actor to have an appearance in all 10 of the Disney/Pixar feature films.<br/><br/>Like most Pixar films, so much relies on the music. My least favorite of the 10 films is Cars, a film that have a heavy modern soundtrack. I like it when they stick to their creative guns and fire off something new and fantastic. They were much better about it with WALL-E, mixing in original with with existing tunes like the Hello, Dolly! soundtrack. A very nice touch. Here with Up we have a brand new score that is inspirational and fitting to the story. There is a sort of waltz like we are floating across a dance floor. It fits quite nicely.<br/><br/>Where Up falters is...nowhere. I have seen the film twice already and both times I left completely satisfied. The animation is some of their best and the story is tight and perfect. It stays the course and carries you the entire way. It's beautiful, poetic, and uplifting.

"spradley-3","10","2","6","30 May 2009"," More than fabulous animation - see it with someone you love!
","I'll start by saying that I am usually taking my daughters to these animated films and have not been engaged in any of these until WALL-E. However, even with WALL-E- beyond the relationship of the two robots, the rest was done well but ... Anyway - UP was different. ******Lots of spoilers******** The film starts with Carl as a young boy, getting into mischief, meeting his wife - also very young. Still in the opening scenes, with essentially no dialog just images- we are taken through Carl's life and tender moments with his wife. It is truly moving, their love through difficult moments but mostly happy, together times. Then Carl is 78 years old - it is today - and he's alone. For me, half of the film was about Carl's fulfilling his promise to his wife, to make their home in a special, beautiful spot in South America: their special adventure. As Carl embarks upon this endeavor, he meets wonderful, endearing characters whose personalities shine with and without words. The way that Pixar weaves stories with so little words is incredible. The animation is wonderfully detailed and beautiful - you could see individual fur on the dogs, intricate feathers on the bird and stubble chin hair on Carl. The adventure has the usual villain but (for the adults), the second emphasis of the story is about Carl letting go of his loneliness and sadness after losing his wife and becoming engaged in life again. His wife had started a scrapbook when they met as children, about the greatest adventure she wanted to have in life - being the trip to South America. Carl always thought the pages after the ""Great stuff I want to do"" in his wife's scrapbook was empty because they had never gotten to go to South America. At the end of the movie, he moves past that page to find that her scrapbook is filled with pictures of all the times they had together - that those were her best adventures. Amid all of the characters, comedy and activities which had the audience laughing and cheering, was the kind of love we all search for: enduring, fun, tender - and how hard it is to lose that love. You could feel Carl's sadness. Very moving, poignant - absolutely worth the tears. It will help you value your loves more while you have them. And the movie is filled with smiles too. The kids won't understand why there are tears in your eyes..."
"misterembryo","10","2","6","30 May 2009"," ""Up""-Lifting
","The masterminds behind the mysterious walls of Pixar Animation have the strangest ability to transform the simplest ideas into the most poignant stories of our time. They do not disappoint this time around, as they take you on an aerial odyssey to South America in a floating house. I know we say this every year, but this is arguably the best Pixar film yet, and quite possibly one of the best films of all time, period.<br/><br/>""Up"" tells the amazing story of Carl Fredrickson, a retired balloon salesman who refuses to surrender his house to the demands of urban expansion. On the surface is a little old man who is stubborn, apathetic, uncooperative, and bitter with age. But beyond the rigid face, the white head of hair, and bulky glasses is an aging man who is suffering from loneliness, unable to part with the house he once shared with the love of his life. He met her when he was a goofy little boy, and she was a spunky little girl, and together they shared a lust for adventure inspired by the great explorer Charles Muntz. The history of Carl and his wife Ellie is told through one of the most moving opening sequences in recent memory. Translation: I may have shed a tear or two.<br/><br/>Lucky for us, Russell, an enthusiastic Junior Wilderness Scout, comes around to mend our broken heartstrings in hilarious fashion, as his youthful innocence is quickly countered by Carl's old indifference, and vice versa. What they do share, however, is determination. Russell will do anything to assist the elderly and become a Senior Wilderness Scout, and Carl will do anything to find Paradise Falls and finish his late wife's Adventure Book. Their interaction is classic, a relationship that both child and adult are likely to enjoy.<br/><br/>As always, Pixar does a fine job of suspending our disbelief in a way that is strangely acceptable. The flying house, for example, is a simple network of balloons sprouting out of the chimney, with the strings tightly fastened to the fireplace. To steer the flying vessel, shower curtains serve as the sails and a crank tied to the weather vain is the helm, while a garden hose works as the anchor. The idea is incredible, but works wonderfully in the reality of the story, as Carl in his youth often had trouble preventing his balloon cart from floating off the ground.<br/><br/>While the movie is obviously fantasy, it touches on issues and emotions that are very real and very dark. ""Up"" serves as a reminder that adventure is out there, even in the boring stuff we take for granted in everyday life, and therein lies the real answer to overcoming our darkest times.<br/><br/>""Up"" is original, funny, inspirational, beautifully animated, and full of surprises, as all Pixar films tend to be. Even an old bit like talking dogs is used in a way that is different and really entertaining. Fortunately for me, I only watched ""Up"" in 2D, and have an excuse to come back and enjoy once again, the magical adventure of Carl Fredrickson and the little flying house that could. Adventure is out there! And on my list of cinematic adventures, ""Up"" is way up there."
"dragongirl346","10","2","6","29 May 2009"," Did you really expect anything less?
","Pixar's done it again. Nothing new, right? But in their incredible success in the film industry, Pixar has always remained fresh, and Up is no exception.<br/><br/>Before the film is Partly Cloudy, the directorial debut of Peter Sohn, whose job I desperately want. While not my favorite (Lifted will always have a special place in my heart), Partly Cloudy tells a wonderful, adorable story with an impeccable balance of humor. The clouds were absolutely stunning, a true achievement in animation, and I found myself waiting on the edge of my seat for the film to start.<br/><br/>The film opens on a young Carl and Ellie and in five minutes carries the viewer through seventy years of life together. By the end, our entire theater was sobbing. Some of my friends had to make sure we were all crying for if some stone wasn't, they were likely to get hit for being a heartless wretch.<br/><br/>Once the backstory has been dealt in that five minute blow, the film gets in full swing, following the adventures of Carl, Russel, Kevin, Dug, and the rest of the incredibly well-rounded cast with the classic Pixarian flair.<br/><br/>The humor is absolutely spot on and true to form, the storytelling impeccable, the visuals... Oh gosh, the visuals were stunning. I found myself fascinated with how realistic the hair on the dogs looked, the mists, the clouds, the balloons. Every moment of the film contained at least one example of animated beauty.<br/><br/>Being the soundtrack nerd that I am, this review wouldn't be complete without a mention of the Michael Giachinno score. The music itself is extremely conservative in its deviations from the melody Giachinno establishes. Instead of using different themes to convey different settings and emotions, Giachinno manipulates tempo and instrumentation to a satisfactory effect. By the end of the film, the score was verging on repetitiveness, an effect I also felt in Giachinno's other running film, Star Trek. I feel that he put much more effort into Star Trek than into Up, but the results of that divided attention were not at all disappointing.<br/><br/>No film ever made will be able to top the level of perfection I found in the preceding Pixar feature, WALL-E. But Up presented a fair and strong fight and is, without doubt, the best film of the year so far. I'd say the Oscar is almost guaranteed for this one, Pixar - hats off to you.<br/><br/>10/10"
"gregeichelberger","8","2","6","25 May 2009"," 'Up' up and away, Pixar flies high with newest production
","The one thing that has made Pixar Studios so successful in making high quality CGI films is not just the brilliant animation and the love and craftsmanship that go into each effort, it's those wonderful stories.<br/><br/>While the kiddies can wallow in the vivid color spectrum, high energy action and such lovable characters as Sully, Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Nemo, Lightning McQueen and Wall-E, among others, their parents can relish the thoughtful and interesting plot lines.<br/><br/>And, with the newest Pixar animated film coming out this weekend, both youngsters and elders can re-live the whole process all over again. ""Up"" is a multi-layered action/adventure/comedy/drama that goes for the laughs but slides just as easily into the other genres.<br/><br/>And while the studio has grabbed the lion's share of animated movie Oscar awards, many these movies far outshine much of the live action garbage we're given year after year. In fact, in 2008, ""Wall*E"" was my second favorite film of the year, just behind ""The Dark Knight."" In ""Up,"" Carl Fredrikson (voiced by Ed Asner) is a bitter 78-year-old retired balloon salesman who has just lost his adventure loving wife. He lives alone in a small house no one in the neighborhood ever visits.<br/><br/>But Carl does have one dream left – to visit Paradise Falls in South America. Of course, he does not have enough cash to accomplish the trip, so he sets about tying thousands of helium balloons to his domicile.<br/><br/>On the very day he decides to embark, however, a fatherless Wilderness Explorer, Russell (John Nagai) just happens to be on his front porch. The story then arcs into pure fun and fantasy, but the growing relationship between the lonely senior and the young boy in need of a role model is not ignored.<br/><br/>There is a lot of action in this film, but there is an equal amount of heart – and that's what sets it apart and makes it one of the best the studio has produced (and that is saying a whole lot).<br/><br/>Especially wonderful is the short opening segment(mostly without audio, just like many parts of ""Wall*E"") which introduces us to Carl and his wife. If this is not a lump-in-your-throat moment, you're probably a heartless android.<br/><br/>Now, I haven't even written about Pixar's crystal clear animation and seamless technology. There seems to be a different look and vibe with each film and ""Up"" is no exception. The characters are rather boxy and goofy, but that's fine and fits in well with this story.<br/><br/>The scenes beyond the clouds are vivid, amazingly artistic and wondrous. The emotions run from frivolity to fright and back again. it is truly a roller coaster ride of emotion that leaves you tearful one moment and exultant the next.<br/><br/>I almost did not want to leave the theater.<br/><br/>And, of course, no Pixar picture would be complete without the opening short. In the past, we were introduced to rabbits and magicians, space aliens and gauntly but cute birds. This latest effort is entitled ""Partly Cloudy"" and is one of the best and funniest, so far."

","just here to cast a vote for those hating this film. I would not have liked this as a kid either. the whole beginning was so maudlin and ... weirdly seemed drawn out even as it went through 60 years. maybe it's an insult to my intelligence such as it is that a boy and a girl who are pals would end up married. how fake is that. all that sentiment and sediment blech... at just before when he gets kicked out of his house I decided to come and read the crappy reviews cause I knew I was not one of the people who thought highly of this movie.

","Introduction:<br/><br/>Up is considered by many to be in the top five of the best Pixar films. However, Up for me, doesn't make my top 10. Don't get me wrong, Up is a good movie. I just don't think it's a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Thoughts:<br/><br/>The first ten minutes of Up are simply amazing, absolutely perfect, and can work as it's own short film. However, it's not a short film. It's a 90 minute movie. And the other 80 minutes is really just okay to me.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film is really the villain. For a company that has made such great villains, I can't even remember this guy's name. And the kid character is also a little dull. I think Carl is still a great character, and he's one of my favorite Pixar protagonists. The movie has a nice creativity to it, and it's very entertaining.<br/><br/>I like the animation of the film. The CGI backgrounds are very nice. The character models are cartoonish, and fit in this world very well. With bright colors to go along with it, the animation is great Pixar CGI.<br/><br/>I just think people blow out proportion, because of the first ten minutes. The first ten minutes is amazing, but the other 80 minutes is good, but not amazing.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>I like the movie. I don't think it's amazing, but I like it. I think the first ten minutes is a little too blown out of proportion.But the rest of the movie is still good. Up is in fact, a good movie, not one my favorites from Pixar, but still a great watch."

"zkonedog","8","1","2","11 March 2017"," ""Gran Torino"" For The Family Set
","A few years ago, I watched the film ""Gran Torino"" and was completely blown away by director Clint Eastwood's take on themes such as aging, friendship, and coming to terms with one's own life. However, those who are easily offended (by either harsh language or non-political correctness) would likely not be able to get past those hang-ups, while kids are ruled out altogether. Thankfully, Pixar's ""Up"" explores those same themes in a much more family-friendly fashion.<br/><br/>Basically, the story centers on Carl Fredricksen, a senior citizen widower who's being cajoled out of his old relic of a house by construction (""progress"") on all sides of him. Instead of going out smoothly, though, Carl decides (being a retired balloon salesman) to fly his home (via a gaggle of helium balloons!) to Paradise Falls, the mystical place that him and his deceased wife Ellie always dreamed of, but never quite realized. However, there is one hitch in the plan...that being the completely helpless boy scout, Russell, who just happened to be on the wrong porch at the wrong time. As they make their way towards the falls, Carl and Russell encounter a slew of new characters and challenges, making it truly an adventure in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>The first level that this film really works at is with the kiddies...the intended viewers. There are enough sight gags (involving the rotund Russell and crotchety Carl) and crazy characters (the talking dog ""Dug""...squirrel!) to keep their interest the whole runtime.<br/><br/>However, on a much deeper level, this film will truly move even the most adult of viewers. An amazing sequence towards the beginning of the film depicts the marriage (both the ups and the downs) of Carl and Ellie, and really sets up Carl's character development as he is forced to venture out into the world again and bond with young Russell. With each passing moment (and new adventure), viewers get the feeling that Carl is taking another small step closer to making a clean break from the past and living for the here and now. The scene where he finally realizes that fact is enough to make your eyes begin to water.<br/><br/>Thus, I consider ""Up"" to be the pinnacle (at least so far) of animated films for its ability to make you laugh, tantalizing your senses, and really draw you into the characters and their successes/struggles."
"areatw","9","1","2","25 May 2016"," An animated masterpiece
","This is probably my favourite Pixar movie to date. I loved 'Ratatouille' and 'The Incredibles' but 'Up' is in another league - quite simply outstanding. It's an emotional roller-coaster of a film, which is a remarkable achievement in itself for an animated feature, but Pixar rarely fails to deliver.<br/><br/>The story is wonderfully uplifting and the characters are engaging. It is very well written and of course the production is terrific like with all Pixar movies. 'Up' is also surprisingly funny - usually the humour in animated films isn't my thing but this one did make me laugh. It is also visually stunning and I would love to see it again in 3D one day.<br/><br/>This is as close to perfection as an animated movie has come and it can be appreciated and enjoyed by all. 'Up' is a masterpiece."
"barkaj","10","1","2","25 January 2016"," Believe the Hype
","Going into this review, we've all heard about the first ten minutes of this movie and how no one will escape them with a dry eye. Some of us might have heard that this is Pixar's crowning achievement, surpassing the likes of ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo"". Regardless of the buzz surrounding ""Up"", the film remains, quite simply, one of the finest animated movies of recent history, if not of all time. Yes, the first ten minutes are extremely compelling, and I have never seen a movie achieve its exposition so well in such a subtle way; it's something beyond remarkable. The life of Carl Fredrickson is played out to show the love he shared with his wife, Ellie, and how they had some big dreams that never quite came true. The rest of the movie is a beautiful testament to how love and the spirit of ambition take new forms as life goes on, as Carl befriends Russel, an enthusiastic young scout, Dug, a talking dog, and ""Kevin"", an inappropriately named tropical bird. The way this film tackles heavy issues like loss and grieving is so profound and yet simple enough for any audience member to understand. There's enough laughs to keep the kids interested, enough touching moments for adults, and an amazing sense of adventure for the kid in all of us. I can't really name a favorite movie, but if someone held a gun to my head and forced me to decide, this would certainly be one of the first to cross my mind. Absolutely essential viewing. Perfect."

","Up is an animated movie produced by Pixar and released by Walt Disney Pictures on May 29th, 2009. The movie introduces us the adventures of Carl, an elderly widower, Russel, a Wilderness Explorer, Dug the dog and a rare exotic bird named Kevin, just to name a few characters.<br/><br/>Carl aged 78, sets out to fulfill his dream shared with his late wife, Ellie. This dream started at a very young age, when Carl met Ellie, she confesses to him that she wants to move a clubhouse to ""Paradise Falls"" located in South America. They get married and have a rough life together, with Ellie dying because of old age. One day, after an incident with a construction worker, Carl was to be taken to a retirement home. Surely, with his experience as a balloon seller at a zoo, and the unhappy thought of living his last years in a retirement house, he ties thousands of balloons to his rooftop and floats away. What a crazy idea that is! The only little nuisance is, there is an unexpected passenger on board, Russel, a Wilderness Explorer. Carl has no choice but to accept Russel and his presence on board his house. <br/><br/>I love this story, it is full of teeth gritting adventures and lots of elderly action! (seriously) My favorite character is Kevin, a female exotic bird that is being chased by Muntz and primarily what the whole story is actually about. Pixar did their very best with this movie and they really deserved the ""Best Picture"" award. The characters felt very real to me, both soulfully and with the amazing, vivid 3D graphics. ""Up"" kept me at the edge of my seat, I was always waiting for something to happen and kept making assumptions and conclusions throughout the movie.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie is when Carl realizes that what his wife wants him, is to be happy, and to go find new adventures. That is when he mans up and hurries after Russel who was flying/floating away. The scenes showing how Carl and Ellie grew up together, when they got married, when they restored the ""clubhouse"" and up until Ellie's death were very well portrayed in my opinion. This movie touched my heart and made me feel an array of emotions. I was sad, depressed when Ellie died, amazed when they survived the thunderstorm, happy when they all got together for some ice-cream. This movies is DOPE!<br/><br/>This is such an amazing movie and such a great work of art done by Pixar! I would recommend this to anyone, of any age. I look forward to watching this with my friends and family again! Thank you!"

","Up (2009): Dir: Pete Docter / Voices: Edward Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Petersen, Christopher Plummer, Pete Docter: Adventurous animation regarding living life to the fullest. Elderly Carl Fredricksen descends to the air bound for South American Paradise Falls via thousands of balloons lifting his house. He is accompanied by an eight year old kid out for adventure. While third act is ridiculous with dogs flying planes, director Pete Docter is backed with extraordinary visual images. He previously made another inventive Pixar animation called Monsters Inc. Edward Asner voices Carl whose back story is the emotional core. It is a sad yet detailed account of how his childhood love gradually became his wife but their planned trip to Paradise Falls was always prevented. He will now make the trip with Russell and become the father figure he never was. Jordan Nagai voices the enthusiastic Russell whose meaning is obvious. Bob Petersen voices Dug the dog with a voice collar and a better route in life in mind. Christopher Plummer voices the villain whose story is depressing considering his humiliation. His ability to render dogs in flight with speech collars is insane, and his defeat is at the mercy of his accusers. Pete Docter provides the noises of the rare bird in edition to directing this epic animation. The film teaches our potential regardless of our age. Score: 8 / 10"
"sandnair87","9","1","2","29 April 2015"," Pixar Lifts You 'Up' on the Waves of Visual Bedazzlement!
","Up begins with a poignant montage of our protagonist Carl Fredricksen (the unmistakable voice of Ed Asner) and his partner Ellie as they meet as fledgling broods, only to fall in love. Thrown together by a shared spirit of adventure, particularly the escapades of a spirited explorer Charles Muntz who dazzled the world with his discovery of Paradise Falls, Carl and Ellie are forced to shelve their plans to move to this ""exotic lost land"" as life, as always, gets in the way. We watch the couple deal with the ups and downs, joys and tragedies of life; and gradually we watch them grow into old age, Ellie's 'My Adventures' scrapbook still unfilled, even as her time on Earth ends. This wordless, eloquent, effortlessly heart- breaking sequence is sure to melt even the iciest of hearts.<br/><br/>With Ellie gone, Carl becomes a crusty codger, faced with moving to retirement home for the rest of his days. But he has another idea, one involving the inflatable leftovers of his previous career as a sidewalk balloon vendor. He decides to honor the promise he made to his dearly departed adventure-loving wife and take one last shot at adventure! Carl hitches thousands of helium balloons to his rickety old house, rigs a steering system and 'Up' he goes. But he is not alone. There's a pint-size accidental stowaway aboard: Russell (an endearing Jordan Nagai as Carl's comic foil), an eight-year-old Wilderness Explorer scout set on earning a badge for assisting the elderly, who happens to be on Carl's porch right when the house takes off. Together they embark on an eventful journey that brings them face to face with unlikely travel companions - both friends and foes in the form of talking dogs, an enormous squawking bird and the reclusive Muntz himself - as they arrive in Paradise Falls. By the end of their escapade, they not only become thick friends, but also learn an invaluable lesson about what really matters most in life; a lesson that imbues Up with a strongly beating heart. <br/><br/>Pixar once again outdoes itself with Up, a vibrantly bubbly exploration of how life's great adventures can stem from death's gloomy depths. From a distance, Up may seem to be an old-fashioned adventure story, but filmmakers Pete Docter and Bob Peterson utilize the off-the-wall premise to consistently enthralling effect. The chemistry between Carl and Russell plays a pivotal role here, with the pair's various misadventures heightened by the flamboyant supporting characters and breathtaking visuals. Never has the sight of a thousand balloons looked as glorious as it does here, while the mountains, canyons, and dense forests of its South America bristles with life.<br/><br/>Up is so human and relatable that it feels like it's more than just a mere animation - it has more heart and soul in its tiniest pixel than most live-action movies can boast in their entirety. No matter how you look at it, through the innocent eyes of a child or the wider, wiser world-view of an adult, the bright, buoyant 'Up' brims with imagination, adventure, humor and heart. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but you won't fail to be lifted!"

Again and again they release entertaining movies with not only a terrific sense of humor, but a level of storytelling that has set a standard for today's films, animated or otherwise. While I was obviously extremely excited to see Up, never did I expect it - or, to be honest. Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Simply put, Up is a perfect movie.<br/><br/>This movie is freakin' hilarious.

The movie gets very surreal with dog translators, and a very colorful bird. The villain is a bit too villainy. The story gets too serious at times. But it ends almost as emotionally as it starts. It is one of the best of Pixar."

","Up is an inspirational movie for all ages. The movie begins with a bitter introduction of a couple named Carl and Ellie, joined together by love and adventure until the passing of Carl's beloved wife and ends with a developing friendship through an obscure journey. Up showed compassion, love, adventure, and friendship. It showed the devotion of a man fulfilling a dream of his deceased wife and revealed growing friendships among an irritable old man, a rambunctious child, and a talking dog. The story line was very original, filled with both humor and sadness, from the hilarious talking dog to the heart wrenching story of the widowed cranky old man."

","What a wonderful film! ""Up"" is a sweet, beautiful, humorous and exhilarating animated flick from the great folks at Pixar. entertaining, Hilarious, Captivating fun movie. This film was not just another goofy animated romp, however. It was surprisingly touching with some deep themes, while also strikingly original and altogether great! While a little slow in places for the toddler set, it nonetheless grabs hold of your heart and doesn't let it go. am not a fan of animation movie but when i saw Up, i was lost for words. was very much emotional for me and I loved every minute of it, and left the theatre with a big smile on my face...a must see movie!"
"paul2001sw-1","9","1","2","27 January 2013"," A real movie
","'Up', the latest delightful animated film from Pixar, combines whimsicality, beautiful graphics and a lot of laughs. It follows in the spirit of previous Pixar movies, most obviously its immediate predecessor 'WALL-E', but has something of its own flavour too - although the medium is different, there are elements of this film that would not have been out of place in Nick Park's 'Wallace and Grommit' films. What really has impressed many people about Pixar's films, and which certainly impressed me about this one, is not just that they feature groundbreaking animation, but they are put together with a real auteur's eye: look for the quality of the scene composition, or the way that the final images of one scene fit visually and thematically with the starting images of the next, and it's clear that this is a film made by people who know how to make movies (although for once, John Lasseter himself is not directing, and the job is done instead by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson). And ask yourself, have many mainstream Hollywood blockbusters feature two (sympathetic) characters as unglamourous as a childless widower and a fat kid? This is a gentle movie, for sure; but also a genuinely funny one, and oddly, in spite of its fantastical story, a certain grounding in truth actually lacking in most live action Hollywood films."

","Pixar seems to be improving from one film to the next. From The Incredibles onward, they've been set on making their films more and more appealing to adults, and they've done it - Up can be enjoyed by the entire family - more so that Wall-E, which was too slow paced in its first half for children.<br/><br/>The feelings of melancholy and nostalgia in Up, especially the opening montage, are authentic and truly touching; which doesn't mean that Up is not also incredibly funny. The second half is a romp of an adventure movie with lots of action and lots of fun; it's not as powerful as the beginning, but it's also not a letdown like the second half of Wall-E. Whether it's melancholy or insane, Up remains consistently good throughout, and it's one of the best CGI features made yet."

","Up is the Pixar film that towers over all the other Pixar films. The emotional impact of it is even more powerful than even some Disney Classics such as The Lion King. Do not worry though because the film does have lots and lots of good old slapstick humor and best of all no crude pop references. The film follows an elderly widower (voice of Ed Asner)as he journeys to his late wife's dream vacation but finds himself entangled with a boy scout, a giant bird, and a talking dog. Funny and touching to say the least, Up is one of the greats, an instant classic that will keep people talking until movies themselves wither away. Pixar's Best."

"rochelle123","7","1","2","6 February 2011"," I found the film ""Up"" to be funny and chalked full of excitement . It was a great movie to watch with my children.
","The movie ""Up"" is a 2009 Walt Disney film about a retired balloon salesman, Carl Fredrickson who is in his 70's living his deceased wife Ellie's childhood dream of adventure to South America. Carl is a funny little man who adored his life with his wife Ellie who he met as a child. After Ellie's death and the court's decision to send Carl to a retirement home, he decides to fulfill Ellie's dream of living on Paradise Falls in South America. Carl fills thousands of balloons with helium and ties them to his house in order to take the house to Paradise Falls. Along the way he realizes that he has another passenger, an eight year old wilderness explorer named Russell. This unlikely duo get off to a rocky start but through meeting new friends like Kevin the bird and Dug the dog they become like father and son. The theme of this film is about life, love, and adventure. In the beginning we see Carl and Ellie's life together up until her death when they are old. We also see the love that they shared. Throughout the rest of the film we see the adventure that Carl takes to live the adventure that Ellie had wanted herself. Towards the end of the film when Carl sits down and looks through the adventure book one last time he realized that Ellie had lived an adventure of her own and was happy with their life together. The film as a whole focused on an old man's dream of fulfilling an adventurous past. Each scene of the film offered a bit of imagination and suspense. When Carl finally reaches Paradise Falls with his house he quickly realizes that his adventure is just beginning. After coming in contact with Kevin the bright colored unusual bird and the talking dog dug the pace of the movie picks up to an action based plot. Carl is torn between saving his house and saving Kevin from his childhood hero. The film was bright in its color format and used very deep but brilliant lighting to enhance the characters themselves. The camera gave different angle shots on specific scenes to keep you in suspense. For example, the scene where the dogs were chasing what appeared to be a very large bird. I found this film to be very mature and more of a young adult type than of a children's style of film. I felt that the film gave a sense of sadness and reality."

","Up is a very creative film that will win over many young children. The film begins with a captivating montage about the protagonist's times with his wife, up to her death. He then decides to meet her promise of visiting Paradise Falls, located in South America. A young boy scout accidentally follows him during the journey. When they finally get there, they discover a rare colorful bird who must be protected from a vicious poacher and his dogs. This is one of Pixar's more mature efforts (indicated by the PG rating).

"oneguyrambling","9","1","2","30 October 2010"," Just your standard ""Old man flies house to South America"" film. Brilliant.
","No one company has given me as much movie enjoyment over the last 14 years. No actor, director or studio has me anxiously awaiting even the announcement of the next project as Pixar.<br/><br/>Pixar value story over pop culture references and winking at the screen, genuine charm and consistency over simple cuteness and syrup, and establishing character over crass marketing ploys (probably ""Cars"" aside).<br/><br/>If you like any Pixar film read no further, there is no letdown here. Go watch Up.<br/><br/>It doesn't even matter if you have kids or not, Up is just a great movie. I for one have watched every Pixar release since Toy Story in 95, which was of course the first, and as my son is still too young to go to a cinema I went to Up kid-free. Don't be snobbish adults, you'll miss out on some great flicks.<br/><br/>If you are still uncertain here is what Up is about.<br/><br/>We open with a star struck little kid, maybe 7? at the ""moving pictures"" in what might be the 40s or 50s, watching a news piece on the rise to prominence, and subsequent fall from grace of explorer Charles Muntz.<br/><br/>On the way home, still on a giddy high from his 40s fanboy experience, the boy runs into a similarly aged young girl, also an exploring enthusiast named Ellie. Carl and Eddie are polar opposites, Carl seems quiet, shy and introverted, Ellie is loud, opinionated and outgoing. They grow up, get married and plan ambitious exploring missions.<br/><br/>Now comes the most moving dialogue-free few minutes that I have experienced in a film for perhaps ever. A simple slowly paced montage shows Carl and Ellie and how they grow together through life.<br/><br/>Realistically this is the kind of step that can only be pulled off by an animated movie, but this few minutes is amazingly effective. In it we learn more than we could have discovered in a totally separate 90 minute film about the same characters.<br/><br/>One key point from the montage is that despite their best efforts, Carl and Ellie are never able to save enough for their trips before the funds are needed elsewhere - ultimately Carl is left alone. No sappy last words, no clumsy togetherness, just a lifetime summarized in minutes.<br/><br/>10 minutes in, and I'm genuinely sad.<br/><br/>Carl is now 70 something, think Clint Eastwood in ""Gran Torino"" without the forced everyone is racist – but that's sometimes OK clumsiness. He lives in the same home that he and Ellie shared, and now it more than anything is the embodiment of his deceased wife and their happy life together. Therefore, while progress is altering all around him he stubbornly refuses to move with the times.<br/><br/>One day a knock at the door introduces us to Russell, a Wilderness Explorer (Boy Scout). Russell is looking at adding to his hefty collection of merit badges by helping the elderly.<br/><br/>Russell is a typical 10 year old kid – well meaning, book smart about topics a 10 year old should be (animals and such), especially Wilderness Explorers but unaware of how much of real life actually is. He says 10 year old dumb things because he doesn't yet know any better, Russell is just a boy growing up.<br/><br/>Carl is a crotchety old man, and when he does change it is only subtle and for legitimate reasons.<br/><br/>Back to the film, Carl shoos Russell off with a wild goose (snipe?) chase, and goes back to his lonely existence.<br/><br/>After a run in with developers, Carl is told that he has run out of time and must move to a retirement home, and two men show at his door to take him there.<br/><br/>Now anyone who has seen even the poster knows what happens next, so there should be no surprise at how he leaves, but when it dies happen it was a spectacular event, both visually and cinematically, and it carried a real sense of something actually happening, not just a plot device.<br/><br/>I had all over tingles for minutes. Good ones.<br/><br/>As luck would have it Russell has come back to visit and has inadvertently stowed away with Carl on his journey to fulfil Ellie's wish and Carl's promise.<br/><br/>Russell appears Asian-American (to be PC), and it is refreshing to see Asian-American animated actors getting more work, as up until now the animated landscape has been dominated by white, black, green and blue characters.<br/><br/>Carl and Russell (well really Russell) befriend an 8 foot tall South American bird while ""walking the house"" the final stretch to Paradise Falls and the bird, who Russell names Kevin becomes quite protective of him.<br/><br/>Yep I said Walking the House.<br/><br/>I'll go spoiler free from here, Up is a film that earns the right to unravel in front of the audience.<br/><br/>Once in Paradise Falls they meet more characters, not all human - but still capable of communicating. ""SQUIRREL!"" There is a very effective chase scene, house included, and a finale that makes Carl the most geriatric Indiana Jones type character since, well Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br/><br/>Being an animated film involving a man floating his house to another continent and his subsequent adventures of course the plot includes ludicrous events and situations, none seem truly out of place. Up remains amazingly entertaining and deserves repeated viewings.<br/><br/>One final point, there are a few situations where Carl and Russell and various animals are put in danger, so younger children may be a bit distressed at times (OK parent hat off).<br/><br/>Final Rating – 9 / 10. There is nothing more certain than the fact that I will be watching this many times in years to come. Loved it.<br/><br/>If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com"

","By now, if you're gonna see Up, you probably already have. For no good reason, I'd missed out on it utterly until this weekend, in August of 2010. I have watched it three times in three nights; I may watch it again tomorrow.<br/><br/>I'm not bothering with yet another synopsis - but here are a few subtle, exacting details that made Up outstanding:<br/><br/>The only intelligible word spoken by the young Carl, perfectly summing up the frisson of the earliest stage of his acquaintance with Ellie - that dazzling light like sparklers on hi-def video - was a simple, ""wow."" The thing is, you'll probably have to go back and watch it again, convinced by the fluency of the sequence, that he'd been conversing normally with her the whole time.<br/><br/>The first sight of the massive balloon array did NOT follow a sequence showing Carl staying up all night planning, diagramming, building, testing (a la the bird construction in A Bug's Life), set to Raymond Scott-ripoff clichéd planning/diagramming/building/testing music - it was just sprung, dazzling and beautiful, with almost no warning (other than the quick sight of the empty helium tanks on his front lawn and the knowledge that Carl had sold balloons as his work).<br/><br/>The iridescent feather-ruffle - quick, over-and-done-with and not to be repeated - in Kevin's first scene. Also, Kevin's tendency to direct a single round staring eye towards whatever she was paying attention to, instead of facing it beak-on for a two-eyed gaze. This is just,... right. Also also, Kevin's consistent doting embrace for Russell, grudging beak-pat for Carl and scolding squawk for Dug. Okay, just about everything about Kevin.<br/><br/>Carl slapping the frog like a snooze button.<br/><br/>The incidental dog-dialog shortly after Muntz first clears Carl and Russell as friends - ""I like you temporarily."" ""Oh, you DO smell like prunes!"" - and their persistent labeling of Russell as a ""small mailman.""<br/><br/>But to get back to my summary title - the whole treatment of floating the house with balloons *and then following through with the logical upshots of it and being pretty deadpan about the enormous ridiculousness of it* is reminiscent of '40s/'50s science fiction, when there was a sense of wonder. There's SO much good about Up."
"geniuskentyk-1","10","1","2","9 July 2010"," UP lives UP to the Pixar hype!
","Pixar always makes amazing films, like Wall-e, Ratatouille, or The Incredibles. The ones that aren't amazing are usually pretty decent, like Cars or A Bugs Life. Finding Nemo has always been my favorite because of how great the story was, the beauty presented in the movie, and the variety of characters it had. Up has two of the three things Finding Nemo has – Beautiful scenery and a wonderful story. Up's story isn't as smart or complex as Ratatouille or Finding Nemo, but it's still entertaining and fun. Up doesn't have that many characters, but it is Pixar's most emotional movie to date.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes of Up will make you want to cry. It sure made me want to give up my god-like manliness. Those that don't give in to Up's emotional beginning don't have a heart. I like how the story isn't all about Carl (the old guy) and his sad story. The movie sheds some light on the other lead's (the little kid, Russel, who accompanies Carl. He also happens to be Asian!!) background. Carl is mourning his wife, while the film briefly explains Russel's issues with his father.<br/><br/>Although there wasn't a variety of characters in the movie, there was still a whole bunch of dogs, a colorful bird, and another old dude, who happens to be the villain. The dog, if you've seen the trailer, is Dug. Dug is a very cute, playful, and loyal dog, who appears to be a Lab. Kevin is a beautiful female prehistoric bird that the other old guy, Charles, is searching for. The movie is fun because it offers so many laughs from the four characters of Carl, Russel, Kevin, and Dug. Charles, however, is a different story.<br/><br/>Charles Muntz is Carl's childhood hero. He's a famous explorer that, about 70 years ago, discovered the bones of some kind of bird that no one has every seen before (we, the audience, know that it's Kevin's race). Scientists claim that Charles made up everything, so Charles swore that he would find a living specimen. This is where Kevin comes in. Charles spent the rest of his life trying to capture Kevin, and when Russel and Carl grow fond of Kevin, the two parties are at an opposition. Now, Carl finds his childhood hero trying to kill him.<br/><br/>I respected Charles and his character in the movie, but I soon grew intolerant of him. I understand that he spent his life trying to capture Kevin, and it's his passion. However, Charles becomes an asshole to the other characters when they get in his way. Charles even endangers a little 7-year-old boy, Russel, just to get what he wants. By the end of the movie, I felt that Charles got what he deserved.<br/><br/>Up is the best film I have seen all year, and is the only movie so far of 2009 that I've given a 10 out of 10. I can't think of any animated movie, or live-action, that has been as emotional, sad, funny, and charming as Up has been. I also loved the animated short film that appeared before Up, called Partly Cloudy. I liked how the short film kind of has a similar setting as Up, and I think that Partly Cloudy has a story that Pixar could actually make into a feature film. One think that disappointed me at the theater, though, was the fact that the trailer for Toy Story 3 wasn't shown. Every Pixar movie has a teaser trailer of the next movie that's going to be released, so I kind of felt cheated. Even though I saw the trailer for it already, I still would have liked to see it on the big screen, and also for everyone else in the theater to know about it."

It's all refreshing. Simple stories. So simple, yet powerful. They create memories... no... they become a part of our memories as we experience them. The animation, the dialogs, the plot twists, the texture and the special effects brings life into each character and reality to the background portrayed. <br/><br/>And, as I watched Up, I can imagine the hard-work, dedication and love put into this masterpiece. The movies before Up I keep them under the categories of comedies. But, Up is an exception. First, this movie is a drama, then it is a comedy. Yes, my friends. It is a drama first. Though, Wall-E is cute and moving, Up is emotional. The movie is true to its very soul. This movie actually brought tears. At times it lit up a smile on our faces in a way that is very understandable. Add a bit of action, adventure and humor to this drama and the resultant movie is a true masterpiece. Pixar always manages to surprise and amaze us in a way no animation movie ever could. <br/><br/>As you can see that I am not mentioning even one scene from movie, it's because it is not a movie to be explained nor said, but truly a movie to be watched and experienced.<br/><br/>Pixar has done it again. The magic still exists. As always, Pixar rules the world of animation. <br/><br/>I give it a 10. No questions, asked. The movie deserves it totally..."
"TorontoLiver","10","1","2","22 June 2010"," Up is a truly magical, touching, and hilarious film. Pixar does it again!
","Up is one of those movies that's difficult to dislike. It's hilarious, beautiful, and it will make many cry with its touching story line! Pixar has an excellent talent. I absolutely loved it, and I don't know anyone who doesn't.<br/><br/>The movie is about Carl Fredricksen, a man in his 80s. He's a bit of a grouch, but still a good guy. At the beginning of the film, he's shown as a boy, about 8 or 9 years old. He stumbles into a house and meets the girl of his dreams. Her name is Ellie. She talks a lot and was a bit annoying, but she's still a good girlfriend. Then the film skips to a 6 minute montage, depicting their whole marriage. No words, just background music. This scene is very touching and emotional. It shows them getting married, and a lot of people at the wedding. They have an almost perfect marriage together. Then eventually Ellie starts to die in a hospital. The scene is very emotional and sad. Her husband is right by her side. Then eventually, she passes away. At the funeral, he seems to be the only one there. It was the end of the funeral only.<br/><br/>After Ellie's death, Carl starts to sink in a bit of a depression. A boyscout named Russell shows up at his house and asks him if he needs any assistance to earn his 'helping the elderly' badge. Carl refuses, and Russell sits on his porch, hoping Carl will change his mind. Then eventually two men show up, trying to put him in a retirement home. Carl asks for a minute, goes back inside his house, then releases thousands of helium filled balloons and they actually make his house float! Russell is still outside, and begs for Carl to let him in. He does, but is reluctant. Eventually the house flies to South America, a place Ellie always dreamt of travelling to. In South America, Carl sees the falls Ellie spoke about. He was so happy to finally be there, and he attempted to walk over to the falls. Carl and Russell walk into a jungle and a dog comes up to them and starts licking Russell. Carl doesn't like the dog, and tries to make him leave. Eventually, he agrees to let the dog stay. Eventually while in the jungle, Carl, Russell, and the dog meet a man who was Carl's childhood idol, Charles F Muntz, who turns out to be the antagonist! Charles was looking for a bird that Russell befriended and named Kevin. And Charles would not stop until he found the bird. When Carl and Russell refuse him the bird, he tries to get both of them killed! He has a legion of talking dogs, and the dog that found Russell turns out to be one of Muntz's dogs, and tries to defend Carl and Russell. The dogs aren't successful, and Charles's plan eventually backfires. He falls to his death at more than 1000 feet. Eventually Carl and Russell both travel back home and both rebuild their lives.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend Up to anyone looking for a good laugh, and it's touching (I cried). I mean, who wouldn't want to see a man with a flying house? But seriously, Up is one of Pixar's greatest movies, along with Ratatoulle, The Incredibles, an incredible film, and don't forget Toy Story. Up definitely soars. DON'T miss it!"
"jake-law123","8","1","2","8 June 2010"," The most emotional Pixar film ever!!!
","Not only is this the second greatest Pixar film aside from Toy Story, but its the most emotional. I was in tears on so many scenes that I had so much crust in my eye the next day. The music score is irresistible, the animation is unbelievably smooth, and the characters are hilarious. The plot itself is also quite clever. Carl Fredrickson is a 78-year-old man who sets out on a quest with an annoying little boy scout named Russell to Paradise Falls in South America, the place of he and his deceased wife's dreams, until they encounter a giant but extremely rare animal hunted down by a famous hunter, which causes problems. Although plot may seem to be falling at times, it kicks itself right back up, with clever scenes, following the ridiculous occurrences. It all fits well as can be. Similar to other Pixars, with more emotionality. Absolutely fantastic! The perfect film for kids and adults."

","The premise of the film is excellent - we all dream about embarking on the adventures of our lives. The first 20-30 minutes of the film are intriguing and not at all predictable. They introduce the characters - quite lovable - and raise one's expectations. Unfortunately, the film ""degenerates"" in the usual cartoonish thrills with good guys fighting bad guys on the edge of a cliff or last minute (very predictable) rescues. This run-of-the-mill Disney/Hollywood action is only interrupted towards the end when the film remembers that it has an idea and that it needs to convey a message. It reveals what our true ""lives adventures"" are; this part and the beginning of the film earned the 7 stars from me. Well, I guess Pixar needed to include all the cutesy stuff and the nail-biters to make the millions at the box-office. Too bad."

","The word on the street was that Pixar's latest finally showcased the true potential 3D has in the movie market. Now we aren't talking about the gimmicky extra dimension you find at studio theme parks in the U.S. or in those schlocky horror movies like My Bloody Valentine and The Final Destination - whose sole purpose are to make you duck and weave as things are swiped and hurtled at you - the third dimension here would add depth to each and every frame like never before seen. The word on the street was right. There is nothing cheap or sore on the eyes here, just subtle 3D that supports, not replaces, a worthy tale. If this is the direction that 3D is heading in, then I am very excited indeed.<br/><br/>Pixar (now owned by Disney) aren't the leading company in animated movies just because of the visual benchmark they continually set. They understand that the story comes first and without it the breathtaking imagery will mean next to nothing. With Up we have an endearing yarn about following your dreams before it is too late, which is genuinely moving for the most part, but it seems to steer into adult territory a little too often. Don't misunderstand, this is a truly wonderful story and it is nice to find a 'kids' movie that isn't afraid to make the audience, both young and old, think, however it could have used a lighter touch to get across the same message. An extra laugh here and there would've been welcomed too.<br/><br/>We have seen and loved a toy cowboy and spaceman, the last robot on earth, a clownfish and an ugly green ogre yet Carl is one of the most unlikely protagonists to feature in an animated family movie yet: a grumpy old man. However it is a breath of fresh air to see this square-jawed, button-nosed man in his seventies lead the way in a world that inhabits talking dogs and a female exotic bird named Kevin. His offsider, the loveably pudgy Russell, almost steals the show though. His bumbling voice and priceless facial expressions pave the way to majority of the laughs and subsequently ensure his escapades are the most enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Toy Story or Finding Nemo this is not.

This is one of the best films of the year and puts live action films to shame.<br/><br/>Carl begins as an adventure-loving boy whose childhood friendship with a girl, Ellie, grows into a marriage as adults and a dream to visit their ideal destination, Paradise Falls in South America. Later widowed, Carl becomes a crusty, elderly man who longs for escape. In time, his neighborhood is transformed into an urban development, and one fateful day with the threat of being committed to a retirement community, he takes his house on a bold, unlikely trip by balloons through the skies to South America. Unfortunately, he discovers an accidental passenger in the form of a Boy Scout named Russell who is looking to get his final merit badge by helping a senior citizen. Carl must make a momentous decision that changes his life and affects Russell. Their joint flight arrives somewhere in the vicinity of Paradise Falls. Along the way they encounter an unusual, giant bird dubbed Kevin and a dog named Dug whose thoughts are vocalized through his special electronic collar. This motley group encounters a mysterious, dangerous presence that threatens them and jeopardizes Carl's journey to his final destination.<br/><br/>Pete Docter (Wall-E, Toy Story) and Bob Peterson (Finding Nemo) bring their story and screenplay talents to the fore as co-directors. It's really a story about unfulfilled, broken dreams and things left undone, and the spirit and drive to recapture those feelings. The film begins with a subplot involving the friendship and growing romance of a young Carl and Ellie who share a passion for life and adventure. The imaginative vignettes tell a complete love story in an opening montage that ends as our film is only beginning-wow! What makes this film head and shoulders above most animations is its poignant confrontation of life's ups and downs. It's about life and death told in terms that are not disingenuous. In the grand tradition of Disney classics as Bambi and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, movies about finding a safe place from danger are at the core of children's animation, and this film plays on that tradition. The novelty here is that the lead character is elderly. There is a sense of The Wizard of Oz in its otherworldly journey of discovery and camaraderie, and even the climax smacks of Saturday morning cliffhangers. A nice change of pace is the lack of contemporary, inside jokes or puns based on pop culture that are staples of such Dreamworks hits as the Shrek films. The situations here are organically amusing from natural conflicts and plot.<br/><br/>Carl (voiced to perfection by Edward Asner) is a mean, bitter soul who rediscovers his innocence and humanity through Russell, who in turn discovers the safety of a nuclear family with Carl and some unlikely companions. Kevin is cute, emanating amusing sound effects and body movements without uttering a single line of dialogue. Dug is a riot as the misfit dog whose heart of gold is matched by his incessant habit of having his 'talking' interrupted at any moment by a sudden spasm of posturing and shouting, ""point"" or ""squirrel""! It's a hoot. Christopher Plummer is effectively sinister as a blast from the past. The only criticism of the movie is minor at the end when we are not quite sure about Russell's parents and how much they are part of his life. John Ratzenberger's (Cheers) streak of doing a voice in every major Pixar release is intact.<br/><br/>The computer animation is so good, that anything not human looks like a picturesque postcard. When Carl's balloons sprout above his house, we admire their stunning, vibrant colors. Interesting uses of cinematography are employed as if this were a live action feature. The final image is ironic as it is iconic, a fitting end to a fairy tale.<br/><br/>This one ranks highly alongside Pixar favorites like Finding Nemo and Wall-E. Quite possibly, adults may find as much (if not more) to enjoy in this story. It's amazing that a modest story featuring a kid and old man told with conviction and skill is one of the best films of 2009."
"refresh_daemon","8","1","2","2 August 2009"," Great film, but some of the more mature themes might fly over kids heads (in a balloon house nonetheless)
","One day, Pixar might make a film that will just fail to be decent. Fortunately, Up is not that picture. While the story is a little fragmented, this still remains a marvel of animated storytelling that continues the Pixar legacy of releasing solid 3D animated films.<br/><br/>The story begins with Carl as a child and we quickly watch his relationship with Ellie, through its various phases, through its untimely end. And then we pick up again as Carl decides to make his late wife's dreams come true. He launches his house into the sky via a ton of balloons, but manages to pick up a young Wilderness Explorer named Russell and then his goal gets derailed from there. Along the way, we meet a few other kooky characters, hilarity ensues and we end on a nice note. First of all, I think Up contains some of the most mature themes and story elements of all of their films so far, especially as we watch Carl and Ellie's life together in fast forward. I don't know how much children will fully comprehend what was going on, but despite the brevity, I still found some of the moments to be borderline tearjerkers. One downside to the story is that it's essentially fragmented and requires that ""life with Ellie"" at the beginning, but overall, the ""quest averted"" concept works very well to help bring out Carl's character. Russell does cross into the land of affably annoying and at times it's difficult to retain sympathy for him due to all the trouble he causes, despite his innocence.<br/><br/>The art is pretty classic Pixar, clean with lots of attention to detail and the animators definitely display their considerable skill in getting the characters to display various degrees of emotions. Voice actors do a great job with their characters, even the rather simple characters. Music is used well, even if it's not hyper-memorable.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Up falls into line as a good Pixar film, just under the tier of great Pixar film. Of course, a good Pixar film tends to mean a great film otherwise and I won't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. 8/10."
"Polaris_DiB","9","1","2","25 July 2009"," As their techniques improve, they maintain the same level of quality
","Pixar's first venture into 3D is just about everything you would expect of it. Beautiful, gorgeous, colorful, and all that and a story too. A story full of lovable characters, adventure, and a gruff ol' fart. Everybody loves gruff ol' farts, especially those that have hearts.<br/><br/>Some stand-outish things: 1) Whoa. Dog character dialog that sounds exactly like how you'd imagine dogs think.<br/><br/>2) Whoa. Animated blood. Pixar truly pulls no punches.<br/><br/>3) Whoa. One of the saddest cartoon deaths since Mustafa went down in Lion King.<br/><br/>4) Whoa. What a tear-inducing ending! 5) Whoa. That scene when he looks through the adventure album again and discovers something new hit ya right in the heart.<br/><br/>Make no doubt about it, whether I have kids or not I'm saving all Pixar productions to be watched over and over again. Nobody I think in the history of cinema has had such regular and trustworthy output, especially for movies that are aimed at children.<br/><br/>There is one thing. As their animation has gotten more and more detailed, the character's faces have started looking more and more marshmallowy and plastic, devoid of quite the amount of detail put into, for instance, the millions of leaves in the background. This time you get to see Carl's face get all scrubbly and patchy as he doesn't shave for a few days, but the kid still looks like a plastic lollipop. I'm worried that, although they've gotten to an almost unthinkable level of detail in movement and environment, that Pixar isn't much interested in putting more dynamism into the faces, which still move roughly the same way they have for several years now. This type of thing wouldn't even be noticeable if it wasn't for the constantly improving level of all of the rest of their work. That said, like always, this is merely a nit to pick and not something that it ruinous or damaging to the fun and heart-filled Pixar experience. They are still, as far as I'm concerned, reigning kings of quality CG children's animation.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"MartianOctocretr5","8","1","2","19 July 2009"," Emotional and exhilarating
","The opening sequence is the most powerfully emotional image in a long time; for any genre of movie, let alone an animated family film. It does bring a tear to the eye, and may be too sad and intense for children to take. Taken at its intent to show a once happy man's loneliness as a foundation for the story line that follows or taken as too strong a message will probably determine if you like this movie or not.<br/><br/>I did. The central character, Carl, is a very likable guy, and can be sympathized with immediately. The boy scout kid represents what Carl feels he has lost, and the adventure is his effort to reclaim it. There's a great feeling of freedom and escape when the house zooms out to the sky, and an eagerness to see things along with this good man as he embarks on his journey.<br/><br/>It's a great ride, both literally and figuratively. The visions of the animators of what the world looks like from this unlikely dirigible is authentic, beautiful, and inspiring. Colors are used vigorously and with astonishing precision. The overall look of the film is simply wonderful. The enormous Grand Canyon like precipices in Carl's South American Shangri La type destination almost appear as a dream scape. One example of the creative imagination in the movie is when the hero carries a giant object along, strapped to his chest--I hope I get to do that one day.<br/><br/>As for characters, most are fun although not always essential. The dogs and their human-like gifting is the stuff of great humor. The mythical creature was a nice touch. My only criticism of the movie would be the choice of villain. Someone who should have been a fast friend for Carl since they think the same way is depicted as vengeful, bitter, and vicious. It was too pessimistic a choice; a longer look would have provided a more logical bad guy.<br/><br/>In summary, some visions are very strong emotionally, but the final product is another fun and exhilarating triumph for Pixar."

It was adorable, funny, and cute. I really disliked how they showed dogs falling to their deaths or very serious injuries.

His adventure is interrupted by a young boy scout who just happened to be on the porch when liftoff occurred and thus the duo head to a new continent together. Excellent achievement in every way imaginable as Pixar once again outdoes itself with a wondrous cinematic technological achievement. The story is outstanding early and then stays strong in spite of its second act (which prominently includes a paper thin villain who has exiled himself since the 1940s because he is trying to catch a rare animal with a pack of dogs who wear collars which allow their barks to be translated to English) which wavers a bit, but still comes through by the finale. Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer are the most noteworthy voices found within. Another computer-generated gem of outstanding film-making. 5 stars out of 5."
"isabelle1955","Null","1","2","1 July 2009"," Pixar take animation to new heights
","Up is fabulous, and I love Pixar. Were it not necessary to submit at least 10 lines to IMDb, I'd leave it at that and leave you groaning at the terrible pun above! <br/><br/>As with WALL-E last year, it's taken an animation studio to give us an object lesson in story-telling and empathy. When did you last see a mass audience film featuring an old person and a boy scout? And enjoy it? Up tells the tale of seventy eight year old Carl who always wanted to travel to South America with his wife Ellie to find their hero the missing explorer Charles Muntz, but life kept getting in the way and Carl and Ellie never made it before Ellie died. With his beloved wife gone, and their home threatened by redevelopment, Carl ties thousands of balloons to the roof, and takes off for South America anyway, taking along an unlikely accidental stowaway, the intrepid scout Russell. Up is the story of their adventures. <br/><br/>The story features a pack of dogs that have been given voice by the wicked Muntz, by way of collars containing technological wizardry. But the dogs are still dogs, not too cutesy, and are interested in doggy things like squirrels. In fact, one of the best gags in the movie is the sound which emanates from the voice box of the most macho hound, the Alpha dog who sounds like a diver on helium. What Pixar are so good at, is eliciting the audience's sympathy for the characters without drenching the movie in the over wrought sentimentality so often used by Disney. We are allowed to listen and observe, and reach our own level of sympathy and empathy, rather than being hit over the head by unbearable cuteness – the dogs being a case in point. <br/><br/>For me, Up is not quite in the same class as WALL-E which I adored, hence my score of nine out of ten rather than ten out of ten, but for script, direction and technical brilliance, it's the best movie I've seen so far in 2009."

You feel the joy that Carl feels when he was with Ellie, and you feel the pain that he felt when she died. By the end of the sequence, I was in tears.<br/><br/>The film is truly hilarious. Pixar knows how to make a funny movie. Kevin was awesome. Dug was especially funny though and had you laughing every time he opened his mouth.<br/><br/>""Up!"" is truly, truly beautiful.

The closest I can think of is silent film, which also used minimal dialogue. I was very impressed, even as I was watching, to see how much the animators were able to convey, and the depth of the material. A couple of very challenging life events are addressed, in ways so graceful and subtle that one could not take offense or decide that the subject matter was inappropriate for a children's film or an animated film. I was fully engaged for this sequence, and ready for more. The opening is capped by a lovely, colorful, effervescent scene depicting a house taking flight. After that, the movie was still good, but it didn't engage me as much."

","The Incredibles is one of my favorite movies of all time and I really enjoyed most of the other Pixar movies. However, I am one of the roughly 3 people in the world who didn't like Wall-E. And I was not all that impressed with Ratatouille. After being let down by those two recent offerings I went into Up a little skeptical. My faith is renewed. Walking out of Up I felt the same joy that I did walking out of Finding Nemo or Toy Story with one distinct difference: I felt like the target audience was different for Up than for all other Pixar movies. All previous Pixar films left me with the impression that they were created for kids, but not just for kids. They could, and were, appreciated by all generations despite having kids as the target audience because they were so finely crafted. For me, Up has the same characteristic of being enjoyable to all ages, but I really felt like it was targeted to adults. The themes and issues, while appealing to kids, will resonate more strongly with adults. The format and content were definitely kid-friendly, but I hope the animated style doesn't dissuade adults from going to see it regardless of whether or not they have kids with them. It is truly a poignant and fun movie for everyone."
"honorhorror","8","1","2","14 June 2009"," ""There is no value without sentimental value."" And that's the Pixar value.
","Saw it in Bangkok in 3D, found it overwhelmingly touching for a cartoon. If the movie can keep you concentrate on its sentimental side for the whole 2-hours ride, it surely can make you think it's the best animated film ever made(as currently at Top 18 of IMDb Top 250). <br/><br/>The film doesn't falls short in technical aspects. The characters, objects and everything are animated in a way that they're not bound by the physics rules. The scenes are not so different from a combination of The Incredibles and Cars, but they are assembled professionally and made their own credibility. You can prematurely conclude that a movie casting an old fart as the main character may not be vividly colorful, but that definitely is wrong. You will find the color of good old days' memory, color of freshness and color of life in Up, and you don't have to try to get it.<br/><br/>The story, basically the same formula implemented by Pixar, has indeed succeed again. After Wall-E and Up, we can safely say that, there are not any common senses that Pixar dare not break. So don't argue about how many balloons can bringing up a house, or how was the house floating so steady without proper operation, or how did another old fart get the technology of a dog voice box after locking himself in mountains half a century. Just sit and take it for what it is and enjoy. Family ingredient is the true star of Up, which took me to tears twice in the first 20 minutes. If ever you get a stubborn but loving family member, you will cry too. And after all, it's the sentimental value that saved its climax and ending from being a run-of-the-mill fun.<br/><br/>However, there is always a however. Since Pixar made Wall-E, Up will not escape from being compared to Wall-E. The screenplay of Wall-E totally blew me away from beginning to the end, but Up's energy is halfway leaking like the balloons on the house. The fist act, so touchingly executed, totally promised too much for the rest of Up to bear. After Charles became a menace, the movie became predictable at all. You can tell the bird tried to escape but failed, the old man has to struggle between his house(a symbol of all the sentimental value summed up) and the righteousness(saving the bird), you can also tell what choice he's gonna make and how he's gonna overcome his own issue. It's also obviously rigid that the writer tried to combine old Carl's emotion breaking through and the rescue mission. At last, it's sad for me to find it predictable because it's like suddenly waking up from a beautiful, touching dream.But, this doesn't prevent the whole cinema from laughing through the movie and appreciate the efforts makers put in it. This is still, a great film in every aspect.<br/><br/>You definitely need to bring your family to it. The children will learn, the elders will sigh and sob, and all of them will enjoy. Sometimes it has a darker and heavier undertone than Wall-E, but the final result is still as up-beating as a balloon.<br/><br/>8.5/10 A fierce competitor in Oscar, but may be beaten this time."

","While I didn't find this nearly as impressive as Ratatouille or Wall-E, Up was still a quality Pixar product, and a creative, if slightly pandering animated film. The animation, as to be expected, was stunning. The character design and ballooning portions of the film were exceptionally crafted. The story, however, was lacking. The first 30 minutes were perfect, exuding a level of maturity I didn't expect from a Pixar film. With minimal dialogue, the expressive cinematography was emotionally effective, reminiscent of the best moments in the nearly silent Wall E. The summation of Carl's life with his wife was absolutely beautiful. It is truly one of Pixar's finest moments, and one of the best scenes of 2009 thus far. Once Carl's journey got underway, however, the film took on a far younger sophistication, with cutesy side-characters and inane slapstick moments thrown in to keep younger audiences awake. Kevin the bird was especially annoying. On the other hand, the dogs were hilarious and creatively crafted, garnering some of the best moments in the film. Overall, I thought UP was an enjoyable, if somewhat underwhelming film that could have been so much more if it didn't noticeably pander to younger audiences. Even so, Pixar's heart is always in the right place."

","Yet again, and why are we still surprised at this?, Pixar has dazzled and amazed all of us who believe that movies have the ability to rise above mediocrity and simple-mindedness no matter what genre. Gradually, these genius computer animators have grown more mature in their writing, bringing alive characters that perhaps kids would like but adults would almost certainly love. It seemingly started with Ratatouille, but these elements were evident even in Finding Nemo or The Incredibles. Here, it all comes together in an incredible array of sparkling animation and vivid storytelling that will show audiences once again that Pixar has a monopoly on animated films.<br/><br/>There are sequences done here that no other studio would dare touch, much less for an animated movie (consider the silent sequence depicting Carl and Ellie's life together). But, Pixar is so far above the average and ordinary, they dare to dream and tell the story in a way so different and more effective. Our hero here is Carl Fredrickson, a 78-year old retired balloon salesman who has lost his wife of many years and is feeling the effects of pressure on elderly people by the world. He decides to pay tribute to his wife by attaching thousands of balloons to his house and float away to Paradise Falls, a secret place in South America he and his wife vowed to go to one day. However, things happen, such as an ambitious 8-year old boy scout trying to earn his final badge stows away and they find a giant, exotic bird named Kevin, and a dog that can talk named Dug. The more I think about this story, the more I like it. For my taste, it doesn't reach the magical levels of Wall-E, Ratatouille, or the the original classic Toy Story, but it pulverizes movies made for the pop culture crowd like the Shrek movies, Ice Age, and Monsters vs. Aliens.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest asset to Pixar is Disney, which gives them a seemingly unlimited amount of resources to create worlds that are wondrous to experience. Every single one of their movies are at the top of computer animation for that time and this is no exception. The color palette which director Pete Docter is working with exceeds all levels of imagination and makes for a glorious adventure. And the characters are likable as well as not likable at some points along the way. A mixture of mirth and fantasy, Up is an adventure like no other. Kids may like it, adults will love it. And as for Pixar, there is only one direction for them to go and that would be... up."

","I saw UP today, and I was very impressed in how funny and realistic it was. It had original characters, and an amazing plot. I thought the film was better than always, and I really think Pixar is getting more and more original, and more funnier. The dog, Dug, or the bird, Kevin. Russel and Carl. All of them were voiced great, played great, animated perfect, and created great. <br/><br/>I also noticed Pixar is getting better with their audio and music. The sound effects actually made me wonder how they did it. It's a wonder how they do this so perfect.<br/><br/>UP was truly a great movie, and I recommend it to anybody!"
"Reel_starz","8","1","2","31 May 2009"," Pixar Does It Again!!!
","When I first saw the trailers for Up, I was skeptical. How interesting can it be to watch an old, cranky man and an impossibly optimistic, chubby kid float around in a house held in the air by balloons? As it turns out, it can be very interesting. The latest film from Pixar, the tenth in their roughly decade-and-a-half history of success, is, in parts, a comedy, an adventure, a buddy movie and a romance. Each genre is blended with the others to create a funny, entertaining and emotional story.<br/><br/>One of the first things that helps make Up so compelling is the pitch-perfect voice casting, particularly of the two leads. As the movie's protagonist, Carl Fredrickson, Ed Asner is delightfully gloomy and cantankerous, delivering his lines with just the right balance of sarcasm and sincerity to make the audience genuinely care and root for a character that would be otherwise extremely unlikable. Newcomer Jordan Nagai provides his character, Russell, whose peppiness could easily have been irritating, with energy, enthusiasm and enough feeling to prevent Russell from becoming a caricature. Of course, a brief cameo by Pixar regular and ""lucky charm"" John Ratzenberger, who is the only person to have been part of the cast of all ten Pixar feature films, as a construction worker doesn't hurt. Though he usually has minor parts, it would be very odd to see a Pixar film without him and his very distinctive voice.<br/><br/>Even if it had not been available in 3-D, the visuals in Up would still be stunning. Vistas of a jungle and waterfalls act as an almost jaw-dropping backdrop without detracting from the story or characters. The attention to detail is phenomenal. Even though by now, computer-animation is considered the standard, one cannot help but be amazed at how realistic the film looks. Perhaps even more impressive is how Up uses 3-D technology to its advantage but never allows it to overwhelm the plot, relying on it to immerse the audience in the film instead of cheesy, pop-off-the-screen gags. The color palette, alternately bright and more neutral, really adds life to the film. In fact, the animation and visuals are so well-done that it seems as though Up would be just as entertaining if there was no sound at all, only images.<br/><br/>But, of course, as great as the technology utilized in Up is, it's the story and characters that really engage the audience in a tender, emotional experience. What has distinguished Pixar movies from other animated films in the past is the way that it focuses on getting across a story worth telling instead of using the story as a vehicle to tell the jokes. Also, from Toy Story to Wall-E and Up, Pixar movies have appealed to both kids and adults. This appears to be the one of the only studios that realizes that animation is just another medium and that it can be used to tell grown-up stories with mature themes as well as tales that please kids. Though it has its share of laughs and jokes that will make people of any age crack up, the themes and messages that Up explores are decidedly serious. Unlike many recent animated films whose messages usually consist of ""Just be yourself"" or some variation on that, Up focuses on death, loss and, ultimately, the importance of moving on and not letting grief keep you from realizing your dreams. In a world of cynicism and restlessness, its plea for people to recognize life as an adventure, that you don't have to travel to far-off places to experience excitement or grandeur, is especially relevant and crucial. Up is about ordinary people that do extraordinary things in equally extraordinary places before realizing that it is often the simple, boring things in life that bring the most joy.<br/><br/>The only major flaw is the presence of a villain. Voiced by Christopher Plummer, Charles Muntz has little role to play than to provide an excuse for lengthy (albeit admittedly thrilling) action sequences. He feels unnecessary and in fact hurts the movie by forcing it into the typical villain-trying-to-kill-hero-for-no-real-reason formula. Though Muntz's canine sidekicks are colorful characters and sources of humor throughout, it seems as though the movie would have been better off without a central antagonist and instead used the relationship between the two protagonists as the main conflict. Knowing Pixar, they could have made Up just as entertaining and more innovative if the formula was ditched in favor of a more character-driven story about self-discovery.<br/><br/>However, despite that flaw, Up was a thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming movie with surprisingly likable characters. It had, not surprisingly, incredible animation that was used in support of a simple yet profound story and helped convey timeless messages of letting go and enjoying the ordinary and complex journey that is life."
"MatthewLong23","8","1","2","31 May 2009"," emotional and fun movie. only complaint was the dogs
","UP is a movie that both adults and kids will enjoy. It starts off very sad as you see the main character and his wife throughout the years and the hardships they have endured. The main character ends up loosing his wife and stays at home all day refusing to let people take his home until he injures a man who breaks his mailbox he made with his wife. As a result he is going to be sent to a nursing home but before they take him he unleashes balloons attached to his house, which lifts up his house off the ground so he can go to South America which him and his wife always wanted to do. Unbeknownst to him, a little boy was under the house at the time, who needs to get his badge for helping the elderly. The boy is funny and brings most of the humour to the movie but it's really about friendships and doing things you love. The annoying things I found were the talking dogs. It was funny with the dog they meet but having so many was just annoying."

Carl's wife is dead, but he raises his house up using thousands of balloons he has in his old days of selling them at the Zoo. He then goes Up!

","****THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*** <br/><br/>OK, so I know it was supposed to be a ""kid's"" movie, which is how most Disney/Pixar titles are advertised, I can't help but feel, after having taken my 3 1/2 y.o. to see it, that it had some pretty 'adult' themes that could have been better left out. And, before I'm besieged by folks saying ""IT WAS RATED PG!"", (of which I was totally aware), the film to me just seemed to have too many downers that supposed kid-friendly movies can do better or just without altogether.<br/><br/>First, the death of the main character's spouse-complete with hospital stay? Just a little morbid to me. Fortunately, my little guy was enjoying movie snacks through most of that, so he didn't focus on it then, but he asked about her later when we got home. And I had to pull out my best explanation of it for a preschooler.<br/><br/>Then, did anybody else think the 'talking' dogs were just weird? I found them creepy, and my son had a kind of 'head cocked to the side' look along with an ever-present hand on my arm whenever they showed up. Dogs in movies are supposed to be fun, so this one went way on the other side to me.<br/><br/>And, to have them chasing the main characters, along with a very strange bird, and a formerly, high-spirited, but ultimately insane and homicidal adventurer/poacher, just kind of gave it all a bit of a pall to me.<br/><br/>In Pixar's defense, they did add lots of colorful balloons, the requisite cute kid, a hopeful premise (letting go to truly connect), and a smiley ending.<br/><br/>And, my little guy was ecstatic to tell his Grandma about the 'old Daddy' (Fredrickson), the little boy, and how the 'storm made the pictures fall off the wall'.<br/><br/>So, I guess that's all that really matters!"

","UP (2009) **** (VOICES OF: Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, Delroy Lindo, Jerome Ranft, John Ratzenberger) Pixar continues their streak of instant classic animated fare outdoing themselves in arguably one of their very best: widowed codger Carl Fredricksen (voiced with gruff yet lovable zeal by Asner) finds himself being forced to vacate his life-long home and instead decides to (finally) go on a promised adventure to Venezuela by tying literally thousands of balloons to his home and aloft from its mooring sail away to Paradise Falls. Along for the ride is stowaway Russell (Nagai in an affective vocal turn for a youth), a 9-year old Wilderness Scout wanting to assist the elderly for his final badge of honor, much to Carl's chagrin. Written and directed with flair, style, humor and most importantlyheart, by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson (who provides hysterical voice work as Dug, a 'speaking' dog the duo encounter, who steals the movie), the film transcends all ages and truly inspires magical moments that will have you feeling like a kid again while crying through your laughter (the early montage of Carl and his wife-to-be Ellie is for the film vault that ranks up there with any Chaplin flick; silence is golden). My pick (so far) for Best Film of the Year and hand's down Best Animated Picture come Oscar time; one of the year's very best films and one you should see immediately!"
"plex","6","2","8","11 June 2009"," The 1st Pixar disappointment.
","While the 1st 25 minutes was superb in every way, the rest of the movie plodded along with a ridiculous and silly story line. The very poignant messages that were introduced in the beginning get overshadowed, and rarely revisited, by a bombardment of inane scenes and unlikable characters.<br/><br/>The kid scout was annoying and morbidly obese (and eats chocolate constantly) the idolized explorer is really a ego-centric and sadistic sort. There's next to no character development. Our lead character, well voiced by Ed Asner, although old enough to need a cane, magically runs and lassos his house for most of the film. There was no sympathy written in for the hunted big bird or the enslaved dogs. Somehow when the helium was running out and the balloon count was depleting, the house would later rise again. The story was inane. I would have preferred a more concerted effort in betraying the real messages of the film: Cherish your loved ones, live a full life, be cautious of false idols, don't be a slave to material possessions, help your fellow man, follow your dreams, live up to your promises- all the things outline in the 1st 25 minutes which all get abandoned for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The look was what we expect from Pixar- highly polished,detailed, vibrant and resolute but I would have liked to see more 3-D FX as there were no instances of things coming at you or from behind you, but the depth rendering was superb. Overall, I was bored and couldn't wait for it to end."

","First, the 3-D is flawless. The goggles are comfortable, even over glasses. The matinée audience I saw it with was full of moms and dads and hundreds of small children who ooh-ed delightedly when sparks flew off the screen during previews of coming attractions. (See it with children in the audience if you get the chance: they are absolutely rapt and spellbound and emotionally involved -- no fidgeting, no talking -- amazing, ""Up's"" effect on them.) <br/><br/>Though not essential for full enjoyment, 3-D really DOES serve this film and not the other way around. The process is breathtaking in the flight and action sequences. But it works surprisingly beautifully in the interiors and closeups as well. The rich details and depth of field, even in quiet moments, are jaw-droppingly realized.<br/><br/>But it's the story, not the effects, that keep even kids glued to their seats. The old adage about film making (""Show, don't tell"") has never been better served than in ""Up."" Or better visually designed and executed.<br/><br/>The voice actors are, to a man and a dog, perfect.<br/><br/>There's a reason the opening night audience at Cannes gave this film a standing ovation.<br/><br/>They knew, and so will you when you see it, why ""Up"" is an historic film achievement."
"aleexx_1920","10","2","8","29 May 2009"," up is pixar's magic
","OK I was never interested in seeing this film at all and it was never really on my list of what to see for the summer, I mean the trailers never did it for me. But branded by the name Pixar, I saw the movie and as much as I love Wall E, Up is not only my favorite Pixar film, but one of the best films I've ever seen in a while. This is how animated films suppose to be, I never really fancy Coraline and I like Monsters vs Aliens but that movie doesn't have as much heart as Up. From the start of this film I was emotionally captivated by the main character and even being an grumpy old man, he's still likable and that's one of the reasons I didn't want to see the film in the first place, because the star is an old guy. But don't think for once that the movie is just too emotional, it is also funny, Oh look another movie with talking animals, we got like about three movies like that in 2008, but Up has a talking dog (name Dug) like no other we've ever seen before, Its actually a very genius way of having a talking dog and I would imagine that's how a dog would talk in his mind and Dug's facial expression just makes you go awe and is funny at the same time. Listen people I know you all are looking forward for big blockbusters out now and later soon like Transformers and Harry Potter, but if you can't wait that long go and see Up, you will laugh, even some may cry and enjoy this great adventure movie that I thought before ""A house floating with balloons, LAME"",trust me you haven't seen anything yet and mark my words it will win for best animated film for 2010 Oscars."

Is this a kids movie or an Ibsen drama? The film starts with an unrelated short about storks bringing new babies. Already we are thinking, ""huh?"" Then the hero (a sidewalk balloon vendor) ages from 7 to 78. Touching but cartoonish. Scene change. Then he transports his house to South America with a mockery of an ethnic Cub Scout in tow, where they meet a giant bird. Then his childhood hero, an accused fraudster, who should be at least 120 by now, appears and turns out to be a creep.<br/><br/>All this time they never meet another human or animal, other than the villain and his dogs, despite that those forests would be teeming with tribesmen, lizards, other birds, and so on. Like a stage play in which a few characters do everything. <br/><br/>The cardinal sin: the characters never change. The old man and the demented pseudo Cub Scout emerge exactly as they were before. Pixar markets itself as being about great storytelling, not just animation, but here they goofed. You'll walk out wondering, ""what was that?"""

","The best (but not my favourite) Pixar release, UP made everyone cry in its first fifteen minutes with the magical 'married life' track guiding us through the life of Carl and his wife Ellie. Doug is a perfect comic relief character and a huge improvement on Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' Steve, a film which came out the same year. But the stark contrast between the full of life boy scout Russell and the old, deteriorating Carl which makes the movie so rewarding. The surprise villain Charles Muntz is also very good. The score is the highlight though, with swooping pianos and violins Michael Giachinno made us cry, laugh and cheer at the best Pixar score to date.

"Maserati7777","10","1","3","25 March 2016"," Excellent
","Up was a very beautifully made movie. So many emotions were shed while watching it, laughter, sadness, joy, anger even. For me the idea of the movie was truly original. When I first heard the synopsis I was surprised at how creative the idea was, wondering what Pixar could do with it. It's no secret that Pixar are great at taking unique, original ideas and making magic with them. And after so many previous hits I wasn't worrying about this one. Pete Docter and Bob Peterson both have good Pixar credit. And when I watched the movie some characters who would be annoying under a different animation studio weren't annoying at all.<br/><br/>Specifically to Up Pixar makes you care about a fictional, computer animated characters life story in literally 5 minutes. Of course they tend to do this is every movie they make, not in 5 minutes but overall. The music also was perfect for the movie.<br/><br/>It also had the distinction of being the first Pixar film nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars so you really can't go wrong if you decide to watch it."

"willcundallreview","10","1","3","5 November 2015"," An animation master-class
","Animation has had its marks throughout its short history before Up, you have Toy Story really being Pixar's massive contribution and in truth the introduction to computer-animated movies. Up I feel should be remembered for being a massive step in not only how animation is done visually, but also how animations can be compared on the same level as any other movie out there. This is truly a masterpiece, it builds itself into an emotional roller-coaster that also makes you laugh and really this is exactly how to do animation perfectly.<br/><br/>The story see's Carl Fredricksen an old man living by himself after his wife has died, that isn't where the plot picks up from though no, first it has to toy with your emotions and oh man the start to this film is tough to not feel something for. We see Carl's life and it has been good to him, it had its hard moments but most times he and his wife were extremely happy together, until she passed away and that is where the story picks up from. Carl made a promise to his wife to set up a house on top of a place called ""Paradise Falls"", a large waterfall somewhere in South America, and he is going to do it with balloons of all things. The film sways around, frantic at times and then sweet again and although that may not sound so good, it is in fact timed to perfection; the movie never loses momentum and keeps you watching from the first second to the last.<br/><br/>Pixar haven't just made a great film, they've made an astounding one and also one that very much deserved its Best Picture nomination at the 82nd Academy awards. Pete Docter directs this in a visually stunning way, he not only gets the most out of the rich colours on offer, but he also puts things in that look amazingly real. Jonas Rivera's script is fine as well and really lays the foundations for all the comedy side if this; this is really one movie where physical humour is entwined well with comedy in dialogue. The characters are fantastically developed as well with not only Carl well done, the young boy Russell is finely thought up as well, he and Carl create one of the best duo's in animation movies.<br/><br/>The way in which it also uses it's colour to bring out everything is even more impressive, the fine tones of the clothing, the beautiful animation style and the just general way in which this flows is beautiful. It is such a lovable movie as well, one that is maybe recommended for the kids but this is one for the adults too because this is one thing that can make anyone cry, whether that be by the funny bits in this or the heart wrenching moments.<br/><br/>So Up, one of the best animations ever, for sure. I don't really have a group of people I would recommend this to but I mean that in a way where I believe that anyone can enjoy this. It's one of Pixar's finest for years and shows they are one of the most consistent movie churners out there, producing film after film that are not only movies that are financially successful, but also one's with big hearts as well."
"bencsik-laszlo91","10","1","3","28 August 2015"," A touching tale with a strong underlying message
","Pixar laid the foundation of passionate animated film-making. This company clearly knows how to communicate with the audience and they have become experts in creating intelligent and multi-faceted movies. What makes their movies unique is the fact that they are able to entertain different ages with different tools. Furthermore, they always smuggle some sort of moral message into their films. From year to year they raised the bar and after Wall-e i wasn't sure they can make another animated miracle. They did.<br/><br/>The story was wondrous and imaginative at the same time. From the beginning till the end it completely captivated me and every event was spiced with an indescribable charm. The creators divorced from reality and they approached Up from another direction. A year earlier, the story of Wall-e tried to stick to reality, but now the main focus was on creating a some sort of tale image. I felt like i am reading a tale to my kids and that's the evidence of success.<br/><br/>Without doubt characters are the highlights of the show. Our two main hero are unique in their own way and they earned my sympathy pretty quickly. The bond that slowly grew between Carl and Russel was well structured and watching their relationship was a heartwarming feeling.<br/><br/>Carl was a quite and shy boy during his childhood, but the appearance of Ellie in his life gave a completely new meaning to everything. They perfectly completed each other and this proved to be the key of a lifelong relationship. We see their love story from the beginning till the end, even (for us) it only lasts a few minutes. This short montage is the perfect example of Pixar's success, they can picture emotions very gently with moments that don't require dialogs at all.<br/><br/>Enough hint was given to understand Russel's passion about the whole wilderness explorer thing. Child of divorced parents, a father who is too busy to be a part of his son's life, a kid who would like to have more attention and recognition from his father. He desperately tries to find a connection, a common point. A well-know sample, but it works.<br/><br/>Even the villain's actions were reasonable and understandable. A man who was tossed out by the explorer society looking for a chance to earn his respect back. An insuppressible rage that slowly consumed him and made him ""blind"". This huge obsession and the many years of loneliness affect his mind and made him what he is.<br/><br/>Without doubt my personal favorite was Doug. Besides Russel he was responsible for the most fun. He wasn't tried to be funny, but whatever he said always ended in something hilarious or cute. Even the fact, that creators tried to imagine what thoughts a dog may have was a brave and smart move.<br/><br/>As usual, both sides (kids and adults) receive the perfect amount of fun. The chemistry between the characters ensures funny situations and many other things (e.g.: dogs as assistants) serve as a great source of humor as well. My favorite line was: ""We're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly with no rap music or flash dancing"", but the ""smail mailman"" description was also hilarious and creative at the same time.<br/><br/>There is no Pixar movie without some moral message, this is their strongest feature and during the years they were able to develop this skill to perfection. The best thing is that Pixar doesn't directly throw these messages in your face. These are hidden among the events and can only be felt in tiny manifestations. This time, we face the importance of moving forward and finding a new purpose. This is a very important lesson that many people ignore to realize or refuse to face.<br/><br/>A movie's ending is always a critical point, closing can add or take away from the overall experience. Up handled this point very well. The moral message unfolds here, the final scene reminds us how important to move on and you must let new things happen to you. I am so thankful that i live in an era where smart and talented people are capable of dreaming and creating such beautiful and heartwarming movies like this."

If a movie can get an emotion out of you at ten minutes in, it's doing something right. Plus, the chemistry between a grumpy old man, and an annoying Boy Scout work surprising well. Just imagine if the Boy Scout asking the old man if he needs help, and the old man always replies, ""No."" Sure I do have one problem with it: Charles Muntz as the villain. I mean, does this film even need a villain?!! It could just be a film about an old man who tries to follow his dreams. Not to mention, the climax is pretty predictable. But, does it matter? The ending is perfectly fine as if there was no villain. Still it's amazing and everyone should watch it."

","I roll my eyes every time someone claims the first fifteen minutes of this film are all it has going for it, that after the silent montage it's just a banal kids' film about talking dogs and giant birds. For me, the greatest moments of Up (2009) happen long after the montage, for its power does not come from those five minutes, but from Carl Fredericksen's emotional journey.<br/><br/>Carl has lost his wife Ellie, whom he promised to one day take to Paradise Falls in South America. Life got in the way and he was never able to grant this wish during her lifetime. The whole film is about him getting past his guilt and grief, and learning to live again. The image of Carl dragging his floating house by the hose says everything about his inner state. Russell is not only there so the kids will have a character they can closely relate to; he's there to get Carl to come out and live again, to connect with people again. (He's also a lot like the young Ellie in terms of personality, just a touch less hyperactive.) To those who argue Muntz was a needless villain, I must also disagree. Muntz is a mirror image of Carl in that he is a bitter old man unable to let go of the past and live. Like Carl, he is a recluse, but to a much greater degree, and he is so disconnected from humanity that he sees every other person as a threat.<br/><br/>Yes, the scene with the dogs flying the fighter planes is silly, but guess what fellas: this is not gritty realism. This is a film where a man can use balloons to make his house fly to South America. Are we really going to loose it over a Star Wars homage that lasts less than five minutes? I feel this was more of a defense than a review and I apologize for not going over the gorgeous and vibrant animation, and the score. But I think this is one of Pixar's most powerful films and it deserves every ounce of praise it gets, no matter what the haters say."

","Up is a 2009 American 3D computer-animated comedy-adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by Pete Docter, the film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner) and an earnest young Wilderness Explorer named Russell (Jordan Nagai). By tying thousands of balloons to his home, 78-year-old Carl sets out to fulfill his lifelong dream to see the wilds of South America and to complete a promise made to his lifelong love. The film was co-directed by Bob Peterson, with music composed by Michael Giacchino.<br/><br/>Docter began working on the story in 2004, which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. The floating house is attached by a varying number between 10,000 and 20,000 balloons in the film's sequences. Up was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.[3]<br/><br/>Up was released on May 29, 2009 and opened the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first animated and 3D film to do so.[4] The film became a great financial success, accumulating over $731 million in its theatrical release. Up received critical acclaim, with most reviewers commending the humor and heart of the film. Edward Asner was praised for his portrayal of Carl, and a montage of Carl and his wife Ellie aging together was widely lauded.

","I've seen a lot of animated films and cartoons since 90s there is a long list that i can write that have my favorites or some of them that i just watched to pass the time but now cartoon network,nickelodeon and other channels that used to be in there prime are now finished they lost their taste even independent and not so famous companies that are making animation have surpassed them but when it comes to Disney & specially with Pixar i have came to a conclusion these guys don't make enough films but when they do they never compromise on the quality and knows what the audience want to be honest here if anyone can beat Disney and Pixar its themselves no other can do it you name the films Finding Nemo,tangled take classics from 60s but the case with up 2009 is not the same it is good but not a Oscar material.<br/><br/>The Plot:Carl is a 70 years old man after his wife dies when government force him to go to retirement home he embarks on a journey to south America with his house on balloons along with Russel a 8 years old boy.<br/><br/>The Cast:Edward Asner & Christopher Plummer & many others did nice voice acting.<br/><br/>Sure this film got its flaws,but the animation,dialog and story covers it up and when Carl lets go of his house is a lesson for those who don't want to move forward it was becoming a burden on him if you take out this scene the ending will make no sense the disappointing thing is this when i pick up a Disney film its exiting this one never made an impact maybe its the character designs or a lot of sadness thrown in i mean this is a type of a film that you wont remember for long you would just like to watch it once i did enjoyed it but at many places it seems dull.<br/><br/>Overall Up 2009 is a decent entertaining film but one a one time watch for some people it will be boring its not a masterpiece so keep expectations below my rating is 5/10."
"StevePulaski","10","1","3","20 November 2013"," Animation is no longer an airless timekiller and whoever still calls it one hasn't been paying attention
","The first fifteen minutes of Pixar's Up play like a full-length movie, featuring a reserved amount of dialog and a beautiful collection of clips that show a childhood friendship that amounted into a healthy, lasting relationship that ended in sadness. The relationship was between Carl, a shy young boy who idolizes the explorer Charles F. Muntz, and Ellie, an eclectic young girl who turns an old, rundown home into a headquarters for her club. The two meet out of nowhere one day, spark an immediate, offbeat friendship predicated on their love for exploring new places, get married, and endure decades of happiness before nature takes its course and Ellie passes away. Up details this in a beautiful, unforgettable fifteen minutes, leading to one of the most impacting scenes of animated emotion I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Carl (voiced by Edward Asner) is now elderly, living in the aforementioned rundown house that acts as an island in the center of construction in the big city. Suits try to get Carl to sell his home, but he refuses, until seemingly admitting defeat after an incident with one of the workers turns violent. Carl manages to strap thousands of balloons to his home and, utilizing a complex steering system pioneered by his wife for fun when they were kids, manages to lift the house from the ground and sail through the vast, open blue skies. His destination is Paradise Falls, located in Venezuela, an exotic land where him and his wife always believed they'd reside.<br/><br/>However, unwanted company accidentally hitches a ride in the form of Russell (Jordan Nagai), a totally harmless little boy scout anxious to obtain his ""helping the elderly badge."" Before taking off in house, Carl instructed Russell out of kindness to capture a beast that has been tearing up his yard, and Russell returns on Carl's front porch to state his success when he is unwillingly taken up, up, and away along with Carl's entire home. The two wind up sticking together on this trip, both getting more than they bargained for when a nearly extinct bird and an unconventional talking dog turn up in their path as well.<br/><br/>If there was ever a film to prove even the most hard-hearted that animation can be a wondrous medium that is capable of showing deep emotion, Up is the one. Writers Bob Peterson and Pete Docter (the Monsters, Inc. franchise) have successfully crafted Pixar's most adult script in terms of theme, focusing on the ideas of death, tribute, and closure, but capturing it in such a way that will not bore or miss the mark with young children. It wouldn't be far-fetched in my eyes to call Docter ""John Lasseter Jr.,"" since he possesses ambition akin to Lasseter's early animation days.<br/><br/>If anything, this is thanks to the Docter, who utilizes both his directorial efforts with Pixar to create some of their biggest films in terms of visual scope and range. Monsters, Inc. featured an unprecedented amount of visual flair and colorful content. Consider the scene that took place inside the factory of many doors the monsters could use to enter a young child's bedroom. In one shot, when Mike and Sully are desperately holding on to one door, hundreds, if not thousands of doors are shown in just one shot. In several shots in Up, hundreds, if not thousands of multi-colored balloons are shown, which I'm sure posed and animating nightmare for the production team. The film had such a lengthy production history, a list of ""production babies"" - babies born during the making of the film - reaches about thirty or so children.<br/><br/>The plot of Up works as a piece of escapism because it seems to be everyone's fantasy at one point or another - the fantasy being the ability to escape life's current issues by abandoning them entirely and having to answer to no one. In an essence, the film is a staple of what all animated film should include: lovable characters, a beautiful sense of adventure, the right amount of emotion leverage, extraordinary action sequences, and adult themes tackled in a digestible (but not condescending) way for young children. The revolutionary aspect of Up comes while watching this, realizing that animation is not just a timekiller for children, but an unbelievable art-form that will no hopefully no longer go shortchanged in discussions concerning cinema.<br/><br/>Voiced by: Edward Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and Christopher Plummer. Directed by: Pete Docter."

","So, I really loved this movie. This is my first review in this site, but I am so moved by this movie, that I forced myself into writing one. When I listened to people talking about this movie, all I got was ""You cry. A lot."" And I did. I cried throughout the movie. But then, I laughed a lot as well. The characters are beautifully portrayed, and there are some moments between them, that are really fun, as well as touching. If I have to describe the theme of the movie, I'd say it's letting go. Is it to spend some boring Sunday afternoon? I don't think so. I think it's full of meaning, beautiful imagery and intense music.

"asda-man","10","1","3","4 January 2013"," Soars past every Pixar film to date!
","You might think that from my summary that I hate Pixar films. The opposite is actually true, I love Pixar films, they're wildly original and inventive with brilliant, unforgettable characters and a narrative with heart. I've not seen a bad Pixar film yet (although I haven't seen Cars). I've been wanting to see Up for a very long time and finally my little (well actually, incredibly tall) blonde friend decided to buy it for me this Christmas in Blu-ray no less (he spares no expense!) and what do I find, after I had expectations as high as Carl's floating house? I find probably the best Pixar film ever! It's probably even the best animated film I've ever seen too. Up ticks every single box and more. It has a genius original plot, sensational characters, a huge heart, is absolutely hilarious and is also incredibly entertaining whilst balancing all of these things.<br/><br/>Up starts with one of the most touching flashback and montage sequences've ever seen. I can't think of a film that gets you teary in the first 5 minutes, but Up manages it. Whilst it didn't squeeze out a very small man tear, it did undeniably move me and also completely engage me into this old man's super sweet life. The character of Carl is so beautifully realised, as he clings onto the past and never having the chance to have a child, his only lasting aspiration is to go to Paradise Falls, where he promised to take his wife (Ellie) all those years ago. The trouble is that Ellie has now sort of become the house and so that obviously has to tag along too.<br/><br/>The image of the house floating off into the sky has already and rightly become iconic. It's a bizarre, yet weirdly awe-some sight and could be symbolism for getting away from a crazy world (like the escapism you get from watching Up!). Now, Carl isn't entirely flawless, he has a temper and there's this rather deep scene where Carl has to go to court after causing someone a head injury! He was also not very nice to a cute and hilarious boy, who happens to be a stowaway on Carl's house. However, of course by the end of this epic journey Carl begins to realise the greatest adventure of all is having a child, or a surrogate grand-child in this case. It's enough to produce tears and chills, seeing such an odd couple become so close.<br/><br/>The look of the film is nothing short of breath-taking. I saw Up in blu-ray and it's probably the best blu-ray I've ever seen and is right up there with The Dark Knight! It looks crisper than a Walker's factory and helps to show off the film's incredibly vibrant colours and imagination. The animation has such depth and detail, and the scope is so huge you can't help but feel transported to another world. And whilst the film can be wonderfully surreal (talking dogs flying aeroplanes anyone?) it never loses sight of its plot and characters. Now the characters are nothing short of genius. Dug the dog is an absolute hoot, and Kevin the bird is just as hilarious. Dug actually speaks like how you'd imagine a dog to speak, it's brilliant! The relationships between the colourful characters are also nothing short of touching and engaging. The theme of protecting nature is much more involving and less patronising than Avatar's attempt at conveying the message. The screenplay is full of wit and endless imagination which helps Up to become an instant classic. I was riveted by the grand chase scenes and profoundly moved by the slower, more character-driven scenes.<br/><br/>Up is the full package. It's a highly engaging and hilarious animation with a fantastic sense of adventure. The wonderful directing and screenplay will have you hooked on one of the greatest animated adventures ever filmed. It's perfect for children but also offers so much more for adults, as it boldly explores some heart-wrenching ideas and touching relationships. By the end of it I felt as uplifted as Carl's house! It's a tale for our times, a wonderful feat of the imagination and a refreshingly original tale. Pixar's out done itself again, but Up will be preposterously difficult to beat. Do yourself a favour and watch Up on blu-ray!"
"Desertman84","10","1","3","19 October 2012"," A Pixar Classic
","Up is a computer-animated comedy-adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and directed by Pete Docter. The film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen,voiced by Edward Asner; and an earnest young Wilderness Explorer named Russell,voiced by Jordan Nagai. By tying thousands of balloons to his home, 78-year-old Carl sets out to fulfill his lifelong dream to see the wilds of South America and to complete a promise made to his lifelong love. It was co-directed by Bob Peterson, with music composed by Michael Giacchino.<br/><br/>Carl Fredricksen is a 78-year-old balloon salesman. His entire life, Carl has longed to wander the wilds of South America. Then, one day, the irascible senior citizen shocks his neighbors by tying thousands of balloons to his home and finally taking flight. But Carl isn't alone on his once-in-a-lifetime journey, because stowed away on his front porch is an excitable eight-year-old wilderness explorer named Russell. Later, as the house touches down on the world's second largest continent, Carl and his unlikely traveling companion step outside to discover that not only is their new front lawn considerably larger, but that the predators therein are much more ferocious than anything they ever faced back home.<br/><br/>Funny and poignant and full of life, Up easily qualifies as one of the best computer-animated movies ever released.The pacing is perfect, the animation looks terrific, the emotional range is wide, and there are a few sly jokes you might not catch the first time around. That's okay; you'll want to see it a second time anyway.It was obviously another masterful work of art from Pixar, it is an exciting, hilarious, and heartfelt adventure impeccably crafted and told with wit and depth."
"thommy741","10","1","3","27 May 2012"," Maybe the best PIXAR movie to-date?!
","Although I have to admit that besides all my concerns at first, PIXAR movies tend to be the most amusing and lovable movies out there. Before I've seen this movie I've been only interested in thrillers, horror-blockbusters and action-movies. Since I've seen UP, I'm checking out every PIXAR production right in a movie theater nearby. Why? I was wrong! I was wrong about this cover, this house, this old man - EVERYTHING! I don't wanna spoil the fun watching this movie yourself but I dare you to: If you want to do your soul something good, you need to check this out. You will laugh, you will cry and you will feel with the protagonists - during the first 10 freaking minutes of the movie! Until the credits rolled - and I admit it like a bos.. ehm man - I cried.

"justin_wileman","10","1","3","29 March 2011"," A True Gem
","This is one of the most moving animated movies I've seen in a long time. I highly recommend it for both children and adults alike. It tackles some pretty heavy loss to the main character that will have you blubbering, but it certainly rebounds. It truly captures how heart wrenching the loss of a soul mate can be and how that pain can never completely heal. It shows however that a memory of a lost love can carry you through difficult times and how those memories can add a fullness to future endeavors. <br/><br/>Very Bitter Sweet movie.<br/><br/>Justin Daniel Wileman"
"htmidas","10","1","3","24 February 2011"," There are no bad Pixar movies
","Seriously, there are no bad Pixar movies. Sure, people pick their favorites and least favorites - I have - but even the ""last picks"" are fantastic. Up is no exception to this high standard.<br/><br/>I personally prefer to watch an hour and a half of beautifully executed character development than a neverending action sequence or special-effects-fest. That's exactly what Up is: a sweet, extremely touching, character-driven movie (with excellent Pixar visuals as a bonus). One of the biggest complaints I've heard about it is that it's boring, and I can definitely understand why some people feel that way. If you're not a fan of cute, and looooots of it, this probably isn't the movie for you.<br/><br/>That being said, find me someone who can honestly say they sat through the ""married life"" montage without (at least) tearing up. They get you surprisingly early on with the waterworks, and the rest of the movie is devoted towards watching Carl finally learn to live again without the love of his life by his side. I feel like a lot of this movie might actually be lost on the little kids who generally flock to Disney or Pixar creations; a lot of it is about accepting death and letting go of the past in order to love the present. (Hopefully!) there aren't a lot of little kids who fully understand the gravity of this film, but it's got some appeal for parents, and kids will be entertained by the humor and the closing scenes (there is a final action-based showdown, it's just not the focus of the movie).<br/><br/>Up is carried mostly by visuals and emotion, with dialogue less of a focus and more of a gateway to lead the audience into the heart of the film. (Again, if you're not a fan of such slow-paced means of storytelling, Up is probably not the best viewing choice.) Russel, Dug, and Kevin are all adorable and funny in their own ways. They and the ridiculousness of the basic plot (man flies his house to South America in a day using... balloons) bring some lightness to an otherwise emotionally heavy film.<br/><br/>Up is excellently crafted and extremely cathartic. If that's your kind of movie, go watch it - you won't be disappointed."
"mrtomclift","10","1","3","13 January 2011"," surpasses even WALL-E in terms of adventure, beauty and human emotion
","Pixar Animation Studios have always been in a league of their own, both in the quality of their animation and the superiority of their storytelling. It's almost unfair to compare recent kid's films such as Kung Fu Panda or Shrek - both of them decent movies in their own right - to the likes of Finding Nemo or The Incredibles, movies that put to shame anything being produced by rival studios. Then of course, last year, we saw WALL-E, a quantum leap forward from what was already a splenderously high level of standards. That film made me and many others reevaluate what a modern children's film could be, and left us wondering if Pixar would ever be able to replicate that level of success. Up is the film that proves not only that they can replicate that success, but better it. It is a film that blends the best parts of all of Pixar's previous films, and yet somehow manages to be utterly unique, and utterly wonderful. It is not only my favourite film of 2009, but my favourite Pixar film of all time, surpassing even WALL-E in terms of adventure, beauty and human emotion.<br/><br/>The story begins with a shy young boy, Carl Fredricksen, bonding with an outgoing young girl named Ellie over their mutual dreams of exploring the world. The pair fall in love, marry, and grow old together â€“ a journey that is outlined in a gorgeous dialogue-free montage near the beginning of the film. The way a lifetime of love is communicated so beautifully using just music and images in this sequence in awe-inspiring, and if I had one complaint of Up, it would be that after such a superb first act, the film never quite manages to reach such insurmountable heights again. But I wouldn't trade those scenes for anything in the world; the emotional effect that Ellie's passing has on both Carl and the audience is incredible, and within ten minutes of the film starting I literally had tears in my eyes.<br/><br/>Carl, now a seventy-eight year old widower, lives alone, filled with regret about having never travelled to South America with his beloved Ellie. But after a run in with the law leaves him facing life in an aged care facility, Carl decides to go the adventure he never had. In another one of the films stunning visual set pieces, Carl attaches tens of thousands of helium balloons to his house and flies off to Paradise Falls in the jungles of Venezuela. His sabbatical is somewhat complicated however when he discovers that Russell, a plucky ten year old wilderness explorer, has stowed away aboard his house. Without giving away too much of the story, the duo end up pitted against a villainous old explorer, humorous hi-jinks ensue, and with the help of this unlikely friend, Carl finally learns to overcome his grief.<br/><br/>The beauty of the animation in this film is simply indescribable. Gorgeous, stunning, mesmerising; I can throw around all the synonyms I want, but you truly cannot appreciate it until you see it for yourself. There are so many individual moments throughout this film that could be frozen, framed, and hung on the wall of an art gallery for all to see. But it's more than that. These aren't just empty pictures to be analysed; there is true feeling behind every frame. We feel as though we have been with Carl his entire life, experiencing each of his emotions for ourselves. Such is the level of storytelling in this film that two worn armchairs sitting next to each can be as memorable an image as the sight of a thousand balloons floating against the crimson backdrop of a rising sun.<br/><br/>Where I think Up truly trumps WALL-E is in its sense of fun. Say whatever you like about that movies stunning visuals and thought provoking themes, at the end of the day a lot of those things are going to go straight over small children's heads. While Up is undoubtedly as mature and intelligent a film as any of Pixar's previous works, it is also a rip roaring comic adventure that kids are going to love. Maybe you could argue that this film gets a little silly as it goes on, but I think it's ridiculous to hold that against what is, at its core, a movie for primary schoolers. With Up, I believe Pixar have found the perfect match of emotional maturity and light hearted entertainment, and because of this, kids who love this film when they're five years old are going to be able to come back in ten, twenty, thirty years and enjoy it all the more.<br/><br/>Up is one of those rare movies that can be enjoyed by everyone, be you young, old or in between. It is entertaining, with a great story, terrific characters and heart warming message. It is funny, and manages to be so without having to resort to flatulence humour or inane pop-culture references. It is moving, capturing the full range of human emotions with inexplicable ease and captivating grace. It is one of the most beautiful, memorable, touching films I have ever had the privilege of watching. That much, I can explain with words. But words, as this movie proves, can only do so much. So if you want to understand how I truly feel about this film, go and experience it for yourself."

","Up is by far the best Pixar movie released to date, and one of the best movies of the year. This film has it all, a great story, interesting characters, a good soundtrack, and great visuals. I watched this in 3D but I think it would be just as good without it because what stands out here is the heartwarming story and the relationship between the old and grumpy Carl Fredricksen and the young boy scout Russell. This movie really grabbed me by surprise, I didn't expect it to be so good, especially after watching the trailers. I thought Carl was simply an animated version of Clint Eastwoods character in Gran Torino. But in this film we really feel for the characters, the character development in this film is just brilliant. There is a scene at the beginning of the movie where there is no dialogue but we all understand what is going on and it is one of the most heartwarming scenes. The film also has several funny moments so there is a nice balance. This is probably Pixars most serious film, but at the same time it is extremely funny. You think Carl is finally fulfilling his lifelong dream when he sets on a journey to South America, but at the end you realize he has already lived the adventure of his life. Sometimes we are so caught up with reaching our dreams that we miss the adventure of the moment. Enjoy the ride even though at first you had different goals and dreams! A powerful and touching story which at the same time combines some very funny moments (I loved how they played with the voice of the Doberman). This is one of those rare films that is much better than the trailer makes you expect it to be. I know it is a little early in the year but I expect this film to be nominated for best picture. Yes, it is that good."

","Most reviewers who are ""guys"" in the true sense of the word will probably mention GPS, boy scouts or say ""SQUIRREL!"" or something like that about this movie. While those things are certainly in this movie and are funny plot devices, UP is, in it's essence, a love story told from a man's point of view. What a refreshing turn. In the first 3 minutes, every man with a shred of testicular fortitude is holding back a flood of tears. What transpires after that is wondrous.<br/><br/>Carl Fredricksen has turned into a crotchety old man because he has lost the love of his life, his wife Ellie. Throughout their marriage, life's most common problems has prevented the completion of what brought them together as children: building a home near a falls in South America. His grumpiness is confounded by the necessity of moving out of his; of their; home which is in the way of the wreckers ball. His undying love for her inspires him to finish what he believes is her life's desire. Along the way, near tragedy strikes, and in the process of choosing between what he believes SHE would want and what HE should do, he discovers that what she had wanted the most all along was what she had: a life with him.<br/><br/>He discovers inside himself, once again, what it was that fueled their love all those years: A good man, who can choose right over desire and not look away when what is before him doesn't fit his conceptions. He saves the day, of course (this is Disney, after all) but then the movie becomes even more magical and it even carries on into the credits: He takes his legacy of love for his wife and uses it to build a new life with a young boy who needs a grandfatherly figure.<br/><br/>I have not been so moved by a movie since ""Lion King"", which still rates as my # 1 animated movie ever and may be my favorite movie of all time. ""UP"" is a close second."
"domino1003","10","1","3","13 June 2010"," ""Up"" took my breath away!
","Pixar has had the magic touch ever since ""Toy Story"" was first released in 1995. Since then each film has made it's mark in cinematic history, each having a different feel and style, but leaving a lasting impression in a movie-viewer's heart and soul. ""Up"" is no exception. I laughed and cried (A LOT of crying, I'll admit)as I watched this incredibly heartwarming story.<br/><br/>Carl(Ed Asner)lives alone after his wife of many years has died. Forced to give up his home and move into a retirement community, he decides to run away...and take his house with him. His goal: To reach Paradise Falls in South America, where he and his late wife had always plan to go (And both their childhood dreams). With the help of a LOT of balloons, and the unwanted assistance of Russell, who is trying to get his badge, Carl gets to South America. He also discovers that Charles Muntz (Wickedly played by Christopher Plummer), a disgraced explorer from Carl's childhood is trying to capture a rare bird that will bring him fame and restore his damaged reputation. With the use of his talking dogs, Muntz will stop at nothing to reach his goal.<br/><br/>""Up,"" only the 2nd animated film to be honored with an Academy Award nomination (""Beauty and The Beast,"" another film that made me cry was the first)is a wonderful work of art. The animation style has changed since Pixar brought ""Toy Story"" to life. It's more realistic than the previous films that they have made. And as I said, it has a wonderful, magical story to it. Who hasn't wished that they can make a childhood wish come true once childhood has slipped away? It's great for all ages (Some parts make spook the little ones), and another Pixar classic. And I am not afraid to admit that I sat and cried all through the ending credits."

The dream of going to their hero's magical place kept them alive and through that difficult time.<br/><br/>During the next couple of moment after that you really got a good feel of what the main character drives to rig his house full of balloons.<br/><br/>I must say that if you have seen the teaser / trailers, you will be fooled watching this movie. The humorous / comedy aspect is there but not the main focus of the movie.<br/><br/>When he finally meets his goal of setting the house near the fall. He spots the end of the book his wife used to record all the adventures she had with him. Although very predictable but we loved it! Definitely 10 out of 10!"

","This is a masterpiece. This is the best animated film I've ever seen so far (surpasses ""The Incredibles"", ""Ratatoille"", ""Cars"" and probably even ""WALL-E""). There is nothing to complain about - great acting, story, voice and music.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with this movie is that in several places it is incredibly, insanely sad. It is certainly not a comedy (although it has a lot good funny moments), and probably is better suitable for adult audience. It is the 3rd movie that ever made me cry (and believe me, I'm not a ""soft"" person, but rather cynical guy that doesn't care much for other people), and the first one that managed to make me cry during first 15 minutes.<br/><br/>It is touching, it is perfectly done, but I still wished that things turned out better, straight from the beginning, and main characters fulfilled their dream together. But in the movie, things happen differently. In a sense, this is realistic."
"metal_man1789","10","1","3","18 November 2009"," Up and Over Every Expectation Imaginable
","Where do we begin with this one? How about returning to an era of voice-over work where the characters mattered and not the celebrity voices? How about the beautiful animation, from the shadows produced by the light in Muntz's lamp to the water running off of Paradise Falls. How about the most touching story imaginable? You know you've done a good job with your movie when a little animated couple make a nineteen year old boy tear up...and that's the THIRD time I saw it. I'll be downright angry if this does not win the academy award for best picture. Seriously, there hasn't been a better movie in 2009. And it's the best Pixar movie ever. I mean, WALL-E was the best animated film ever, so what's that tell you about this? UP has something for everyone. When was the last time a movie did that? Forget the awful 9. Forget the disappointing WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE. Even forget the sublime and darkly enchanting CORALINE. THIS is the ""kids"" movie of the DECADE. If UP is only Pixar's tenth picture, I can't wait to see what they'll come up with in the next ten years."
"beaconb","10","1","3","9 November 2009"," Too good to be true!
","I saw this with my family at the ""dollar"" theater a couple of days ago (actually the ""2 dollar"" theater now) Although no movie is perfect, I ranked this a 10 because I couldn't find anything wrong with it. In fact, I believe it is the best movie I have seen in the past couple of years! It is hard to believe that a few minutes of animation can make you cry! The humor is excellent as well, and of course, doesn't rely on the raunchiness of the R-rated comedies to get laughs. There are a lot of great messages in this movie that have probably already been discussed by others, so I won't get into it, but you do come away with a little better understanding of what is important in life. What is nice is that the messages are not left or right, politically speaking, but just plain human!"
"Igenlode Wordsmith","8","1","3","3 November 2009"," A sense of history
","A lot of people have written about the humour, excitement, sweetness, depiction of love etc. etc. of this film, and with most of that I'd concur; I want to write about the element I haven't seen mentioned much, and which I perhaps enjoyed and was impressed by the most -- Pixar's homage to the spirit of the past, right down to the authentic style of the vocals in the 'period' song that plays at the end of the credits. (Not just a bit of distort and crackle to make it sound old -- if anything, that's overdone -- but the singing technique and orchestration are spot-on for a pre-war popular record. Wish I could say the same for the rhymes, but 'adventure' clearly isn't the easiest couplet to complete..!) <br/><br/>By having Carl as the principal character and his adventures triggered by his childhood fantasies, Pixar have very cleverly contrived to have their cake and eat it: to produce what is basically a 'Boys' Own' adventure full of lost jungles, unknown species, biplanes and giant airships, mad scientific gadgets and a reclusive genius -- something out of the ""Eagle"" magazine, right down to its action climax -- and yet to set it in what is supposedly the modern world of its juvenile audience. The 1931 newsreel with which the film opens is wonderful pastiche (and was that a visual reference to ""King Kong"", as adventurer Muntz prepares to reveal his latest discovery?), the two children and their games bring the period to life as the real existence of people just like us without feeling in any way anachronistic, and then the segment that follows demonstrates Pixar's effective use and command of an even earlier idiom -- the fluent story-telling of the *silent* film era.<br/><br/>Too much has been written already on the impact and poignancy of this wordless love-story for me to be able to add anything to its praise. I would agree with the reviewer who wrote that it is very rare for films of any kind to depict the married love of adults, let alone to do it in animation so sweetly as this.<br/><br/>But actually, the moment when tears came to my eyes was not during this segment at all, but the moment when the house takes off and Carl makes his defiant adventure/escape... (Shades of the Crimson Permanent Assurance!)<br/><br/>I found most of this film very enjoyable indeed, especially the retro adventure feel and the dog psychology. What actually undermined it for me was not the surrogate-family-bonding scenario, which would normally have been anathema to me but is handled convincingly here, but the handling of the villain. Interestingly, reading comments on the IMDb boards suggests not only that I am not alone in this, but that the film's creators themselves weren't very sure right up to a late stage in production what to do with him -- the result is that the character, who could have been intriguing, is simply dropped into one-dimensional mode and wasted.<br/><br/>I would have preferred a treatment more like the ending of ""Ratatouille"" (and would have preferred a beginning to ""Ratatouille"" more like this!; and for this idiosyncratic reason alone, which did significantly affect my enjoyment, I have rated it down one mark from the level of 9 (for ""deeply moving and exciting"") that it would otherwise have scored on my personal scale. Both films still score by my standards very highly."
"unclepete","9","1","3","23 October 2009"," Beautiful, but it peaked too soon...
","There's no question in my mind that this was a sublimely wonderful film, and I hate to criticise it, but I had just one niggle - it peaked too soon! Whilst I've long respected the Pixar animators for their technical skills, it's their storytelling that I truly admire. Here, they excelled themselves. Within the first fifteen minutes of the film lies a contextualising montage. With almost no dialogue, and very little screen time, it told a story that ripped my heart out. All the adults in the theatre were crying. It was tragic and beautiful, and I'd place it as one of the best pieces of storytelling that I've ever seen on the screen, large or small.<br/><br/>The rest of the film was likable, with charming characters and a lovely whimsical plot, but no matter how hard it tried it couldn't take me to the places, emotionally, that that first quarter hour did. And I can't believe I'm saying this about a kid's animated movie! Wonderful work, bravo Pixar!"
"sibelian","Null","1","3","11 October 2009"," Up there with the rest of the Pixar masterpieces
","There's a difference between Pixar and most of today's movie studios that makes it stick out like a rose in a sea of sore thumbs. The difference is that the first thing they do their best to get right is the story and the first thing they do to get that right is to find the story's heart. There are a lot of clever movies, scary movies, exciting movies, silly movies and just plain bad movies out there released year after year, but Pixar goes for the heart every time and there's just no replacement for movies that want to speak to people's hearts.<br/><br/>The opening sequence in this movie is a series of images that another film-maker might have done as a series of flashbacks. It's a simple story of two people who have found that they must be near one another to be happy - true love. Where is true love in the other stories pumped out like mortar shells from the industry's product-connection and tie-in merchandise addled belly? It's rare these days. Sex, sure, flirtation, mawkish sentimentality, but love? 100 million stars for that sequence alone.<br/><br/>The rest of it had me howling with laughter, as usual they just don't seem to be able to put a foot wrong. Could Pixar be the greatest movie studio of all time?"

","We keep hearing 'Pixar does it again!' (and they do always do it again), but they really have touched a new high with Up. No one, and I mean no one can tell a story like the guys at Pixar (Toy Story, Incredibles, Finding Nemo, WALLE to name a few) and now Up. This has to be the best animated movie I have ever seen and one of the most romantic (yes, romantic!) movie ever made. Carl Fredricksen, the 78 year old (or in this case young) balloon vendor turns out to be the surprising hero of the act, where, among other things, he saves himself from all the things that were pulling him down because of the recent events in his life. He goes on an adventure, and boy, does he have one.<br/><br/>The movie is (due to the lack of a better word) awesome! The expressions, the dialogues and the timely and very aptly put humor along with extremely good direction and voice by the actors make this movie as good as any can be. (The background music at the beginning sets the tone for the whole movie) I can go on and on about this movie. But I'll shut up after saying just one more thing. If you haven't seen the movie, do it. If you have, watch it again.<br/><br/>Rating : 10/10"
"druid333-2","10","1","3","4 September 2009"," Chalk Up Another Winner For Pixar
","Since Pixar produced their first 3D-CGI (three dimension,computer generated image)short,an untitled experimental short of dinosaurs running across a vast field, they have managed to carve a niche in animated features (as well as some mighty funny & very well animated short films,as well). Now, Pixar proudly brings us, 'Up'. 'Up' is a tale of a young boy,named Carl Fredricksen,who just wants to follow in the footsteps of his hero,adventurer, Charles Muntz,and travel to South America to find a hidden waterfall paradise. The ensuing years manage to side track Carl's dreams (in a wordless montage that will go for the heart strings). Carl is now an old man (voiced by veteran actor,Ed Asner),who's home is scheduled to be demolished to make room for apartments,and seems doomed to spend the rest of his life in a nursing home when he has the idea to tie thousands of helium filled balloons & float away. Unbenownst to Carl,a young boy scout,Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai)stows away on his porch. Carl has no other choice but to bring Russell along. What follows is a series of adventures for Carl,Russell,and a dog named Dug (voiced by co writer, co director,Bob Peterson)to South America,where they manage to find not just Carl's boyhood hero,Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer),but an ultra rare bird,which Russell takes a fancy to (and vice versa). Bob Peterson co writes & directs,with Pete Docter (who also provides some voice overs for a character named Campmaster Strauch),from a story by Peterson,Docter & Thomas McCarthy. The film has some impressive cinematography & editing. What I really admired was the fact that,despite a Disney production,doesn't have the usual sappy Disney-esquire songs that only manage to pad the film out. I eagerly await Pixar's next entry. Available in certain areas in Digital Disney 3D,and standard 2D for cinemas that are not equipped for 3D screenings. Rated PG by the MPAA,this film serves up some scary moments that small tykes may find a bit intense."
"pporosz","6","1","3","1 September 2009"," The first Pixar misstep
","The consistent brilliance of Pixar movies set my expectations very high for this one. However, it must be clearly said that Up! failed to live up to these expectations and I must call it the first clear misstep in the studio's famed history.<br/><br/>There is some bravery in selecting an unusual pair of heroes for the movie and contemplating on the passing of years in the beginning sequences. But innovation comes to a halt at that very point and the movie as a whole turns out to be a rather flat affair. The story itself proves to be very limited, with a small number of characters tumbling through a series of surreal, yet quite predictable situations -- the very antidote of what once made Pixar movies such as Toy Story, The Incredibles or Wall-E such outstanding pieces.<br/><br/>While for the mainstream of movie-goers (socialised by Hollywood) the mere choice of the theme of the movie in itself could be refreshing, it does not have lasting appeal for a mature audience. Up! is okay for a rainy afternoon, but the very high rating and ranking in utterly unfounded."
"3xHCCH","10","1","3","30 August 2009"," Excellent and Very Heartfelt Animated Film for All Ages
","When I saw the preview months ago, I knew this latest Pixar offering should really be seen in 3D for the best effect. However, upon watching, I feel that the best feature of this 5-star film is not really the 3D animation, it is the heart upon which the heartwarming story of Carl and Ellie Frederickson is so firmly based.<br/><br/>From the trailer, I already knew this would not be the typical Disney-Pixar film. First of all, the lead character is a cantankerous elderly guy! I was really curious how this story would flow. And true to Pixar's amazing record of film-making, ""Up"" belongs up there with the best of them.<br/><br/>That wordless montage on the evolution of the relationship between Carl and his wife Ellie from childhood to old age was beautiful and very touching. Maybe kids will not get affected, but certainly adults will be hard-pressed to hold back their tears in these few minutes that start of the film.<br/><br/>The ""spirit of adventure"" upon which the love affair of Carl and Ellie was founded was finally realized when Carl was pushed to the wall by modern developments around their house. Carl had no other recourse but to go for broke and bring their house to the edge of Paradise Falls in Venezuela, as Ellie always dreamed since her childhood. He did this in the most original way, only possible in an animated film like this.<br/><br/>The relationships Carl builds with his unwitting stowaway boy scout Russell, and later the strange bird Kevin and talking dog Doug, were slow to build up. But again, in true Pixar fashion, the power of true friendships shines through adversities encountered. Great story-telling indeed. This is a movie truly for all ages to enjoy. Do not miss it! The 3D is not essential for you to fall in love with it."

Not one I have any desire to see a second time.<br/><br/>The quality of animation was fine, good artwork, Pixar very well done.<br/><br/>Except for the 3D. It came in and out of use. Sometimes it seemed to have been drawn in layers. When there was motion, things got blurry and horrible, even worse than regular cinema. Yes, points for not giving us vertigo like some 30 year old drive-in. But other than that, this was just light years behind Monsters vs. Aliens in technical quality. Watching Up after seeing MvA was a bit like watching old NTSC TV on an old tube after having seen HDTV on a modern flat-screen. What were you thinking, Disney? This is not the future of cinema. I have to knock a full 2 points off for the terrible misuse of technology. Folks, don't go away thinking this is all 3D can do."

Carl isn't going alone, he has 8 year old boy scout Russell tagging along.<br/><br/>This movie is truly awesome. a kid's movie with an excellent story, funny moments with no toilet humor (Thank god) but yet the first Disney Pixar film I know of in which a character draws blood (2 parts; First with the man Carl attacks, the 2nd being kevin the bird) so if you're sensitive about that, it's a forewarning.<br/><br/>Bottom line, 10/10"
"TrueTenorOne","10","1","3","23 June 2009"," Exceeded my already sky-high expectations
","At this point, I expect nothing less than excellence from Disney/Pixar. It's only natural after seeing them produce 9 high quality films in a row, a streak that is unmatched by any studio in Hollywood. And the greatest thing about their films is that they continue to mature from movie to movie, both in the animation and the storytelling. Culminating in last year's triumph, ""Wall-E"", Pixar showed us that they can take any story, and character, and make us care about them.<br/><br/>Well, the trend continues and then some with this summer's ""Up"". Like I alluded to earlier, this film continues the maturation trend that Pixar has shown throughout their existence. In fact, this could be the most mature 'children's film' since ""Bambi"", both in the themes that it covers and the way that it presents them. But part of the genius of these storytellers is that they can make an extremely mature film without it losing its innocence. I personally consider that to be the greatest achievement of the film, apart from the wonderful animation.<br/><br/>We are introduced to balloon salesman Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner, the best voice-over since Ellen DeGeneres) early on as the movie takes us joyfully, and painfully, through his life. His wife has passed, and he is now alone living around a construction zone. When an incident with a construction worker forces him to move to a retirement home, he has trouble leaving his house. So much trouble, in fact, that he decides to tie thousands of balloons to his house and soar away to South America, a dream he and his wife shared while she was still alive. But unknown to him upon takeoff, a precocious young boy named Russel was on his porch, and becomes an unexpected stowaway on the voyage.<br/><br/>Once in South America, Carl and Russel run into Carl's childhood hero, an exiled explorer accused of fabricating evidence of a ""monster"" in South America. The explorer vowed to leave the U.S. and not return until he found the monster. Pleasant company quickly turns unpleasant, however, after the explorer thinks that Carl and Russel have come to claim the monster for themselves, and a battle quickly ensues between the two parties. By the end of the struggle, Carl is able to learn valuable lessons about life, and the small adventures that often go overlooked.<br/><br/>The film is incredible, the animation is stunning, the voice-over work is tremendous, and the themes are timeless and important. 15 years ago, if anybody had said that an animation company who made films on a computer would become the most consistently successful film company in Hollywood, people would have laughed.<br/><br/>Nobody is laughing now. Or rather, everybody is. They're just all laughing with Pixar.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Just watched the 3D version last night with my 17-year old daughter. I have to admit, I am a huge Miyazaki fan and have often poo-pooed on sugary sweet and idiotic American mainstream animations for lacking subtle nuances and emotional intelligence, but I was just blown away by 'Up' for its completeness.<br/><br/>Kids will love this movie for its hilarious comedy moments and suspenseful action scenes, and still get the full money's worth of experience. However, 'Up' definitely has the undertone that resonates more deeply with those of us who have had few years of life experience under our collective belts and let us emotionally connect with the main character with ease. Astonishingly, the film accomplishes this emotional connection with audience, which I believe is one of the most important foundations of any good movie that too many movies of late fail to achieve miserably, in the first 10 minutes through very poignant and elegantly put together flashbacks.<br/><br/>In the end, everything about this movie - streamlined yet warm visuals, simple yet emotionally powerful story line that buoys the entire movie, real life events masterfully intertwined with out-of-this-world imaginative adventure, and melancholy yet uplifting undercurrent - all reminded me of my all-time favorite Miyazaki movie, 'My Neighbor Totoro'.<br/><br/>I am very happy and pleased to see that another excellent animation studio is finally emerging and raising itself and animation as a legitimate movie genre to the highest artistic level as Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli has been for many years."

However, this cartoon has enhanced the quality of presentation with effects that were unavailable in the 1950's. The storyline is one that is bent more toward the adult, and true empathy for the characters is unique to this film. The kids may enjoy the special effects and cartoon animals, however, the adults will appreciate the kind and gentle approach to the elderly that is a welcome change in the cartoon world. Edward Asner is the perfect voice for the protagonist. And Christopher Plummer is pleasure to listen to as Mr. Charles Muntz. I highly recommend this film for old and young alike."

","After the first 15 minutes of Peter Docter and Bob Peterson's ""Up"", I was in tears. I kept thinking this does not bode well for me. In those 15 minutes without much dialogue, the miraculous storytelling of Docter, Peterson, and Thomas McCarthy realizes such heart felt poignancy. We see the life of widower Carl Fredricksen and his wife Ellie up until the present. Carl (brilliantly voiced by Ed Asner) is a lonely old man, who believes the best part of his life has passed him. In ""Up"" Carl was supposed to go on Ellie's dream trip to Paradise Falls in South America, but this does not happen. Instead of surrendering to a retirement home, Carl decides to go on the trip to Paradise Falls by hooking up a fleet of balloons to his house. In the process Carl inadvertently high jacks spirited Wilderness Explorer Scout Russell (wonderful Jordan Nagai). Thus, the adventure begins.<br/><br/>""Up"" is the best movie of the year. The animation is visually astounding. Whether we watch Carl's house navigate through the clouds and horrendous storms, or Russell befriending the giant brightly colored mythological bird in the deepest jungles of South America, whom he names ""Kevin"". As it turns out Kevin is actually a she. The Paradise Falls themselves are amazingly beautiful. I can even be with the more out there narrative elements like dogs talking through electronic collar translators, because it is absurd context. I loved dog Dug (playfully voiced by Bob Peterson), who initially finds Carl and Russell. Turns out, the dogs' owner is famed explorer Charles Muntz (sublimely evil Christopher Plummer), who is also searching for ""Kevin"" in an attempt to reinvent his ridiculed legacy.<br/><br/>At the heart of ""Up"" is Carl and Russell. Directors Docter and Peterson create a magical chemistry. At first Russell occurs as an annoying Explorer scout in search of his last merit badge—by helping elderly Carl. Carl is this cantankerous old man, who seems to be waiting out the rest of his life. Throughout he keeps calling to ""Ellie"" in lieu of speaking to real people—other than Russell. In a hysterical exchange Carl suggests playing a game: Who can go the longest without saying anything? Excited Russell says, ""Cool! My Mom loves that game!"" However, there is more to Russell than blinding eagerness. While struggling to pitch his tent, Carl inquires why Russell's Dad didn't teach him. Russell replies that his Dad was a great camper, but he didn't get to teach him. Later in the beautiful moment of ""Up"", Carl looks through Ellie's photo album. Sitting in his chair he mouths, ""Cross my heart"" Again, I was in tears. ""Up"" is all eloquence and heart. Docter and Peterson brilliantly balance the hysterical and the touching.<br/><br/>""Up"" is all about the wonder and beauty of life. You wonder how Docter and Peterson can circle back and conclude the story. They do, and the fade away scene is as poignant and sweet as anything you will experience. ""Up"" is beautiful and amazing."

","All his life Carl Fredrickson dreamed of adventure, but today his adventure has taken off. Up is Disney/Pixar's latest adventure and their first in 3-D (which looks colorful by the way). Our story starts off with Carl Fredrickson a grumpy old man who's missed the train, and is still mourning the death of his beloved wife. Until one day he decides to travel to Paradise Falls (a jungle in South America) by tying 100 balloons to his house and exploding into thin air. Taking along a young wilderness explorer named Russell, Carl is determined to finish his journey while honoring his late wife's dream in the process. Disney/Pixar have been making nothing but Art ever since they first started and this is no exception. Up is a delightfully funny, sweet, and heartfelt dramady that will make you smile and shred a tear at the same time. It also has a good message about moving on and the chemistry between Russell and Carl is a good example of a strong friendship and true male bonding. There's nothing to complain about here as I haven't seen a single flaw but young viewers maybe frightened by the appearances of the dogs. They turn out friendly, but are creepy enough to scare the kids. That said this is a movie event you can take anyone (your parents or grandparents in particular) to. Its real like groundbreaking 3-D animation makes it far beyond its predecessor and if you thought Disney's best effort was WALL-E you'll immediately think twice after watching this."
"puffball97","10","1","3","7 June 2009"," A Very Up-Lifting Adventure Tale
","""Up"" is so far the best picture I have seen all year. In a slow season of movies, and the year is almost halfway done, I am glad I can write about an outstanding animated feature that would appeal to all ages. I like this one much better than ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" the previous film I reviewed because this movie relies on careful character development and an interesting story, rather than ""Guess which celebrity does this voice? Pick out the celebrity's personality and features in the drawings and you'll know who,"" needless pop culture references which can bore the most discerning adult film-goer, and violent action. That's right. The reason why Pixar animated movies, and ""Up"" is the 10th Pixar movie, always do so well, I can say even better than DreamWorks animation, because they are interested in plots and characters, where most DreamWorks animated movies in recent years such as ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" can border on vulgar pop culture and celebrity parodies.<br/><br/>The visuals and colors are breathtaking. The story is beautifully constructed and richly textured. The plot brings out all sorts of emotions to us. It can be funny, touching without being melodramatic, action-packed without being violent, and we get to delve into the lives of each main character around.<br/><br/>We meet Carl Fredericksen as a young boy interested in flying adventures. He watches a newsreel of his hero Charles Muntz, a famous explorer who flew on a giant airlift to Paradise Falls in tropical Venezuela. However, Muntz is accused of bringing back fake fossils, so years later he sets out for a real giant, colorful ostrich. In the neighborhood, he meets young Ellie, a tomboy who likes to dabble in flying around the world. What follows is a very poignant footage set to music of Carl and Ellie getting married, living in a house the fix up, saving money into a gallon jug in the hopes of traveling to Paradise Falls, but too many expenses get in the way, growing older, and eventually Ellie dies. The footage is not at all maudlin, but it does touch the way we all live.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the present day. The elder Carl (voiced cantankerously by Ed Asner) is left alone and his beloved house is about to be taken away and he would have to go to a retirement home. No, he says, as he blows up all the balloons attached to his house and flies it off the ground on his own. Joining him is a young wilderness scout named Russell, who becomes Carl's loyal sidekick and friend. The two take off to Paradise Falls, where Carl always wanted to go all his life. They meet up with a big colorful ostrich Russell names Kevin and a cute dog named Dug, who become welcome allies. The conflict of the adventure is that they see Charles Muntz (voiced convincingly by Christopher Plummer), who is after the ostrich that Carl is now friends with. Aided by Muntz are a large pack of vicious-looking robotic dogs which bring comic relief to the movie. But at the end, Carl's dream is fulfilled and more wonderful things happen, even without Ellie in person.<br/><br/>Pixar movies always have a heartfelt message, which is why they are always on a roll. The message of ""Up"" is that if you live long enough and you never give up, you can always have your dreams come true. ""Up"" is rated PG for mild peril and action."

","This is one of the coolest animations I have ever seen! Very nice 3D stuff, nice scripts, very emotional etc. Whenever I think nothing could be better, Disney comes with new movies and just surprises me. If you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it. The way they use to picturize characters' emotions is breath-taking. There are many scenes that I wanted to cry and suddenly it changes to a cheerful one. Sometimes I could not control myself to do not laugh very loud! In fact, everyone was like me;). Moreover, you can see this animation either in 3D or regular theater. I suggest the 3D one. Sometimes it looks like that scene objects are coming out of the curtain. Nice job Disney! I really enjoyed it. I am looking forward to see ""The Princess and the Frog"" as well :)"

","Rarely does a film studio continue to produce such amazing films, and with the exception of Cars and A Bug's Life, Pixar has done just that. Year after year, Pixar has crafted masterpiece, after masterpiece. Certainly Up is no exception. My love affair with Pixar started with their first film, Toy Story. Pixar has never made a bad film and despite A Bug's Life and Cars not being amazing, they were still entertaining and being called the worst Pixar, is certainly no insult. Up is a masterclass in animation, it's a perfect film and definitely a big candidate for the best of the year. I would be hard pressed to see this leaving my top 5, let alone top 2. I can only see one film topping it, and it's going to take Thirst being another Park masterpiece to overcome Up.<br/><br/>There's a very beautiful sequence at the beginning, it shows Carl, our hero of the story, growing up. I won't reveal any of the story, but at times it got me choked up. It's the kind of storytelling, and human emotions that a lot of filmmakers can't create. We next meet up with Carl, when he is much older. He goes about his morning routine, and there's a construction crew creating apartments outside his house. Carl returns to his home, after getting the mail. Soon after he settles down in his favourite chair, a little boy named Russell knocks at his door. Russell is a lovable character. He is very adorable, and newcomer Jordan Nagai does a wonderful job voicing him. Anyways, the next day, Carl unleashes his balloons and he leaves the city in hopes of traveling to South America, a childhood dream. Russell unexpectedly turns up on Carl's doorstep. When they arrive in South America, they meet Dug, the dog. Dug can talk because of the collar that his master built for him. Dug is amazing, he's probably one of the best characters Pixar has ever created. I still can't believe how much I laughed and fell in love with Dug, he was certainly a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>The film is a visual treat, the backgrounds are so full of detail. The film is just so colourful and so vivid. Though this comes expected of Pixar, and they certainly don't let down. The screenplay is brilliant, there are so many instances of bizarre humour, and there are so many different emotions. The film has it's share of depressing moments, but you before you become completely depressed, another moment lifts you up, and evokes a lot of joy in you. The voice work is excellent, Ed Asner is just as perfect as I thought he would be. There's just so much emotion in his voice alone, and the character design of Carl, fits Asner's voice perfectly. New comer Jordan Nagai is, as I said before, tremendous. He adds such a charm to Russell, an big adorable element if you will. Bob Peterson's voice work as both Dug and Alpha, had me side splitting laughing. He was perfect in every stretch of the imagination. With Monster's Inc and now Up under his belt, Pete Docter is one of the best Pixar directors. It's hard to decide between the big three, Andrew Stanton, Brad Bird and Pete Docter. They are all equally amazing, and Pixar is a better studio for just having them on staff.<br/><br/>Up is amazing, it's a movie I would see over and over again. Go see it now if you haven't, and if you have, see it again. It's the first masterpiece of 2009. A perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect movie, have I mentioned it's perfect? It would be easy to say the Oscars should take a break from Pixar, that is if Pixar would just stop producing so many masterpieces.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I went to see this movie with high hopes, after all, it is Pixar. Another thing that intrigued me was the overwhelmingly positive reviews received by nearly everyone. I was, however, a little affected by the 3D, as in, I wasn't sure if this would be used to the film's advantage, or just to make more money in ticket sales.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed, at all. This movie was both visually and emotionally captivating, and now I would have happily paid the 3D price even if not for the 3D (which, by the way, was rarely in your face, but used frequently to add depth to the film). This movie never failed to keep me interested in what was going on. Everything worked together so seamlessly; the plot, the characters, the humor, and the visuals. I was genuinely experiencing everything in the movie, not just watching it (and it wasn't because of the 3D).<br/><br/>When you go in to see this movie, don't just go in to watch an animated film. Go in to watch a high quality, well thought out and thoroughly interesting movie that you will be paying full attention to from the short film (which was also great) all the way up until the closing credits.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. 10* out of 10"

","Karl (voiced by Ed Asner) met and married the girl next door, Ellie. Ellie was an extroverted adventurer while Karl was a shy, reserved person but their friendship and marriage lasted a lifetime. It was Ellie's dream to follow in the footsteps of a famous world traveler, Charles (Christopher Plummer) and make her way, someday, to Paradise Falls in Venezuela. Over the years, however, Karl and Ellie, a childless couple had many home and life realities to deal with and they never made it to South America. Now, Ellie has died and Karl is forlorn. Not only that, developers want their Victorian house, the last holdout in an urban neighborhood, to be razed to make way for high rise buildings. They almost get their wish. But, at the last moment, Karl attaches a fleet of balloons to his house, lifting it in the air, and steers a course for Paradise Falls. But, wait, there's more. A talkative, tweenage scout, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who had convinced Karl to help the young lad earn a merit badge for helping the elderly, has stowed away under the house's porch and is, thus, a fellow passenger in Karl's house-airship. At first, Karl is annoyed but after they land in Venezuela, not on target, Russell helps Karl begin to move the household toward the falls. The two also encounter a trained army of dogs, who obey the commands of their long-lost-to-the-world master, Charles the explorer, who has been trying to capture an elusive, large, colorful bird, new to the known world. It seems Karl and Russell are definitely putting a spanner into his plans. What will be the outcome? This is an extremely wonderful family film, highly entertaining and very, very touching. The story is ingenious, with a flowing action that will keep everyone riveted and the animation is amazing, especially in 3-D. But, added to that mix, is a beautifully moving tale of true love, friendship, and loyalty. This viewer was in tears several times and would dare to say most others will do the same. As the voice of Karl, Asner is excellent, his gruffness hiding a caring soul. Nagai is also topnotch, very funny and very sweet as the young, lonely boy. Plummer, too, does a fine job as the ""heavy"" of the movie and the lesser characters are absolutely perfect, too. In fact, this is a rarity among films, in that it is almost totally without any flaws whatsoever. If you can only see ONE film this year, make it this one. It is UP at the top, and will remain so, of the list of films for 2009."

","First thing I have to say about this movie is that it had all the elements to make a perfect movie(Comedy, Action, Drama, Romance).<br/><br/>The visuals to this film were amazing also (saw it in 3D). My friends said that the 2D movie was just as good. The comedy in this film was hilarious and was filled with it(very clean comedy) from the dog in the movie to the kid. The first 10 minutes of this film were very touching and actually made me tear up. The characters are all very unique and makes you actually care for them. The movies keeps you occupied throughout with no dull moments.<br/><br/>To the people who say its a ""downer"" or ""this is not what Disney movies should do"", yes its a little depressing and very touchy in the beginning but this is an aspect of the movie that makes it so superb. The touching first 10min of the film does not make this a bad movie quite the opposite really. Who says that Pixar movies just have to be happy all the time? This is an animation that actually shows reality (in not such a harsh way). This portion of the movie may be slightly hard to understand for kids under 8 years old and for everyone else this will be a moment in the movie that you will not forget. The rest of the movie will entertain the kids 8 and under.<br/><br/>I would say this is easily in the top 3 animated movies ever made if not the top. I wouldn't be surprised if this gets nominated for best picture and even win it all. This movie is a must see. 10/10. 4 stars out of 4. If you are willing to experience all your emotions(even the sad one's) this is the movie to do it.<br/><br/>Also, the short film before the movie is also quite good."

","The first 10 minutes of this file, done without almost without dialog, are brilliant and poignant. They alone were almost worth the price of the film. The rest of it was pretty good too. I have never seen a bad Pixar film but I think this one was their best so far.<br/><br/>It's an adventure on several levels - the kids can enjoy the action and adventure but there is plenty in the film for the adults as well. It really isn't about plot twists and turns but more the trip through life. <br/><br/>I don't want to write spoilers but I was moved when Carl discovered Ellie's book had more pages and her take on her life's adventures.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I know all together too many young boys in Russel's position.<br/><br/>I recommend this film highly."

","25yr Male from Detroit, MI Up is a hugely entertaining, hilarious, and touching family movie that adults and kids can thoroughly enjoy. I was a big fan of the Toy Story movies growing up so was intrigued to see Pixar's first 3D outing. The movie far exceeded my expectations. Great animation, characters and story that almost reminded me of James and the Giant Peach in a way. I was a bit disappointed in the 3D effects, they certainly did not stretch the limits as far as things jumping out at you, etc. The movie was just kind of ""in 3D"". As far as the story, I am a big time dog lover so especially loved the canine aspect of the movie. Talking dogs were much more prominent in the storyline than I expected which was very entertaining to see. The ""adult"" themes some people are complaining about are incredibly subtle and bordering on non-existent. The whole theater was laughing and enjoying this movie from start to finish and it joins Night At The Museum 2 as two terrific family movies to check out right now."

","My wife and I took our just-turned 3 grandson to ""Up"" this afternoon. We opted NOT to see it in 3D, considering that format too harsh for his age.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this movie hits an absolute home run. Not at all what we expected, Up has a delightful story - wonderful characters - good human finish. For what else can one ask? On the top of the heap is seeing 1) the blazing chronology of beginning to end of the relationship between Mr. Frederickson and his wife. How incredibly touching, and sad, and 2) seeing Mr. Frederickson evolve into this warm, loving being as his relationship with his scouting nemesis blossomed into love and respect.<br/><br/>We are thrilled to have seen this film. There is so much trash generally in theaters on an on-going basis, and especially this summer. Thankfully, Disney created a great ""up""lifting film we will remember for some time to come.<br/><br/>Oh, BTW: the individual who posted ""now I can forgive Pixar for 'Cars'), I have NO idea of what you speak. Cars is a classic. Excellent voice talent, great characters, superior process of transition from a hot-shot dreamer to a 'car' with his wheel planted firmly on the pavement. I fail to see what people want in a film - especially a wonderful animated vehicle (sorry, had to do it) like Cars.<br/><br/>Buy the DVD of Cars, and be sure to see Up!"
"arthera09","10","1","3","30 May 2009"," This is why Pixar is the best there is
","What can I say about this movie. It is perfect in every way. First of all it looked beautiful and probably not as mind blowing as some of Pixar's in terms of visuals it still looks great. The second thing is that the voice acting is top notch like always and nothing less than one would expect. The music never stood out and over powered a scene but there were definitely moments when there would be a little piano melody that would really tug at the heart strings. I guess the most important thing about a movie like this is the story which was told masterfully by Peter Doctor. If I could a favorite Pixar director it maybe Peter Doctor mainly because I think he has the ability to tell a very adult story that never strays away from being a children's film. He totally nailed it Monster's Inc. and was probably for me one of the more emotionally moving Pixar film, or film in general for me right after this one. If you try to explain to someone this movie just in terms of the the character arc it is a very grownup story, but Pixar puts in in the perfect amount of heart, warmth, humor and just magic in general. I do not think I even need to point out any particular moment, but so much of it is just perfect. If I did have one complaint it would be I wish I would have seen some sort of resolution with respect to Russel's character and his father. Now I must say a word about the environment that I saw the movie in. I saw it at 2:10 in the afternoon with nothing other than kids and their mothers. There was a little girl maybe 3 or 4 sitting next to me with her mom that had to keep getting up to go to the bathroom. Except she only had to go when the movie slowed down with respect to a personal moment for Carl. As soon as some action picked the little girl could have cared less about going to the bathroom. Their was chatter all around me, but I loved it. It was perfect. The parents laughed at moments aimed at them and the kids laughed at moments aimed at them and then we all laughed at the moment when it was right. I loved the experience. It is another great film by Pixar and I can only hope that they keep up the quality."

","My family was very excited to see UP at a special pre-opening screening in San Francisco. My daughters, 5 1/2 and 7 had seen the TV ads with the talking dog and were really drawn to see this film.<br/><br/>By the time the credits were running, my 5 1/2 was just beginning to recover from her sadness, and my 7 year old was very ready to leave. My kids were not the only ones shocked by the more violent depictions. Do the trailers let on about violent pursuits, gun shots fired at the heroes, dangerous and scary predicaments, and the sense of dread that fills a good third of the movie? No, they don't. Do they show the scenes where there is senseless destruction of things old and valuable - No they don't. I'm tired of seeing both myself. My five year old actually asked me to write this letter to warn other little kids since ""they might cry too."" After the film, I did read the stamp on the ticket - Film may not be suitable for children under 13 - but the marketing of the film with balloons and the talking dog seemed to target viewers at this age group.<br/><br/>The movie is very much as the SF Chronicle's LaSalle stated it - party great animation and interesting story - then the adventure segment, as the lead character fulfills a life dream of seeing the ""Lost Falls"", lapses into very well trodden depictions, motivations, outcomes, etc.<br/><br/>And Disney - in keeping with Bambi, Nemo, etc - manages to KO the lead female.<br/><br/>A bright spot is the depiction of the boy scout in the film. Very enjoyable character. The short subject film that preceded UP titled Party Cloudy was great fun too."

","I have a history of generally avoiding animated films just due to a block that prevents me from investing in artificial characters, but I'd be lying if I said Up didn't touch me. Within the first half hour I was in a river of my own tears and there were several other times the film got me choked up. The relationship between Carl and Ellie was beautiful and sweet and whenever they pulled on those strings, wellit really worked for me.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that the rest of the film wasn't that good. Instead, they mix in this beautiful and heartbreaking story of an elderly man all alone with a very dull and standard villain plot (disappointingly standard after the great uniqueness in his means of transportation) and the most annoying sidekick since Short Round. I admired the parallels between Carl and Russell and I got plenty of laughs out of this, but it wasn't exciting at all. For a relatively short film it dragged a lot, and the moments that it dragged were the ones that were supposed to be the most exciting. I couldn't have cared less about everything with Muntz and so the big action pieces had me zoning out frequently.<br/><br/>Up started off with a very somber, adult tone with the introduction to Carl that I really respected, but the more things they added onto it just made that tone a lot more muddled and awkward. They went for a lot of different tones and I don't think they pulled them together very well. Still, I have to admire it so some degree just by virtue of how much it pulled on my heart strings; there were a lot of tears and quite a few laughs. I just wish the good hadn't been bogged down by so much ordinary."

","They've really got the animation 'down', they are seasoned pros at it, and can do almost whatever they want. However, they've never seemed to work on getting skin and faces to look at all realistic. After all the work to make fur, feathers, water, clouds, fire, food, and almost everything else look like the real thing, it seems high time to make the human characters look like something other than play-dough. If they can get that down, there's a whole new world of human features and expression opened up. Just getting tired of looking at plasticine characters, it's time to move on from the ""Toy Story"" look. Even in 1988 Jessica Rabbit looked at least 2-D human, and 20+ years later Pixar could probably do something good if they tried.<br/><br/>This movie -- started very slowly and boring, even as an adult I was asking, ""What is this? What's this about?"" well into it, and it didn't hold the kids' attention. The story is weird, and also simple."

"freemantle_uk","10","1","4","25 October 2009"," Another brilliant animated film from Pixar
","No one at the moment can match Pixar in the world of CGI animation at the moment. They made a lot of instant classics, with only one film being a flop (Cars). No one in Hollywood has even come close, and all studios should follow the Pixar philosophy of story comes first.<br/><br/>The plot of Up tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (Edward Asner), an elderly man who's wife Ellie had died and about to face evident from his home. Instead of giving in and going to live in a retirement home, Carl decides to go on the adventure trip to South America that he and his wife were never about to do. He attaches hundreds of helium balloons to his house and floats to South America. But he has a stowaway, Russell (Jordan Nagai), an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer. When the two reach South America, they come to a strange rainforest, with a large colourful bird which loves chocolate and Russell calls Kevin, and a Golden Retrevier called Dug (Bob Peterson) who has a collar that allows him to talk. With this jungle is a mad elderly explorer, Charles F. Muntz (Christopher Plummer), and Carl and Ellie's childhood hero. He created the collars to allow his pack of dogs to speak, and wants to capture the bird to show to the world.<br/><br/>Pixar has a strong philosophy which obviously works. They have a old-fashion style but it works. They is a strong story and character development. The actors in this film were casted because they had the right voice, not cause they are a big name actor. This is a right move, especially because children don't care who voices the film, only if they are good. They is brilliant designs, direction, with excellent jokes, especially Russell and the dogs. There are sight gags, slapstick, but also some more adult-aimed jobs involving observational humour. There is also a good amount of action, some reminding me of Peter Jackson's version of King Kong. They is a emotion element, especially the montage at the beginning of the film. It makes you feel sad for Carl and Ellie. Pixar films also often trend to have a message about family relationships, like Finding Nemo and the Incredibles. This time the focus is on the love between Carl and Ellie, the surrogate relationship between Carl and Russell and Russell need for a fatherly figure. There is also the themes of unfulfilled dramas and hero worship.<br/><br/>A perfectly enjoyable film for the whole family."

","Up finally arrives in the UK and, just when I thought Pixar couldn't do better than WALL-E, it turns out they can.<br/><br/>It's not often that I find myself thinking that a film is pretty much perfect, but this is one of them. The core story of Carl's adventure in his balloon-powered house together with stowaway Russell is exciting, involving, moral, funny (very funny!), and visually stunning.<br/><br/>The 3D is used wonderfully effectively, but without being so in-your-face that you are always having your nose rubbed in it.<br/><br/>But I must put my name down as one of those who was stunned by the opening sequence running from the newsreel footage of Muntz' initial exploration through Carl and Ellie meeting and then the montage of their life together. This exquisite sequence wasn't just great animation, it was - in my view - one of the all time great cinematic sequences, on a par with any of the classic sequences since the birth of cinema. In 10 short minutes it not only provided the exposition, it also conveyed a huge amount of information which paid off later in the film, and did both of these without you ever feeling that you were being spoonfed. And I can't recall the last time something moved me so deeply in the cinema.<br/><br/>This movie is, simply, a work of genius."

","Surprise, surprise, Pixar has made a wonderful film. ""Up"" is a true original, loaded with unique characters, outstanding design, and some wild, vertigo-inducing action. Through it all, the Pixar brand of wit and humor is fully intact. John Lasseter and his team have chosen another rather risky project for a Memorial Day weekend release: an old man ties balloons to his house to travel to a South America, a location he's desired to go to since his youth. Outside of ""Gran Torino"", this is the only film that's taken a risk on putting an octogenarian front and center of a potential blockbuster. But ""Up' gives it's lead a real warmth and humanity that is all but missing in Hollywood's general portrayal of the elderly, who, when not pointing shotguns at the local hoodlums, are normally the butt of the joke.<br/><br/>""Up""'s main character is Carl Frederickson, and Pixar deals a masterstroke in telling his backstory in an remarkable montage set to Michael Giacchino's dazzling score (Giacchino scored both ""Star Trek"" and ""Up"" and deserves an Oscar for the love of god – he was unfairly passed over for his GREAT ""The Incredibles"" score years ago). The montage of Carl's life elicits laughs, tears and strongly establishes why Carl is doing what he's doing. The house with balloons is as memorable a cinema icon as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang or Dorothy's house flying through the tornado. But it's the reason for Carl's quest and the metaphor of the house as the baggage he's carrying that makes the story of ""Up"" go from memorable to truly magical.<br/><br/>The voice talent is strong throughout, and like ""Wall-E"" before it, there are no superstars driving the show. Ed Asner's voice brings all the weight of his years to Carl, and he's matched pitch-perfect by Christopher Plummer. In a hilarious turn, young Jordan Nagai kills as the Explorer scout constantly bothering Carl. ""Up"" has been shown in 3-D, and I get why theaters are doing that. With pay-per-view, on demand, online, blu-ray and DVD options for people to see a film, the in-theater option is pulling out all the stops to get you to come out and spend up to $14. But ""Up"" is so strong in character and narrative, there's no need to add the special effect of exploring the third dimension. An added plus, for sure, but not necessary. ""Up"" excels in its animation, robustly coloring every frame, whether it's with thousands of individual balloons or the painter's palette worth of color on a unique South American bird.<br/><br/>""Up"" also fires up the Pixar humor to uproarious effect. Particularly funny are a pack of dogs who ""speak"" through collars that read their thoughts. The combination of the absurd and the direct translation of a dog's actions into words make for some pretty funny stuff. They also get a lot of mileage out of Carl's grumpiness, without making him unlikeable.<br/><br/>Gush time. Pixar makes the best films in Hollywood right now. An eclectic mix of top acting talent, dazzling animation, inventive and risky storytelling, every time. Next up, they're re-distributing ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" this fall in 3-D. Again, whether the 3-D is necessary is debatable, but it'll be great to re-watch the first feature length film that put Pixar on the national map. They came out of the gate so strong, it's amazing that they've managed to see the possibilities in risky plots and never waiver from a formula underneath that is the most watchable cinema out there."

","A profoundly intimate human drama, a rollicking adventure, a heartwarming romance, a joyous coming-of-age tale & a rib-tickling comedy, all extraordinarily blended into one gorgeously rendered masterpiece, Up is a breathtaking fusion of art, animation & vision that marks yet another creative high for Pixar and also happens to be their most emotional film to date. One of the greatest films ever made."
"simonwest80","7","1","4","4 September 2009"," Up = maybe a little over inflated.
","Up in my opinion is probably the weakest film in the Pixar collection. There was never the ""magic"" moment for me which is always created in the other films. Don't get me wrong Up is a very enjoyable film but didn't quite push the right buttons.<br/><br/>The plot confuses me a lot as it starts off very sombre (i had a tear in my eye at one point) and then transforms into something mainly for the kids, so it doesn't blend the 2 together as we are used to. So the kids will hate the first half, and adults will find the second half maybe a little silly.<br/><br/>There are lots of funny jokes in here that serve both sets of viewers. And the voice acting is superb and spot on. You just got to love the Doberman ;)<br/><br/>The characters, animation and general design are all out of the top drawer as normal for Pixar but i made the mistake of seeing this in 3D.....if you are charged extra to see it in 3D don't! The movie has no scenes of ""3Dness"" of the likes found in Ice Age 3, and Aliens Vs Monsters to name a couple. Even Valentines day Masacre made a better use of 3D, and for me seemed to just be thrown in ""cos 3D films are doing well this year"".<br/><br/>Overall good film...........but.................even now i cant explain why it isn't as good as the others."

","I just can't understand how they manage to do it all the time. <br/><br/>Up may just well be the best animated movie I've ever watched. It may beat anything Walt Disney ever made. In my opinion, it's even better than anything else Pixar has done. How can they do it?<br/><br/>There are no real objects in this film; everything is made by computers. So, how is it possible that Carl plays with our emotions they way he does? Why is it that, 10 minutes into the movie, we *are* Carl, and become one with his journey? <br/><br/>I have no clue about it. All I know is, I'm pretty certain I've just watched one of the most unforgettable movies ever made. Go, Carl."
"mrmatthardy","10","1","4","6 June 2009"," Is it possible? Pixar has outdone itself?
","With Pixar's track record, I felt inclined to see their newest motion picture adventure, UP. This movie does not falter in any aspect. The story as all other Pixar film is unique and completely it's own. It follows an elderly man and a young boyscout on their adventure as they travel across the world by way of a floating house. Along the way they meet others who follow them on their quest to find Paradise Falls South America. The film does a great job of entertaining the audience, but also bringing up serious matters in life. In this aspect, UP does an amazing job of attracting a wide audience. As for the animation, I was not disappointing what so ever I went into this movie with high hopes and expectations.I am happy to say that this movie is every bit as great as I hoped it would be. Cheers Pixar!"
"BigWhiskers","10","1","4","2 June 2009"," Wonderful movie -
","Just got back from seeing ""UP"" and it was a very entertaining movie. Lots of neat special effects and it really did make you feel as if you were up in the air with the main characters. The plot involving a 76 yo man Carl Fredericksen wanting to experience adventure before he dies is charming and heartfelt. Along with him for various parts of his journey are a young cub scout and other characters like a talking dog and a large bird. I can see why the movie is rated PG though as their are some parts that I think would be too scary or too intense for the under 10 crowd - such as the part where one dog brutally bites another dog and throws it off a cliff and the duel between Carl and Charles Muntz which is rather intense- Carl gets kicked in the chest by Muntz and nearly impaled several times while fighting Muntz who is armed with a large sword.<br/><br/>Otherwise,I loved the animation - I didn't get to see it in 3d but an article said that you get more in the 2d version. Either way, totally enjoyable and the voice actors especially the Asian kid were a treat on the ears. Ed Asner is perfect as Carl who himself looks like an older Spencer Tracy look alike - he may be rough on the outside but has a warm heart and really cares. Enjoy the movie and the wonderful animation. 10 out of 10."
"basitziakhan","3","1","5","24 June 2019"," Overhyped and boring
","I had such high expectations before watching this movie because of all the hype created around it. With all honesty I think it kept trying too hard making it feel pretentious, and it bored the hell out of me. The pacing is so off and everything seems so stretched. Even though it's an hour and a half long it feels like three. The plot doesn't lead anywhere and humour is missing. No seriously, when I say humour is missing I mean this is the only Disney movie that didn't make me laugh even once. Infact I did not feel any emotions flow through my body at all except annoyance, because whenever it tried to make me feel something I just couldn't stop wishing it would just end already (the movie).
There's a lot of great Disney movies out there, but this is not it."
"notdos","4","1","5","19 March 2011"," Inappropriate for kids in my opinion
","Technology is a wonderful thing. However, maybe we need to spend a little more time contemplating the subject matter of our ""cartoons"" rather than how cool we can make them look. To begin a child's movie with the revelation that death and heartbreak are inevitable is just plain stupid. This movie is a depressing look at real life that is, in my opinion, completely inappropriate for a child. I thought that, given time, the movie would accelerate to a more upbeat theme. No such luck. Throughout, you're reminded that this poor old man is alone. Old and alone are just not entertaining subjects, even if they're wrapped in bright colors."
"mystshadow","6","1","5","13 June 2009"," UP... not so much.
","I'd give it maybe 6 of 10. If you've seen the trailers you've seen most of the funniest scenes. Disney's moral message gets muddled up in a dragged out tale of an old man seeking a lost dream. Asner is great as a grumpy old man (with heart), but nothing that we haven't heard before. (Lou Grant, animated.) The highlight was Bob Peterson as Dug and Alpha, the two leading dogs. Also, kudos to young Jordan Nagai as Russell. The 3-D added little to the film except for a few panoramic shots, and maybe a handful of other times, and the colors were a lot sharper w/o the glasses. It's a shame there is no alternative for a kids movie yet this summer. Be prepared for them to be bored to tears by the first 10 minutes."

","Peter Docter's UP is an animated film only in the most basic sense, for it is like no other animated film ever made; it is equal parts action, adventure, drama and comedy. The film combines all these elements so successfully that you will put aside your preconceived notion that animation is for children's films. You know, silly films with uncomplicated plots and G- rated adventure. UP is about an old man, Carl Fredricksen, who dreamed of going to Paradise Falls like his hero, the famous adventurer, Charles Muntz. He promised his wife, who he met as a child and who shared the same dream of adventure, that together they would move to and live in Paradise Falls. But life, and all its problems got in the way, and Carl and his wife never take said adventure. After she dies and Carl accidentally injures a man working on the construction that is occurring next to his home, Carl is forced by a court to give up his house and move into a retirement center. Instead, he attached thousands of balloons to his house and flies away. The characters are hardly stereotypical heroes: an old man, a talking dog, and an overweight Asian boy scout who just want his last merit badge. These characters are believable and they make the film feel realistic. UP features great visuals and stunning color sequences. It is beautifully directed, with shots of great beauty and scope. Docter uses the visuals as his main tool of communication, for example, explaining Carl's life story without any dialogue, and it is obvious that he took great care in framing the characters within the shot. As a result, the film feels authentic and engrossing. The emotional elements of the story are heart-wrenching and make the audience feel a part of Carl's journey. This is also an adventure story where people and indeed their animal accomplices do perish, granted all of this is implied without any details. There are many suspenseful turns in this film and it keeps you on your seat and interested throughout. The mood is constantly being lightened by numerous comedic moments. The dog that follows them on their journey, Doug, whose collar allows him to talk, fills the film with much laughter, as well as being an involved character in the story. The film manages to strike the right note at every turn and is a joy to experience. UP is quite simply a lot of fun and is a comedic adventure that will appeal to all audiences. UP is the best film of the year so far, and is worth any ticket price."

","Up is a new family friendly 3D animated feature from Walt Disney Studios and Pixar Animation. I do not always go to see family films, usually because I feel they are aimed at more of a younger audience and there is not much for me to enjoy, or be entertained by. Up is a different story entirely. Once, I started to see all the glowing reviews of the film, I figured I would at least give it a chance and I was so glad I did. I think there is a lot here that adults will enjoy and reflect upon and enough that will entertain children and keep them interested and make them laugh. For adults the plot does deal with aging and overcoming obstacles and learning to reach your dreams and deal with the sadness and loneliness in your life. The film does briefly deal with some of these issues which are more, or less things that will happen to everyone of us at some point in our lives, which is just a natural part of getting older and losing our mobility and perhaps losing the ones we love. Although we all know this will happen to us sooner than later, as the film shows, it is still not easy. While some adults may feel that these issues are not what they would want to subject their children to, don't worry because this film is a great film to see with the whole family and while there are some mature and thematic elements to it, it is nothing a child could not handle and it is not done in a disrespectful, or disturbing way. It may be sad, but wasn't also a lot of other Disney films that children have been watching for years? Also for the youngsters in the audience the film deals with adventure and again following your dreams, making friends and doing the right thing. Both of the main characters in the film seem to learn these life lessons from one another and they make a captivating, funny and charming two leads to this film. While, I appreciated the subtle and more thematic moments of the film there was still a lot of uplifting moments that were both touching and sweet. There was a lot of comedy as we are introduced to some wonderfully creative creatures later in the film and also a subplot that deals with good versus evil and a final showdown that will keep everybody watching. Up is a thoughtful and sometimes thought provoking film, but it still has the other qualities like humour, magic and adventure that families love about these kind of films. Not to mention that I really enjoyed the animation as well. I left the audience feeling really uplifted at the end of this film and it was a thoroughly entertaining 90 minute film and sometimes I even wish it had been longer. Another great addition to this year's lineup of movies including Adventureland and Drag Me To Hell (not family films though) and one of the best films of the year so far."

","Awful film about a sad old man who waits until his wife is dead to fulfil all their dreams and a sad little boy who just wants his dad back.<br/><br/>*I'd definitely advise giving this a miss if you have children... Unless you are looking for a way to bring up some difficult subjects such as loss, and miscarriage. And that's just the start of the film. But if you are, by all means crack on, just make sure you have your talking points well prepared... You'll need them!<br/><br/>Why not have the boy (e.g. as an orphan) come into their lives after the sadness of not being able to have their own children? Then realising that life was too short and setting off on their grand adventure, all 3 of them together.

But it lacks that emotional content what this sort of a film requires and it aspires that too. The starting scenes are pure gold. The story runs fast and rapidly to its meat from the very first scene itself. Mr. Fredrickson is a character of great man-hood. But leaving aside him and Russell, this film doesnt provide any other memorable characters which Toy Story does pretty consistently. The humor is good but inconsistent. There are some sequences that will hold your breath but they are far and in between, the film feels unmistakebly long and strecthed though its lenght is just above 93 minutes. The love story is great,begins well and the idea of making this story in animation deserves a apllaud. Then surviving dreams come true altogether, it feels unmistakbly contrived. It could have been more effective. What good is the idea of creating a villain who is your very own childhood hero. The idea was pretty cool but the effect is missing somehow. As i said the animation is good. Kids will enjoy this movie and so do adults, its your choice you decide wether its your cup of tea !

","The movie Up! is a family friendly and heartwarming movie. We first are introduced to two young children Carl played by Ed Asner and Ellie played by Ellie Docter, who fall in love and build a life together. Through their bond of adventure and no luck with having children, they decide to save for adventures in South America. As life happened and the couple grew old the trip continued to get put off. When Ellie got sick and passed away, the trip was all together forgotten. This backstory is a very short portion of the film and leads us to present day in the film, where Carl is an old grumpy and lonely man. 
One day, a boy scout Russell played by Jordan Nagai, stumbles upon his doorstep one day in hopes to earn a new badge. After Carl turns the naive boy away on a hopeless mission, he is greeted by an even bigger pest at his door. Developers who intend to make him leave his house. Through annoying construction and misunderstandings, Carl has no choice but to go live in a retirement home. Or does he? He constructs an elaborate plan that allows him to keep his house and follow is late wife's dream. Carl attaches a mass amount of balloons to his home and takes flight off to South America. Unannounced to him, a stow away has joined the trip. Russell and Carl along with new friends found along the way, must figure out how to get back to where they came from and Russell back to his dad. The journey wasn't easy and getting back would prove to be difficult as well, as the pair encounter obstacles that try to hinder them from getting back home. Eventually through teamwork and a new found friendship, Russell and Carl manage to defeat the not so heroic Charles Muntz and make it home safe for ice cream.
 There are multiple themes for this film but the main theme is the complexity of human relationships. Through his hard times and the joys of marriage with Ellie, Carl experiences the complexity of a human relationship in regards to love and companionship. Through his adventures and experience with Russell he experiences a whole different kind of complex relationship as he experiences what it would be like to have a kid and in the end gains a new friend. Carl had a different approach to relationships and love at the beginning of the film but it is lost. Through the film he finds his love again and is able to love in a new way towards Russell and even Doug.
 When Carl meets his childhood hero and he turns out to be nothing like he imagined, he finds himself at a loss for words as Charles Muntz sets his band of dogs on Carl and Russell. Then in order to catch the notorious Snipe, Charles Muntz comes after them again putting their lives in danger to bring himself to fame. Carl wants to give up and let Charles Muntz take the Snipe away from her babies and back to be caged and studied for the remainder of it's life. Russell on the other hand believes in helping those who can't help themselves and heroically goes after Charles Muntz and the snipe. This further makes Carl realize the love that has been formed for Russell and busts into action to save Russell and the Snipe. Through the film, all the antics they get into and obstacles they encounter help to form that bond between Carl and Russell. Leaving Carl with a new friend and companion at the end of the film. It all came full circle so beautifully. I truly felt Russell was sent by Ellie to be Carl's friend. 
 A motif of the film was a theme of the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Adventures seem spectacular and amazing, but it can be scary and dangerous. Charles Muntz spent his life exploring and adventuring, but in the end he died and was forgotten. Carl and Ellie may not have ever gotten to go on their adventures, but their life was an adventure and as Carl found out, adventures aren't all they are cracked up to be. His new adventures can be had right at home with his new friend.
 The theme in comparison to another movie that I would like to contrast is the Jungle Book. Just as Carl and Russell are two unlikely friends, Mogli finds his fair share of unlikely friends as he tries to find his way home. Similar to Carl and Russell. Although the two movies have extremely different plots, the themes can be compared and we can see similarities. In both movies a pair or group of strangers work together to accomplish the goal of getting someone home. In both movies, the forced pairings become friends.
 The movie is a heartwarming depiction of how young kids can be friends with older people and the most unlikely friendships could turn into the best companionship possible. Carl who was a lonely widower needed to find a neglected sweet boy scout to once again complete his life and bring meaning back. In return Russell also received the supportive friend and role model that he deserved."

","Developed by Pixar Studios, Up takes the viewer on the adventures of Carl Fredricksen as he goes for one last adventure, in a brilliantly funny and touching story that all the family can enjoy. From the start through to the end its an enthralling ride filled with with laughter, joy and many touching moments that you can't help but emphasise with. <br/><br/>Pixar certainly know how to make a film and Up is yet another example of their brilliance. The script is extremely well written, the animation suitably matches the script and the whole direction of the film is beautiful.

Carl Fredericksen is a grumpy old man who learns valuable lessons of friendship and trust, but discovers some unpleasant realities along the way. <br/><br/>He meets some colourful characters on his journey, which may seem weird at first, but strangely enough fit into the universe the film creates. <br/><br/>Up also features some comedic gold which surely will entertain audiences of all ages and does not stick awkwardly out.

","I really liked this film for its adventure and portrayal of characters not often seen working together; especially the relationship between senior and youth age groups. It added a family dimension outside the nuclear which was surprising and delightful. I would even go as far as reaffirming a sense of community.<br/><br/>I wondered if Ellie Fredrikson's story could be revisited in an inspiring way for a prequel? Amy Poehler's Smart Girls and Emma Watson's HeforShe campaign are on my Facebook feed and Ellie Fredrikson might fit right in that profile. I would really like her to not disappear into a tragic footnote in history to focus just on Carl. Oprah Winfrey helps educate 172 South African girls through college in the US for example."
"mjplysaght","9","0","1","30 March 2017"," Fun, colourful and poignant
","While Pixar tend to gear their films towards kids/family audience, it doesn't stop them from kicking you to the ground emotionally. I am of course referring to the first ten minutes of the film, where we see our protagonist Carl as a child, meet his future wife, an eccentric energetic girl called Ellie, who bond over their love of adventure. They make a bond to travel together but life problems always get in the way. The opening montage is possibly the most moving, poignant piece showing them grow old together until Ellie dies, making Carl a widower.<br/><br/>The film continues as Carl is now a grouchy old man, threatened with eviction as construction is due to take place where his house is currently situated. He manages to make his house airborne by harnessing hundreds, if not thousands of balloons to it and begins to make his way towards the spot himself and his late wife dreamed to live. He accidentally brings a boy scout called Russell along for the ride and together they encounter a series of zany characters along the way.<br/><br/>So putting the first ten minutes aside, which in my opinion, deserves to be a standalone short film, the rest of the film is humorous, bright and ultimately shows us the journey of Carl becoming more compassionate over time, struggling to cope with the grief of his wife's death.<br/><br/>It'll bring a tear to your eye and once again, Pixar's mastery over computer animation has not faltered."
"Animated_Antic","10","0","2","13 March 2017"," A perfect movie from beginning to end.
","Pixar has made some of the most brilliant movies in the last few years, and in my opinion ""Up"" is the best of them all. I fell in love after I finished watching this movie for the first time in theaters, that I decided to see it a second time. That's something I never do. I only see a movie once in the theater and usually wait until it comes to home video, but I just had to see ""Up"" a second time. It was and still is a perfect movie. Everything in this movie is great and I still love it.<br/><br/>The film opens up with a boy named Carl and a girl named Ellie having a passion for adventure, both being a fan of the famed explorer Charles Muntz. They later form a bond and through a 5 minute segment, we see they're married life told only through visuals and music. After Ellie dies, Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) becomes a stubborn grump who is refusing to leave his house which is now in the middle of a construction zone. After being forced to move into a retirement home after injuring a construction worker, Carl takes  thousand balloons, ties them to his house and flies his house to Paradise Falls. However, he isn't alone. A wilderness explorer named Russel becomes an accidental stowaway. He is trying to get his final merit badge which involves assisting the elderly. So, when they get to Paradise Falls, they are both accidentally thrown out of the house and are now forced to pull it to the waterfall. Along the way theme across some colorful and funny characters including a bird named Kevin and a dog with a collar translator named Dug (the later performed by director Pete Docter and the latter by co-director Bob Peterson).<br/><br/>I don't know where to begin with this film, but I might as well give my thoughts on the story. It's so crazy, but it works. Everything feels perfect in how events are told and nothing seems particularly dull or boring. It keeps you invested all the time. The characters are all memorable. You can probably remember most lines they say, and they all have likable personalities. You really enjoy all of these characters and you laugh at most the lines they say in the film. The animation has also held up well. It looks colorful and energized still and every detail still feels genuine. Another great thing about the movie is the music by Michael Giacchino. His score, in my opinion, is one of the best in animation. Particularly the music featured in the first ten minutes of the film, it's soothing and upbeat at the right moments and definitely deserved the Academy Award. <br/><br/>""Up"" is the perfect example of a family film. It has all the emotions, all the laughs, and the all the beauty you expect in an animated movie. That's something that you don't see everyday in an animated film. Considering how animated movies nowadays are mainly seen as ""kids stuff"", which really annoys me, I can make the slim argument that most people love ""Up"". It's a straight up wonderful flick, one of the best animated movies probably ever made in my opinion and I certainly have plans on seeing the movie again in the future."
"jsm-16571","8","0","1","2 March 2017"," Dreams Up in the Air
","After watching the movie Up, by Pixar, the viewer is instantly connected emotionally. The love between Carl and Ellie is adorable. The viewer watches them grow old together from a young age. Whether it is working at their day job together or laying at the park staring at clouds together, any person would be envious of the love they have for each other. They always had adventure within them, from a young age they formed an adventure club and filled the pages of Ellie's adventure book with the dream to go to Paradise Falls together. They created a jar to put spare change in that would go towards funding their dream. Carl and Ellie face a lot of bumps on the road towards their dream, Paradise Falls. Some of them include Carl breaking his leg, getting a flat tire, and a tree falling on their house during a storm. This causes them to use the Paradise Falls fund which delays their trip. After these delays, they become content with their love for one another and soon forget about their dream from a young age. Carl remembers about their dream too late and Ellie suddenly passes away early on in the movie. Ellie passes without fulling her and Carl's dream and the viewer is overcome with sadness. However, Carl decides that he wants to make the dream happen for his wife after he is given her adventure book in the hospital in the days before her death. So he works towards being able to go there himself, for the both of them. This captivates the viewer to feel for Carl and wish for his success. In Pixar's movie, ""Up"", determination and loyalty is portrayed in the main character Carl despite the hardships he faces before and after the passing of the love of his life. <br/><br/>After Ellie's passing, Carl soon begins working towards his and Ellie's dream. However he soon runs into a problem with construction workers working outside of his house. As the construction goes on, they accidentally smash Carl'a mailbox in his front yard. The mailbox means a lot to Carl because he and Ellie designed it together when they were young. Thus when he sees his mailbox smashed, he is angered. Arguing with the construction workers leads to a court case where Carl is ordered to move into a retirement home forever. By moving in, Carl knows that he would not be able to fulfill his and Ellie's dream of going to Paradise Falls. So Carl thinks of a solution to tie thousands of balloons to his house and make it fly. Carl is willing to do anything and everything to give him a chance at fulfilling his and Ellie's dream. <br/><br/>He had succeeded in getting his entire house into the air, an enormous feat in itself, but it is not long after he gets his house floating that Carl hears a knock at his front door only to find that it is Russel. The day before Russel showed up at Carl's house asking if he needed any assistance as he was trying to get his last badge for helping the elderly. Carl grew annoyed with him and finds a way to send him away. However when Russel surprises Carl by appearing on his porch, Carl decides to let him in. Russel causes more problems for Carl that he does not need. For instance, Russel accidentally throws the GPS out of the window making it more difficult for Carl to navigate. Carl must now try to navigate his house to Paradise Falls on his own. <br/><br/>Even after lifting his home into the air and dealing with the badgering of Russel, he continues to face adversity. While in the air, they run into a thunderstorm. The thunderstorm shakes the whole house. This causes Carl needing to quickly gather all of his valuables such as pictures of Ellie hanging on the wall so that they do not fall and crack. Carl ends up in a jungle where he comes across a big colorful bird named Kevin. Russel falls in love with the bird, however Carl finds the bird annoying like Russel. Carl soon finds out from dogs in search of Kevin that Kevin is wanted by Charles Muntz. Charles Muntz currently has a skeleton of a real bird like Kevin, but nobody believes him that it is real. Thus he wants it to prove to people that he is still a great explorer. However Carl realizes Kevin is the last specie of the bird, so he pities Kevin and tries to protect him.<br/><br/>Carl does not forget about his dream. After the hardships of being forced into a retirement house, getting his house in the air, finding Russel on his doorstep, running into a thunderstorm, finding Kevin and trying to protect him, Carl continues to work towards his dream. These hardships do not stop Carl. Carl's determination to reach his goal is shown as he does not give up regardless of what obstacles he faces. He is also loyal towards Ellie, as he wants to fulfill their dream. I would recommend this movie to anyone needing motivation. The movie ""Up"" captures the picture of determination perfectly, it truly is an emotionally captivating and well made movie."
"mauricepfeife","8","0","1","21 February 2017"," What a depth, what a movie...
","I remember seeing this movie as a kid in theaters. I was like 8 or 9. I didn't think it was an awful movie, but it (kinda) didn't makes me feel something, I just didn't get the point. Yesterday I buy this movie thinking maybe it was too deep or more for adults. And I was kind of right. I think kids can enjoy this movie, but adults too, and maybe even more than kids. I love all the metaphors (House represents what Ellie is for Carl), the music and the animation (even though I sometimes feel like they didn't nailed the balloons). In general, the first half was like a 4,5/5, truly brilliant. But the second half, I thought didn't gave that brilliance of the first half. It felt so fast, kind of messy and the action didn't worked for me. And the fact that Muntz dies, makes Carl kind of the bad one, like he doesn't care about that death, it doesn't even bothers him. Anyway, that half doesn't makes the movie a bad one. Its an 3,5/5 half. Still deep, great message (I would summarize like this: Love is amazing but you still have to do your own thing. What would you say?) and I don't know much about that stuff, but I think I can say it has a great character arc. Not a brilliant movie, but a veeery good one."

","Up is by far the saddest Pixar film I have seen and I still wandering why it didn't get the Best Picture in 2009. Apart from the excellent animation, interesting story ,the opening is by far the most famous part of the film for it shows the life that our hero Carl Fredricksen had before he embark to his adventure towards the Paradise Falls.<br/><br/>No spoilers for the opening minutes, but they were both beautiful, funny, sad and in the end tragic for our elderly man and after seen them you understand why he is grumpy all the time. Also at his great escaped, he is joined by Russell a plump ,joyfull boy-scout and they form one of the most mismatched duos in film history. And after-ward in the island they meet the talking dog Doug, I want him can we keep him?!!!<br/><br/>As for the island itself ,is what your child-self would dream from an tropical island, vivid colors, huge trees and animals that you won't believe that really exist. This change in tone is done in a so amazing way that even Carl smiles! <br/><br/>Also to our duo ,what I got, was that Carl saw his younger self to Russell and Russell got a father figure that was absent from the majority of his life. What a twist right? But how times in our life did we wished to happened to us and this was the best execution of that cliché I have seen.<br/><br/>Over all I love Up and you should definitely watch show it with your kids, they are going to love it!"
"EthanBJones_03","10","0","2","28 January 2017"," One of Pixar's Best; My personal favourite
","Overall: This movie is just simply excellent. It is one of Pixar's finest and is 100% worth watching<br/><br/>Good: This movie contains absolutely gorgeous animation that is so rich with detail and care it is outstanding. Every frame has so much care and passion implemented into it, it is truly a sensational spectacle to behold. The story is beautifully woven and emotionally charged. Each character was interesting a likable. The villain was conniving and cruel and easily hate-able. His relationship to the hero was also a great choice. Doug is my personal favourite character with all the charm and love and wit you could ever ask for in a dog. Russell is quirky and funny and you just cannot help but adore him. His polar opposite, Mr Frederickson, however, is cold and harsh and even ruthless but you can see the goodness inside him and feel really sorry for him. A magnificent ending which perfectly fits and can make a grown man cry, in typical Pixar fashion. The music is beautiful and is intricately designed and chosen to be perfect for each scene which it is. This movie will make you laugh, make you cry, keep you on the edge of your seat and make you exclaim in amazement. A Pixar Masterpiece.<br/><br/>Bad: I sound like the world's biggest jerk here but I refuse to believe a chubby kid and a frail old man can keep a house, with enough balloons attached to make it fly, on the ground. It's an animation so liberties can be made but this just annoyed me slightly.<br/><br/>Best Part: The beautiful ending.<br/><br/>MVP: Ed Asner/Jeremy Leary as Carl Frederickson<br/><br/>10/10: A Masterpiece"

"YourFamilyExpert","10","0","1","17 January 2017"," A cathartic masterpiece
","At the time of this writing, Disney-Pixar's Up has received a 98% rating at Rotten Tomatoes. That means that 98% of the nation's movie critics have given it the ""thumbs up."" Such a high rating almost never happens.<br/><br/>That said, any movie, no matter how great, can be over-hyped, which can ruin the experience. For example, Ratatouille received such acclaim that my initial viewing of it was met with disappointment (though I appreciated it much, much more the second time around). So, in the interest of not raising the bar too high, I will simply say that Up continues Pixar's streak of excellence.<br/><br/>Combining poignant and profound themes with memorable characters and a contagious sense of adventure is par for the course for the group that brought us Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille, and Wall-E. What do all these films have in common? They effectively tap into our childlike sense of wonder while never insulting our intelligence or emotional maturity (or that of children, for that matter).<br/><br/>Likewise, Pixar makes the most visually stunning and sharply humorous films of anyone doing animation right now. In fact, they make some of the best films, period. Up is no exception, and it ranks particularly high on my Pixar list because it did something the others didn't. It made me cry. Twice. Up got me going, with a pair of wordless moments (one towards the beginning, the other towards the end) that drive home how precious of a gift our lives are, as well as the people in them.<br/><br/>Don't worry, though, the movie is more of an adventure-comedy than a tearjerker. It simply has a beating heart, as the best adventures (and often the best comedies) do. It's thrilling. It's funny. For some reason I felt it dragged very slightly in the middle before kicking into high gear for the third act, but that's a minor complaint for something so thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. Oh, by the way, I wanted to take Doug (the dog) home with me. You will too. MY GRADE: A."
"abrahimsadek","9","0","1","28 December 2016"," Absolutely wonderful animated feature
","Absolutely wonderful animated feature, Pixar crafts a stunning, engrossing picture that is superbly animated and boasts a great cast of talented voice actors and a heartwarming story. I had heard plenty of great things about this film, and heard it was one of the sadder of Pixar's output. With that being said, the film is sad, but it so makes you feel good, and it's really one that makes you feel all sorts of things. I've seen many of Pixar's films, and each of them has that quality that makes it so good, with UP, we get something more, we get a film that goes deep in its story and adds a lot more depth into one film. One minute the tone is sad, heartfelt, the next, it's funny, whimsical and adventurous. But as a whole, Up is a standout picture, one of the finest of Pixar's animated features, and is highly entertaining from start to finish. If you want a great animated comedy, Up is a great film to watch and it's a film for all ages, one that has a simple, but well constructed story, and it is a film that just has plenty of charm to really make it standout, and it's easily one of the finest films that Pixar has ever produced. If you enjoy animated feature, Up will certainly deliver, and it's one of those movies that is purely entrancing from the first frame, and it doesn't let go until the wonderful final. Brilliantly animated, and with a great script Up is yet another solid animated feature from Pixar, who always deliver some truly wonderful, amusing and highly memorable pictures. Although there are some sad moments here and there, the film just makes you feel good, and as the film goes on, the story is richer, fuller and gets even more enjoyable. If you enjoy animated films, especially Pixar films, definitely don't pass up this great film. Up is one of the studios finest works, and that's saying something."

","Carl Fredricksen is a young 9-year-old boy who idolizes famous explorer Charles Muntz. Muntz has been accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant exotic bird he says he discovered at Paradise Falls, and vows to return there to catch one alive. One day, Carl befriends a girl named Ellie, who is also a fan of Muntz. She confides to Carl her desire to move her ""clubhouse""—an abandoned house in the neighborhood—to a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls. Carl and Ellie eventually get married and live together in the restored house. Carl sells toy balloons from a cart at a zoo Ellie opens. After suffering a miscarriage[7] and being told they cannot have a child, the two decide to realize their dream of visiting Paradise Falls. They try to save for the trip, but repeatedly end up spending the money on more pressing needs. Finally, an elderly Carl arranges for the trip, but Ellie suddenly becomes ill and dies."

","There is so many words that can describe this movie. Exciting, sad, amazing and so much more. And the fact it's 2016 and I've only seen it THIS YEAR?! I've been living under a rock! <br/><br/>I loved how they didn't use a character in their 20s or a teenager. Unlike most movies that are made nowadays, they used a 78 year old! That is pretty awesome if you ask me. <br/><br/>There was many emotional scenes in this film. For example, Ellie's death. Another time I cried (Well, I didn't cry..I almost did tear up though) was when I read the quote ""Thanks for the adventure, now go have a new one!"". That is probably my favorite movie quote EVER!<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is now my favorite Pixar movie so far. Without hesitation I would give it a 10/10. Such a beautiful, but sad movie!"

","First, I was surprised at the title of this film. In Japan, the title is ""Old Carl and a house which flies in the sky"", so I thought ""Up"" was too short.<br/><br/>anyway, the story describes isolation which characters in this film have very well. Carl lost his beloved wife. They have no child, so he starts to live alone. Russell feels a gap between he and his father so he feels lonely. Charles Muntz is a villain of this film, but he is unfortunate circumstance. He was denied his opinion by everyone and people who praised him fell away from him when he was young, so he becomes a person who can't believe anyone bu his dogs. These situation can occur around us, so I think this story is not only fantasy but also human story. Friendship beyond the age and the species impresses viewers. Also the scene which Carl's house flying with colorful balloons in the sky is one of the best part of it."

","it has a touching message. this is its basic virtue. and, maybe, the most important. because it is a simple story about solitude, fundamental meetings, childhood, oldness and the dreams. because it is an adorable version of The Wizard of Oz for a generation who believes to have is more important than to be. and one of the applause for this splendid animation must be for the work of Edward Asner who impose a real fascinating Carl. not the adventure are the essence of film but the science to explore the essential traits of the ages. the beautiful transformation of characters who discover the meaning of life. the new perspectives about the past. and, sure, the importance of memories for an age who lives in the circle of memories and has the chance to discover the fascination of a living dream."

For Carl Fredricksen what adventure looked like was this wild exploration of South Africa. For Ellie a life with the love of her life was adventurous enough.

"ElMaruecan82","9","0","1","30 June 2016"," Air of Dreams...
","I see some spiritual connections between Pete Docter's ""Up"" and ""Field of Dreams"", both about men who missed opportunities for reality's sake before embarking in fantastic eye-opening experiences and coming to terms with their past. And both have this daringness of scripts starting with real people living real situations, yet never shaking our belief that the impossible can happen, former baseball players coming from heaven or hundreds and hundreds of colored balloons taking a house to the most remote place of the world, somewhere in South America. <br/><br/>But there's more in ""Up"" than the adventure of a cranky old man and a little kid; by the time, the house takes off, literally, we already handled more emotionality than all the previous Pixar movies put together, and this is what makes this sight so rewarding, so relieving after the unforgettable prologue. Indeed, if there is one sequence from 2009 that became an instant classic, and you better believe it will still be in twenty years, it's the magnificent marital-life montage sequence, sublimated by Michael Giacchino's Oscar-winning score. It all starts with Carl as a little bespectacled boy idolizing adventurer Charles Muntz and dreaming to join him in the Lost Word to admire the Paradise Falls. On his way home, he meets Ellie, a free-spirited little girl who talks for two, the two kids share the same dreams.<br/><br/>And the magic of ""Up"" is to convey messages through simple visuals, Carl meets Ellie when losing his balloon, he gets to the hospital by trying to get it, she then sends it back with a little gift tied to it, so Carl and Ellie's love story is constantly associated with balloons, and Carl's job as a balloon vendor might be the humblest way to emulate his hero's zeppelin. So Carl and Ellie get married and from the clouds they gaze at, they form exotic creatures, symbols of their escapist dreams. Reality slowly fades in and starts to inspire such forms as toddlers, unfortunately, the couple can't. Then they decide to save money for their travel, putting nickels and dimes in a jar, but life always find a way: a flat tire, a roof destruction, ordinary hazards postpone then erase the dream. Only love hasn't been tarnished by the passing of time, but the tragedy of such couples is that one ought to live some time. So Ellie finally dies, leaving Carl alone with his memories their house.<br/><br/>This is a marvel of storytelling, no words or lyrics, only a musical theme to complete a sequence whose timeless and universal appeal is comparable to the ending of ""City Lights"", because I refuse to believe there's anyone in this world who can't relate to Carl and Ellie, and even if you watched the scene with cynicism-tainted glasses and thought their life was boring, in a later scene, the little kid says something like ""funny how we remember the most boring stuff"". This line sums up everything, Carl had a happy life with Ellie, and it's all up to him to make the rest of his life as happy. I think it was John Lennon who said that life was what happened to us while we're busy making plans, well this totally applies to Carl, certainly one of the most fascinating characters of Pixar, I want to say, if only for the fact that he's an old man, and that the villain (voiced by Christopher Plummer) is even older.<br/><br/>Their age is important because the two men have one thing in common, they're prisoners of their past, naturally each one finds a different way to fight the demons. Carl's present was Ellie, once she was dead, he couldn't connect with anything related to his time, only living in a world of memories and dusty pictures, even keeping the little house from the estate investors who want to buy him out. Carl categorically refuses until the day he hits a worker and then is forced to put in retirement home, losing his only remaining link with the past. Carl is left with no other choice than project himself into the future and what more glorious than the one he always prepared with Ellie. So, using all the balloons he could collect during years of services, he takes his house to the air.<br/><br/>The movie gets a bit more conventional once the house picks off, featuring some magnificent locations, high mountains with oddly flat summits, oddly shaped rocks and oddly colored creatures, towering over the tropical jungles, so high and so remote that no human ever set the foot there. And beyond the escapism, there is this eternal love story that drives Carl, and there's the little kid, an Asian overweight scout who starts like a comic relief until you see he has a few things in common with Carl besides the fact that both act realistically, according to their age. Russell's dream is to get the 'Assist the Elderly' badge and to spend more time with his Dad, the fact that he calls his mother by her first name might be a hint that he's an adopted orphan. Russell is like the total opposite of Carl, it's the absence of love that makes his banal dream impossible, while Carl had all the love he needed and that's what made his extraordinary dream possible.<br/><br/>Carl and Russell's journey isn't devoid of humor, an exotic bird and a bunch of robotic dogs provide some laughs, but the story ultimately works because we genuinely care for the characters. There aren't many but that allows them to have more realism, texture and personality than any other standard animated character. And this is integral to the story's appeal as it invites us to reconsider our life and what we call failures, to make us forgive our mistakes and embrace the future with more optimism, and as ""Up""'s ending suggests, the ground can be as a great field of dreams as the air."

","When discussing ""Up"" many point towards the emotional, beautiful introduction of the film and see it as a decline from said point. I would disagree, though the beginning is unrivaled in all animated movies, the laughs and tears continue throughout the duration of the Pete Docter directed flick. Docter's team does an amazing job of blending the scaled animation of Carl's home with the expansive landscape explored through the Carl and Russell's journey. The variety of characters displayed by Pixar will keep all audiences entertained. As any good flick should do, it pulls at your heartstrings, lets loose your eye ducts, and even makes you snicker!"

","Up is just one more reason why 2009 can be considered among the best years in modern animation. The animation is pristinely captured and rendered, making each scene colorful (in the elderly person style, but it fits) and completely watchable at worst. The characters are a blast to have on screen or off (if Russell is a tad obnoxious), and the story has among the best balances of originality and cliché I have seen in a Pixar movie (up there with Monsters. Inc, which didn't take too much advantage of its originality), all because of its execution. The prologue, of course, is what most people will hold memories of, connecting to the lives of any widowers or widows who might watch this movie with their grandchildren or someone else. Even after leaving it, Pixar put in quite an amount of labor in creating the Venezuelan rainforest that the rest of the movie would be set in (please do not take that literally). The jokes work as does the action, and it sums up to a movie that anyone would (or should) appreciate. Pixar, you have crafted another champion, and I have optimism that you will continue to do so in the future (little did I know that only one movie past this point until the Dark Age would be such)."

"buckne","10","0","2","29 April 2016"," Adventure is out there
","This movie is about an endearing adventure between unlikely companions that become friends. Ed Asner voices the character of Carl Fredricksen, an elderly gentleman that faces his future without his beloved wife Ellie. Carl meets the character voiced by Jordan Nagai, Russel, a young boy trying to earn a badge for Wilderness Explorers when Russel knocks on Carl's door. Through unfortunate circumstances, Carl was being forced into an elderly home, and he decided he was going take chances and float his home to Paradise Falls to fulfill a promise he made to Ellie. He connects helium balloons to his house to achieve that promise, but life teaches him the lesson of letting go of the past and moving on with his life.<br/><br/>Unbeknown to Carl, Russel was at the house when it takes off and Carl had no choice but to let him in. Carl is so focused on keeping all his precious mementos of his life with Ellie that Carl gets them to South America. While trying to walk his house to the Paradise Falls, Carl and Russel meet a bird that Russel calls Kevin and a dog, voiced by Bob Peterson, named Dug. Dug's owner, Charles Muntz, voiced by Christopher Plummer, has been searching for this bird to clear his name that he was alleged to have created. His catch phrase was ""Adventure is out there,"" but he was unable to let go of the search for the bird. He was left holding on to his past, and never made any new adventures. Meeting Charles, causes Carl and Russel to freeing Kevin from Charles' blimp and they make memories together. Carl realizes that Ellie's adventures with Carl meant everything to her, and after looking in Ellie's My Adventure scrapbook he reads that she wants him to make new adventures when she is gone.<br/><br/>This movie uses balloons as a motif. When Carl and Ellie first meet, Carl has a blue balloon. He accidentally lets it go when Ellie startled him. Ellie brings the balloon back to him and that is where their friendship begins. They also use balloons during the picnic when Carl buys tickets for them to go to Venezuela. He has balloons tied to the picnic basket. Carl also sits by himself with a blue balloon at her funeral. Of course, Carl uses balloons to float his house which begins his new adventures with Russell. <br/><br/>Another film technique that this movie uses well is montage. To show the life of love that Ellie and Carl share together they show brief moments of their lives. They get married, buy the house where they first met, the fun they had, the desire to expand their family, the devastating news that they could not have children, and all the moments up to Ellie's death. They give you the lifetime of them together without this being the main focus on the movie. They also show a Carl and Russel montage at the end. They show that Carl was able to make new adventures.<br/><br/>Another Disney Pixar movie that shares the theme of letting go would be Finding Nemo. When Marvin has to let his past fears of danger go to help his son, Nemo, that was caught by a scuba driver. Marvin and Carl both learn that by letting go, they too can find the adventure that is out there."
"lisafordeay","8","0","1","4 January 2016"," At first I actually hated this movie but now I actually really like this film.
","Up is a Oscar winning animated film from Pixar that tells the story of an elderly man who whisks his house away by using balloons and goes to the falls where his deceased wife wanted to go. Along the journey he teams up with a scout named Russell,a dog named Dug and a peacock and together they go off on an adventure. The animation in this film is very well done and the first 10 minutes of this film is very sentimental where we see Carl(Ed Asher from Elf)who meets his future wife who was a real tomboy and we as the audience get to see them growing up to actually falling in love to actually growing old together. That was just genius the way the filmmakers did this. Also the story is very good too and if you haven't seen this movie I strongly recommend it. <br/><br/>When I first seen this film first I actually despise it because it felt rather boring and just too overrated for my likings. But when I finally seen it again another few times I actually changed my mind on it and ended up liking the film."
"luke-a-mcgowan","7","0","1","25 August 2015"," Its great but lets not call it the best Pixar because its not
","I am certainly not as enamoured by this film as the rest of the free world seems to be. Its funny, touching and good, but its nary a patch on Finding Nemo or Toy Story or Monsters Inc. <br/><br/>The story of Carl and Ellie's was beautiful and poignant. I loved that Ellie's family were gun- toting nuts and Carl's were stiff straight shooters, so that Ellie's sense of adventure was both a positive influence and a point of attraction to young Carl. One little scene in the montage of Carl finding their dream jar was absolutely wrenching. After she goes, Ellie remains a delightful influence on the story, especially one final scene where Carl opens her dream adventure book and finds that she has filled it with her life with him - showing us that Ellie was happier with the adventure she did have than the adventure Carl thinks she missed. The closure given to Carl was really beautiful. <br/><br/>However, these beautiful scenes happen in the midst of a rather dull and conventional adventure (certainly by Pixar standards). Carl's desire to move his house to Paradise Falls, yes, but his and Russell's side quest to save the world's most annoying bird is more of the preachy environmentalism I saw and found irritating in WALL-E. Christopher Plummer pops up to voice the villain Charles Muntz, who just wants to capture the bird and save his reputation that was ""Gary Webb""ed sixty years prior. Without the classy and honest Pixar execution, I'd probably have been rooting for Muntz to get that stupid bird back home. <br/><br/>I found Carl and Russell an adequate Pixar team - good to root for but I found myself not particularly caring about their falling out later in the film, which is a far cry from Woody-Buzz or Mike-Sully. The best character of the film is the lovable Dug, a gentle outcast from Muntz's pack of talking dogs, who steals the entire movie with his dopey optimism and beautifully written dog dialogue.<br/><br/>Up is colourful (I never get sick of looking at the ballooned house), funny (see one hilarious scene where Carl imagines lowering Russell down to the buildings below) and touching (oh Ellie), but if I have to choose between Up and one of Pixar's early 2000's films, I know where my heart will always lie."
"OllieSuave-007","7","0","1","9 July 2015"," Heartfelt and very imaginative.
","Pixar's Up is a heartfelt and very imaginative animated film, where 78 year-old Carl Fredricksen makes a promise to his carefree wife Elle that he will travel to Paradise Falls in South America. Faced with being sent to a retirement home, Carl seeks to fulfill his promise to Elle and journeys to South America up in his house, pulled by tons of balloons, with a wilderness scout stowaway in tow.<br/><br/>The animation is bright and brilliant and the story will tug at your heart strings, especially during the first part of the movie where we see Carl and Elle's love and bond for each other, and then years later when we see an aged Carl facing loneliness and moping about in his house. It makes you feel for the elderly and makes you think of your own family. <br/><br/>The second half of the movie is more adventure and action oriented, with overly imaginative elements like talking dogs with beeping collars. While I know this is a fantasy movie, the talking dogs do overshadow the heartfelt element and slows down the story quite a bit. I felt that it turned into just another animated movie about animals at times. <br/><br/>But, what's also wonderful about the movie is the relationship between Carl and the scout stowaway, Russell. He's the all-around innocent and inquisitive kid who wants to help Carl to earn his helping-the-elderly badge. But, their interaction with each other grows into friendship throughout the movie and is heartfelt.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a movie that will have you reminiscing and missing the ""good ol' days"" but will also cheer you on in search of new adventures.<br/><br/>Grade B-"

In South America, they saved a colorful bird from an explorer, Charles Muntz, who wanted to take the bird to scientists and was searching for it for many years. Carl lost his house in the end but he owned Charles balloon ship and traveled with Russell happily. Carl was the main character in the movie. He really loved his wife Ellie and they had the same dream - having an adventure to South America. Ellie wanted to built a house on the top of the Paradise Fall when she was young. Carl was a determined person and carried on their dreams. Though he was very old and his wife had passed away, he took the trip immediately that nobody could imagine. Finally he passed his love on to the little boy. Russell was a little hero in the movie and brave. He desired a real adventure. Facing danger, he still wanted to save his friend. He was really friendly and kind to animals. Charles was an overambitious and cruel person. He decided not to come back to England until he found the bird when he was doubted by the public. He lived in field for many years. At first he was kind to Carl and Russell and invited them to dinner. But when he found the bird was their friend, he wanted to kill them without mercy and catch the bird. He had many dogs. His favorite one was Alpha, who was the same ambitious and cruel as him. Alpha had two sidekicks, Beta and Gamma, who had no ideas and always did things what Alpha told them to do. Kevin was the colorful bird and became their friend. She was big but not strong. She liked eating chocolate and had three kids. <br/><br/>The movie is educational but ordinary. At the beginning, Carl and Eille grew up so fast that made the audience overwhelmed.

"suresh_raj92","9","0","1","8 January 2015"," Up is most certainly up there as one of Pixar's finest
","Up is the charming tale of adventure and is one of the best films to come off the exceptionally strong Pixar production line. Elderly Carl Fredericksen (Ed Asner) does not wish to end his days in a retirement home or in a soulless district of high-rise buildings and in remembering a promise to his late wife, Ellie floats his multicoloured home away with an incredible number of multicoloured balloons. Naturally, a group of scientists somewhere decided to stop everything they were doing and applied a multitude of calculations to see if this was genuinely possible (a team from NatIonal Geographic managed to fly a custom built house 10,000 feet into the air with 300 eight-foot-high helium balloons). <br/><br/>Accompanying Fredericksen is Russell, an eager young boy with his own desire for adventure as they fly themselves to Paradise Falls, supposedly somewhere in South America. Both characters are brilliantly realized and manage to form a heartwarming bond over their course of their trip. Later, they are joined by Dug, an adorable talking dog and Kevin, a mythical bird like creature and seemingly an amalgam of an ostrich, peacock and pelican, as they set off on the adventure Fredericksen has been craving his whole life. <br/><br/>Few films are able to invoke such a broad range of emotions like Up. One would have to possess a heart of stone not to be moved by the montage of Carl and Ellie growing old together. And this was all in the first twenty minutes. Not since Jessie's touching back-story montage in Toy Story 2 has an animated scene been so heart wrenching. The tone does lighten inevitably and there are many laughs to be had before the adventurers find themselves in grave peril in a breathless action-packed conclusion. All is remarkably achieved within the 96 minute running time, which will fly by and there is never a dull moment to be had throughout. <br/><br/>All of this is expertly underwritten by Michael Giacchino's award-winning score, which contributes enormously to the charm and illustrates the difference a good soundtrack has to a finished movie. This is most certainly fun for all the family and adults will be able to spot the inspiration of classic titles centred around a character's rebirth (Casablanca and A Christmas Carol) in addition to a cautionary note on meeting your heroes. <br/><br/>Unmissable for the whole family."

This is when the kid comes into it & shows him the innocence and gets him into fulfilling lifelong dream to let his house fly with millions of balloons, to escape from the restraints of the world. After that they get into the wild jungle and find a new funny companion, the dog. I personally loved how stupid and lovely at the same time the dog was. The evil later on with a career driven old adventurer was the action & suspense it maybe needed but it doesn't felt to be that necessary.

","Is very good movie , i like it p is a 2009 American 3D computer-animated comedy-adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by Pete Docter, the film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner) and an earnest young Wilderness Explorer named Russell (Jordan Nagai). By tying thousands of balloons to his home, 78-year- old Carl sets out to fulfill his dream to see the wilds of South America and to complete a promise made to his late lifelong love. The film was co- directed by Bob Peterson, with music composed by Michael Giacchino.<br/><br/>Docter began working on the story in 2004, which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. The floating house is attached by a varying number between 10,000 and 20,000 balloons in the film's sequences. Up was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.[3]<br/><br/>Up was released on May 29, 2009 and opened the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first animated and 3D film to do so.[4] The film became a great financial success, accumulating over $731 million in its theatrical release. Up received critical acclaim, with most reviewers commending the humor and heart of the film. Edward Asner was praised for his portrayal of Carl, and a montage of Carl and his wife Ellie aging together was widely lauded. The film received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, making it the second animated film in history to receive such a nomination (and Pixar's first Best Picture nomination), following Beauty and the Beast (1991)"

","It's a must take adventure. Go UP and UP and UP!!!<br/><br/>I watched it in theatre in Pune in 2009 and revisited this today and wow, still so nice and fun it is. The first 15 minutes made my heart melt and the last 15 minutes made my heart pound and race. Wow, what an adventure it was. It was more about a bird named Kevin than about the old man Fredricksen. <br/><br/>As any pixar movie which have been released till TOY STORY 3, this is simply atop in terms of animation and story telling, they just weave animation into great stories and create movies that are much better than most. Yes, it's memorable and still we would dive into the adventures more as we go and see them. UP for sure is one such cinema though it may be a bit uncharacteristic as most other PIXAR films did not have humans as their protagonists. <br/><br/>Here, we have an old man who wants to go to see a place called paradise falls just that he wants to end his trip of life by fulfilling the last wish of his wife that is to see paradise falls. He is joined by the wilderness explorer Russell and the cute dog named DUG. These guys join in together and form a team to accomplish there mission of paradise falls and to save the bird Kevin. But, save Kevin from what and why? Hmm, just go and fin out in this beautiful piece of cinema that for sure is going to make you please, given that you like good animated cinema.<br/><br/>All is great, the details are remarkable and the story is spell binding, in fact it's just a trip. Kudos once again to the great team of PIXAR who have made us joyful yet again in cinemas. If you have not seen in theatres, that's OK, get a DVD or better a BLU RAY and have fun. Everything is just right in this film. Having said that, if you have watched many PIXAR or animated films, you might have predicted early itself what PIXAR has go to offer, so that's the only thing we need to think about. Yet, as a good cinema fan, I would give this 5/5. Another 5/5 to a PIXAR movie and they keep making me happier each time I get back to their films.<br/><br/>Thanks to PIXAR team for this adventure."

","UP! Is Disney & Pixar's 2009 animated story of Carl Fredricksen (Edward Asner) and Russell (Jordan Nagai) and their adventurous airborne journey to Paradise Falls. The dominant thematic elements in UP! are the focus on character, emotional effect and mood, the complexity of human relationships, and the coming of age. The story begins with Carl, a 78-year-old widower and the struggle he is facing to keep the city from turning his home into a construction site. As the pressure to avoid the nursing home as well as releasing his homeowner rights to the city intensifies, he develops the brilliant idea to leave town by balloon. Carl hopes to complete his book of adventures he and his late wife Eleanor were unable to complete. Unbeknownst to him, Russell, the 8-year-old neighborhood Wilderness Explorer sneaks his way onto the house as it departs to South America. <br/><br/>As the story progresses viewers are introduced to the similarities Carl and Russell share, as well as the changing dynamics between the characters. Carl is learning to live, love, let go, and embark on new adventures, without his beloved wife Eleanor while Russell is discovering his hidden strength and confidence. The consistent use of a bold color pallet enhances the theme, emotional and visual effects on perception in the film. For example, Carl and his house are often depicted in bland Earth-tone colors, reflecting his current unexciting stage in life. We also see elements of dark, Earth-tone colors in the scenes leading to an altercation between Carl, Russell and Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). <br/><br/>Diving deeper into the plot, we see a colorful and exciting additions to the color pallet associated with excitement, calmness, happiness, etc. A great example is the use of color in the house's balloons, Paradise Falls, and in Kevin, the bird. The use of visible sound and invisible sound enhanced the viewing experience, creating a life- like setting through special effects from the sounds of animals and insects in the jungle to the creaking floorboards in Carl's house, as well as the scores used in climactic scenes.<br/><br/>In addition to an eventful plot, UP! introduced heavy issues for both child and adult audiences through its message of the coming of age. The young (Russell) teaching Carl detach himself from his state of depression, returning to the times of his younger years that motivated him to take a chance. The old (Carl) teaching Russell to leaves his timidity behind in efforts to earn the Wilderness Explorer badge of his dreams, despite his battles with insecurity. Overall, UP! is a great addition to the Disney-Pixar collection and is a viewing experience the family can enjoy."

Its 3-dimensional characters are some of the best characters I've seen, its plot is adventurous yet at the same time believable and its soundtrack is pretty darn good too.

","A near perfect gem. Pixar does it again. Up has everything one would want in a movie.

Almost everything has texture making the film seem that much more real. <br/><br/>With all that being said, the cgi is not what makes Up great. It's the story. It's not often a film is based around an elderly character. This allowed the film to explore themes that are usually avoided in most Hollywood films. <br/><br/>Themes like getting older and losing a loved one and having to move on might seem a bit heavy for an animated film, but it never pounds you over the head with it. <br/><br/>Another great part of Up is some of the action sequences. Some of the action scenes will have you on the edge of your seat. Hollywood action films could learn a thing or two about how to plot out an action scene. <br/><br/>In the end, Up has something for everybody. Kids will love the animals.

","Up is not my favorite Pixar movie, but I welcome its arrival. I'd rather see dozens of movies like this than one more ugly sequel to Shrek or Madagascar or Ice Age. Pixar views their films as creative and artistic endeavors; Dreamworks and Fox see theirs as products. With Pixar, it's about the movie. With most other animated features, it's about the marketing. There are some great moments in Up, and it may be the funniest thing Pixar has done in a long time, but even the aspects of Up that lack greatness are not bad, and that's worth applauding<br/><br/>Up falls under the umbrella of a tried-and-true formula: the old man/young kid ""buddy film."" This may be, however, the first time this Hollywood staple has been translated effectively into an animated format. As with most movies of this sort, the old guy - 78-year old Carl Fredricksen (voice of Edward Asner) - is a grumpy sort: set in his ways and not welcoming of strangers. The young guy - cub scout Russell (Jordan Nagai) - is full of innocence and wide-eyed optimism. During the course of the film, the two bond and learn from one another although, as is often the case, Carl's schooling strikes a little deeper. The boy who is a nuisance at the beginning has become a valued companion by the end."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","10 January 2014"," A bit too sporadic for my tastes, but still a really good film
","For me, Pixar has always been at their best when they don't try to tell you anything, they simply allow the animation to tell its own story. Likewise with this film. The early silent montage of Carl (voiced by Edward Asner) and Ellie (Elie Docter) getting married and just growing old together is... it's unbelievable. Beautiful, touching, heart-breaking, it's one of the most potent scenes I've seen in a long time. Had the rest of the film been equally as good, this film would be in my Top Five.<br/><br/>Alas, for me this film's downfall are its characters. I honestly really like Carl alone. He has this wonderful curmudgeon thing down pat, yet he's still extremely likable and you feel for the guy. Especially because you've just seen a few minutes ago what a great guy and husband he was, and now he has to struggle with both the loss of his wife and the loss of his dreams. Great, great character.<br/><br/>The rest... are okay, for the most part. I never formed any connection with them like I've done with many other Pixar characters. Russell (Jordan Nagai) strays between being annoying and being sympathetic, Charles Muntz's (Christopher Plummer) presence in the film is just bawling, the bird just elicited a bored ""huh"" out of me and the dogs... well, the dogs were actually okay in a good way. They got a few laughs out of me and they were both cute and menacing as the story demanded.<br/><br/>I have nothing bad to say about the story, which is a sweet and interesting romp through various situations, all of which look great and keep up your interest. But even a great story is built on top of its characters and if you don't feel for those characters, the story is really nothing more than a series of scenes, locations and actions strung together.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm being too negative here. This is a good film. It's great for kids and adults alike, it has one great character in it and the rest are up to the task as well, it looks amazing and has some wonderfully imaginative scenes in it. For some reason I personally don't care too much for it, but that's just me and pretty much everyone else I know loves this film. I'm sure you will as well."
"richieandsam","7","0","1","30 December 2013"," Another great film, but with a few big surprises that you don't see in any other Disney movie.
","UP<br/><br/>Well... this movie is a surprise.<br/><br/>A guy promises his wife that they will go to Paradise Falls to live one day... but as their lives together go on, they let the dream slip away. But when his wife dies he ties a load of balloons to his house and floats it to Paradise Falls.<br/><br/>It is a great adventure just like every other Disney film... which is a good thing. After all that is what I love about Disney.<br/><br/>There are some big differences in this movie though. Firstly the beginning of the movie is very sad. As I have stated above, the main characters wife dies. Now I know this is rare in a Disney film, but not unheard of. I know Bambi's mum got shot and Simbas dad was murdered... but this was different. She not only died of old age, but during their life you are made aware that she had a miscarriage. It is a very risky move from Disney to add this to the film. It really was not needed, but it did add to the back story. It was a very sad start to the film which I never felt with a Disney movie before.<br/><br/>Secondly... there was blood! There is a scene in the film where the old man is having an argument with a builder... and he gets very frustrated and hits the builder on the head with his walking frame. The next thing you see is the builder on the floor with blood coming from his head. Now I might be wrong, but I do not remember ever seeing blood in a Disney film. It actually shocked me a little bit as it just seemed out of place. Normally when a character get's a hit of the head there is a bump or red mark, but never blood. This was another bold move, but just felt unnecessary.<br/><br/>The story was very good. I loved the idea of the old man after many years doing what he promised his wife. I think everyone should finish what they started before they pass on. It was a film about completion. The old man was not very likable in places. He was a mean old man who was horrible to almost everyone. The little boy that went with him on his adventure was brilliant. I thought he was very funny and I felt so sorry for him in places. One of my favourite characters was the talking dog. He was great. I laughed so much when he was chasing the ball and squirrels. What a great character.<br/><br/>After this film was made, someone actually tried lifting a little shed with a load of balloons to see if it was possible... it was. They actually got the shed off of the ground. There was a documentary made about it.<br/><br/>A very moving story and possibly one of the saddest Disney films made. It is definitely worth watching and enjoying more than once.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>""Won't you please be my prisoner, please, please, please!""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

","If there is one thing that could be said about life, without an argument is in its own chaotic way, it is an adventure. It is beautiful and horrid to experience. It shapes us in many fashions as we experience every moment, learning more and more about ourselves. Whatever goals we have in life are part of the self-developing construct that helps us better in choosing whichever direction that intrigues us. This adventure is wondrous in its mystery and just as frightening in the same respect that in the end of this journey there is death. What follows after, who's to say? Modeling their love for exploring after famous explorer Charles F. Muntz (Plummer), Carl Fredericksen (Asher) and his wife Ellie (Docter) have looked at the prospect of exploring with the same charisma of their idle, believing in simply the journey. Their hope to reach a place known as Paradise Falls has been their one and only dream in life. Sadly because of the many pressures life brings forth, dreams are often left on a shelf for many years before they can be opened and fully realized. Not long after a poetically musical montage of introduction, Ellie passes on to hopefully a better place, leaving Carl alone, and with little spirit left to move forward. The story picks up later with Carl, a little more cynical and bitter, with his house blocking a construction site. After a misunderstood accident with a worker, Carl is forced into a retirement home. Gratefully though, as many senior citizens are encouraged to by yours truly, Carl refutes such a notion of indifferent hospitality, as he turns his home into a makeshift airship, embarking towards Paradise Falls, in the hope for just one more adventure, for his sake and Ellie's.<br/><br/>Joining Carl on this journey comes a chubby, and overly talkative boy scout named Russell (Jordan), who in accompanying Carl, hopes to acquire his final merit badge from assisting the elderly. Russell being an Asian character, played by an Asian actor is both delightful and charming through his innocence and his good nature, and giving a more cultural relevance to his identity, rather than the typical stereotype. No matter how many times he refers to Carl, as ""Mr. Fredericksen"", the cynical look on his disgruntled face marks a comic humor that has never lost its touch within these soulful comedies. Along their journey, the duo, lets call them that because eventually through their adventure they become heroes in their own manner, encounter many hardships, and meet many new friends as they head for Paradise Falls. First comes a large and colorful bird, who Russell names Kevin, and then a talking dog. Yes a talking dog, as hard as it is to believe, but then again its Disney so logic is somewhat out the window. Speaking of which, that really what the filmmakers are intending really when exploring such a simple concept in Disney film no less.<br/><br/>In an existentialist perspective, UP is beautiful in the poetry it tries to convey when discussing the subject of life. Early in the beginning of the film, after his wife's death, Carl has lost his zeal for life. His passion to explore, resulting in his demeanor being more negative and antagonistic towards strangers. His journey to Paradise Falls within the film is in its own way more of a spiritual journey as Carl heads towards a destination he and his wife envisioned as the ultimate adventure. Now this is to say that in death, as we carry out the wishes of our lost loved ones we take on an essence of their desires, as they live on in us, thus ushering a sense of immortality within the memories we still treasure of them. So Carl's journey, whether successful or unsuccessful is not the key goal. It is really the spirit he embodies as he carries the wishes of his wife, out of love for her, and in this journey he discards the anger he holds as he experiences the very adventure that shaped his childhood and formed his character. If anything, Up is beautiful within the simplicity it draws strength from, giving the prospect of life a purpose within on our own nature, as we are pattern seekers, and as we pursue knowledge, be it in science, philosophy, literature, art, or even religion, it all amounts to the spirit in which we take it to ourselves to make this complex journey we call life, hopefully with no regrets and no desire to limit ourselves."

Obviously the decisions towards the ending gives a character somewhat what they wanted, but my friend believes that showing that scene in the beginning was far too adult for a young audience. I merely saw it as part of the sequence it was illustrating. It was sad, quick and never really affected me UNTIL the end of said sequence. I suppose I just wish to know if someone else felt the same way as my friend did, and see if Pixar was in the right or wrong of bringing something so real that commonly affects couples into this extremely innocent and naive story. SAYING THAT, I applaud the creators for their maturity and handling of the subject matter.<br/><br/>Pixar's 10th feature is nevertheless gorgeous. It's charming and definitely stands up there as one of their best, ""up"" there with the original ""Toy Story"". Ed Asner as our lead Carl Fredricksen is possibly Disney's greatest character, and everyone else is suitably casted like every outing this company delivers.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: From the wonderful square skyscraper city, to the realistic cliffs and jungles of South America (Which the artists actually travelled to). ""UP"" is no doubt one of the most ambitious & emotional journeys a kids film could take you on. 10/10."
"almanjit25","10","0","2","14 December 2013"," This is not just an animated film, calling it so would be an unforgivable crime. This is art, this is heart and this is pure soul.
","Calling Up an animated film would be a vile insult for Up transcends this common ordinary denomination to stand as a beacon of hope for Hollywood and film making in general. Pixar created a masterpiece of art, they created the definition of cinematic magic. Never has there been a more enchanting, a more fascinating, a more spellbinding animated feature than Up. As i said this is not animation, it is something much more special. Up feels like a Newbery or Carnegie medal winning children's book that comes alive and captures the imagination and soul but this time instead of doing so with text it happens to do so on the silver screen. It feels more like these timeless, enduring and unfading works of pure literary imagination than just being a movie. Movies pale in comparison to Up. Yes i am comparing this film to award winning, timeless, generation spanning and magical literature because comparing Up to other films would be a far more severe insult than calling it an animated film. Up has the magical enchantment only found in books. Up takes all these great qualities that only books have to an even more extraordinary level. Do you want to know what that is? Pure unadulterated emotion. Emotion so profound and philosophical, so startling and deep. Emotion like nothing i have ever seen in animated films nor in almost all of the live action fare that has ever been created for that matter. The humanity in Up slays me. Humanity that is devoid in box office blockbusters and especially lacking in pretentious and fake independent artsy fartsy critics award winning fare.<br/><br/>What exactly is Up? I shall tell you. It is whimsy and imagination, it is unlike anything you have ever seen or experienced before. Is that it? No it is also an emotional and heart breaking roller coaster of a ride about a man who was always socially withdrawn from boyhood. It is about a young boy whose spirit was brought out by a young, quirky, vivacious and beyond special young girl who had a zeal for life. A girl who was his soul-mate. I have never found it apropos to use the word 'soul-mate' in my life as it is too a powerful and misused word. Though it is the perfect definition for what Carl and Ellie were to each other. She was a young budding naturalist who had a sense of adventure and discovery in her, something she and Carl so amazingly shared. Carl fell in love with Ellie, married her and had a life that was so beautiful and fulfilling, a true love that is so human and pure unlike anything ever depicted in the movies. These days these Indie flicks and their sterile, pretentious portrayals of soulless and bitter relationships, showing them to be the reality and order of the day, have raped the meaning of love. They brainwash spurned youths and empower the cynical fake artsy fartsy crowd to spread their pretentiousness and lack of life. I'm sorry cynics but pure love exists and i feel sorry for all of you who have never experienced it. It took an animated film to portray real love. Through heartache and pain they trudged on and never let a second of life or love slip them by. <br/><br/>Up is about the loss of a loved one, coping in an ever changing world that is becoming cold and sterile by the second. It is about social isolation and losing ones reason to live. It painfully portrays the loss of hope, deftly portraying the excruciating heartache of loneliness while illustrating the poetic beauty of courage and strength. Sounds profound and beautiful for a kids film huh?! Well it is certainly that and even more. Up is about love's enduring promise, the fulfillment of a dream. It is about keeping your dearly departed close to your soul and holding on to your one and only reason for living, your true love and best friend. It is about honoring the departed and never losing ones zeal and passion for life. It is about love beyond the afterlife. It is about soul searching adventure unlike anything you have ever experienced, finding the purest of friendships, recognizing innocence and letting it flourish and being there for someone so pure and impressionable. It is about kindred spirits. It is about love and friendship finding a way to heal broken hearts. Most of all it is about letting go for memories of love will always persist. Material items may come and go but emotions endured will never die. Up is mesmeric and perspicacious. It is about laughter and life. It says never let sadness take you away from this vast adventure we call life, live and cherish every second. When one adventure ends, it is not the end for another will begin, a new chapter. Up is about love. Love that will never die, never end for it exists in the heart. An invincible and unconquerable love that will never be extinguished and will motivate and inspire with courage, hope and strength unlike any ever know. It is about the end and also about the beginning.<br/><br/>This film is everything i have said and countless other beautiful things that words cannot portray. Carl, Ellie, Russell and Dug feel like family and not just characters. Up concentrates on the personal, on different relationships, with different meanings but at the end it is all about love.<br/><br/>Pixar delved deep into the soul to create an awe inspiring masterpiece that has and will always move me, inspire me and warm my heart, stir my soul and emotions in the most beautiful and touching ways possible. Up is Pixar's greatest triumph, it is the greatest animated film of all time. Even the word 'great' feels like too small a word to describe Up. Up may very well be the greatest film of all time."
"schmidteren","10","0","2","8 December 2013"," Magical Movie Experience
","Magical. That is the first word that comes to mind when describing this movie. <br/><br/>The movie has so many life lessons put into one, but none of them feel forced or are repeated so you start to feel sick. It has the perfect balance of action, everything just melts together and fits together. The mood and the storytelling, how it IS a animation, so over the top things works brilliant, the art direction supports this. I teared up several times during the film, already after few min, and I think you will to. <br/><br/>The pacing is brilliant, big concluding finale, nothing really overstays it's welcome. It has a lot of funny, clever jokes. It just puts a big smile onto your face, while also touching you in deep places, and with stuff we all think off. We want to do this, we want to do that. I know I do, forget to live in the now. Get over the past, it only does one thing, and that is hold you down, which this movie literally shows time again. Each time he makes bad decisions because of the past, the house gets lower and lower and harder to carry. <br/><br/>It's just a fantastic movie, I've seen more movies then I can count, and I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Everything blends together perfectly, I couldn't find a bad thing, even if I tried very hard. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading this, I hope you enjoyed the movie just as much as I did. And have a great day!<br/><br/>Just some notes I wrote down quickly when watching it, ill just put them here in the end, if anyone would be interested. <br/><br/>Important moment. Instead of trying to save what is already living ""Kevin"" A new partner/friend, he is still to bound by his past, his old love.<br/><br/>Whenever he makes bad calls he stumbles, and drags, everything is a chore <br/><br/>(I don't care about my writings being perfectly written, I do no corrections etc. I hope you can live with that, I myself prefer the raw stuff. When everything is too sterile, it's just boring to read. Errors is what gives personality to you, and to your writing.)"
"johnsc24-834-635580","10","0","1","3 November 2013"," Up, Is a very uplifting and fun story.
","In this uplifting animated story you will go on adventure with Carl Fredrickson (Edward Asner-voice) and a young adventurous Russell (Jordan Nagai-voice)an 8 year old boy, who is on a mission to obtain his last badge for his ""Helping the Elderly"" in his Wilderness Explorer Troop. Little did Russell know the extent he would be going on to obtain his ""Wilderness Explorer Badge "". In his ongoing persistence to help Carl, Russell travels to South America in a floating house, uplifted with balloons. Carl,is on his own mission that only he and Elie(Elie Doctor) knew, and Carl crossed his heart that they would complete their mission. Little did Carl know that Elie's adventure was fulfilled and now it was time to fulfill his.<br/><br/>This adventure begins when Carl was a young boy (Jeremy Leary), about the same age as Russell, Carl was a shy boy when he met Elie who will be a big influence in Carl's future. She was quite the opposite of Carl. She was loud, fun and eager to be an explorer and both Carl and Elie were true followers of Charles Muntz, (Chrisopher Plummer). The great explorer<br/><br/>In one of the first scenes you see Carl with his head gear and goggles,(just like Chales Muntz) Carl is in a cinema watching a film about the great explorer Charles Muntz. The lighting and coloring of this scene was almost as you were watching a real movie. The film that Carl was watching was in black and white and added some roughness to this film, other than that this was a very smooth cinematic scene. <br/><br/>The theme in this film is to be honest, sincere and adventurous. Carl had made a promise that he would help a little girl, Elie to be a true adventurer. Russell's goal was to obtain a Wilderness badge, his last one he needed to be a Wilderness Explorer. <br/><br/>This was a very good film to watch. The cinematic and coloring were unbelievable. The sound/audio were edited to a perfection. When the balloons burst through the roof of the house and it lifted from the ground the color was bright and surreal. As Carl was touching the ends of the balloons in the fireplace, the sound was the sound of someone tuning a musical instrument. The machinery tearing down the buildings around Carl's house, along with Carl using the megaphone were as though he was not an animation but a real person."

","Well I've given it a ten out of ten and I can say that myself and a number of other people I know just can't watch this movie.<br/><br/>In short we can't get it out of our minds that they are all dead and so constantly feel the need to burst into continuous tears all the way through...<br/><br/>You just know the boy got run over by the construction vehicle, the old man had a heart attack and then just as he floats of to heaven the boy appears again, only to be greeted by the bird he was trying to catch prior to getting stream rollered.<br/><br/>Then to make matters worse they suddenly find another old man with loads of, yes, dead dinosaur bones.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure what all the dogs have to do with this.<br/><br/>Stunning visuals and obviously a moving story but for me and other people I know too much to handle, in fact I have difficulty thinking about the movie without crying and I'm a 36 year old fully grown male!<br/><br/>If your watching it for a chilled night in with the kids and like balloons, this may burst your bubble.<br/><br/>I advise a quick prewatch before watching it in any company you don't mind bursting into tears around!"

"BelleSeleneXia","10","0","2","13 September 2013"," A Movie that Touches and Inspires
","It has been quite a while when I last watched this movie but the same emotions arise when I saw its cover by chance. I believe that this is a movie that will be remembered and cherished.<br/><br/>Within the short 96 minutes period of its existence I was literally being pulled into this movie on a voluntary basis: the characters enlivened me; the story simply devoured me. I was been forced to experience a spectrum of emotions; like a roller coaster, I held and released my breaths, as the movie showered me with its little twists and gently raised me to its climax.<br/><br/>78-year-old Carl actualized his promise to his wife, his dream and their dream. An absolutely crazy idea was fulfilled by a seemingly impossible mission via thousands of balloons, each symbolizing a share of hope. During this journey, Carl demonstrated qualities of perseverance, sincerity and loyalty, all of which touched my heart deeply. Russell, a wilderness explorer 70 years younger, is a sharp contrast to the main character. It bought joy, color and energy to the old man's life. Their relationship had gone through numerous turning points in this movie, all equally intriguing. Whether the story was occasionally hit by the talking dog, the evil villain or the rare bird, it was the emotional aspect of it all that captured my heart.<br/><br/>Carl and Ellie, the new generation of Romeo and Juliet; another golden symbol of eternal love, they represent the ideal marriage, which couples in the twenty-first century would strive for. <br/><br/>As the movie reached its end, I smiled to myself and admitted that despite all the changes that had occurred in our society, traditions and the old-fashioned life style have never gone obsolete nor disappeared. Even today, some of us are still being completely drawn to the exact same values as before, namely the goodness in human kind.<br/><br/>Belle Selene Xia<br/><br/>P.S. For some, this movie might be boring, too average or too slow in pace, as it had no heart-beating violence scene nor heart-throbbing princess love; it is merely a depiction of an old man, overcoming all the impossibilities and harshness of life, never forgo that one goal to strive for. Unlike other animation movies, I was not bored by its simplicity, confused by over-the-top performance nor disappointed by its superficiality. I believe that this is a quality movie whose ultimate goal is not to impress but to inspire."

"livstrongeva","9","0","1","24 August 2013"," Animated movies are not only for children
","I am usually a fan of good animated movies as they put very good ideas and themes through simple symbols. They have everything simple yet complex. But for children these topics go easy and subconsciously.<br/><br/>So this movie is how a person named Carl gets older after a wonderful and full of love life, he stays alone and finally when everybody wants him to go to the Old People's home, he packs up his helium balloons and flies away. Literally.<br/><br/>I actually did not know what this movie will be about when I sat down to watch it. I thought it's going to be some nice simple movie about relationship, but I did not expect for everybody to pack up and leave for South America. And I certainly did not expect talking dogs searching for a giant bird.<br/><br/>Most people might think that ""oh, it's an animated movie, it's for children, what the hell can I learn from it?"" Wellactually quite a lot, if it's good animated movie. You know, just because it's animated doesn't mean that it's worth nothing. It just like a movie with completely unknown actors. But hey, I'm getting of the topic.<br/><br/>What this movie shows for me (because we all might interpret it quite differently) is that adventure only stops when you allow it to stop. So, you're old. So, you live alone. So, you never traveled. That doesn't mean that you will never have any adventures. They are just around the corner. You can see it if you let it. Of course, sometimes we need help in order to spot them or to truly enjoy them. And our pride or loneliness might not allow us to let anyone help us. But it's not such a fun adventure if you're having it alone. Other people is what makes the adventure truly remembered. And sometimes one adventure is all you need to take another look at your life.<br/><br/>The way you see life, is it boring or no, depends on you and only you. If you are not allowing others to help you, you are the only one to blame if you say that you are lonely. I think these are great things to say to children who might start to say that they're bored. How can you be bored, when adventure is out there?"
"dr-wacker","Null","0","2","7 August 2013"," Best Pixar Surprise Yet
","This was to be the first disappointing Pixar movie that I would see. I was unbelievably surprised to find it was one of my most favorites. The preposterous idea of an old man flying his house around the world using balloons was successfully done in only a way that Pixar can deliver. This movie tells the tale of a bitter old man finding his youth again, a young kid without a father finding a role model, and a lonely dog finding an owner. The old tale is give new light using the wonder of animation to create a world of dense forest, towering cliffs, and even talking dogs. I would not have been able to grasp all the imagination and creativity within this movie had I not seen most of the other Pizar movies already. This movie is a delight for all ages."
"Stompgal_87","9","0","1","6 August 2013"," A bittersweet yet adventurous Disney Pixar film
","I have seen this film three times so far; once when my mum rented it, the second time on a plane to Dubai and the third time upon renting it myself. It is one of Pixar's best and it is better than 'Cars,' 'The Incredibles' and 'Ratatouille,' on par with 'A Bug's Life,' 'Finding Nemo,' 'Monsters, Inc.' and 'Wall-E' and nearly as good as the 'Toy Story' franchise.<br/><br/>This film has a fine mix of laugh-out-loud funny moments that totally save the film from being too boring (especially the scenes involving the talking dogs) and heartbreaking moments (the passing of Ellie at the end of the montage between her and Carl, which made my mum cry as well as the later scene where Carl looks at pictures of himself and Ellie in her Adventure Book) as well as a great variety of characters, beautifully-rendered backgrounds, in particular the surroundings of South America, and vibrant colours (especially the balloons that lift Carl's house and Kevin). Not only were the surroundings of South America beautifully rendered, but they are also realistic due to some of the film makers visiting Venezuela themselves. While a number of characters were modelled around basic shapes (Carl's square-shaped head and Russell's more rounded physique), they still had their distinct personalities such as Carl's grumpy- old-man yet ambitious nature, Russell's excitable yet assistive traits and Charles Muntz's good-guy-turned-evil character. If I could point out any flaws, they would be the fact that Muntz is still alive when Carl meets him in person, Dug's rather unfunny squirrel joke and Carl throwing the furniture out of his house to make it float again when there are still some balloons tied inside it. This made no sense at first but today I realised he did it since there were fewer balloons. I also found the cut on a man's head a bit too much for a family film after Carl hits him with his walking stick. Other than the flaws, there are some more positive points such as the Easter Egg of Lotso Huggin' Bear from 'Toy Story 3' in the little girl's bedroom during the first house-flight scene, a picture of Dug finally chasing a squirrel during the end credits, the end credits themselves looking like a scrapbook (which I thought were as unique as the end credits of 'Kung-Fu Panda') and the music which was jolly, tense and poignant in different places. I especially liked the incidental music during the Carl and Ellie montage because it is nostalgic-sounding and memorable.<br/><br/>On the whole, this is an entertaining film that is adventurous, funny and moving all at the same time. 9/10."

","I had heard and read so much about Up and after misunderstanding it to be George Clooney's Up In The Air, today, I only repent of not watching this sooner. I was hypnotized.<br/><br/>The animation has always been impeccable. But, what Up makes so special for me is the numerous number of life virtues inhibited in its sweet story. Wilderness, confidence, perseverance, love, humanity, wrongness & what-not, God! I am still stupefied by the panache. Although, the plot is set in improbable situations, I totally understand. It induces so much of emotions towards the end, it will affect you somehow.<br/><br/>To live the moment without repenting, to find happiness in every thing you do. To live loving others. To be adventurous. To not lose heart at the time of death. Up teaches you that, if you've forgotten. ""Carpe Diem!"" that is what Up shouts at you, with a voice of a nightingale. Music is cute.<br/><br/>The characters are so lively & genuine I can relate to them. And the humor just adds to the fun. The innocence of elderly & young, the adventure theme, and the underlying message is all worth to be considered. High priority. A great 9.6/10.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: No alibis for missing this. If you haven't watched this epic animation tale, buy the BluRay now & enjoy the details!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES<br/><br/>Profanity/Sex/Alcohol/Drugs: No | Violence: Mild | Gore: No (Everything is passable, mates.("
"tappingjeff","9","0","1","2 July 2013"," Out of This World and So Much More
","THE GIST: A delightfully charming film from the animation titans at Pixar, UP is simple, concise, moving, hilarious, and a masterful showcase of storytelling at its finest. Hailed as one of the best films of 2009, UP is gorgeously animated and filled with such original and memorable characters and content, it is no wonder that it has established itself as a modern classic. The famous opening is lush and emotional and provides a strong backbone for the adventure that follows. Seen as an ""unfinished love story"" and coming-of-age movie, UP reminds us of the kid in all of us, and it will make you laugh and cry and laugh again (and cry again), all in thanks to the terrific director, Pete Doctor, and the wild and transcendent screenplay by Doctor and Bob Peterson. I could go on for days about how and why this is a great great film, but i digress. Watch it and you'll understand.<br/><br/>THE BEST PART: The opening montage, heartwarming and heartbreaking, set to the whimsical and lovely Academy Award-winning score by Michael Giacchino.<br/><br/>THE VERDICT: In every way, UP takes you there, and never lets your feet touch the ground for every fantastic minute. One of the best animated films ever, surely, and perhaps one of the greatest modern films from the past 20 years."

"blackbird827","10","0","2","24 June 2013"," The first eight minutes say it all
","The first eight minutes spoke for the entity of this film. Pixar's montage of Ellie and Carl was not only animated really well, but was also one of the best uses of a montage I've seen recently (montages are tricky to use without being really clichéd or annoying or a mix of both). The 8 minute love story is a detailed recant that explains why Carl is so crotchety. Now, lately, Pixar has been in a decline with their ideas, popping out generic mini-animated things and making them talk coded gibberish, but Up was a diamond in the rough. Even if the kid annoys you, or you don't like love, or you hate dogs, the production of Up is one that remains superior to the recent Pixar attempts at grossing box offices. The plot that follows an angst old man, rather than an angst teen (it's a nice break), and his quest to fulfill the dream he and his wife shared flows steadily with the Scrooge technique of softening his heart. With well liked characters, I find that this is really a FAMILY MOVIE. I hardly find all movies ""family"" movies, because it's just not too common at all to find something produced in such a specific manner it fills the cinematographic mediums of all or most age groups. I don't just mean adults and toddlers will like it, but even your moody teenager might crack a half-smile at the movie. No promises. Pixar really did a good job this time."

","When you start to watch it, you may think that this movie was made for children. Then you realise it's way more then that. It brings us to think about the speed of life, and warn us to not waste time in useless stuff. If you play close attention there are many metaphors in the movie, many subtle ways to make you think: ""Oh, maybe I'm doing that wrong"". And look carefully, you may be doing so. I think it's like the book petit prince, if you watch it several times at different points of you life you will have a different epiphany every time. Loved the cranky way the old man talks and how he cares about stuff, even though he doesn't want to demonstrate it. I'd watch it again. Truly remarkable... I'll rewatch it a few years."

","If you were to pitch this story to a major film studio you'd have asphalt burns on your butt from when you hit the pavement: a boy meets a girl who shares her spirit of adventure, but adventure takes a back seat as life takes over and then unfulfilled he ends up lonely and old living in a house. Facing eviction he ties millions of balloons to his house so that he can fly to Peru. Russell, an earnest boy scout, accidentally follows him on his quest to find his dead wife's dream but then, together, they make new ones...<br/><br/>First things first. This is Pixar. The animation is wonderful. The art direction is sublime. The attention to detail is simply jaw dropping. It is a film that Blueray was designed for. I saw it in the cinema the first time and that really is the way to see this film.<br/><br/>The plot (as I have ineptly tried to summarize above) is fiendishly clever and you know where it is going but it doesn't matter. Some elements of the storyline are never fully explained and it is for you to work them out and I liked that. They're not rocket science, but it's nice not to be spoon fed.<br/><br/>The voice acting is wonderful and special mention should go to Edward Asner (who plays the lead) and Bob Peterson (who plays Doug). They bring the characters alive in a way that animation cannot.<br/><br/>The thing that sets this film apart is the subtext. Dream fulfillment. Regret. Grief. Anthropomorphisation. Adventure. Progress. I could go on. There is so much in this film it is amazing. This, however, makes it sound like a film for adults only but that is not true. My kids (4 & 6) adored it and laughed throughout, cowered at the exciting bits and shed a tear or two here and there.<br/><br/>Talking of tears the first 15mins of this film are brutal. Heart strings pulled, plucked and finally snapped. Makes Bambi look like a romcom..."

","Wicked entertaining, immensely funny, and emotionally heart-wrenching, UP is a phenomenal animated comedy. It's exciting, and incredibly adventurous, treading new ground that most Pixar movies don't get close to. Right from the get go, Up tugs at your heart strings, but soon enough Up's unique brand of comedic and cartoonish humor will have you laughing uncontrollably. <br/><br/>The story is fast paced, exciting, and whimsical but also very emotional. Up's sense of humor is totally solid as well, producing plenty of deep and hearty laughs. The animation, while not as detailed as WALL-E or Toy Story, is vibrant and fast paced. The film never lets up its brisk pace, and the exciting plot takes some unexpected twist and turns along the way that keeps the adventurous tone vibrant right up to the final action scene. <br/><br/>Up is funny, fast paced, and very charming. One or two moments of humor are intended for kids, but aside from that Up is a wonderful animated film!"

","I can't deny that's a popcorn movie made of impossible and unreal scenes and actions, such as typical Pixar and animated movies, but at the same time this movie talks about more than just simple subjects, like the difficulties of a senior man giving up his own stuff after living a whole life with his wife - that he met when they were both young, having the same interests (hobbys) and sweetness - giving up his house, his place that he lived all his life. The solution for this character's go to where he and his wife ever dream of, the ""Paradise Falls"" at the South America, finding a way to show his love for her, but he does that motivated by a incredible and unbelievable idea: tying thousand of balloons to his home. During this situation, he has to deal with a little boy discovering all the things the old man already ""discover"" (this sign means the stories can be comparable but the development of them is completely different, each one has its own purpose and consequences) Combining the elements for both kids and adults in a way them all can understand and appreciate, I recommend this movie with no doubt for everyone, that has its moments of laugh with talking dogs, an unpredictable evil and a super different kind of colorful bird. Such an adventure !"
"unrealcrasher","9","0","1","13 February 2013"," Thirst For Adventure
","UP is able to create a story that is so riveting and enthralling, you hardly pay attention to the fact that it is an animated adventure. It starts with a miniature story all in its own, of a boy and girl who fall in love and live together happily, then the woman passes away, and his second, more geriatric adventure begins. Hate the villains, love the heroes. That is the goal of all movies when it comes to creation of antagonists and protagonists is it not? Up manages to create characters that take form into real people. Their development adds to the peril of the movie by giving a tie to the characters. During most of the movie, a soft background music hums away, gently, hardly loud enough to notice. Without this music however, the story would be lacking a certain quaint feel. Soft and whimsical during the highs, low and menacing during the lows, this movie seems to have all the music exactly where it needs to be. In Pixar fashion, UP is a superbly animated film, unparalleled by any other ""cartoons"" of its time. UP is definitely in my recommended movies list. No matter how old, or young, all are welcome in this story of heroism and adventure."

","First lets say I am NOT a massive fan of Pixar movies. Sure, I've had my fair share of them, but it's not really a genre i'm overly fussed about. They were nothing more than fun entertainment made for all the family to watch and enjoy. Enter Up, a tale about a grumpy old man who, after a lifetime of misery and misfortune, goes on an adventure to the land he always dreamed of going to, bringing his house with him. The house isn't the only thing he brings with him, however, and he finds a small child named Russel tagging along for the journey too. What makes Up so interesting is the way it isn't just a typical run of the mill Pixar-type film. It's got all the elements of a comedy that you would expect already (with characters such as Russel adding a sense of light and happiness to the tale and a nice contrast to the more secluded and lonely character of Carl, and talking dogs bringing a relatable and goofy humour that keeps things moving) but the tale also stretches to be emotionally engaging. Carl's story is an emotional one and you really feel sorry for his character from very early on in the story. The first 10 minutes will make you cry (no joke) simply because it's such a relatable and down to earth issue yet effects his character in such a great way that really makes you understand why he is how he is. Towards the end of the movie you really do feel connected to his character and really want him to finally get the happiness he deserves. That's something that movies of ALL genres fail to pull off on a regular basis. The progression of the story is a little hit and miss, and elements such as a bad guy don't feel well placed or even necessary at all, but it does its job of continuing the story, mainly down to the great voice acting and writing, along with some real toung-in-cheek references to movie classics (Independence day fans will get what I mean) Whilst the movie could have been shorter, and a few scenes were a little pointless, by the end you really feel satisfied you were watching a well made and full movie. People of all ages can enjoy this movie. One of the best movies I have ever watched, and certainly the most solid from an emotional standpoint. I highly recommend this, whatever your age or movie tastes, for anyone to watch and enjoy."

","Many of my friends who saw it said they cried, so I was expecting a real tearjerker. It wasn't as bad (of a tearjerker) as I'd expected, or maybe I was prepared, but in any case, I loved the story!<br/><br/>The boy and dog were really cute, and the storyline and main character made me think about my own life. What is it that I really want to do, and why don't I do it? As this movie reminds us, nothing and no one lasts forever. Whatever you want to do in life, no matter how old you are or how long it's been, do it. What a wonderful, life- affirming message among the slew of dystopic movies about ""real life."" I love that this movie reminds us that real life can be positive too."

","One of the most touching love stories of all time is told in five minutes and without sound. If you watch this movie with someone and they don't cry, beware- they might not have a soul. When this film came out, a lot of people gave Pixar flack for having another male dominant movie. Brave, was the first Pixar film with a female protagonist. While the point against Pixar is valid, I felt it distracted from how good Up was. I don't believe this movie would work as well with if the genders were reversed.

","Young Carl Fredricksen's hero is Charles Muntz an explorer who has been disgraced after it is suggested that one of his great finds is actually a fake. Carl refuses to believe this though. Soon after learning of Muntz' disgrace he meets Ellie; a girl who is equally obsessed with the idea of exploration; they vow that one day they will go to Paradise Falls in South America together. The years pass and they get married; money is put aside for the trip but one thing after another means they never do. Eventually Ellie dies leaving Carl all alone in the house they had shared all their adult lives. Developers want to buy his house so they can build there but he has other ideas. One day he decides he is leaving... and he is taking his house with him!<br/><br/>He uses thousands of helium balloons to float the house into the sky; then he realises he is not alone; Russell, a Scout who wants to get his 'helping the elderly' badge. When the balloon finally descends they find themselves in South America; not just that but within walking distance of Paradise Falls. Carl wants to take the house there before all the helium leaks out of the balloons. They try to get there but meet several distractions along the way including a giant bird, a talking dog and the man Carl once considered his hero. One thing is for sure; Carl will finally get the adventure he dreamt of!<br/><br/>I haven't seen every Pixar film but I've been impressed with every one I've seen so far and 'Up' is no exception. The opening is beautiful as well as being tear-inducing... more so for older viewers I suspect. When Carl and Russell go on their adventure the story becomes more child-friendly with plenty of laughs provided by Kevin the bird and Dug the dog. There are just the right number of scares provided by the obsessed Muntz and his pack of talking dogs. I know this was released in 3D in the cinemas but when I saw it on TV I wasn't constantly thinking 'that scene was put in just to show off the 3D'. The characters were really good; I especially liked how the elderly Carl never forgot his late wife... she was not just a motivation to travel then never mentioned again. Russell made a good sidekick and Kevin and Dug were pretty funny... older viewers might find them a little silly but we must remember this is really a film for all ages and I'm sure children will love these characters. If you've enjoyed other Pixar film you are sure to love this it is great."
"illbebackreviews","6","0","1","28 December 2012"," One of the finest films I've ever seen
","Okay, so I'm a pretty big fan of Pixar films. I love Monsters Inc, the Toy Story trilogy, WALL-E, Finding Nemo and all those other classics! I watched 'Up' a few years back and when I did, I was absolutely amazed at what Pixar could achieve, even after its success in 2008 for 'WALL-E'. To me, this deserves to always be right up there amongst the greatest Pixar Films ever made.<br/><br/>Why is this so special? Well, the answer in brief is that Pixar, whilst making such classics, haven't always been able to focus as much on a touching side. Take Monsters Inc for an example, or even Finding Nemo. Those movies have a lot of humor but they cannot focus as much on the emotional aspect of things. Up can! <br/><br/>The characters in Up are extremely likable. If this was any movie directed by, let's say...I don't know....GEORGE LUCAS....Russel would've been absolutely painful like Jar Jar Binks was. But there was something that Pete Doctor did that made Russel such a memorable and lovable character. The characters, everyone, Carl, Dug, Charles Muntz, Alpha, Kevin EVERYONE had something extremely well done about them. They each had a unique trait! <br/><br/>The story itself is unique. After the Incredibles, Pixar haven't really made a film which has its main characters as humans but thankfully this film takes a break from all of that. The story is very moving and is well paced with just the appropriate amount of humor in it. At no point during the film do you really say...""Okay, c'mon lets move things along quickly"" like in Star Wars Episode I- Phantom Menace. I mean, its wrong to compare those films to classical Pixar films but I just needed to indicate what's right and what's wrong. <br/><br/>The voice acting is very well done. The musical score is very heart- warming and often gave me tears. The 10 minute love story between Ellie and Carl is just phenomenal. Twilight have taken 5 films to a tell a love story and failed, whereas Up took just the first 10 minutes to tell one! <br/><br/>This film is clear proof that Pixar can still manage good films!"
"amanda-leigh-85","10","0","1","16 November 2012"," A movie fit for everyone
","When you think of Disney the first thing to come to mind is children. From classic children's movies such as Toy Story to Disney world consisting of many rides and attractions, one thing's for sure it's geared toward children. Often not all Animated movies appeal to people other than children however, Disney Pixar's Up appeals to multiple audiences. Between a classic love story, modern humor, and a theme that always rings true, Up warms the hearts of every viewer.<br/><br/>This movie captures the hearts of multiple people right off the bat. SPOILER ALERT. The movie Up begins with young Carl Fredricksen frolicking through the neighborhood pretending to be the famous explorer, Charles Muntz. While running and jumping on the sidewalk he comes upon a old abandoned house which happens to be clubhouse to a girl known as Ellie, another adoring fan of Muntz. Through the bonding over their love of adventure, Carl and Ellie eventually fall in love and get married. The movie shows little tid bits of the happy times they shared such as being a zoo keeper and balloon salesman, picnicking underneath the shade of a tree, and having the idea of having children. This is where things take a turn for the worst, the couple learns they are infertile. Over the course of many years Ellie and Carl decide to save up money to pursue their dream of going to paradise falls like their idol, Charles Muntz, however the necessities of life put their dream on hold. Ellie Eventually becomes ill and passes away, leaving Carl all alone. All this happens within the first ten minutes of the movie, connecting with multiple audiences along the way. For starters, everyone has someone they look up to and want to embody. In this particular case Carl and Ellie idolize a famous explorer Charles Muntz. Whether your role model is a famous explorer or your mom, everyone can relate to the fact there is someone out there to look up to. Moving on to the many hopeless romantics in today's culture. The timeless love story of a couple knowing each other at a young age and growing old together captivates every girl out there, leaving them with big hopes and dreams for their own love life. Although animated, this classic plot line is repeated in about every movie in the media today, but it never fails to increase the amount of viewers. On a more serious note, Up connects with women who cannot have children. Despite Ellie and Carl's dreams of having a family, they discover they are infertile. This is a real issue in the lives of many women today and I can guarantee many viewers of this movie happen to be in the same situation Ellie is in. Though heartbreaking, this minor detail of the movie pulls the heartstrings of many woman thus, catching the attention of an often forgotten audience. Another audience that is not normally acknowledged are the widows or widowers. Although we don't know what Ellie became sick with we do know that she passes away leaving Carl alone. Just about everyone has lost a loved one and Carl Fredricksen is a Prime example how love can fuel your dreams even if that person is no longer physically there with you.<br/><br/>Even within the first ten minutes, Disney Pixar's Up captures the heart of just about everyone. In some way, shape, or form you can relate to this movie. From the ever present hopeless romantics to the often forgotten widows, this movie connects with everyone on some level. The first ten minutes are the heart of the movie and preface the greatness that is yet to come for the rest of the film Although it is an animated movie, it connects with anyone who will take the time to sit down and watch this movie."

","Up is yet again another Pixar gem. From the start of Pixar all the way to the present, Pixar never disappoints. They keep producing quality film after quality film. I think Pixar may be the best Pixar film to date, even better than the Toy Story trilogy, which I never though that would happen. This movie has the characteristics of a great Pixar film. This film is a heartwarming movie with emotional moments just to sum it up in a sentence.<br/><br/>Up is a story about an old man who meets an 8-year old explorer scout and unexpectedly, they travel together on an adventure of a lifetime.<br/><br/>I never thought an adventure movie with an old man as a protagonist would work in its favor, but it did here. Edward Asner gave a certain charm to the voice of Carl Fredrickson.<br/><br/>Overall, this is just a lovely Pixar film. It is one of the best films of 2009. The animation is just beautiful and great to look at. The story is quite original and the screenplay is well-written. I rate this film 10/10."
"simu07","8","0","1","8 November 2012"," Up and Away
","The movie ""Up"" which was created 2009, is about the power of love. Love is a powerful thing, it can create war or peace. In the movie a journey is made; it teaches us to follow our dreams and teaches us to respect our elders. In addition, ""Up"" has excellent animation. <br/><br/>Furthermore, ""Up"" has excellent animation. Presumably created by Pixar,it is one of their movies. This movie was rated PG and is appropriate for all ages. Nevertheless, some may say that it might be a little nerve racking at sometimes. ""Up"" made about $68,108,790 in the first weekend and has won 2 Oscars. Additionally, the producer of ""Up"" has also created many more famous movies such as ""Toy Story"". Henceforth, ""Up"" has many credentials and you can see that it will be a great movie. <br/><br/>Respecting your elders is a key point in this movie; one of the main characters Russel meets an old man Carl Fredrickson. Eventually, Russel must learn to work with the old man and help him pursue his dreams. Russel soon finds that the old man is very wise and begins to work with him. To demonstrate the actor who played Carl; Ed Naser did such an outstanding job giving the character life with his voice. A good theme in this movie is respecting your elders. <br/><br/>On the other hand, this movie could have created a sequel to explain what happens after Russel and Carl get back from their epic journey. ""Up"" also demonstrates that kids can go and annoy elders. Russel did this in ""Up"", but good things turned out to happen of this. In conclusion, there was nothing I would like to change about this movie. <br/><br/>Finally, the last theme in this movie is the power of love. Carl, the older man had a plan to go on a trip with his wife. Sadly, a tragic incident happened and he wasn't able to go. Eventually, Carl was to old to go on his own. Nevertheless, his love for his wife still kept him going and he sailed away to Venezaula with Russel. Russel also was influenced by love from Carl, to be inspired to make new friendships. Love is such a powerful theme in this movie and influenced the plot greatly. <br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Up"" is a great movie to go see with your family. Have you ever wanted to be inspired by love? or follow your dreams? if so, this is the right movie for you. Evidently with great animation and created by the best animation studio in the world. ""Up"" is an outstanding, tears in your eyes, and inspiring movie for everyone to watch."

Not all, no. It is considerably more grown up than the other Disney Pixar films but I don't think it is necessarily a bad thing every now and then to have an animated film with slightly more mature content. <br/><br/>I can see how the beginning of the film, especially, could easily be upsetting for sensitive children but then again it is the parents responsibility to make sure that they think that any particular film is suitable for their child before they allow them to watch it...."

"matjpi","10","0","1","8 March 2012"," Life is the adventure - though dreams never die, nor should they.
","It's always a delight to find a completely original film. Often animation tries too hard to ape gritty realism or trite cartoonishness to be tediously impactful or overly cute, respectively. This film does neither. Pixar seems fated to produce (for the most part) great films and they should be very proud of this one.<br/><br/>The human observation (with, I felt, a vaguely Tati-esque feel) and the soundtrack complement the charm and comedy. From the opening scenes, through the montage of Carl's life to this point - a mere 10 minutes of run time - I was already quietly mopping my peepers. I moved easily from that to laughter as Carl began his day as a tired old curmudgeon. If this film doesn't move you several times from laughter to tears and back again then, lucky you: some great living and loving lie ahead.<br/><br/>The quality of the animation; the lushly realistic textures, the incredible lighting, the wryness of character movements all multiply the feel and atmosphere. The look has a satisfyingly retrograde feel reminiscent of ""The Incredibles"" with some ""Triplets of Belleville"" and ""Ratatouille"". Clearly it will only be a decade or two before animation can be indistinguishable from reality if the film makers wish it so. This is not really a children's film; adults past thirty will easily appreciate the rich sadness and comic redemption. Perhaps the children need to wait a bit to see it.<br/><br/>Deserving of its high rating, this is easily the best animation feature .. SQUIRREL!! ... I've ever seen."

","I'd hate to have small kids and try explaining the first 15 minutes of this to them – but for me it was wonderful, touching, sweet and almost wordless a plethora of emotion was conveyed with few words – Pixar's handling of the main and a very necessary component of the story – the loss of a loved one in your elder years – was just astonishingly beautiful, gentle, kind and respectful - <br/><br/>Pixar is simply miraculous in what they can do with animation in developing and following a story line –from touching, it goes to hilarious even to exciting – we have been where Russell is at some time in our life – seeking approval, verifying who we are as we grow – and if we are not there we will all one day be where Frederickson is when he makes his fateful decision to go UP and AWAY and we have all faced bullies like Muntz at some point in our life Every moment is real, touching, thought provoking, funny, sad, even frightening – when you fear for them in their adventures -- just a roller coaster of emotions you'd expect from a top studio drama. <br/><br/>The animation is superlative as one has come to expect from the marriage between Disney and Pixar but they have outdone themselves with the facial expressions and character articulation. nobody could have played this lovable old grump better than Asner did – the same for little Jordan Nagal –and the interaction between them is just delightful pure magic. Throw in Plummer as the explorer turned evil villain Muntz. Kevin, the dogs (especially Dug), are all just such wonderful believable characters – having a dozen dogs of my own I can tell you they are SPOT ON on canine behavior in this film – from the tennis balls to the jumping to express affection to the squirrel fixation to the magic transition to alpha dog in a pack – great great work. <br/><br/>A.J. Riebli's animators and Deirdre Warin and Tom Sonocki's character modeling and articulation teams did a Phenomenal job here – wonderful animation<br/><br/>I cannot imagine anyone not just LOVING this film --<br/><br/>A delightful triumph of filmmaking – a masterpiece of the heart –an ode to the human spirit and the loyalty of our companion animals<br/><br/>Up is not to be missed.

","Up Rating: A <br/><br/>WARNING: Review may contain minor spoilers but I promise not to include anything you can't already see in the trailers. <br/><br/>Up is Pixar Animation Studio's tenth feature film as well as Pete Doctor's second film (he also directed Monsters, Inc.) and it tells the story of Carl Fredricksen, a man who had always dreamt of an adventure to South America with his wife Ellie. Now Ellie has passed away and Carl has watched much of his life pass by. So when construction workers try to take his home he uses thousands of balloons to fly him and his house away to South America, however a young Wilderness explorer named Russel stows away on Carl's house and comes along for the journey. <br/><br/>So I'm sure that I don't need to tell you that Pixar is absolutely infallible, and once again they've proved it with another great movie to add to their 14 year winning streak. The animation is of course gorgeous and the gags are funny but I think the thing that sets this movie apart is just the depth of each character in the story. While I was watching this film I was so completely engrossed in it that I didn't have time to look for the Pixar in-jokes. The performances by both the animators and the voice talents was absolutely perfect, from the first time we see Carl to the last frame of the film I believed that these were real people. Each character had so much layered into them and this film touched on some pretty heavy stuff. As with Pixar's other films this is by no means a kid's movie; not because it's inappropriate, kids enjoy this movie it'll make them laugh and they'll like the talking dogs, but there is so much depth wrapped up in this story that it works on a completely different level than what a child would see. <br/><br/>Pixar can do no wrong, they never have and I'm sure that they never will. The way they operate and encourage crazy ideas and last minute changes to make the best movie that they can possibly make. Their method is flawless and we as the audience get to experience the wonderful fruits of their hard work. While it didn't have the same level of artistry as WALLE and it didn't match the perfection of Finding Nemo, this film is nothing short of a masterpiece and I recommend it to everyone. The best film of 2009 so far and, although it's early on, it's gonna be a tough one to beat."

The film follows around 78-year-old Carl Frederickson, after his wife passed away, he has dreams of adventure to Paradise Falls in South America, and travels with an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell, a talking dog named D.U.G, and a gigantic bird named Kevin. This film is completely different from all Pixar flicks. Although they have funny moments, the film is a serious film with drama and heartbreak. Many moments can make you either laugh or cry in their seats. This movie is the perfect movie to be named the 10th movie ever made in Pixar. With an amazing cast, creative animation, and so many creative elements, ""Up"" reaches the top to become an amazing motion picture with drama, comedy, and animation. And it's also another personal favorite movie from Disney-Pixar. I could watch the movie over and over, and never get tired of watching every single moment. ""Up"" is a funny, and beautiful work of art that only Pixar can bring to the world. ""Up"", in my review, ""a fantastic journey into the human heart, a true must-see""."

"Eternality","8","0","1","22 February 2011"," Up is still effective, uplifting, and mostly heartwarming, but it is one of the less accomplished works by Pixar.
","Directed by Pete Doctor and co-directed by Bob Peterson, Up is from the guys who created Monsters Inc. (2001) and who work at one of modern cinema's most consistent production companies - Pixar Animation Studios. Up is the tenth feature film from Hollywood's Jewel of Creativity following the successes of films such as Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), and Wall.E (2008).<br/><br/>This latest picture is another bold step away from what Pixar has done over the decade, and together with Wall.E (which was considerably bold enough), both represent a significant change in priorities in the company's vision. Producing family-friendly fare is a thing of the past. Now they are using CG technology to transcend animation filmmaking, to give the once isolated genre devoted to entertaining five-year-olds a strong cinematic identity, one that mature audiences can find themselves unashamed of appreciating.<br/><br/>Up is perhaps the most risky venture by Pixar thus far. The lead character is not a cute fish, or a lovable rat, or a friendly monster, but a short, bespectacled, and grumpy old man with a face as unappealing as a box. How marketable is that? Fears that Up could be Pixar's first real flop are swept away within the first fifteen minutes. The prologue sequence that introduces Carl Fredricksen is a gem both in its execution and its ability to comprehensively and instantly portray the old man as someone we have no difficulty empathizing.<br/><br/>Carl's dream of visiting Paradise Falls in South America is triggered to reality when he is forced to relocate to a retirement village. That morning he made his house fly, lifted by thousands of colorful balloons, and propelled by wind as it pushed the curtain-like sails hung out on rails on each side. Russell, a chubby boy with a zest for adventure happened to be on Carl's front porch when the house made its ascent. Together they explore South America and evade obstacles which appear more life-threatening than they expect.<br/><br/>The introduction of the actual villain Charles Muntz in Up comes slightly too late into the film. Because of limited development of the character, Charles is not as imposing as he should be. While it does create an extent of fear, there is not a moment in the film when we have doubts of the protagonists surviving unscathed. Likewise, the climax arrived too quickly as well. Although the adventures of the leads are mostly engaging, they appear short-lived. I see it as a flaw because the filmmakers could have spent more time adding more action set-pieces to the fray.<br/><br/>As with Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle (2004), a major influence to this film, physical logic has to be cast aside. Many of the scenes can never happen in reality. Can an old man really navigate a floating house with his frail physique? Can balloons really lift a house? Up tends to indulge in fantasy far more than reality. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but when a film whose devotion to human emotions and bonding (themes grounded in reality) far eclipse that of its far-fetched plot, there is a fair chance that it might turn out to be a mixed bag of unclear priorities. And it does to a small extent. Up is still effective, uplifting, and mostly heartwarming, but it is one of the less accomplished works by Pixar. But that is still saying something.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."
"johnstrash1","9","0","1","8 February 2011"," Glad I was talked into seeing this
","I've never really been much into the modern animation movies with their predictable plots and politically correct characters, but Up really was worth seeing. Although I do agree with a lot of reviewers that there is a very sad overtone to the story, I found that their was enough to distract from this to still make it very amusing and entertaining.<br/><br/>Unless I simply missed other voice acting performances by Ed Asner, I can't imagine why I have never seen a role like this for him before. Combined with spot on facial expressions, Carl Fredricksen was simply hilarious throughout the entire movie. And Christopher Plummer, who I seem to be seeing in quite a few movies lately, was almost unidentifiable in his roll, which shows how much effort he put into the part. Even young Jordan Nagai never went off the mark with his performance.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a great movie. But it may be wise to consider the depressing aspects of the story before showing it to younger kids."
"Imdbidia","7","0","1","8 February 2011"," Delightful Entertainment
","Up is a story of a forced friendship between Carl, and old grumpy retired salesman, and Russell, a lonely overweight Asian-American boy, and their adventure together.<br/><br/>The animation is not as impressive as in other Pixar films, but the script is very charming, and you'll get hooked right away. I missed the story being a little more original and inventive, and having less stereotypes and predictability. Still, is a moving and funny story that will delight adults and children. Among my favorite characters are Kevin, the rare species of bird, (hilarious! which reminded me of the WB's Roadrunner!), the talking nasty dogs, and Carl's dog.<br/><br/>The first 10-15 minutes of the film, in which we see the story of Carl from his childhood to the death of his wife, are superb. as they create a real emotional life-long biography of the character. That's, no doubt, the best part of the film with a difference.<br/><br/>The short film that precedes the movie, as always happens with Pixar's shorts, is pure delight and humorous creativity."
"tronghieu-designer","10","0","1","25 January 2011"," Its never too late
","to go explore the world out there! This movie is not just for kids, definitely. Its rather for all kind of people regardless of age.<br/><br/>Maybe for those who are young, this film is all about the thrilling adventures throughout the world full of color, but for me, i like this movie mostly because of the emotions and memories ( of the old man and his passed-away wife )and the idea of ""its never too late to do things"".<br/><br/>Can you imagine that ? A 80, 90-something old man goes on to discover the location of the waterfall in the outer world to fulfill his cross-your-heart promise with his wife, the promise that he made when he was like 10 year-old young ! And guess what! He already did it !"
"Enchorde","6","0","1","19 December 2010"," Doesn't quite take off
","Recap: Growing up, both Carl and Ellie idolize Charles Muntz, a world famous explorer. But after a mission to Paradise Falls, Muntz falls out of grace after a retrieved bird skeleton is accused of being a fake. Muntz goes away to capture a live specimen, and Carl and Ellie continues with their life, growing up, marrying each other and growing old together. But when Ellie dies, and old Carl is left alone, the dreams of their adventure awakens again. Carl wow that he shall fly their house, with a lot of helium filled balloons, to Paradise Falls. By accident Russell, a kid scout, happens to come along, being trapped on the porch as Carl lifts off. But as they arrive at Paradise Falls, they discover that the hunt for the mysterious bird is still on.<br/><br/>Comments: A rather sweet comedy, but ironically it never takes off and lifts to the heights that previous Pixar movies do. This time it seems that, somewhat in the spirit of the movie, they have focused more upon the adventure part of the movie than the comedy. But comedy, especially comedy that works for people of all ages, are Pixar's strength, and I think the movie lacks some of that strength. Especially knowing what Pixar can do.<br/><br/>One guess on my part, is that like many others released in the new 3D format recently, a little too much focus has been given to make a visual treat over perfecting a good story. But effects can only augment a story, not build it. And for me, the characters didn't quite work out. Carl is a little bit too grumpy and Russell is just too annoying at times. And they being the main characters, it is a problem when they don't quite work out. However, supporting characters Dug and actually and especially Kevin save part of it.<br/><br/>Up is good, mostly a sweet movie, funny at times. But it is not hilarious. Pixar has done better, and I expect better in the future.<br/><br/>6/10"
"itszombietime","7","0","1","16 October 2010"," Technically beautiful, great concept, great beginning...then question marks
","This film is a marvelous technical achievement. The digital animation is outstanding, possibly the best ever achieved. And with a film budget exceeding $170 million, you would expect nothing less.<br/><br/>The basic plot is great and rich with pathos. The beginning of the film is wonderfully done, as we see a ""highlight reel"" of Carl's life journey with his lifelong love Ellie. It's an ordinary life, like so many, with ups and downs (mostly ups) and one great dream unfulfilled.<br/><br/>The adventure phase of the film then begins, and at first it's great. The characters are presented, the stage is set, the journey ""up and away"" begins.<br/><br/>Once Carl and Russell set sail and leave the city behind though, the story unravels. The pace, development and story arcs are problematic and, frankly, peculiar. I realize this is a children's tale with all the developmental liberties and assumptions that provides, but some of the gaps and story decisions are outlandish and just don't make sense, and leave you asking, ""what"" and ""how"" more than a few times. <br/><br/>A few examples: <br/><br/>In the span of an old man's exhausted nap, the two travel (at a drifting balloon pace) from somewhere in North America to directly above southern Venezuela. Huh? Even kids in the theater were asking their parents, what happened? How much time went by? Is the giant waterfall close to the house? I thought it was far away, but it must be really close, right? <br/><br/>Talking dogs? Advanced ""canine interpretive technology"" emerging from a remote landscape with no civilization or human presence? Wow. Where did that come from? <br/><br/>And the strangest decision of all, one that had kids (and adults) in the theater thoroughly puzzled --- the heroic adventurer is alive and well, with the agility and stamina of a 25 year old, and the advanced scientific capabilities of engineering genius? If Carl is pushing 80 years old (do the math, watch the beginning of the film, time it out), then the heroic adventurer has to be at least 100, and probably 110 years old or more.<br/><br/>The story arcs have to explain or justify these things. It can be done with just a few transitional scenes, fantastic as it may seem. But you can't just go from A to B to C with big gaps and unexplained progressions. That's basic. Any professional in this industry should understand this. When 8 year olds in the audience are scratching their heads and trying to understand the plausibility of the story, you have a problem.<br/><br/>7/10."
"lee_eisenberg","7","0","3","6 June 2010"," Sky pilots, how high can you fly?
","Now here's an unusual movie. Pete Docter's ""Up"" portrays elderly Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) attaching balloons to his house and sailing it to a South American waterfall and finding even more than he bargained for. I've never been a fan of Disney, but this one had some out-of-the-ordinary stuff (for a Disney movie, that is), namely when Carl scornfully calls someone a hippie. As far as I can tell, the major theme is the completion of long-standing promises - Carl's deceased wife had long dreamed of going to the waterfall - and Carl's return from the brink of total senility.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Up"" is not my favorite movie, but worth seeing. Also starring Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger, and even former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member Laraine Newman in a supporting role.<br/><br/>Squirrels can be a problem. My parents recently installed bird feeders, and the squirrels always try to get into them."

","I work in a library, and like Ratatouille this is a movie which will not go in the children's section - it is an adult movie that kids will enjoy.<br/><br/>I saw it yesterday in 3d (but that doesn't matter) with my son who had highly recommended it having seen it several times. After 10 minutes I was a mess, and stayed that way for the whole film. From the introduction of the utterly charming Ellie to Carl's devastation when she died, through the silly but endearing adventures in Venezuala, and finally the clear and close relationship between the Grumpy Old Man and the boy it was completely involving.<br/><br/>In a sense it was of course highly exploitative - my comment afterwards was that it was a full frontal assault on the lachrymals! <br/><br/>And I'm a Grumpy Old Man!"
"Ostrumation","Null","0","1","16 May 2010"," ""Up"" Is Another Animated Masterpiece from The Geniuses at Pixar
","One of the more surprising things about Disney-Pixar's ""Up"" is that it shows how Pixar is closer to the old Walt Disney classics than the modern Disney animation films could ever be. ""Up"", being Pixar's 10th film, pretty much shows how Pixar manages to stay consistent with top-notch storytelling, great characters and wonderful visuals. They're a far cry from most modern animation, as they care about the story and the characters. ""Up"" proves this once more. The sky was the limit once Pixar released ""Ratatouille"" and ""WALL-E"". Those two films proved that Pixar could take any concept and make it work.<br/><br/>""Up"" tells a story in its first five minutes. If you were to take the first five minutes of ""Up"" and release it as a short, it would've taken home numerous Oscars. It's one of the best opening sequences to an animated feature. It immediately draws you into the story and the character of Carl Fredericksen, and his motivation for turning his house into a makeshift aircraft. From there, ""Up"" becomes a rollicking and fun-filled adventure, but the emotional side of the film remains there throughout.<br/><br/>If anything, ""Up"" is a fantasy film that has a lot of imagination feel. Who wouldn't marvel at an adventure in the South American jungles with plane-flying dogs, giant colorful birds, paranoid 100-year-old explorers and flying houses? It shows that Pete Doctor (the director) and Pixar's writers have an imagination, and that's much better than anything DreamWorks has churned out over the past 10 years or any other ""big"" animation studios.<br/><br/>""Up"" soars when it comes to action sequences. Otherwise, the film is hilarious. Dug was probably my favorite character, as he stole the show. The emotional side was beautiful. When I saw this in theaters on its opening weekend, I really connected with the opening (Since my grandfather died two months before the film came out), and I also could connect with the scene where Russell implies to Carl that his parents are divorced and his father is a dead- beat. I like when animated films use these themes. It shows that Pixar makes films that can appeal to anyone of all ages.<br/><br/>The animation in this film was great as well, very stylized. It had a more cartoon-y feel to it, and it worked. The artwork and design was beautiful, especially with the South American Tepui. The film has the feel of a really good action film.<br/><br/>The film breezed through its 96-minute runtime. I thought it could've been longer, but I think the film was supposed to be an emotional but fun-filled adventure. I remember when ""Up"" was announced, they said it was about a 78-year-old and an 8-year-old fighting exotic beasts in the wilderness. That idea intrigued me, but I think it was used just gear people up. The film turned out just fine. Just a thought, though.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Up"" is one of Pixar's darker films and it definitely works with its strong story and characters, and its sense of imagination and fun. It's a great mix of all kinds of things. The great Walt Disney once said, ""For every laugh, there should be a tear,"" and ""Up"" perfectly fits that quote. This is why I'm a devoted Pixar fan.<br/><br/>A 10 out of 10."
"lesleyharris30","10","0","1","15 April 2010"," Heartwarming and Hilariious, One of Pixars Finest,
","Up is a fantastic movie with an extremely well developed storyline and a terrific voice cast that capture the emotions and personalities of these characters perfectly. It has a near perfect balance of drama and comedy, it had loads heartwarming and upsetting scenes that genuinely made me cry, but it also had plenty of very funny parts and hilarious characters that brought light to the film, such as Dug, and this movie brought me so much joy to watch, and I will certainly be seeing it again and again. My only problem with the movie, and it's a very small one, is that I didn't feel we got to see Ellie develop enough, I know exactly what they were doing with that montage and it was terrific, but I would like to have seen a bit more of her beforehand so that I would feel so much more sympathy once the montage came along, although seens revolving around her later on were the parts that real warmed my heart. Carl Fredicksen is easily one of Pixars best written characters ever, he has so much depth and he is very human, I felt so much sympathy for him and can relate to his struggles to not want to let go of the things that mean so much to him, it's quite hard to believe that this very real character is computer animated. Pixar hit it out of the park once again, it's funny, it's tearjerking and its a lot of fun, I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good film for the entire family to enjoy, and to all moviegoers in general. <br/><br/>An elderly man who is being forced to a retirement home attaches all his balloons to his house and heads off on an adventure in dedication to his deceased wife, however, chaos ensues when a young boy scout accidentally joins him."
"manicman84","10","0","1","22 March 2010"," unforgettable movie, equally laugh-out-loud funny and wistfully nostalgic
","Pixar are continuing their winning streak with this uplifting (yeah!) masterwork. ""Up"" takes an unusual, awkward premise and turns it into an unforgettable movie, equally laugh-out-loud funny and wistfully nostalgic. Let's start from the beginning. The first 10-minute montage depicting elderly Carl Friedrikson's life is mesmerizing to the point that it ranks among the most poignant ones ever created. What's following is more adventure/comedy-oriented material with its blend of electrifying action sequences resembling ""The Incredibes"". Up's own identity is unquestionable though. In a nutshell, the movie is about putting the past in perspective, about gaining the distance to the past events and eventually accepting them. All three central characters deal with a painful loss of some kind. Carl mourns her late wife Ellie, young Russell misses his now distant father and ex-celebrity adventurer turned villain Charles Muntz has lost his credibility chasing supposedly imaginary bird. It's not the climax that matters here that much, but the journey towards this finality. On their journey, Carl and Russell meet a wonderfully goofy bird named Kevin and a sweet talking dog called Dug. Their adventures, albeit exciting, require certain risks and sacrifices. ""Up"" blends fantastic with realistic: it's the first Pixar film where blood is visibly shed and death is dealt with so prominently. All these adult themes may seem too much for a kid-friendly movie, but directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson do such a wonderful job of keeping all the aspects of the story balanced and characters easily reliable. ""Up"" is a fully accomplished exercise in escapism that soars every time it should fall. Superbly executed and enthralling in its ideas, it raises the bar so immensely high."
"johnnyboyz","7","0","1","16 March 2010"," Stands on its own as the animated film with all the individual high profile accolades; and Up is a pleasant piece, blending a number of fun ideas and affecting content.
","One wonders if 2009's animated feature 'Up' will be the mark of change in certain areas. Here's a film of an animated ilk that not only opened the 2009 Cannes film festival, but became the first since 1991's Beauty and the Beast, and only the second ever, to receive a best picture academy award nomination. The heavy spate of films throughout the whole of the last decade, those of a kind that saw them animated but rendered by way of computers, have enchanted and engrossed children and adults alike; but one wonders if, amidst the higher-ups that are entrenched within the nether regions of The Academy and premiere occasions across the European film festival circuit, those in charge have ever seen any of them as anything more than just a bunch of cartoons produced in order to merely satisfy and entertain. Up's recognition at Europe's best known, but not necessarily best loved, film festival gathering plus domestic acknowledgement at The Oscars, even if it was never going to win, might mark Up down as more significant over time than the creators first had in mind.<br/><br/>Up's an enjoyable experience; a blending of physical comedy with a brutally simple, but certainly heartfelt, premise combined with a necessary amount of substance rolled into a package which suffices to a degree. No, the physical comedy does not peak at the levels 2001's Monsters Inc. attained, a film with a similar arc to Up in its cut and thrust idea of two hapless individuals (one little, one large) in possession of something they really ought not be as a wiry, spindly antagonist goes to extreme lengths to trip them up. Nor does it quite hit the heights of the previous year's Wall*E; a film that also had a somewhat lonely lead inhabiting a world that has significantly changed over the decades before deciding to branch out into yonder as all sorts of adventures and mishaps unfold. I imagine Up was pitched relatively simply, certainly if doubts were ever raised as to whether it would make its money back: it has a flying house; slapstick infused chasing; an oddball buddy teaming of an old man and a young boy; plus, it features a talking dog. <br/><br/>The film starts with a young boy by the name of Carl Fredricksen (Asner) having his gaze captured as looks at a cinema screen, displaying one of those reels of news footage you got prior to a film screening way back when, are captured. The cinema screen looms over the watching crowd, an establishment of power is apparent as this young boy observes in absolute awe explorer Charles Muntz (Plummer) take to the skies in his airship on a mission to seek out the animal whose bones he has brought back from South America, but have subsequently been deemed fake. The innocence of youth, and that latching onto either a brand name or an omnipresent media story is captured; the reasons for which become clear later on when another young boy sixty or so years later, carrying an obsessive fixation this time with the great outdoors, enable Carl to suffer an epiphany when all is truthfully revealed and the true nature of what was so striking and fascinating is all but a letdown.<br/><br/>Carl's ascent into old age is put across by way of a three or so minute montage, a life of which seemed to consist of home-building, balloons and a wife named Ellie. Following her death, the void that is that they never got to journey to South America together, despite Ellie's equal fascination in Muntz and his travels, has steps dutifully undertaken so that it may be filled by Carl in flying off to the continent by way of a lot of balloons and a lot of helium. It additionally allows Carl to avoid the wrath of some thinly drawn businessmen whom want his house and land for construction purposes, and whose appearance is made more unearthly in their wearing of shades thus giving them an odd insectile look. In the process of filling that particular void, he will gradually undertake filling another in the taking care of young junior scout Russell (Nagai), the son he never had while in time, Carl will come to represent the father Russell doesn't seem to have. Russell additionally has one of the more perplexing lines of the film; when he expresses his distinct shock at the discovery of a talking dog in Dug (Peterson), despite having just flown to Venezuela from The U.S.A. by way of a house and then encountering a bird that sort of resembles the long since extinct Dodo.<br/><br/>Up's idea is clear-cut, in that Carl's there for adults wanting to will on the guy trying to pay respect to his dead wife, while Russell's shenanigans and often amusing antics will entertain those of his respective age range. But Up's heart is in the right place, and its instances such as Carl's emotionally charged reaction to Russell's innocent ""cross your heart?"" plea as well as some basic mother-bird-in-peril/chicks-rendered-defenceless are effective without overly demanding we react. Like most of these films from recent times, the chase inspired finale in which physical comedy and all the natural surrounding elements combine to create a set piece is present. It's equally dramatic as it is funny, an idea for a finale coined from the removal truck chase sequence at the end of Toy Story. It's not of the creative nor humorous level that Monsters Inc. hit, what with its extravagant ideas and genuinely funny moments spawned by a number of doors opening up and acting as portals into our world as a warehouse full of all kinds of devices and tricks acted as the setting. Nonetheless, Up works; with a blending of heartfelt and comedic material which sit well with chase-come-thriller ingredients that crops up towards the end."

"east-emerald","9","0","1","10 March 2010"," The animated movie continues its evolution
","I found some things to poke fun at in ""Up"" ,but I'll start out though with a little gushing praise. Pixar has produced a complex story that blends heartfelt sincerity with the illogic and humor available in animation. I won't bore you with a plot description because I imagine everyone is familiar with the story of Carl Frederickson and his improbable journey to Paradise Falls. In a sequence completely absent of dialogue (think Wall-E) we are shown the complete life of a marriage that includes a miscarriage and the eventual death of Carl's wife, Ellie. This portion alone could have been an amazing short film. Once Carl has teamed up with the ever helpful Wilderness Scout, Russell, we are treated to a more conventional Pixar with the happy ending right around the corner.<br/><br/>Here is my, ""What I learned from Up"" list:<br/><br/>-Due process does not exist in a Disney/Pixar world. Carl accidentally commits what would be a minor crime one day and the next he is kicked out of his home and somehow forced to move to the friendly neighborhood old folks home.<br/><br/>-When going on an adventure, always go armed, but if a Disney movie make it something non lethal like pepper spray. You never know when you might run into a childhood hero turned madman.<br/><br/>-When a talking dog says, "" I was sleeping under your porch because I love you"" it's funny. If a person says that to you, call 911.<br/><br/>-Russell, as cute as he is, appears to be at risk for juvenile diabetes.<br/><br/>-It's ugly when really really old guys try to fight each other."

It seemed hard to beat that, but they managed to to come close, if not beat them.<br/><br/>Up is a fantastic movie, based on a simple promise between two people who love each other to death. An old man, who loved his wife very much, and was willing to keep a promise they kept, even after death; to go to Paradise Falls.<br/><br/>Up had a lot of firsts for their series of movies. A lot of violence (though child-like), blood, a reference to being sterile or even still birth, not to mention, a character having a mullet =p<br/><br/>Regardless, even with these new elements, Pixar manages to make a masterful piece of art that will wow and astound you, and making you want to go out and buy this movie as soon as you can."

","Critics raving and audiences are in total cinematic aw with Pixar's latest addition to the family. Up, is a visually stunning, hilarious and heart warming tale and although sugar coated, it has a much darker layer for it's audience to indulge in. What makes Up so devastatingly brilliant is how it manages to deal with such serious themes like life and death, but does it in such a honest yet innocent way that it doesn't talk down to children. Obviously, this is as far fetched a plot could possibly ever get, but while saying that this is so smart and once again delivers to both adults and children. <br/><br/>Even more character to fall in love with like Russell and Carl, and so many ideas that just add so much to Pixar's already outstanding reputation. It doesn't have the element that made Toy Story, Finding Nemo and The Incredibles such masterpieces, but it's best not too compare. This is one of those movies that if you don't love it, your insane. Up is a very tight film so the running time is a little on the short side and we are deprived of our short film opening. But still, the best animation movie of the year hands down, and probably just one of the best movies too. <br/><br/>Overall: Up is hilarious, intensely heart warming and involves some of the greatest visuals to ever bless the screen. Not quite a masterpiece such as their earlier efforts, but if you don love this movie, your criminally insane. <br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>4/5<br/><br/>-Simpson Reviews"
"eddax","10","0","2","16 February 2010"," Inspired casting in Ed Asner
","I don't know why other people loved Up but I'm sure most of them don't share my reason, which is that Ed Asner was the voice of Carl Fredricksen. I'm a huge fan of The Mary Tyler Moore Show and I would recognize the gruff teddy bear voice of Asner anywhere. It is that quality that makes him the perfect voice for the role. What inspired casting it was. Maybe they wrote it with him in mind.<br/><br/>I also think Up is more poignant (and thus more adult) than past Pixar movies, what with the early setup of Fredricksen's wife passing away before they have their last great adventure together. It really moved me, the way they captured the couple's happy marriage and the big dream they shared. The rest of the movie... meh.<br/><br/>Heh, I jest. While I have to say I wasn't a fan of the kid, he didn't get on my nerves a lot - not more than a real kid would - and Asner anchored the movie well enough so that it didn't wander into overly juvenile territory. <br/><br/>As with the other Pixar movies thus far (except maybe, Cars), Up is movie magic - a great melding of story, humor, and gorgeous animations. But Up, with its more adult-inclusive story, has now supplanted Monsters, Inc. as my favorite Pixar."

","I rank this Pixar film second only to Wall-E, but part of it bugged me.<br/><br/>Sticking a house on top of such spectacular scenery was desecration, especially when the old man tossed out the furniture and junk as ballast.<br/><br/>The house might be OK in the forest where it didn't stick out, but a place like that should be left undeveloped. It mimics the real life location of Angel Falls, which is fortunately in a park, protected from construction.<br/><br/>At the end we are left with the impression that the house stayed there indefinitely, with the pile of junk next to it. It seemed incongruous with saving the rare bird, etc. It's forgivable considering the spectacle of the movie as a whole, but not trivial."
"joshua_s_reeves","9","0","1","9 February 2010"," Pixar does it again!!!!
","Pixar's track record with producing not only exceptional CGI animation films but films in general is a spectacular feat. No doubt the word 'Pixar' will remind you of such classics as 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo' and the visually jaw-dropping 'WALLE'. So it was with no surprise that I was full of anticipation when I collected my cinema ticket. There is always the danger of great disappointment when one anticipates the release of a film. Was I disappointed? No. 'Up' follows the story of retired Carl Fredricksen and his unlikely companion Russell, who is seventy years his junior, on Carl's quest to fulfill his lifelong dream to see the wilds of South America. This dream plants a seed which turns into a poetic love story, a heartbreaking tale of bereavement and a thrilling adventure. The opening minutes of the film details Carl's earlier life in magnificent fashion showing storytelling at it's finest. The particular use of beautifully composed snapshots to document Carl's marriage illustrates the effectiveness of simplicity. Unsurprisingly I heard a fellow cinema-goer whisper ""Well, that was a great movie!"" after a timely fade-down bringing the film's opening sequence to a close. It is shortly after this that the audience see the film elevated by Carl taking to the sky in his house using an assortment of vibrant helium filled balloons. Up's setting is then suddenly transformed into a luscious jungle where it becomes evident that Carl's uninvited companion isn't going to be his only pain. After meeting the character Dug who is – in true Pixar style – a hilarious talking dog, Carl finds his motives changing taking the film into its final stage where the Directors Docter and Peterson deliver a spectacular air battle. Seeing 'Up' will leave viewers satisfied through the way it delicately approaches subject matters whilst distributing plenty of laughs. Encouraging audiences to dream big, 'Up' successfully fulfills its own dream making it one of Pixar's finest animated films."

","I am a huge fan of Disney Pixar's. So I am always eagerly waiting for their next release. Same is the case for Up. I actually hate movies seeing in the cam-rip or pre-DVD rip quality.<br/><br/>But this time I was wrong.<br/><br/>Seeing this film for the first 5 mins I realized how much life and heart has been poured in it by Pete Docter. But its not all. The main thing is that it portrays the desired living of every people. When all seems to be hasty and disordered then hope lies beneath it-----BENEATH YOUR AIM AND DESIRE--------------------- perhaps this is the moral of this picture. And when you have no one around you to share your dreams and thoughts perhaps you have to do anything to chase your dreams. I believe this must be the motto of everyone.<br/><br/>The common stuff of a Disney's story is adventure, comedy and moral. But this picture is different. Apart from these it has REALITY, HEART and LIFE. So ""It has rocked me to my core."" And it also gives us a message that if you chase your dreams with your heart and dedication it always comes true; So when I saw the last scene I could not control my tears of joy from coming out.<br/><br/>I hereby give all my heartful wishes to Pete Docter and the entire crew for their confirm win in Oscars and thanks them for this sort of inspiring movie."

","Wonderfully written, UP is poignant, funny, sad, frightening, uplifting, cute, entertaining, and visually pleasing to the eye. And the dogs are just amazing. The animators capture their faces, movements, and idiosyncrasies so perfectly they're side-splitting; especially Dug. <br/><br/>There are number of messages in UP; the most evocative being resiliency. <br/><br/>Another is the spirit of adventure, woven throughout the story. <br/><br/>The most important message – which if mentioned will spoil the story – is very touchingly played between the married couple, and then continues on when character Carl Fredricksen finally realizes the path he must take. <br/><br/>That being said, the screenwriters (Doctor and Peterson) are very in touch with the human spirit and psyche with UP. Kudos, guys.<br/><br/>UP is a relevant movie to discuss with most children because it captures many feelings we humans experience.<br/><br/>In addition. it is nice to see an overweight, animated child in the story so that other overweight children can relate."

Their life dream of going to Paradise Falls, a place of wonder as described by their mutual childhood hero, never materializes. Ellie passes away, leaving Carl alone in a world that seems to be moving on without him.

In the end Carl realizes his dream was really companionship and his life is enriched by the new friends he made while on his adventure. The story, overall, is uplifting, funny and just a good time.

"fwomp","9","0","1","24 January 2010"," The Human Element Makes Animation Watchable...
","Many people disagree with me about this, but I'm sticking to my guns because of the level of enjoyment I received from these films. The disagreement is that WALL-E was some sort of exceptional film and THE INCREDIBLES was only so-so. I had the exact opposite experience. I found WALL-E to be so-so and The Incredibles to be a wonderful film because of the human element attached to it. Also, both The Incredibles and this film, UP, had a PG rating and not a G, which might mean that deeper, perhaps disturbing things, made this film carry more emotional weight. And it most certainly does.<br/><br/>Edward Asner plays Carl Fredricksen, a man who's loved and lost. Yes, we ACTUALLY get to see an old person pass away at the end of their life ...in an animated feature. Imagine that. Reality. This gives Up more bite and we empathize with Carl on a very basic human level. Whereas with Wall-E, we're trying to gain empathy for a machine that's acting like a human. Not the same thing.<br/><br/>Into Carl's lonely life comes wannabe boy scout Russell (Jordan Nagai), who's trying to earn a merit badge. But Carl wants none of his help, nor does he want to help Russell gain the badge.<br/><br/>Amidst Carl's life is his understanding that his now dead wife Ellie never got to have any adventures. She married Carl and bought a home, which took over their lives and made them home-bodies. They both grew up worshipping adventurer Charles Muntz and wanting to go and find out what happened to him. But Ellie never made it. So, when Carl's house is being threatened by developers and his life steered toward Shady Oaks retirement facility, Carl attaches a mass of helium balloons to his house and floats away. Trouble is, that pesky boy scout is on-board, too.<br/><br/>Eventually they make their way to South America and discover dangers, foes, friends, and, yes, adventure. Talking dogs with an obsession for squirrels add a high amount of hilarity to several scenes, as does a unique bird that befriends Russell and loves chocolate.<br/><br/>More telling is the friendship that blossoms between Russell and Carl as the generation gap closes, and Carl learns to open his heart (and mind) to new experiences. Also learning to let go of Ellie's memory adds an incredibly deep plot-line to an amazing story.<br/><br/>The animation, like most 3-D style animations, is impressive. The colors, shadows, and depth made the scenes come alive. But it's the story that makes it all worthwhile. Just like The Incredibles, this is a tale about human beings doing unique things but with regular challenges and mental hurdles. It is this that drives me to see complex animated films, not a robot ."
"zaisjr","10","0","3","21 January 2010"," Simply Beautiful.
","I can only summarize this movie as beautiful. I didn't think that Pixar could make such a heart-warming movie, even after Wall-E.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that this is a kid's movie. It is so well written and so touching. I may be an adult male, but I will admit that I cried at the beginning and end of the film. If I didn't cry out of sadness, I cried just because of the pure emotion the movie portrayed. The movie isn't your typical kid's movie. The characters aren't your typical characters. Usually movies rely on young attractive characters. This movie relies on an old feeble grumpy man and a pudgy little boy. Yet, they are one of the best duos I've ever seen. This movie has an important theme, that there is a place for everyone... even after tragedies in our lives or when our lives are near the end. It stresses love, carpe diem, forgiveness, and tolerance. There is always someone who needs us.<br/><br/>This should be a movie that is at least up for an Oscar for best picture. I know it will be shunned as a kid's movie, but it's better written than most of the movies this year."

","I had heard of this movie but since I am not crazy about animated films, it took me a long time to rent the DVD and watch 'Up'. I knew very little about the movie or the story, so everything was a revelation. The most important one was that if a movie is really good, it does not matter if it's animation or not.<br/><br/>The animation was top notch, the story idea was unique and very creative. The 'heroes' were- a 78 year old man and an eight year old boy. There was lots of action and imagination. However, what really made me like this movie were the subtle emotions, and how old man Frederickson changes from being a lonely, sad man to a happy person in the end.<br/><br/>The story begins with Carl (Mr.Frederickson as a young boy) meeting his future wife and love of his wife Ellie. They grow up, marry, and live happily until she dies. Carl is attached to her memories, including the home and furniture they built together, and her 'Adventure Book'. . He decides to follow the adventure that Ellie introduced him to, when they were kids.<br/><br/>He is not friendly to the 8 year old kid Russell who wants to get a badge by helping an elderly. HOwever, once Russell gets on his 'flying house' to go to South America, their friendship develops. Carl starts caring for the young lad. Their adventures take them to see Paradise Falls, which was Carl & Ellie's dream. They fight evil dogs and an evil person and triumph in the end. In the process Carl lets go of the things he was attached to, and is a happier person as a result.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful story that has adventure and action, and philosophical depth. The message at the end is so subtle, it is not at all preachy, and yet one gets it. That's what makes this movie so special."

They both got married and spent their whole life together! In the end she passed away and Mr. Fredrickson is now an old man and he is lonely and just downright depressed.

Along the way Mr. Fredrickson meets a very annoying kid named Russel. They are now in Paradise Falls and they encounter talking dogs! But how? When?

","I immediately fell for this film. I think my favorite moment in the whole thing is when he meets Ellie for the first time. She is one of a kind and the animators did a lovely job of making her eternally beautiful. It has one of the most touching moments I've seen in any film. Then, of course, we need to suspend out disbelief, thinking that a house, propelled by helium balloons, can be raised from the ground, becoming airborne. What follows is a truly great story. We have a young Wilderness Scout who has all the hangups of modern youth, clueless in so many ways. We have a cast of incredible dogs who have been given the ability to speak through a device invented by the villain of the movie. There are complex relationships that transcend the usual kid plots. This one works to the end. Some people ask too many questions. While this movie is about science, we should not read too much into it. Just suffice it to say, it is full of adventure, close calls, bonding, and, of course, true love. I really believe this is one of the better films of this past year."

Carl Fredricksen ties balloons to his home and takes off for South America so that he can land his house on some obscure falls. However, he soon learns that an 8-year-old wilderness scout who was trying to assist the elderly so he could get a badge was on the premises when the house took off.<br/><br/>This is one of the sweetest films imaginable, reminiscent in the beginning of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - a young boy has dreams of travel, marries his childhood friend; the couple takes on the refurbishment of an old house and finds that life gets in the way of their travel ambitions. Later on, the film becomes a real adventure story, with talking dogs, exotic birds, and a crazed explorer. Fredericksen looks like Spencer Tracy and has the voice of Ed Asner; the explorer, a childhood hero of Fredericksen's, looks like Kirk Douglas and has the voice of Christopher Plummer. All of the voices are delightful.<br/><br/>I don't generally care for animated films, but I was swept away by warmth and heart of this one, not to mention its magnificent detail and beauty.

I enjoyed the animated film very much but, some of that was due to the fact a friend clued me in first, saying ""this isn't really a comedy or a film for little kids. Don't expect a ton of laughs."" So, instead of seeking laughs (although I still got them here and there), I just enjoyed the adventure story and marveled at the amazing artwork.<br/><br/>Seen on Blu-Ray, this is yet another example in which you shake your head and wonder, ""How does the artwork get any better than this?"" Then, about six months from now, another will come along and I'll say the same thing. Overall movies may not be better today than ""in the old days,"" but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation. This is another example of that.<br/><br/>The colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning. I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes. From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny/ Back to the story, I found it a combination adventure-fantasy-comedy-suspense-sentimental story, about in that order, too. Generally-speaking, I would think adults would like this more than kids, but I may be wrong. Everyone - regardless of age - will have their jaw drop more than once viewing the incredible-looking scenes. It's really a feast for the eyes.

"happygoluckyduck","9","0","1","12 January 2010"," On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a ""Rushmore""
","Review:<br/><br/>The best thing about 'Up' is perhaps its fantastical logic and its strict adherence to physics that while maybe not sound we can still believe in - of course a house can be carried by balloons and of course when a few balloons pop, the house will be less buoyant! <br/><br/>Pixar is a miracle. I'll just come out and say it. Not since the earliest pictures of Disney's Golden Age have we been thrown into animated worlds so visionary that they kindle in our imaginations the ruminations of what we must have felt in childhood when beholding something truly marvelous – the first time we went to the aquarium for instance.<br/><br/>Visionary is a word I do not use lightly, and yet, I must apply it to many Pixar films – ""Finding Nemo"" (2003) and ""Wall-E"" (2008) just to name two. While watching 'Up' I found myself cataloguing the strongest images of the film and how I would use those images to decorate a future Criterion Collection Edition of the film. There was an abundance of inspiration.<br/><br/>The story is simple and profound. Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) is a man who always dreamed of being a great explorer, but like so many would-be explorers, he chose to settle down with a wife and build a life with her. They lived in the house in which they first met as children and this home becomes the iconic symbol of Carl's whole life - all it was, all it is, and all it can be. When Ellie dies, Carl becomes a bitter recluse, hanging on to his home as his last connection to his wife.<br/><br/>With the encroachment of construction projects and soon the law, it becomes increasingly clear to Carl that he will be forced to vacate the home he treasures so dearly. But instead of submitting to the forces that be, Carl decides he will use his house as a means of escape. Using thousands of balloons, he transforms his home into a buoyant vessel and heads for Paradise Falls in South America, the place where he and his wife always dreamed of visiting.<br/><br/>There is one complication to his plan though. A little boy has inadvertently stowed away by crawling under Carl's porch immediately before take off. This is Russell (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Scout who's one wish is to get a merit badge for assisting the elderly. Inspired to help Carl in any way he can, Russell becomes an unlikely sidekick in the old man's quest to get to South America.<br/><br/>The rest of the story involves Russell and Carl coming into conflict with an aged explorer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) and his quest for an elusive South American bird. This plot is fun and involves talking dogs, but it is almost tangential to the real theme of the film which is the process of letting go the past while still treasuring it.<br/><br/>""Up"" is a beautiful film. The colors combined with the minute detail allow for a divine viewing experience. After it's over you feel like you've eaten a rainbow. Pixar has done it again. Some people/companies are prone to masterpieces and Pixar is certainly amongst the ranks.<br/><br/>Rating:<br/><br/>On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a ""Rushmore"" (1998)<br/><br/>Rationalization:<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine that there could be a theme other than 'growing up' in film. No matter who we are, at what age, or in what place, we are perpetually in a state of growing up (and hopefully growing wiser). The forward current of time makes it so. I think the title 'Up' is not only referring to the motion of Carl's house but to his and Russell's growth throughout the story. Inevitably, part of growing up is letting go of things and it's perhaps how we accept our losses that informs how we grow. ""Up"" is an incredibly wise movie and it is not afraid to explore scary topics like aging and death in terms that children can understand. On the whole, I think ""Wall-E"" (2008) will be better remembered for its ruthless social critique and beautiful love story, but my guess is that ""Up"" will hold its own for many years to come.<br/><br/>http://iamdatabasefilmjournal.blogspot.com/"
"sabretoothmovies","8","0","1","5 January 2010"," UP with the Movie, Down with the Dogs
","As we have learned from their previous nine films, Pixar makes amazingly awesome movies (with possibly the exception of Cars, but even then not really). For their tenth endeavour they have produced UP, a family film that lives up to the company name. My opinion during the first half an hour of the movie in fact, was that UP would be the best Pixar film yet, and it almost was.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spend time on the good parts of the movie, because they're the usual good pixar things. Instead I'm just going to have to talk about the damn dogs.<br/><br/>Starting around a half hour in the audience is introduced to a group of dogs, whose collars transmit what their thinking into words. To me this sounds like a bad idea on paper and it looks worse on screen, especially since Pixar can't make up it's mind to whether the dogs are geniuseswho can fly airplanes or the typical mutts that gets distracted by a squirrell. I mean it's weird enough as it is, having an old explorer living in a tropical forst own hundred of dogs let alone ones that can talk. In one scene the heroes of the movie escape imprisonment by throwing a tennis ball by their guards. In another the dogs make fun of their leader because he has to wear the cone of shame (one of those anti-itch dog cones). Keeping in mind these are dogs who in previous scenes have used GPS systems and cooked gourment meals. This might be okay in another cartoon movie but come on Pixar I expected more from you than a scene wear dogs are playing poker in the background. <br/><br/>In the end though this is another great Pixar movie that is miles ahead of any other kid movie. I just wished there weren't the stupid dogs."

","I am 21 years old and never in my life have I cried at a movie. I always thought that one should bestow tears on matters of the day-to-day tragedy of existence. Yet the first 10 minutes of Up blew away my every belief.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of an old man following a childhood dream, whilst trying to fulfill a promise, in a flouting house held up by balloons. And the thousand balloons that lift his house are the thousand of desires, wishes, longings that every one of us has had throughout our lives but never had the courage to follow.<br/><br/>It speaks about freedom in a manner that seems so familiar, and yet equally unreachable; it speaks about the importance of holding on to the past but also of how to embrace the present by releasing past resentments. I got sucked in such a roller-coaster of emotions, that I found myself laughing my pants off while crying like a new-born. It has such a strong message, but packed in a story that everyone can watch and enjoy, no matter the age.<br/><br/>And we draw the lessons from our own existence. And that process is a unique experience for each and every one of us. You can find out why a dog loves its master, the importance of a legacy, the downfall of an obsession or why counting colored cars is good for a child. But of course, one can also learn ten ways to fight with a cane.<br/><br/>But in the very end you realize that it's never too late or hard to make one of your dreams come true, but if, on the way, you take somebody else's dream and you give it a nudge, the experience might prove even more rewarding.<br/><br/>The best animation feature I have ever watched and one of the best movies that I have ever enjoyed. If you haven't watched it yet, find it, buy it, and love it."

"zunitrail-1","7","0","1","1 January 2010"," Paradise falls...
","I think the main problem with this film, which I found just OK, was that it was made in these times of ours. Probably what made me think so was seeing it on the same day I saw the digitalized version of the 1941 movie ""Mr. Bug Goes to Town."" While I enjoyed Carl's character, it was diluted by the hyperactivity going on around him, and I ended up caring much more about the insect village in New York 1941 than what happened to Carl's house, which he talked to as if it were his wife. The insect village was beautifully colored and animated, had interesting characters and dialog, and a decent plot (not to mention great music). ""Up"" (which is called Old Carl's Flying House here in Japan) did not have the beautiful color of ""Mr. Bug,"" the human characters were so much like ordinary people we all know (yawn), and it overall tested the suspension of belief I hold for all animated films... the superpowers of 78-yr old cane-wielding Carl and his nemesis 98-yr old Muntz, people and animals apparently being magnetically attached to a wildly careening blimp, to name a couple. Most of all, I missed the crispness of color and line I have come to expect from Pixar. A huge drop from WALL-E. Despite all this, I became misty-eyed at the right moments: which is why movies like this kind of scare me. The intended messages were missed, but at least I cried."
"Rob_Taylor","5","0","1","31 December 2009"," UP?....the first quarter hour brings you DOWN!
","As a projectionist, I frequently get to see the first ten minutes of most movies. You start the show, then hang around to make sure all is well with sound and vision before moving on to the next lace-up. Sometimes, those first few minutes stretch out a bit as the movie catches your interest.<br/><br/>So it was with Up, but not in any kind of good way. The first 15 minutes or so depict the life of the Old Man from his childhood through to his current grumpy self. And what a life. Good God! A more calculated betrayal of viewer expectations I've never seen! At first, all is good. The kid plays, he meets a young girl, falls in love, gets married etc. All nice, charming stuff. But then the evil Pixar gremlins twist the knife ruthlessly. One mishap after another befalls the man and his wife. The car breaks, then the house is damaged in a storm. Then the wife discovers she can't have children (yes, I know...this is supposed to be a kids film, right?). Every mishap sets back the couple's plans to visit Angel Falls in Venezuela (a dream since they were both little). Finally, though, all seems well. The man (now old) finally goes and buys the tickets for the trip. He plans a nice picnic at their favourite spot to break the good news to his wife.<br/><br/>Can you guess what happens? The evil Pixar goblins think that's too cheerful for kids. They instead have the wife partly collapse on the way, leading to a hospital scene (the second one of the intro) and, ultimately, the most depressing scene of all - the old man returning to his home alone, the wife having passed away.<br/><br/>All this in the first fifteen minutes....<br/><br/>I get that Pixar wanted to explain the back story of the old man so he wouldn't come across as grumpy and churlish. But all they actually did was to depress the Hell out of everyone watching.<br/><br/>As this was aimed primarily at younger kids, I can't help but wonder about all the awkward questions and tears parents must have faced in those first twenty minutes.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is technically excellent, but still rather dark and morose. Additionally, the complete and utter incompetence of the boy, Russell, leaves you wondering just how he managed to get all his other badges. Dogged persistence, I suspect.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film isn't brilliant on a number of levels - competent, but not brilliant. But those opening minutes really taint the rest of the movie badly.<br/><br/>As a rental I'd suggest vetting it yourself before showing it to the kids, particularly if they are sensitive. You'll end up answering a whole bunch of difficult questions if you don't.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, as a whole, but has a rather unpleasant bite at the start which throws it in with the likes of Disney's Dinosaur and Bridge to Terabithia for unexpected shock value.<br/><br/>EDIT: Just realised that ""Stupid, but funny, Fat Kid"" appears to be an endemic trait in animated movies. Up, Monster House, Paranorman etc. they all have them now."

"Vishal_s_kumar","10","0","1","13 December 2009"," A must see, brilliantly told tale....
","I'm unashamed to admit that Up wrecked me. It didn't earn a stalwart man-tear. It didn't make my lip quiver. It didn't even assault me with the usual warm-n-fuzzies. No, dear readers, it absolutely wrecked me. It's not often that I'm reduced to a pile of thirtysomething tears and sobering sniffles, but Pixar mainstays Pete Docter and Bob Peterson created such a touching tale, such a rousing adventure, such a gorgeous masterpiece that I was completely enraptured by everything that graced the screen. From an early, heart-wrenching glimpse into an old man's dashed hopes and hardened heart to his eventual embrace of something far greater than he ever imagined, Up is as much an emotional experience as an entertaining one; as much a multi-layered character study as a rewarding animated journey; as much a stirring story of love and loss as a thoughtful, nuanced examination of friendship and devotion. Before I exhaust all the glowing adjectives in my vocabulary, I suppose it's best to start at the beginning. After earning critical and box office success with the help of several unlikely animated heroes -- a box of aging toys, a bumbling ant, a pair of closet-haunting monsters, a neurotic fish, a family of outlawed crime fighters, a cocky race car, and a cooking rat -- Pixar proudly introduces Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner), a bitter widower who decides to relocate his house to a remote South American locale using tens of thousands of helium balloons. His motivation? A decades-old promise he made to his late wife, Ellie (Elie Docter), when they first fell in love. Of course, things don't quite go according to plan. Carl finds a young Wilderness Explorer named Russell (Jordan Nagai) stuck on his now-soaring front porch, inadvertently flies into a storm, lands short of his intended destination, and meets an elderly recluse named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) who just so happens to be his childhood role model. But before he has the chance to get his bearings, Carl finds himself at odds with the arrogant explorer, building a genuine relationship with Russell, and rediscovering the man his wife always knew him to be.<br/><br/>Up opens with a staggering sequence that introduces Carl and Ellie, follows their budding relationship through childhood and adolescence, finds them sharing vows at the altar and, eventually, growing old together. But as heartfelt as it all is, it never grows saccharine. Carl and Ellie struggle with finances, reevaluate their dreams, learn they can't have children, and discover that Ellie has cancer. Inevitably, we watch as Carl attends the funeral of his one true love, roots himself in his house, and reacts accordingly when land developers want to take it away from him. It's in these opening scenes that Up establishes its identity, its thematic power, and its poignancy. Carl isn't merely a grumpy hermit, he's a sympathetic romantic; a lovelorn victim of circumstance whose brow furrowed the moment his cornerstone was ripped from his grasp. His whirlwind adventure doesn't reek of rip-roaring randomness or Saturday-morning silliness, it's bolstered by very real, very familiar pain that drives him forward and pushes him to be a better man. His South American quest isn't about selfish pursuits or cantankerous whimsy, it's about love; the kind of love that burrows deep and never relents; the sort of love that haunts the hearts of widows and widowers the world over. Carl's simple glances at a picture frame will bring tears to your eyes. His desperate attachment to his house is more about holding onto Ellie than a home. His adventure is driven by his fading memories, not a cluster of balloons or a pack of chatty dogs.<br/><br/>Despite a great many challenges, Docter and Peterson manage to flawlessly transition Up's tragic opening into an undeniably entertaining second act. They tap into a variety of rather standard gimmicks -- an awkward kid, talking animals, midair battles, and physics-defying hilarity, among others -- but infuse each one with enough patented Pixar magic to ensure the film never falters or fails. Russell is as endearing as young characters come: his intense curiosity, short attention span, and fledgling self esteem are masterfully paired with Carl's embittered disposition, making the pair's relationship one both young and old viewers will enjoy watching unfold. The floating house is a character in its own right: a rickety incarnation of Ellie and a symbol of Carl's undying love, it's used to remarkable effect throughout the tale to evoke regret, heartache, and longing. Muntz is a complicated, believable antagonist: a washed up icon determined to prove his worth no matter the personal cost. Even Dug and Kevin, the film's oh-so-helpful animals, are welcome additions to the narrative. They provide infectious comic relief, sure, but they also highlight the mystery and wonder of Carl and Russell's jaunt through the jungle. Together, these seemingly disconnected elements work brilliantly, granting Up even more depth, spirit, and fun than it already has.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, Up is a triumph for all involved. It makes other animated films look positively childish, yet will win the hearts of kids and adults. I'm not sure how young children will handle some of the film's weightier scenes -- despite the semi-silent nature of the Carl and Ellie montage -- but it has plenty to offer families and animation fans alike. While I certainly won't guarantee you'll adore Up as much as I did, I can safely say the film will be remembered for quite some time. More than an animated adventure, more than a heartwarming story, more than a colorful trek, it's the best animated film of the year, one of my favorite animated films of all time and, hands down, one of the best films of 2009. It's a must-see classic in every regard."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","0","1","12 December 2009"," Wonderful Gem from Pixar
","Up (2009)<br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A marvelous achievement ranks as one of the greatest animated movies ever made. The story is pretty simple as an elderly man, after the death of his beloved wife, decides to finally explore South America as the two had always planned. He ties millions of balloon onto his house and takes flight when he notices a young cub scout is along for the ride. Once they hit the jungles the two will discover what's really important in life as they have one battle after another. Even though I had heard this was a great film, I was really shocked to see just how great it actually was. I was a little skeptical after being somewhat letdown by WALL-E, a film I liked but one I didn't feel lived up to the hype. Everything in this film hits all the right marks and I'd go even further by saying it's one of the greatest animated movies I've ever seen. This movie not only has a great love story but it's also an excellent adventure film and buddy film. Not to mention all the great laughs and the masterpiece animation. The Carl character is without question one of the most memorable, lovable and just downright entertaining in the history of animation and I can't help but think that this character will go down in movie history like so many of the early Disney characters. The love story told early on between he and his wife was incredibly touching and more human than many of the live action love stories we get today. His then father-son relationship with the young boy is also incredibly touching as is his connections to that silly bird and talking dog. I really loved the look of the film and those balloons flying are certainly a beautiful site. I'm not a major fan of CG animation but the work being done by Pixar is something truly remarkable and that brilliant work continues here. This is certainly a movie that has a little bit of everything but what's so special is its heart and how it can communicate human emotions through animation."

Although Pixar has mixed things around a bit this time by, introducing an elderly character and briefly approaching such themes as life and death,loss,loneliness and the passing of time,the film is clearly children oriented. Sure, it is uplifting,vibrant and fun and the animation and gci is great but its also crazy,unrealistic and ridiculous. I don't think anyone older then 7/8 years old will take this film seriously. As a kids films, I think Up is tremendous,probably a delight for any kid and I would rate it possibly as 8 or 9; as an overall film, its almost a disgrace. But how could it not be? This film shouldn't even be compared to regular films because it has a very exclusive and limited target audience.Has yet to be made a film that can be fully enjoyed by people of all ages.<br/><br/>5/10"
"TheUnknown837-1","10","0","1","18 November 2009"," Take my word for it: everything you have heard about ""Up"" is absolutely true
","Let me tell you something. It is really, really difficult to write a compelling and compassionate review for a movie as wonderful and impeccable as ""Up."" Why? Because with a movie as complex and imaginatively powerful as this, there is a tendency to want to give away parts of the story in order to fully encompass to your readers how much you loved it. And believe me, there is a moment in just about every scene of ""Up""'s running time that I loved and want to share with you, but for first-time viewers, this would be disgracefully rude, for I would be spoiling the wonder and magic that you would experience upon seeing the movie.<br/><br/>Part of what makes ""Up"" so powerful, is because it was made by Pixar and is therefore, empowered by a fresh and original story. Ed Asner voices Carl Frederickson, a retired balloon salesman who, on the verge of losing his home of seventy years, decides to fulfill his childhood ambition by strapping thousands of balloons to his house and flying to a legendary plateau in South America. And much to his surprise, he has a stowaway: a junior explorer named Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai). And together, the two of them sail to South America, completely unaware of the fantastic and symbolic journey that lies ahead of them.<br/><br/>And that is all that I am going to give away for you. To reveal any other key story elements would seem blasphemous to an enthusiastic amateur movie critic like myself. But I will say this: everything you have heard about ""Up"" is one hundred percent true. I still say that the two ""Toy Story"" movies are my favorite out of all the masterpieces and cinematic wonders that Pixar has made, but this is definitely right there behind them by a sliver.<br/><br/>And I will also say this. There is a tendency for people to assume, by the title and the premise, that this is a movie strictly for young children. Quite the opposite, it's more of a movie suited for children ages, say ten, and up into seniority. This is a movie that an adult can watch without the company of a child. The perfect audience for this movie is an entire family, although there might be some scenes a little too adventurous for the tots.<br/><br/>The animation by Pixar is fantastic, the screenplay is wonderful and rich with imagination and narrative strength, the story is gripping, the voice acting strong, but what makes ""Up"" so enthralling for me anyway is that it's not simply a movie. It's a movie that's *about* something symbolically and it's all personified by the character voiced by Edward Asner. This is a movie about growing old, about reaching the peak of your age and looking back on your life and yet making what lies ahead of you a new adventure altogether.<br/><br/>In the end, if you want a movie that is gut-busting in humor, strong in story, rich in depth and wit, packed with adventure and imagination, and symbolic in its telling, than ""Up"" is the perfect movie for you. I can't name one person off the top of my head that I wouldn't recommend this movie to. It's another masterpiece by Pixar and one of the more impressive motion pictures that I've seen in a long time."

","Saw it on DVD, great sound and great picture.<br/><br/>From PIXAR, the same group that gave us one of my favorites, ""Monsters, Inc"". Although the two movies are quite different, one might even say totally different, I will compare them. Each has a very compelling story to tell, and the superb animation and voice acting are present to support the story. Many of the animated movies in recent years have looked superb, but suffered from very marginal stories.<br/><br/>In ""UP"" we see what can best be described as a love story. Two kids meet quite randomly, and long before they know what ""love"" is really all about, but they turn out perfect for each other. They get married, make plans for the adventures they want in live, grow old together, and find that somehow ""real life"" has gotten in the way of their dreams.<br/><br/>All this we see in the first few minutes of the movie. It sets up the fantasy, that an old man just living out his life can attach enough helium-filled balloons through the chimney of his little house to not only float up into the air, but also float to South America to a spot that he has dreamed about since he was a small boy. Our logic says this can't really happen, just as our logic tells us children don't really have power-generating Monsters in their closets at night. But this movie is not about logic, it is a fantasy.<br/><br/>This is an interesting, exciting movie with superb animation. But the real pay-off is in the love story, which isn't totally wrapped up until the very final image we see.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: As the young couple were growing up, they had an image, a hand-drawn picture which they placed on a photograph of the cliffs and waterfall in South America. The hand-drawn image was of their little house they dreamed of building on that site some day. That day never came. But through his perseverance and as the helium in the balloons finally lost their ability to keep the little house off the ground, it settled down to that very spot they had imagined all those years. He had finally given his wife, now deceased, the little house on the cliff."

","Pixar animations have brought some fantastic films in our time. They have amazed us for more than ten years. With Toy story, A bug's life, Finding Nemo, and at a time, my favorite,Ratatouille. Now, Pixar has come up with a film that is truly beautiful. Up is a big hearted animation with great visuals, humor, and many realistic things. Of course, it's not based on the truth. There ain't a chance in hell that it is based on the truth. But this movie is so beautiful because it focuses a lot on the main character. Also, I found the film to very sad at the beginning, but at the end, it puts a huge smile on your face. I can assure you. <br/><br/>Carl Fredrickson(voiced brilliantly by Ed Asner) had a good life for a while. Until he got older. Now that Carl is older, his life is kind of sad.

","Pixar's UP, is a movie that made me write my first review ever. For a movie this great, only a screening would do justice.<br/><br/>UP's first 15 minutes were so touching to the soul, that tears were already in my eyes(not a common phenomenon). The love between the couple and how Carl becomes a widower, were all portrayed so beautifully, that you could really connect with his grief. Every single instance relating to their love, were just too close to heaven, such amount of expertise in portraying human emotions, I'm baffled. The note left by Ellie, left me in streams of tears. Such fineness.<br/><br/>Amongst the love and grief, there is a special place for the humor, which comes at right times & right intervals, without disrupting the overall theme of the movie. All the heroic attempts appear natural to the human behavior. And all this has been coated with the icing of the love & affection.<br/><br/>Truly a must watch movie, a 10/10 with no second thoughts. Surely will be the first movie I'll watch twice."

","Having seen all the reviews, trailer hype and the rest, I must admit to expecting a little bit of disappointment walking into this movie. So many of todays films aimed at children tell you the entire story before you ever make it into the cinema. Many of the ""moments"" are so often staged and entirely predictable. <br/><br/>""Up"" is really very different. Despite knowing the basic story line from the trailers, the whole movie is still just one surprise after another, full of emotions but not sickly sweet, real laughs come at you from nowhere, you don't feel you have to laugh for the sake of your children.

An astounding movie with riveting animation and colors, beautifully composed music, synchronizing perfectly with the setting and mood - not to mention an absolutely, unforgettably heartfelt plot.<br/><br/>Approximately five minutes into the movie I was sitting still, trying to hold back my tears. The entire story is a roller-coaster (truly) of emotions from sadness to roaring laughter and fright.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone could possibly regret seeing this, as I personally think it would be worth the money and time to see a couple times more.

"jboothmillard","10","0","2","22 October 2009"," Up
","This was the tenth feature created by Walt Disney Pictures studios and Pixar sounded like it had simple concept, but it is done so beautifully that you can feel yourself in the story. Basically young Carl Fredricksen (Jeremy Leary) loved the idea of exploring, and his hero was the great Charles Muntz (The Sound of Music's Christopher Plummer), and he one day meets fellow exploring enthusiast Ellie (Elie Docter). They grow and marry each other, and over the years they try to achieve their dream of travelling to the Lost Land in South America, but many things stop them, and the dream disappears completely after the sad death of Ellie. Carl (Edward Asner, voice in hundreds of cartoons) is now lonely and grumpy, but still remembers the promise he made to his wife, it is only when he hits a construction worker forcing him to move out to a retirement home that this may actually happen. Before the men can take Carl with them, a huge cover unveils thousands of helium balloons that manage to lift the whole house away, with directional wings to take Carl to South America. He is inadvertently accompanied by a young stowaway, eight-year-old scout Russell (Jordan Nagai) trying to earn his last assisting the elderly badge. After encountering a storm and nearly getting lost they manage to land safely on a cliff of South America's Lost Land, and tying the house to themselves they start walking to find the spot above the large waterfall. On the way they are joined by a rare colourful flightless bird, probably the ""snipe"", that Russell names Kevin, and a talking (with a translator) dog named Dug (Bob Peterson). While walking Carl meets his childhood hero, Charles Muntz, missing for many years trying to find the rare bird that he has to become evil over to catch. There is the point where Carl wants to be alone, determined to fulfil his promise to Ellie, but he finds the adventure book is more full than he originally thought. So he plucks up the courage to go after Russell, the bird and Dug and stop the nasty Muntz from succeeding, in the end he even manages to let his house go, attend Rusell's badge receiving reception, and get a new and I guess better house. Also starring Delroy Lindo as Beta, Jerome Ranft as Gamma and Pixar regular John Ratzenberger as Construction Foreman Tom. The montage near the beginning of Carl and Ellie together with music by Michael Giacchino is beautiful, the film is full of extravagant colour, and all the characters make this a wonderful heart-warming story that makes you believe your never to old to follow your heart and your dreams (sounds corny I know, but it's true). It may be aimed a little more at adults, but with plenty of stuff for the younger generation too, it is a visually astonishing, funny, moving, and imaginative, essential animated viewing. It won the Oscars for Best Music for Michael Giacchino and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Sound Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film and Best Music, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film for Best Original Score. Outstanding!"

","Disney/Pixar must be on the seventh heaven after this film, not because the movie's named up, but because it is rich, splendid, magnanimous, resplendent and towering piece of cinema. Not only does it bond with children, but also enchants every viewer, young or old. <br/><br/>The plot itself if vastly different from the other stuff by Pixar. Its completely unique and awe-inspiring. The love-story between Ellie and Carl is illuminating and very sad. Every scene has been planned properly so as to make no mistakes. The dialog is crisp and fine.<br/><br/>The creators have widened their imagination by introducing talking-dogs and some may find it unrealistic but who cares since its an animated movie. The most likable character is Carl followed by Russel. The bird called Kenny is a lovely addition and so is the talking dog.<br/><br/>I would have not mind watching this for the second or third time since its so good.

"mothersworry","10","0","2","15 October 2009"," My love for Pixar grows ever stronger
","This is my first review after joining the IMDb fold and what a movie to review!! Ever since Pixar wow'd me with Toy Story i've been continuously impressed with their ability to better themselves both creatively and visually. I would say the only weak film in Pixar's arsenal would be Cars.<br/><br/>Last year I was totally bowled over and consumed by WALL-E. As soon as I saw WALL-E i was taken back to my childhood and reminded of the movie Silent Running. Silent Running embedded itself into my mind and I fell in love with it. WALL-E grabbed me in the same way, in my opinion it was flawless. Beautifully made and beautifully animated. How could Pixar top it? Up has pushed the frontier even further and when you read a brief plot outline for the movie many people will comment that the idea is insane! Let me tell you that seeing this movie will stimulate your emotions hugely. Within the first 20 minutes you'll be taken on a roller-coaster ride of emotion!!! You'll feel everything, depression, sadness, joy, happiness, anger....and all there is to back this up on screen is a beautifully written soundtrack and a truly astounding visual story.<br/><br/>The start of the film sets the scene, giving you a run through of how Carl Fredericksen's life has unfolded from his early childhood heroes, to the meeting of his future wife, to his despair of her passing. They had always planned to adventure together to South America but it was never mean't to be. Carl is alone and sad. Whilst all of this has been happening the world has continued to change and the grassy fields that once surrounded his home have now turned to Skyscrappers. After an innocent accident forces the authorities to put Carl into a retirement home, Carl takes action and decides to tie thousands of helium balloons to his house (which he also calls Ellie after his wife) and seek the adventure which he never had with his beloved wife. Tagging along with him, also by accident is a young ""Wilderness Explorer"" Russell. Giving more of the movie away would be criminal but to just paint a brief picture, the pace of the movie is great, a few more characters come along for the ride and there is a central villain type character towards the last third.<br/><br/>The animation is wonderful and the story is absolutely top notch. I have read a few comments regarding the whole concept not being suitable for children. I guarantee that this is 100% suitable for all ages. Pixar have this wonderful ability to address situations such as the environment, right & wrong and even death, and paint a picture that can translate to everyone. I watched this movie in 3D with my partner, my 8 year old daughter and my 11 year old son and we all happily gave ourselves over to this picture and journeyed with it. I truly love this movie and could easily watch it again and again. I don't think any review can do it justice so please go and pay your money and see it for yourself.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 all day long."
"villanwilson87","10","0","1","13 October 2009"," Prepare To Be Happily Up-lifted Away!
","Pixar's tenth feature film so far in an astonishing career, is their most feel-good picture they have ever made. It is without doubt an instant classic, a rare film that will appeal to all-ages to go and see. 'Up' most definitely ranks alongside 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo', 'The Incredibles', and 'Spirited Away' as the best animated films of all time.<br/><br/>It is also the first film to have been made in 3D, which was a first for me to watch with those large glasses on. You could see the results, because the animation and story-telling throughout the film is utterly breathtaking. Pixar just don't seem to be creating poor films and at this rate they never will. 'UP' has so much depth and ground breaking visuals. I haven't felt like this since admiring Hayao Miyazaki's work ('Princess Mononoke', 'Spirited Away', 'Howl's Moving Castle'), which this takes slight inspiration from.<br/><br/>'UP' is about a retired, grumpy old man, named Carl Frederickson (brilliantly voiced by Ed Asner), who once aspired to become an explorer alongside his beloved wife Ellie. Together, they saved up to follow in the footsteps of Charles F. Muntz (Christopher Plummer) and visit Paradise Falls in South America, a beautiful rain-forest that is home to a lost world of curious creatures.<br/><br/>But both Carl & Ellie encounter road blocks through their lives, that they unfortunately never reach their dream. This was all portrayed through a wonderfully produced montage featuring some beautiful scored music by Michael Giacchino. After Ellie's death, Carl decides to full-fill his wife's dream, escaping the developers who are trying to build around his house by attaching helium balloons to it. As Carl embarks on his journey, he is not alone, as an eight year-old Asian-American called Russell (Jordan Nagal) becomes his unfortunate accomplice.<br/><br/>The film itself has some of the best action animation sequences you will ever see (not that I am going to spoil it for you), from meeting translating collar's attached to talking dogs (Dug, that steals the film in my eyes, which is joyfully voiced by co-director Bob Peterson) to a large multi-coloured bird named Kevin. The story becomes extraordinarily bizarre and hard to comprehend, but writer-directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson somehow keep us amused, excited and aware that there is an underlying point.<br/><br/>For Russell, who needs a father-like figure in his life and Carl learning adoptive grand-parenthood. The film is showing that if you have a dream, you should chase it and that meeting your life long heroes may end up disappointing you.<br/><br/>The film is predictably very funny in many parts. From creaking elderly bones, characters getting out of dangerous situations by using their knowledge that dogs like chasing balls whilst easily distracted by squirrels and young Russell trying to climb above Carl's head with hilarious results.<br/><br/>The only slight negative about the film is the it doesn't obey the law of physics, and Carl somehow running without his tennis-ball attached cane. But to be quite honest I didn't care, and I doubt that you will to, because the film is there to make you laugh, smile, and enjoy at the same time, which Pete Docter & Bob Peterson succeed. This film will deservedly make bucket loads of money into an already multi-billion dollar film industry in Pixar.<br/><br/>A classic family adventure film, that will appeal to everyone, and that you should watch. Very heart-warming, and very up-lifting.<br/><br/>Bravo again Pixar."
"agmoldham","6","0","1","13 October 2009"," Another fine film by Pixar
","This was the first feature film that I have seen in 3d. Before discussing the merits of 3d let's discuss the film.<br/><br/>Pixar must be the most critically/commercially successful production company of recent times. They have no duds in their back catalogue and a number of classic movies. Up is another fine film and just fails to make classic status although I am sure many people will rank it alongside Wall E and Toy Story. Personally I found it a little bit too sweet although that's a fine line that most of the Pixar movies tread.<br/><br/>The film follows the dreams and ambitions of a couple of kids looking for adventure, Carl and Ellie. We see a quick clip of them ageing and putting off that trip they'd always planned to South America. Before we know it, it's too late ... or is it? The great thing about the movie is that you care about the characters. It always seems a bit strange to me that for some reason it is easier to feel empathy for animated characters than real actors. I've put it down to good script writers in the past, but I'm starting to wonder if there's something else going on. Anyway I'm sure most people will love Up and that it will be many peoples favourite film of the year.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, this was the first film that I have seen in 3d. I can't say it really added to my enjoyment of the film and I can't help feeling that it's a bit of a gimmick designed to increase cinema takings. I've been to several 3d presentations at theme parks, but I think that's where the technology belongs. Maybe there will be a killer app that really showcases the technology, but I don't believe 3d will add much to most films."

The story is childish, the characters are irritating, the metaphors confused, the animation woeful. I mean c'mon people, are you all so backwards that you can't see the proverbial elephant in the living room when he takes a crap on your carpet. This film is risible. It was so bad I felt violated when I left the cinema. Dazed and confused by this infantile assault of sub mediocrity. This film should have a warning sign hanging round its neck. I wanted to do harm to myself after seeing this desperate entertainment. It is so disgusting. Everything about it from story construction to anaemic characterisations. And those dogs ... in the words of the legendary Bhundu Boys ... ""Who let the Dogs out !!!"" I think Pixar are like those cute Disney animals that stare up at you with their elongated eyelashes.

","This movie was amazing. Seriously. The 3-D was great, the story was pretty good but a bit stupid, but other than that it was amazing. If you are a fellow Pixar fan, see it. Pixar movies are the only animated movies I can sit through and actually enjoy because they are the only ones that actually put imagination in their movies anymore. Like...Ice Age 3? There's a Shrek 4 in the works? Are you serious? It's like COME UP WITH A NEW IDEA ALREADY!!! Shrek and Ice Age are boring now. Although Pixar does have a few sequels in the works, I still rest my case. In my opinion, the two best Pixar movies yet are Up and Wall-e. In short, I think that Pixar movies are the best in the animation genre."
"gainestillinger","9","0","1","11 October 2009"," Touching and very very funny.
","Pixar grows braver with every film. In Wall-e we were enthralled and enchanted by an animated trash-removal-bot for nearly an hour before a single word, other than his own name or the name of the film's Biblically inflected love interest, Eve, was said. In Up we are on similar ground as we watch Carl Frederickson grow from a young nervous boy fixated on becoming like his air blimping world exploring hero, Charles Muntz, to a balloon selling man married to his childhood sweetheart and exploring compadre, Ellie. They meet as children and plan to travel the world.<br/><br/>We continue through their lives via a wonderfully bittersweet montage of love and disappointment as Ellie and Carl learn that they cannot pursue their dreams of exploring South America, or have children. Get your hankies ready for that one. We watch as Carl, voiced by Edward Asner, becomes bitter, grows old, shuts himself away from the world and tries to out-stubborn the corporation that wants to demolish his beloved house and build, for God's sake, a m-i-n-i mall.<br/><br/>Carl has always been a man for plans, so he plans an escape: attach several thousand balloons to the roof of the house and float away to Paradise Falls; park on the canyon's edge and live out his days knowing that he did for Ellie in death what he could not do for her in life. A great plan if it wasn't for the twelve year old scout, Russell, who stowed away with him and is determined to 'assist an old person' in order to complete his badge sash and get his own father to notice him. This is where the adventure begins: talking dogs, hilarious slapstick sequences, a maniacal bad guy (explorer Muntz, voiced by a rich and gritty toned Christopher Plummer) and one very strange rare bird that said bad guy wants from Carl and Russell all total up to a fantastic way to spend an afternoon. Even with lots of kids around you.<br/><br/>This is a film about how walls, no matter how old and bitter, can be broken down if you are prepared to accept the past. It is a film about putting memories in a safe and warm place that you can visit when you want; knowing you don't have to live in them. It is a touching fantasy that, quite frankly, I think at some point we've all had: fly away and live somewhere beautiful with someone you love. Marvellous."
"vip_ebriega","10","0","2","29 September 2009"," UP is what going to the movies are all about.
","My Take: Pixar has done it again in this brilliant, imaginative and heartwarming animated adventure.<br/><br/>I've always admired Pixar's works, from their debut in TOY STORY to their later works like RATATOUILLE and WALL-E. I like their talents in telling a good story, the brilliant animation and their own unique style. But as their movies keep getting better every time, my affection for them deepens. I still like the animation and the story-telling, but over the years, they have given me more reasons to like them. But their latest works like WALL-E and the subject of this review UP has pretty much summed up one of the things I truly love about their films: It's how they manage to get you even in those smaller moments of their movies. Their movies always have wonderful stories to tell, but even some of their small scenes, like when WALL-E was listening ram shackling some interesting ""trash"" for example, provide small moments of wonder and curiosity. Their latest film UP has a lot of these scenes, particularly what happens earlier in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie opens with an adventurous boy named Carl Fredricksen sitting in a theater watching the adventurous of his hero Charles Muntz, an adventurer in a quest for Paradise Falls, a land lost in time. But after being convicted about being a fake by his critics, Muntz disappears in search of proof. Meanwhile, Carl finds his match in Ellie, a little girl who shares his passion for adventure and the quest for the legendary Paradise Falls, which she intends to be the site for her new clubhouse. Carl and Ellie swore that they'd be best friends forever, and one thing led to another: they become closer friends, grow up, fall in love, got married and enjoyed a fruitful, happy, often problematic life, but with the quest for the legendary falls still somewhere in their minds. For 70 years, the two of them spent the greatest adventure of their lives, until Ellie dies leaving Carl a sad and rather empty man. This may not be the story of UP, but for those early 30 something minutes of the film, UP already has my vote for the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>If the film had the power to make the audience laugh and cry in the first hour, I was dying to know what happens afterward. Carl ends up being an old, lonely man (voiced by Ed Asner) still living in the house he and Ellie built, in spite of heavy construction being built around his home. But when he was forced to go to a retirement home, his passion for adventure kicks back in. He ties a million balloons to his house and sends it flying to South America in search for Paradise Falls. Along for the trip is eager 8 year-old wilderness explorer Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai), whose reluctant to get his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge. Along the way, they meet danger, a rare giant bird, a dog with a voice-translating collar, and a familiar hero in his older years.<br/><br/>UP was released at a late time here in the Philippines, and didn't really stay for too long in theaters which is too bad. This is probably the best film I've seen all year, and probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. UP is not contended with just being cute as other animated movies of its kind do; the story is told the way it was supposed to, regardless of how dark and mature it might be for the younger audiences (the scenes involving the Ellie's demise may be a bit too heartbreaking for small fry). It doesn't matter whether or not there are gonna be toys or McDonald's tie-ins, the movie alone is already worth a million viewings. It's certain the movie will grab just as much audiences on DVD as in Pixar's other movies. UP, to put it straight-forwardly, is a masterpiece, and if there are other movies this year that want to be as great, animated or not, they have a lot to live up to.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","Up is another must-see animated film from Pixar Animation Studios. It's about a cranky old man and an overeager Scout who fly to South America in a floating house suspended from helium balloons. Up is director Pete Docter's (Monsters, Inc.) second feature-length film, and features the voices of Edward Asner, Christopher Plummer, Bob Peterson and Jordan Nagai. It is the first Pixar film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.<br/><br/>Up is definitely one of the better Pixar efforts. It's about the grandeur and excitement of flight and adventure. The first ten minutes of the film about Carl Fredricksen and his life-long love Ellie are surprisingly touching. It's heartbreaking to see him lose his wife even at old age. With nothing left to do Fredricksen heads for South America, but he's not alone. Russell, a Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge, has stowed away on the porch after being sent on a snipe hunt by Carl the day before. The relationship of father and son that forms between Fredricksen and Russell is completely believable. The filmmakers certainly know how to make a film with endearing characters. The animation is gorgeous. Several scenes in Up are some of the most memorable that I've ever seen in animated films. Like other Pixar films Up is also very funny. Thankfully, it's sweet humour instead of the gross humour that's present in many of today's Hollywood films. In conclusion, Up is another daring, unusual and beautiful animated film from Pixar that both children and adults will enjoy watching. I highly recommend it."

","This is nothing less than a masterpiece. Pixar has, once again, completely blew me away!<br/><br/>I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical about seeing it at first. I mean, an old guy floating away in a house with a bunch of balloons tied to it? But, amazingly, and not too surprisingly, Pixar pulled it off perfectly! The story was intriguing, sweet, and incredibly original. The characters were hysterical and very lovable. My favorite was the dog, Dug. He was funny and nothing less than adorable! The little kid was also very funny and cute. The old man was a bit of a grouch, but it was only because he recently went through a tragic event. (I'm not going to give away what it was). You eventually start liking him because he develops more as a character and his grouchiness kind of fades away. The animation was incredible!! From the fur on the dogs, to the glorious landscapes, Pixar truly painted a moving masterpiece! The 3-D, I thought, enhanced it, and made you feel like you were there. during the scenes when the characters were really really high, my palms began to sweat, because the hight felt so real! It was nail-biting, having to watch characters ALMOST fall a thousand feet to the ground.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was hilarious, sweet, tender, and exciting.

","Where do I begin? Oh yes, the first time I heard that Pixar were coming up with their latest feature length offering from my sister, who is greatly passionate about character graphics and is desperate to join Pixar. Admittedly (like some of my fellow reviewers here), I found the storyline about an old man and a young kid stowing away to a legendary place in the South American jungles a bit dull.<br/><br/>But, boy, did Pixar prove me wrong spectacularly! As a visual treat, it's as perfect as anything you could ever imagine. The moments, tender and funny, never overplay and I found myself wiping my eyes on at least 3 sequences, most notably the one towards the beginning of the film: I laughed when Carl's family politely applauded, looking bewildered; I smiled when Ellie points out the cloud shapes; I was in tears when the doctor gives the shattering news that Ellie can't become a mom and finally my heart went out to a lonely old man who strives so much to keep a promise made to his wife when they were kids. It's impossible for a normal sane person to go through this scene without a pair of wet eyes.<br/><br/>The amusing moments begin when an old man Carl Fredericksen (Edward Asner), disgusted with the changing world, decides to take an adventure trip to Paradise Falls, a place where he and his late wife once dreamt of going. However, he has to contend with an overenthusiastic young explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai), an adorably foolish dog Dug (Bob Peterson), a pack of mutts trained by Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), idolized by Carl and his wife but doesn't seem to be what he really is. On the way, Carl doesn't redefine loyalty or any of that heavy-duty stuff, but as a human being, he becomes less of an island and more of a lovable father figure, especially in the last scene. This effort at redemption is justly rewarded. Watch the movie to understand my point.<br/><br/>The musical score is first class and embellishes each scene, giving it an everlasting lustre. The dialogues are witty, charming and as the old saying goes, never interfere with the narrative if not required, which leads to a truly memorable cinema experience. I'm definitely catching it again.<br/><br/>Take a bow, Pixar. For having introduced a synonym for excellence in motion pictures: UP."

","Pixar's Up is a visual treat for both the kids and the adults. But other than that the movie fails to convince me that it is the best out there. there is a very common thread that is running through both Wall-E and Up...Loneliness. The main character in both the films are undergoing severe loneliness and it is heart-breaking to watch it. My heart went out for Ed at times. But after sometime I got depressed and that is when I thought about Wall-E. It was the same thing I felt in that movie. There is a limit to how much Isolation I can handle :). Other than that the movie was a visual breeze. The animation was far too good and I felt as if I was in heaven while watching some scenes. The bird in the movie was fantastic. I just hope for the next Pixar movie there will be no isolation themes."

","If you go into this movie expecting it to be the typical light-hearted Pixar fare you're in for a surprise. Pixar took a pretty big risk with this story, and despite what the nay-sayers think, UP shatters the stereotypical animated-movies-are-only-for-kids template and delivers a winner. Yes, the movie deals with some very grown-up subjects such as grief, disillusionment and loss. You WILL be crying within the first fifteen minutes - and that's okay. Detractors fail to grasp UP's two-part message: First, you are NEVER too young or too old to follow your dreams and second, life is the greatest adventure off all, whether or not you actually find your dream.<br/><br/>I loved Carl & Ellie because they represent something all-too-rarely seen in movies of any kind these days: a pair of soulmates who start out life with big dreams but never quite seem to achieve them because reality keeps rearing its ugly head. Nevertheless their love for and commitment to one another grows and grows throughout in good times and bad.<br/><br/>Russell is annoying but not overly so, and has one of my favorite lines: ""Sometimes, it's the boring stuff I remember most.""<br/><br/>The only part I really didn't care for were the dogs (with the notable exception of Dug). Pixar went WAY overboard with them.<br/><br/>And you simply MUST watch the credits all the way through. Some of those merit badges are HYSTERICAL!!"

","It's become a tradition for me to go watch the latest Pixar movie when it comes out. This studio is the only one I trust enough to always blindly go to their movies. There's no greater cinematic injustice than wait for the DVD.<br/><br/>Movies like Up keep rewarding me for such loyalty. In this movie, we meet Carl Fredricksen, a 78-year-old man who decides to fulfill a pledge he made to his wife when they were still children: to visit South America. Their lives pass by in bliss, but without their dreams of adventure fulfilled; but when she dies and Carl faces loneliness he comes up with the most hilarious plan to make his dreams come true: he ties thousands of balloons to his house and just flies away.<br/><br/>By chance he receives an unwelcome guest: Russell, a 7-year-old boyscout trying to earn an elderly assistance' badge. Although the boy is initially an annoyance to the grouchy Carl, eventually the two become great friends and teach each other valuable lessons.<br/><br/>Like every Pixar movie, the story and characters are the main draw of the movie. Sure, the animation is spectacular, but which mega-studio can't get the same animation Pixar can? On the other hand, the screenplays Pixar comes up with are always simple but beautiful, not to mention excellent at visual storytelling. Wall-E was practically a silent movie; and even if there's quite a lot of chit-chat in Up, it's the ability to express ideas and feelings in images, which can be comprehended by children and adults alike, that make it so fascinating and heartbreaking."

","I had some expectations regarding this one. I didn't sense it would be as meditative as Wall.E, but i look forward to see what Pixar does. They are leading the sport of digital animation, and nearly all of their films have pushed something (or a lot) ahead, regarding the previous experience. Here, i wasn't expecting that the film, as a whole, would be as grasping as their past 2, but i really thought i might be positively surprised by the 3d. The set up pleased me: this was their first 3d film, and the basic plot seemed to announce the challenge they would take: a flying house, travelling a good portion of the globe, flying over cities, landing on a huge and deep waterfall. Already, by the description, it is spacial. Since we have had Ratatouille just 2 years ago, i thought and longed that the approach would be on the spacial exploration, enhanced by the possibilities of the 3d. Well, i was wrong. In the end this film is the flattest of all Pixar films of the last 6 years, even more than Nemo (which i thought had similar possibilities and failed in similar ways). 3D is merely an enhancement of flat scenes, mundane compositions, and camera work that wouldn't impress if the camera was real. I may have put my expectations out of focus, in relation to what the studio intended, but i really was expecting more on that side. I mean, in the theatre where i watched this, i saw a commercial, in 3D, of Vodafone, playing with that their spherical logo. At a certain moment, we got many spheres on screen, and the 3d made them 'get out' of the screen, and look like they were going to hit me. That 10 seconds bit was more of what i thought 3D can do than the whole film.<br/><br/>Well, other things are appealing, the introducing short film is, as usual, quite meaningful, in this case having to do with the act of creation, as a synonym for giving birth. We have clouds, who create, and storks, who deliver. One specific cloud molds what none other does, always dangerous beings, and the stork suffers in the way. Interpret it your own way, but i found it significant if you consider artists (creators) and the relation with an audience and the answer to the publics expectations.<br/><br/>The film is visually beautiful, not texture in the sublime fashion of Wall.E, but quite adventurous in how it uses colours. I still think Dreamworks is some steps ahead in face modelling, but these characters are more and more alive.<br/><br/>I think you'll find it funny, if that's what you want. I miss some wittiness of other films.<br/><br/>My opinion: 3/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

The first five minutes were the usual sentimental dead wife attempted character building Nemo-all-over-again Pixar stuff.<br/><br/>I don't mind sentimental, because it's just what they like to do in cartoons. What I do mind is the ""South Africa"" part of the movie - where they find the villain.<br/><br/>The villain is an explorer who found some bird bones and when the scientific committee accused him of fraud he went to South America and said he would not return until he finds a living specimen. And the old geezer is amazed by this. I am also amazed. Great character! But wait, because Pixar thinks otherwise. By the end of the film this explorer turns out to be the bad guy FOR Exactly THESE SAME REASONS - He gets punished for wanting to bring some dumb bird to a zoo after years of hard work and clean his name.<br/><br/>And why is this bad? Because the bird has some bird kids. So what? They could bring them all in a zoo, examine them, learn more about this mythical specimen. Is this wrong?

","By Aaron Dumont **** (out of 4) Pixar's Up is stunning and delightful. But what makes it so unique? It's a Pixar creation with disappointment, loneliness, regret, personal reconciliation and crushed ambition, but that's not what makes UP transcend entertainment to artistry--from child's play to vivid, mature reverie. In this movie, characters do let down others, get let down, die and spill blood. They cry, they lose hope, realtions are disintegrated, passions and goals unfulfilled. However, with all the hyperreal color, theatrics, and grace of it all, this movie works on two different volumes at once--both a life truly lived, as well as a life truly dreamt, which is a marvelous feat all by itself.<br/><br/>UP has beauty, redemption and a sense of simplicity and humor in it, while still remaining earthy and pure in its vision and splendor. In a compassionate homage of past classic movies and fairy tales, UP begins as an episodic series of Chaplinesque vignettes--from the opening, a short movie that evokes the beginning of Citizen Kane, UP establishes what it sets to be--a whole spectrum of moods, wonders and experiences from the first embrace of childhood to the final acceptance of weariness and grief.<br/><br/>As a young child, the main character Carl watches a short movie (as I had described earlier) about his hero and banal inspiration Charles Muntz, an aviator and explorer. He soon meets a young girl who shares his beloved obsession, and their childhood friendship soon turns into a lifelong marriage. They develop a dream to sail to where their idol Muntz had flown off to, never to return--Paradise Falls--but before they save up the money to do so, Carl's wife dies from a terminal illness, leaving with her the couple's lifelong goal.<br/><br/>Most of you probably know the rest. Carl ties thousands of balloons to his house, flies it up into the air, and a young boy accidentally gets swept on board. Their adventure begins. The beauty of the flying scenes are magnificent, and the pastoral range of light and shapes used here is more than merely impressive--it's a semi-psychedelic kind of life-affirming.<br/><br/>Apart from the technical brilliance, what can also be found here is profundity, humanity and emotion. This duo (Carl and the young boy) come across a now-elderly Muntz as well as several his several talking guard dog, which provide quirkiness a-la-Duck Soup (or perhaps Chaplin?)--comedy and craft in the most feverishly impassioned and feistily engrossing of the term. The two split up, after a series of mishaps and disagreements, in a turn for loneliness and solemnity, and in a climactic fight scene, find and embrace each other again, but not before depending on one another, helping each other, and saving each others lives in suspense and moving sleflessness. In fact, in the simple, humble ending, perhaps one of the most touching of endings, the formerly recluse and grumpy Carl makes himself as a father figure to his young companion.<br/><br/>UP is truly a wonder. It is capsule of sorts - it holds love, optimism, innocence and freedom in a special, vibrant place, glowing, blossoming and swirling around, floating through scenes and glowing as beautifully and brilliantly as birth. Even during the worst of times, in fact. UP has all the passion, exuberance and emotion of any great art--animated or not--with multifaceted flares of hallucinogenic sights, waking dream textures, reservoirs of poetry and magnificent vision, and the movie's humanistic grandeur and dignity makes it all the more lovably important.<br/><br/>UP, throughout all the adventures and feelings, achieves what many other movies couldn't even dream of doing - it creates a world on its own, one both personal and universal.<br/><br/>It's magic. Deep, true magic."

","WOW. Three-letter word that goes with phrases ""Damn Good,"" ""Darndest Best movie I'd seen in quite awhile,"" ""Impressively Creative,"" ""Genius,"" ""Extraordinarily Remarkable Inimitably Original One-of-its-kind romantic, adventurous, cute, mature, suitable for kids and kids of all ages 3D movie,"" and ""Simply Great."" Also WOW for MNEMONICS. First, W as in Warmth. This is gotta be one of the rarest movies that contains most of 'natural progression' of life's warmth. What could one ask more from a movie that has a romantic side, a love that started from age seven or eight from two different persons. Then warmth of love that stood against gravitation of sadness brought about by natural mishaps that happen in everyone's life. This side of warmth that fosters with age. And then the warmth of friendship - one of the aspects that mostly will make a movie great. What more? Friendship that is developed between two people that belongs to both side of the extremes (as in age). The idea of a man who doesn't have a child, who is widowed, and meets a kid that will later on become his friend or more like a son is truly genius. It is warm and it is a majestic side of this failing humanity.<br/><br/>Second thing, this has Outdone most movies failed to accomplish, both in IMDb ratings (currently seating at #26 in Top 250 Movies Of All Times) and Box Office grossing now at ($399,340,879). One of the many reason why this is so successful is that it incorporated a very original concept of an 'other world,' like LOST with the coolest creatures that never have occurred in most ordinary people's minds. The Robot Dog is brilliant... cunningly worth a million dollar for it's conception.<br/><br/>Tackling again the base of the story which is the friendship between a person that is being taken away into a hospice home and a kid needing the attention of his father, and along their way into adventure, meets a friend Bird and a lame Soldier Dog... together against a menacing goal of someone with his illest intentions just to serve his ego. AwesOme.<br/><br/>It's a short picture, less than two hours but it has tOuched so many sensitive areas of the emOtions of human. The part of the bird is a million dollar idea... her collecting food and even endangering her own life for her kids. Touching.<br/><br/>W for this-is-not-going-to-a-Waste-of-time kind of a movie. Lessons here are genuinely thoughtful.The adventure is entertainingly delightful and enjoyable. This is perfect. Every moment is beautiful.<br/><br/>(For critics) If you're one of the many people who are looking for something in the movie that would disappoint you, or you're waiting for something that would spoil all your enticed saliva... well, it's rare if you do find one (in this movie)."

"Jackpollins","10","0","3","13 August 2009"," Nothing short of perfect
","Up is one those rare family films that completely speaks to both kids and adults. It is funny and touching with jokes and sweet moments that both kids and adults will love. This is the story of Carl Fredricksen (voice of Ed Asner), who tied a 1,000 balloons to his house when his wife, Ellie dies. There's even a nice montage at the beginning of the movie about Carl's life, and how his life went downhill after his wife died. Now he lives in a house surrounded by construction, and one day, when a man is tearing down his mailbox, Carl attacks the man. So, when he is forced to go to a retirement home, he instead puts the balloons to the test. He soon takes in a boy scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai) when he finds him on the porch. Yes, this isn't realistic at all. There is no way a man can make a house fly, but it's by far Pixar's best film so far. The subplot involving Carl's hero, Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) trying to take Carl down is also interesting. This is probably the best family film ever made, and it nicely teaches difficult subjects like death and aging to a way that can speak to both kids and adults."

","This is a wonderful film that manages to work as a children's adventure flick and a serious allegory all at the same time. The animation is beautiful but the characters steal the show, and the most important character of all is the spirit of the old man's late wife as embodied in the balloons levitating his house. The old man spends the whole film literally attached to the house, flying it around with ropes and pulleys and dragging it down to the ground with a garden hose while the balloons are trying to pull it away from him. The more he hangs on the more he suffers, and he only regains his happiness when he finally lets it go. It's a Buddhist parable, and the sort of thing you'd expect to see in a French surrealist film. But Pixar has pulled it off in a kid's cartoon!!! You can't beat that: 10 out of 10."

","Walt Disney has done better animated films in the past. This one is rather average. But it is important because it shows a radical change in the targeted audience. The concept of family audience has completely changed. The kids are no longer accompanied by their parents but by their grand-parents. So the film targets these grand-parents as a potential audience and is built on two main characters, the child and the senior citizen. The whole film is based on this crossing over three generations. Then the film is also aiming at a younger audience that is living in decomposed more than recomposed families and the child is thus living with his father and another woman than his mother, and he is systematically betrayed, in spite of what he mat say, by his father. The boy scouts are shown as particularly father-centered if not male-chauvinistic by not allowing a boy to be supported by another person than his father when receiving medals in some ritual ceremony, the father or another fatherly man, but not the mother. A very long tradition with Walt Disney: their support of the family structure like with Ebenezer Scrooge in the famous Christmas Carol, or of course Snow White and Cinderella. Fathers are not particularly enhanced and step mothers are frankly demonized. The animals of the film are not essential, just some kind of mirror in which children will be able to recognize their phantasms and dreams. But this film is absolutely Anglo-Saxon and based on a myth from this culture and this culture only, or nearly, and particularly the English branch of that myth and culture, the Lost World of Conan Doyle, the belief in the existence of a pocket or virginal nature surviving behind un-crossable mountains that can only be reached by air with a blimp or a flying house. It is thus normal to have some paradise cataract and a bird of paradise, a giant one mind you, and of course this bird will have three chicks, a trinity that is there to sanctify this virginal world, this garden of Eden. At a time when Jules Verne was looking for adventures that contained a great quantity of danger, Conan Doyle was dreaming of the rediscovery of the garden of Eden. Charles Muntz has little to do with Captain Nemo. In fact he has no humanity at all, not even the good sense to forget about, and forgive, the dumbness of human beings. He is ready to kill a child and destroy a bird of paradise and doom its – her actually – chicks to perdition for his own vanity. It is these particularities that make the film interesting, but it does not have the finesse and the subtlety of Ratatouille. The allusions to American culture are numerous but it would be fastidious to give them all, like the small house surrounded by high rise buildings (Death of a Salesman). These allusions are aimed at the adult and elderly audience of course. But I can't resist asking one final question: is the Shady Oaks retirement home covering some shady business or some shaky eugenic mentality concerning the elderly?

","The Pixar animated comedy ""Up"" owes no small amount of its success to the specter of Charles Chaplin. No, Chaplin had nothing to do with this fanciful, first-rate, odd-couple comedy, except that ""Up"" shares something in common with Chaplin's 1921 movie ""The Kid."" The story throws together a grumpy 78 year old retiree and an eight-year old Wilderness Explorer scout and the elder learns how important he is to youngster after his wife has died. This exciting 3-D adventure (it's also available in 2-D) boasts top-flight production values. Indeed, this represents an instance where the characters are so realistically done and voiced that you readily accept them for the people that they play in the film. Mind you, this release may appear to be geared primarily toward adolescents, but adults don't have to worry about getting the short-shrift. There is more depth here beyond the superb 3-D visual effects than you might imagine. Although ""Monsters, Inc."" director Peter Doctor and scenarist Bob Peterson have made a film that epitomizes the spirit of adventure, ""Up"" is not without its poignant heartfelt moments that older viewers will appreciate but younger ones will dismiss. <br/><br/>The protagonist, former balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner's voice), is a septuagenarian who's hasn't entirely gotten over the death of his beloved wife Ellie. Ellie and he met when they were adolescents themselves and shared the spirit of adventure embodied in their media icon, the dauntless explorer and aviator Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer's voice) who flies around in his dirigible like an airborne Jacques Cousteau and makes headlines with each of his exploits. Carl likes to dress up like his idol when he attends the movies and watches the newsreels about Muntz. Unfortunately, Muntz's latest expedition falls under a cloud of suspicion because the fossils that he has brought back are disputed by the experts and he is officially discredited. Thwarted in his ambitions, the irate Muntz retreats from public view and he resolves to prove that he was right and his critics wrong. Indeed, there is a little of Captain Nemo in Muntz who flies around in his dirigible. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Carl comes home from the movies with his balloon and runs into Ellie in a dilapidated two-story house that she has equipped as if it were a plane. She freaks out Carl so much that he cannot utter a word when they meet and he realizes that she is a tomboy girl. They become inseparable best friends. They grow up and marry. They refurbish the old house and Carl gets a job selling balloons. The happiness that they share is derailed when Ellie realizes that she cannot have a child, but they continue to live their lives through their hero, Charles Muntz, and plan to visit the site of his last expedition that ended in his discredit. Unfortunately, Ellie dies the day that Carl buys their tickets. Now, alone in his golden years, Carl finds himself surrounded by new construction projects rising around him and men-in-suits trying to buy him out. Alas, Carl cannot sell the house that was so much a part of his life with Ellie. Things take another turn for the worse for Carl. A construction worker rams the mail box that Ellie and Carl built and Carl assaults the man with his walking cane and draws blood. The courts rule against him and Carl appears bound for the last place he wants to go: a retirement village. Along about that time, Carl has to deal with a cheerfully obtuse Wilderness Scout, Russell, who needs to earn a badge helping old folks. Initially, Carl wants nothing to do with Russell.<br/><br/>The day that the attendants from the retirement village show up to take Carl away, they notice piles of helium containers piled up on his lawn. Carl inflates the balloons and he flies away in his house to South America where Ellie and he dreamed about visiting the site of Muntz's last expedition. No sooner has Carl gotten his house aloft than he hears a knock at his front door and Russell is standing anxiously on the porch dying to come inside. Eventually, the oldster and the younger grow to tolerate and then love each other. They reach the site of Muntz's expedition. Sherlock Holmes readers who read A. Conan Doyle's novel ""The Lost World"" will recognize the similarity between the terrain of the plateau. Once they arrive, our heroes discover an example of a the wild life, a prehistoric bird, that befriends them. Unfortunately, Muntz wants to capture this bird so that he can rehabilitate his career. Inevitably, Carl and Russell find themselves pitted against the evil Muntz and his legion of oddball canines that wear exotic dog collars which enable them to speak. <br/><br/>Talk about underdogs, our heroes have a rough time saving the extinct bird from Muntz who is quite a dastard in his own right. The logic behind this story is clearly at odds with reality, but the sympathetic heroes and dastardly villain help us take our mind of these flaws. Carl was obviously forged in the Chaplin mode, but he resembles a cross between of Cary Grant from ""Walk, Don't Run"" and Spencer Tracy from ""Guess Whose Coming to Dinner."" ""Up"" is a lot of fun and you won't want to come down after its happy ending."

Then he meets a girl named Ellie who is also an explorer like him and has the dream of going to South America like their favorite explorer. She is loud, rash and aggressive and gets him injured and he doesn't even say one word and they end up falling in love (which was quite quick). Then it shows them getting married having a kid and saving money in a jar to go to South America (like a very fast forwarded movie of his life); but every time the money ends up needing to be spent (injuries, flat tire, etc...). Ellie dies of old age before he can keep his promise to her. There is a boy scout (Russell) who needs to get a badge (for assisting the elderly) and Mr. F sends him away on a wild goose chase and then when an instant happens that Mr. F will need to give up his house he decides to tie balloons to it and finally make the trip he promised with the unexpected guest; Russel.<br/><br/>I liked Mr. F from the beginning because you knew his life and I felt so sorry for him. But Russel was so so annoying but when you find out why he is the way he is I started to also pity him and like him.<br/><br/>They end up in South America and meet a bird Russel names Kevin and also talking dogs and particularly Dug who helps them.<br/><br/>I really like the dogs as a choice for Charles subordinates because they were really fun and silly.<br/><br/>I liked the way that Mr.F finally let's go and developed from a lonely grumpy man to a kind and caring person.

","After the brilliance of ""Wall-E,"" Pixar had nowhere to go but down. Instead, they went ""Up,"" way up! I defy even the most cynical viewer to watch the Carl-and-Ellie opening montage and not shed an honest tear. So emotionally overwhelming is this astonishing piece of animated film making that the viewer is completely sucked in to the rest of the story. The technical and artistic brilliance of this sequence is worth the price of admission, but, happily, there is much to come that is comparable.<br/><br/>There are characters, authentic in their realization, utterly believable in their execution, wonderfully written and voiced. There is spectacle, there is adventure and suspense and a great many out-loud laughs. There is poignancy and heartbreak, heroism and redemption -- all of the things that create a memorable movie-going experience.<br/><br/>A brief word about the 3-D work in the film: utterly flawless and free from the obtrusiveness that mars so many 3-D efforts. Pixar did not use 3-D as a trick to be exploited, but rather as an element that enhanced the wonder of the visuals and extend the story. This is a lesson in how to use a technology to actually advance a story. Well done!<br/><br/>I can only hope that with the Academy's expansion of Best Picture Nominees from five to ten this year that ""Up"" will at least get a nomination. If there is real justice, it will receive the award that ""Wall-E"" should have won. But ""Up"" is altogether deserving of the award on its own merits.

","Have you ever had a dream? Have you ever wished you could be Indiana Jones, Zorro, or Dirty Harry? If so this film is for you! Dreams are what this film is about it may have a sad beginning, but it takes a swinging happy hit at the end. Pixar with such films as Wall E, Toy Story, and Monster's Inc have always been about following your dreams... and maybe that is what makes their movies so great! Pixar as long as I can remember has never gotten a bad review and I am still a teenager (they were making films before I was born!) they have brought back the tradition of Walt Disney who made films for children. Not the garbage: Hannah Montana, Zack and Cody, or some of the other stuff they play on Disney Channel these days, which is not for kids, but for people whose brains have been ripped from there heads and replaced by pounds of music, movies, and thoughts that mistreating girls or acting like a prostitute is cool. Up has given us a hope that there is a happiness and good spirit in the world and we aren't all bad. Up is something that will be remembered as long as film exists! -Duke"

","Up – another best movie ever of Pixar! <br/><br/>What are you expecting from an animation movie? A lesson of life? A funny movie? A touching movie? All of these are included in Up! Up is the story of a 78-year old man Carl Fredrickson who dreamed of travel to South American. Just after a night, he made his decision to go to South America by a unique way: he was up in the sky in his house of full memories with balloons attached to it. But, he's not alone and Russell, a ""ball"" boy travel with him.<br/><br/>The movie started with very touching scene at around 10 beginning minutes. It was a story, as a book turned over page by page, expressed in great color tones: fresh and bright colors when Carl Fredrickson was a boy with his big dream, when he met his wife, Ellie, and built up their family; gray and sad color tones when he and his wife knew that they would never have any kid; lovely colors when they stuck together to overcome their sadness; and the tones were back again in gray and lonely tone when his wife passed away. He became lonely in his house, lived with the great love to Ellie and kept his dream alive. It was very sentimental and touching scene in the entire of Up. It reflected a life of person and family life: youth, grown-ups and death. But it included difficulties of a normal life that made a lot of people could not turn their dream become true, romantic moments when they stayed together to build up their dream. <br/><br/>The normal story of a normal life was changed suddenly and the lonely life of an old man turned over to another page: he, together with his house, was up in the sky. The moment of thousands of balloons attached with the house flied up in the sky is the eruption of the movie. That made audiences very enjoyable and turned their motion to another level. That is also one of the best moments of the movie and Pixar and Walt Disney were very successful in making it. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is the adventure of Carl Fredrickson and Russell. That is so very funny. Above all, what still remains in mind of audiences is that you are only become old if you have no dream and give up it. <br/><br/>Up is the funniest and most beautiful movie created by Pixar and Walt Disney. Just come to see and feel about Up. <br/><br/>You will have your own thoughts about Up and your life!"
"allbell","6","0","3","15 July 2009"," Beautiful but random; NOT a film for young children
","I love Pixar, and I love Ed Asner, and I went to this film thinking it would be beautiful and hilarious. It was beautiful, but it wasn't particularly hilarious, or full of any genuine emotion. I'm glad it made everyone involved a fortune, and now that the filmmakers are (good for them) carting their loot to the bank, I want to rant about how overrated this movie is.<br/><br/>The animation and all other technical aspects of the film are, of course, gorgeous. The voice acting is great. The land-based settings have no personality but are fine in a fairy tale way, I guess.<br/><br/>The old man's house is a fine old house, and the airship is a great airship.<br/><br/>The old man and the boy are, in my opinion, clichéd, stereotyped characters without much oomph to them. I can't even remember the chief bad guy well enough to say what I think about him, but the bad guy dogs were good and funny. Maybe not all that original, but original enough, and funny.<br/><br/>Ellie started off as a good character in the beginning, but then turned into a nonentity. The screenwriters seem to have an idiotic idea that anyone who has a regular day job -- who does something other than writing a screenplay or flying off in a house balloon -- is a boring stiff. If Ellie is such a firecracker, and she and her husband are too broke to travel to distant lands, why don't they go to amusement parks in their town? Or museums, or libraries, or camping trips? Or quickie cruises the Bahamas? If these people are too clueless to figure out how to have adventures within 100 miles from home, why would you think they could figure out how to have adventures anywhere else in the world? The movie focuses on what a great, spunky girl Ellie is -- but then, she's the only openly female character in the whole movie. The movie is sort of about how girls and other kids can dream, but it cuts every woman except for the woman who plays Ellie out of the casting process. Filmmakers: If you want some women out there to be able to afford to fly to South America to have adventures, WHY DON'T YOU TRY HIRING THEM?!?!??!?!!?!?!? Also: the overall lack of dialog may have seemed charming to the filmmakers and many viewers, but I see that some people have posted comments in the message board here indicating that they had missed important developments in the movie because the movie was just plain too subtle. Other users then skewer the users who admit to having misunderstood parts of the movie, but why is it the viewers' job to be Sherlock Holmes Movie Viewers, especially at an animated film that's partly aimed at small children? Why can't the filmmakers' get off their high purity horse and put in enough dialog to make sure that blind people in the audience, or people who just aren't great at figuring out visual clues, know what's going on? I guess, then, you could make a case that the whole house balloon trip is either a ""real life event in the movie,"" or a ""dream sequence within the movie."" Either way: the trudging around part seems really absurd and gets old quickly.<br/><br/>The part with the dogs (I'm trying not spoil this too much) is actually exciting and funny, but it's simply too scary for small children who have problems with scary movies. The ad campaign for this movie went to great lengths to imply that Up was a funny, heartwarming movie for children. So why let the scary parts get scary enough that children are hiding behind the seats in the theater? The overall ""scrapbook"" theme is sweet and beautiful, and, for me, aside from the dogs, that was the one part that made the movie that made it sort of worthwhile. But it's also kind of a manipulative, sentimental, tear-jerking, greeting card kind of effort to yank the emotional chains of the audience members. Finding Nemo and Toy Story are two examples of comparable movies that evoked some of the same emotions a lot more subtly.<br/><br/>The filmmakers seem to be saying: We won't give you enough dialog to help you figure out what is going on with the plot -- but we will use mood music and stills to tell you over and over and over again (and again and again and again) that it's sort of bittersweet when children grow up to be old and then die with some of their dreams unfulfilled."

","This new entry into the Pixar vault admittedly doesn't make it to the level of animation or fun of some of it's Pixar predecessors but it gives a good time nonetheless, and tries it's best. It's by no means a bad movie, but the story wasn't focused enough - what is the point of the movie? - pieces of information sort of patched together - what does the movie want say thematically - the movie has trouble flowing or connecting well. This isn't meant to be a huge criticism, and it's not to say it's not entertaining. ""Up"" has some genuinely funny moments (especially with the dog collars and whole dog scenes). The Russel character wear's thin sometimes contrasted with moments with ""Kevin"" that are interesting, alive, and well paced. ""Up"", as with any pixar movie is worth a look, but in a baseball analogy it's a double instead of a home-run."

","While I adore Pixar's films, I had no plans to see this on the big screen. It was an unusually hot night though, the air conditioner was struggling to keep up, and an escape to the theater was in order. I now consider that too-hot night a stroke of good fortune, because Up was terrific from beginning to end. I can't imagine how sorry I would be if I had missed it in all it's theatrical glory! <br/><br/>The characters were genuinely charming, the laughs plentiful and deep, and the story was tender and sweet without being insipid. The 3D effects were stunning without being over used.<br/><br/>Up was well worth the ticket price, which is more than I can say for most films!"

","Thank You IMDb reviewers!!! I probably would not have made the effort to see this film in the theaters had it not been for the high praise of some of the toughest critics of anything on earth. Kudos!! For those of you that pooh-pooh all the high praise, give your opinion of the film and move on, no need to bash the reviews of us that obviously enjoyed it! It's just an opinion, and here's mine.. This was a rare piece of cinema that just doesn't seem to happen often enough in the modern era. I haven't seen Wall-E and really only see a handful of films at the theater per year. Saves me money and time that are all too valuable to waste on what passes for film-making these days. This work gave me reason to believe in the movies again. Fascinating visually, taking CGI to a new level without ever overwhelming the story. A film that takes one man's meeting of his soulmate, through their lifelong journey together, to her passing. Some 40+ years all in 10 minutes, just amazing! As powerful as anything I've ever seen on the screen, and that was just the beginning. So much fun and such a beautiful and poetically told lesson of life, Go and Live your Dreams! Thanks Pixar, now how much is that ticket to Venezuela?.... PS Angel Falls in Venezuela seems to be the visual reference for Paradise Falls in the movie ;) PSS And if I had to pick one negative, the title, it doesn't convey the brilliance of this film, not sure if I could think of anything better, but I do think it hurt the popularity of this film."

","Yes, another movie from Pixar!!! That name alone is a quality assurance. Though I must admit that I didn’t quite find this movie any improvement from their previous, but it is still very much fun to watch and enjoy myself.<br/><br/>The story is brilliant as always - really moving and humorous. And who could forget that 5 minutes montages, visually explain the story of Carl’s life without words. This time around the Pixar decide to take a little turn as we look as life itself rather than other point of view like their previous film – Toys, Bugs, Monsters, and so on. But they still managed to keep all the charm by adding such a lovable character to talking dogs, and colourful birds.<br/><br/>Anyway the story is beautiful, only problem was at the time I have already seen most of the funny stuff in the trailer; so many of the stuff didn’t come much of a surprise to me. The flow of the movie is just great and with Russell (Little scout) around, everything is so lively and very much cute!! Also his stoutness and little beady eyes, added to the cuteness. There is a pretty good chemistry between almost every character. Though, despite all the praise I have for the movie (maybe a little bias) I still the movie lack one thing that really woos me. I’m not sure what it is? Maybe it was set in the ‘60s, or did I find the colour a little old and not colourful enough, or the backdrop was just plain and almost empty - I’m not sure.<br/><br/>But overall I’m sure I will like it a whole lot better after a while and re-watch it. I’m pretty much sure about that!!! And the kids will absolutely love it.<br/><br/>Season to Watch: It’s Pixar!!! Russell is really a lovable character.<br/><br/>Reason Not To: Personal Dislike of animated film.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)"
"seriousbusiness47","9","0","1","21 June 2009"," Pixar is godly
","Pixar's new film, Up, is just as dazzling and beautiful as the previous films. The opening sequence alone was enough to make me cry, as it just grabbed your emotions and twisted them about and punched them until they bled. In a good way. It also helps you to understand and connect more deeply with the old man, Carl Fredrickson, voiced by Ed Asner. After his wife dies, he accidentally-on-purpose hits some guy in the head with his cane and the courts decide to send him to an old-folks home. He escapes by attaching a zillion balloons to his house and flying away, off to South America to complete he and his wife's dream of living in a previously undiscovered part of the continent. Along the way, they meet Dug, a dog that has a collar that can translate his thoughts into English (supposedly. I'm not entirely sure how it works). It's almost scary how similar he is to the dogs I know. Adults can be satisfied that they won't get bored, nor will their intelligence be insulted. And judging by the reactions I heard in the theatre (way too many, by the way), kids loved it, too. The animation is, as always, beautiful. Not realistic, but if that's what you were expecting, you must not have ever seen a Pixar film. Also, this is the first Pixar movie I've seen where there was any blood at all, but don't worry. This isn't like The Shining, with a wall of blood gushing towards you. It's a bump on the head."
"mcsheehey","10","0","2","19 June 2009"," ""It will lift you up where you belong.""
","So here we are, 17 years after the release of ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" and it appears that the tagline for that ""tropically sexy military drama"" has found, in Pixar's ""Up,"" a film that suits it all the better. Pixar films have always been noted for their deep themes and profound focuses, ranging in the past from creative passion to the curse of celebrity, but never before has a Pixar film had the guts to take on love in all its many forms. <br/><br/>""Up"" opens with a scene of young Carl, our protagonist-to-be, dreaming of adventures to South America's Paradise Falls with renowned explorer Charles Muntz, who has lost his reputation in the eyes of the cruelly skeptical scientific community. Young Carl meets young Ellie, a fellow Muntz devotee, and the rest is history, illustrated through an emotional roller coaster of a montage stands as one of the most powerful ever committed to screen. It captures the spirit of marital love, illustrating that romantic love is more responsible for happiness than any material possession. As this montage ends, the film's main plot begins.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the rest of ""Up"" stays afloat even after beginning on such a high-flying note. The plot is unpredictable and has a number of shocking moments, so I'll say just this. Russell, Carl's incidental friend, forms a platonic relationship with Carl that is truly touching and illustrates a whole new type of love. Like the opening montage, the payoff of this relationship is emotionally powerful and real at the same time. While one or two of Russell's lines about his family ring false, these do very little to puncture the film. In fact, they are completely canceled out by the inclusion of some funny canine humor and by the introduction of who is one of Pixar's best and most complex villains yet. Mum's the word on this one.<br/><br/>All in all, as that very different 1982 film's tagline suggests, ""Up"" will lift you up where you belong with its poignant examination of love and its thrilling storyline."
"jpschapira","10","0","1","18 June 2009"," It's where I'm going
","Intentionally or not, with its latest movies Pixar's been trying to get closer to reality. They've invented every imaginary world possible so they started thinking about the possibilities of developing animated fiction in real life. In ""The Incredibles"" this could be seen in the normal life of a family and the existence of, primarily, a real world; but the characters were superheroes. Brad Bird doubled the bet with ""Ratatouille"": the non-verbal communication between a rat and a human, the logic possibility of thinking anyone can cook and a rat finally doing it, in an entire human world. You may object this initial development, but there's fact and it's that Remy the rat is the first (and only) Pixar character that wants and tries hard enough to get out of his parallel world; the animal world. <br/><br/>If Ratatouille wasn't perfect it's because the reality would have been total if rats didn't actually speak. It was not possible, and even when in ""Up"" this has a coherent explanation, the 'speaking animal' factor isn't eliminated. However, in an animated world that lives because of animals that speak, Pixar's recent greatness uses this as a secondary element, something merely comical. It works perfectly that dogs have special collars made for them so they can speak, but remain as stupid as we sometimes imagine them in the real world, therefore are capable of leaving aside any kind of seriousness at the sight of a squirrel or a tennis ball. <br/><br/>The dogs in the film appear long after it's begun, when Carl Frendricksen is in the Paradise Falls of South America, a place he arrived at by flying his own house with balloons tied to it. Frendricksen is a grumpy old man that waited until the day before his home would be destroyed to realize his and his deceased wife's (Ellie) lifelong dream. Not used to getting help, Carl discovers when he's already in the sky that a little boy scout called Russell has come along with him. <br/><br/>As it has always happened, the movie's center is the relationship between the old man and the little boy, but director Peter Docter (""Monsters Inc.""), co-director Bob Peterson (who also voices the film's two funniest characters) and their writing team drive ""Up"" away from every sentimentalism in this particular aspect. The movie is too short and doesn't seem to want to waste time. That's why, during the beginning, in the presentation of Carl and Ellie's love, specifically in a musical visualization of their lives brilliantly handled by Michael Giacchino's perfect and familiar score (Oscar anyone?), the filmmakers get rid of all cheesiness.<br/><br/>Essentially, ""Up"" is (in this aspect we can relate it to ""The Incredibles"") an action movie: packed with the usual Pixar dose of comedy and endearing characters, with the particular addition that it goes, within a frame of reality (the dogs speak because of the collar but no other animal speaks this time), to places no other movie –animated or not- has imagined. ""Up"" is about what its title strategically hides: reaching the limits, of the animal and human world, of the animated world, in every scene, and surpassing them; by giving us a hero in the skin of a grumpy old man, by including an element of surprise, by putting its characters on the edge of death and by making something breathtaking of every scenario. <br/><br/>And don't get confused. ""Up"" is not only visually breathtaking, but breathtaking in terms of an original story that comes along and leaves before you even notice it, literally taking your breath away. If you pay attention, you'll realize that Carl and Russell get to South America from USA in a frame of second. It's the only element that may question the film's embrace of reality, and that's because a great adventure, in Pixar's terms, can take place anywhere; it's just that this time they decided to situate it up high in the sky, which is also the direction in which their film-making is headed, if they haven't been stopped by the highest existing cloud yet."
"maine_310","10","0","2","18 June 2009"," A beautiful adventure and a heart warming love story
","I really expected a similarity with respect to our usual animated flicks. Surprisingly this movie 'Uped' the scale in my book.<br/><br/>The story opened with a shy Carl Fredricksen who I initially took for Russell the annoying wilderness explorer seeking his merit badge. Surprisingly Carl was the old man when he was younger. Carl is represented for having a love for adventure and an admiration for a famed explorer Charles Muntz who journeyed to South America in order to bring back a large bird species and up his reputation.<br/><br/>The movie centers around Carl and Journeys through his life where he meets a girl named Ellie who in turn shares Carl's love... for adventure. Throughout the years we see Carl and Ellie grow together and fall in love and each time promise each other to go to a place called Paradise falls. Yet each time they plan to go something else comes up and they end up growing old together still having their dreams to journey to Paradise Falls and probably even live. When Carl realizes that their time would be up soon, he encourages Ellie to embark on their dreams, but she succumbs to old age and is unable to fulfill their lifelong fantasy together.<br/><br/>Some time later we meet an old cranky Carl whose big day is getting out of bed and sitting on his porch. As he ages the world around him falls prey to youth and his old house seems nothing more than an old thing of the past while everything around him modernizes. Carl is given many options to move out, but turns down every motivating offer for his love for his house and his late wife who he still maintains a fondness for.<br/><br/>We are soon introduced to a ecstatic Russell who ponders on Carl's doorstep inquiring his assistance in earning his merit badge for 'Assisting the Elderly'. Carl sends Russell on a wild goose chase. Carl engages in a heated altercation with a construction worker after he ran over his broken mailbox which gives the court perfect motivation to move Carl into a home.<br/><br/>Carl takes the opportunity to turn his home into an air balloon, with multiple balloons attached to his home and he begins his trip to Paradise Falls which turns into a wild journey as he is also joined by Russell newly returned from his 'wild goose chase'. Carl is forced to bring Russell on his adventure where he soon meets up with his idol, Charles Muntz who has found his way around trying to capture a bird that Russell befriends and names 'Kevin' (It is later revealed that Kevin is a girl).<br/><br/>Non the less we also meet up with man's best friend 'Dug'; a talking dog, well not really, with a collar enabling him to talk.<br/><br/>Their friendship with Kevin comes at a price. While Carl is trying to live his dream, Russell's care towards Kevin puts his dream at bay and Carl is forced to choose between his life journey and saving Kevin which could cost him everything. Carl's hero becomes his enemy and the story unravels into a big chase for different dreams. Charles for fame and Carl to live happily ever after in Paradise Falls.<br/><br/>There is a bit of a struggle for Kevin as she tries to find her way home to her young and the battle adds an extra bonus of wild dogs trained by Charles to get Kevin.<br/><br/>Though with all great fairy tales comes happy endings, well not for Charles Muntz, but for Kevin, Russell, Dug, and even Carl. Even though he didn't get to live his dream the way he imagined, at least he had his journey of a lifetime.<br/><br/>There were a few questionable plot lines in the mix...<br/><br/>I wondered how balloons could carry and entire household. It not only defied gravity, but logic as well. Though it added to the fun of it, I wondered how Carl put that together in one day, maybe he didn't, it was probably part of his plan with Ellie. It was cool watching his House float.<br/><br/>Dug got his merit badge. I kept wondering if his family would be worried about him going door to door to strangers homes and then turning up missing, but I'm sure everything was clarified there.<br/><br/>Dug was hilarious and definitely became my favorite character. Quotes: ""Squirrel!"" ""Point!"" :)<br/><br/>This movie went in my Top five for Pixar movies, I definitely enjoyed this one.

","A movie, in a nutshell, about death vs. life, young vs. old, personal status vs. personal relationships, inner vs. outer journey, friends vs. enemies. Oh, and it was very good too. :)<br/><br/>Pixar has now made their tenth movie, and still going strong.. and boy, are they! That's 10 for 10, which is an amazing feat. Each of their stories are original, different, and shows us that these guys were not out to merely settle for retreads of the same lessons, formulas, stories, and jokes. Pixar films have the danger of being timeless. In fact, I have a sneaking suspicion they already are! For those who don't know the general story, it's about an old man (who sold balloons) who is about to be evicted, decides that he is better off away, ties tons of balloons to his house and off he goes toward a place in South America called Paradise Falls, to fulfill a promise he made to his late wife. Along comes a kid who hitches along for the ride. To say more would be a disservice to the viewers, as the story unfolds to many great moments, adventures, dangers, and humor.<br/><br/>""Up,"" as mentioned, is yet another classic, and personally, I felt this movie went boldly beyond what one may categorize as merely kids' entertainment. In fact, there were moments of great emotion that only adults will fully appreciate. Among the Pixar movies, this movie probably moved me the most at a deep, emotional level, which is saying a lot given that it's an animation. They manage to do things with their skillful use of music, imagery, and story, that is both subtle and powerful. There are many things I can say about this movie and how it has many layers and themes and such, but those will be left for discussion boards and essays and talks over coffee."
"socrates99","8","0","1","15 June 2009"," I was surprised 'Up' wasn't better though it's great anyway
","The problem is the storyline. Love parts of it, like the review of the old man's past life, and the tie-in to what he finds in South America. But some of the contrivances are as annoying as they are helpful, for example, the device that lets dogs talk. And then there's the way the floating house seems to drag the action down in places. Still, the many little quirks of an old man embodied in Mr Fredricksen's figure are pretty much breathtaking as is those of a young boy embodied in Russell. Ellie is fleshed out as a character so quickly and assuredly that I was flummoxed trying to imagine what kind of a team could have produced her. But then most of the art work is completely awe-inspiring and entrancing. (I found the bird Kevin to be disappointing, though.) I guess I would have made the story a little less wild, these films deserve to be instant classics, and I can't help feeling some of the more wild parts are going to hold it back. By the way the opening cartoon about storks delivering babies was a complete pleasant surprise and a clear indication of the level of genius at Pixar. I'm guessing they wanted us to practice dropping our mouths open."

","Pixar seems to be hitting a bit of a wall lately. ""Wall-E"" may have wowed some adult critics, but I noticed that it did not hold the attention of actual children in an actual theater. Sadly the same is true for ""Up"" even though it has a more childlike storyline. Too many disparate elements -- a house powered by balloons, hordes of talking dogs, a big bird and a giant dirigible? OK, whatever. This is one of the weirdest movies I've seen lately but it's a shame the screenplay is a sort of rehash of aspects of previous Pixar movies. The tearjerking dialogue-free story of loss? We already saw that in TOY STORY 2. Long stretches of no dialogue or limited dialogue? WALL-E. I got the feeling that this movie was just ""Let's do a movie about a house powered by balloons!"" and they just threw a lot of other stuff at it. (And why did they spend 2/3 of the movie firmly on the ground in a boring, rocky landscape on a tedious plodding trek to a waterfall we can already see? A lot of this movie just isn't any FUN.) <br/><br/>Don't mean to sound too harsh - the characters are lovingly created and occasionally also lovable (although his character was annoying and trite, I loved the expressions on the little Asian boy).The action-packed ending is pretty exciting. And, make sure to stay for the credits to see what happens to the characters. It's by no means the worst Pixar film (that honor goes to CARS)... and I liked this one better than WALL-E...<br/><br/>...but at the same time, it's no TOY STORY, BUG'S LIFE or INCREDIBLES either. It's a given that nothing in UP is going to make any sense physically, but some things in the characters' lives don't make any sense either. Only in Hollywood fairy tales do modern American boys join Wilderness Scouts and go door to door down city streets (!) looking for old men to help, for example. What planet do these writers live on? Slowly over the years, Pixar's stories (while technically as impressive as ever) have been getting more and more contrived and less natural feeling; they also feel as if they're trying to score more points with adult film critics than with the children. (One of the previews at this showing was for PARTLY CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS, which looked like more of a blast for the kids, and a movie I wish they had made when I was a kid!)<br/><br/>But the whole superiority of Pixar WAS the combination of the stories plus the technical achievement. So, this trend remains worrisome. Pixar really needs to get back to basics with their next project."

The movie was extremely cute, intense at times, and clever.<br/><br/>The first 5 minutes of this movie was an introduction to his passion, his future wife's passion, and the meeting of his first love. Later, as the movie showed his life go on, as the sad events in his life are shown, I saw tears blurring my vision. After, it shows how he is after his wife had died. He had become this old, miserable, man.<br/><br/>As the movie went on, i found myself laughing at a lot of points. Some humor is very cliché though. An example would be Alpha's voice box. All these menacing dogs have these low voices. Then the camera shows the most menacing looking dog, and then he was the voice of a smurf. Although the majority of the audience thought this was rather funny. Keep in mind that the majority of the audience are 5 year old's.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a very entertaining movie, way better than the Hannah Montana one. Well worth the $14."

","Pixar's latest flick ""Up"" definitely leaves a pleasant aftertaste and lets you evaluate the more important things in life throughout the movie. As stated in many, many reviews, the opening montage is both heartfelt and moving and one of the finest pieces of animation I have seen. Speaking of animation, the cinematography, camera angles, depth of field, etc., were spot on and gorgeous to observe. The story itself is unique and does capture your attention throughout the film and does not let you go till the end. However, I did feel that the story became a tad too risqué with all those dogs doing wacky and over the top stunts and doohickeys (but isn't that what Pixar is all about?).<br/><br/>I had the privilege of viewing the movie in 3D. To comment on the effectiveness of this technique, there still needs to be a lot of work done in terms of clarifying motion blur and desaturation in the color palette. However, the animation still shines through despite these minor qualms and does not hinder the viewing experience.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is definitely a gem in this years already dwindling list of good movies and I look forward to viewing it again in the near future."

I am not that much of an animation fan but I guess the kid and me got me out and watching the movie. It was fun, just another relaxing and hilarious movie anyone can relate to.<br/><br/>This movie made me actually think of buying a lot of balloons. Maybe get a tank or 2 of helium and try experimenting with my dog house first. Then again maybe it would be better if I would just go and get a hot air balloon ride. It was just fantastic that my dream when I was a kid got to be taken and created into an animated laugh trip. Well maybe I missed a lot when I skipped scouting and started focusing on basketball.

It's great escapism. I appreciate the artistry of this film. It's beautiful. There really is a story and it is introduced in a charming, but touching way. I think this is where an adult might question whether it is a little too heavy for young kids to see. I always look forward to seeing what Pixar has come up with.

""Pixar launches their funniest film out of their tank to date."" ""Possibly the best Pixar film to date."" ""Pixar hits it out of the park, again"" ""UP, Pixar's latest animated feature, is just delightful."" ""Pixar do it again! Up soars to new heights!"" ""Pixar produces another Oscar Winner.""

It really struck me as odd that so many consecutive reviews referred to Pixar. I would think that legitimate reviewers would refer to the film first, then to the plot, then to characters, and sometimes to the director if he/she is famous. I have grave reservations as to comments posted regarding this film. Has Pixar hired a team of professional writers to bombard IMDb.com with positive comments with rave reviews? As my usual practice is to skip the first two pages of reviews on IMDb, I am aware that this practice of insider reviews does happen. i.e. terrible film gets rave reviews in the first two pages, then followed by all terrible reviews and ratings. In the past, it was only the first two or three comments that were posted by insiders, and then it progressed to a page or two, but this may bring it all to new heights. As with the voting, there can be cheats, and IMDb.com has got to look at this again and see if I am correct in my assumptions of cheating in the comments. It is a terrible disservice to the honest members of the web site. If the comments are accurate, then why did 6.1% give this film a rating of 1 to 5? Where are the negative comments? And 38% of viewers rated it from 6 to 9? 7,837 voters gave ""Up"" a perfect score of 10, and a total of 6,170 scored it below that number. So, it's almost an 8 to 6 as to perfect film versus good film / terrible film. Where are those comments? All I read in the first several pages was Pixar, Pixar, Pixar. One just has to read the first page of comments to see what I mean. What's going on?"

","My kids loved it, but it probably had a lot to do with the fact that they saw it at the drive in. It was their first time, and they were wrapped up in the adventure of the whole ""outside movie"" thing.<br/><br/>The movie has all the Pixar staples -- great animation, lovable characters, and a compelling story. However, it seems to be lacking in some areas. For instance, they seemed to stretch reality a bit, and I'm not talking about the flying balloon house. Talking dogs, two old men that started out DECADES apart in age but ending up about the same age by film's end, dogs flying airplanes, an extinct bird... None are a problem per se, but the story never explains WHY any of these things are happening. One a film establishes the rules, it should just stick with those rules. It just seemed that the creative team came up with some ""cool"" ideas and ran with it. Granted, they were cool, but it made the story seem a bit disjointed.<br/><br/>With my adult brain, I saw problems. But with my kid brain, I had a blast. Thanks Pixar!"

","When a slight misunderstanding threatens to force elderly Carl Fredrickson (Ed Asner) into a retirement home, the wiley old coot decides to go for broke, attaching thousands of balloons to his house and floating off to the jungle wilds of South America. Trouble is, a little kid named Russell (Jordan Nagai) is also along for the ride, which doesn’t quite play out the way Carl intends it to. This Disney/Pixar instaclassic is a lot of fun, especially in 3D, with charming, realistic characters, sweeping vistas, and a straight-arrow message that’s neither muddled nor heavyhanded.<br/><br/>Now, you gotta know this upfront: I love 3D animated films. It’s not like the old days, where the makers would try so hard to make the 3D exciting and amazing that they forgot to make a movie behind the effects. What happens nowadays is that the creators write an awesome, fun movie and then toss dollops of 3D effects to accentuate the story, rather than distract from it. (Or, as sometimes would happen, detract from it.) So maybe I was an easy mark, but I thought Up was outstanding. Ed Asner, as the cranky old man who’s lost his zest for life, turns in a pitch-perfect performance that’s both endearing and curmudgeonly. Of course, the animation is so detailed that you can count the hairs on Carl’s chin as the days progress, but the Pixar gang did a great job in showing the various expressions on the faces of the human characters here, something I think they’ve been slow to develop well. (The toys in Toy Story, for example, looked great, but Sid the neighbor kid did not appear to be fully formed.) The story itself is an adventure on the order of Indiana Jones, if Indy were a septuagenarian with the physical prowess of an eggplant. The unlikely duo winds up in South America, all right, but they encounter more than just trees and rocks. Every animated film needs a villain, and here we get the luminous Christopher Plummer as a thought-dead old-time explorer who’s been holed up at the very spot Carl wishes to visit. Plummer does evil pretty well, I think, especially for a Canadian. (They’re kindly, peaceful folk, you see.) Compared with recent 3D movies, I’d put Up a little higher up than Monsters versus Aliens, but not much. The sweet ending, although expected, packs just as strong an emotional punch as it would if you couldn’t see it coming. And certainly the intended audience for this movie won’t care about nuances; the kids in the theater where I saw this raved about it, keeping in awed silence for much of the film - except when Big Fun Wonderful Things were happening, when they erupted with raucous jubilation."

","Pixar is to animated films as Mark Goodson was to game shows, and it showed why Up has become another hit for the company, thanks to great visuals, outstanding computer animation and the voicework of Ed Asner as a senior citizen whose house goes aloft. But he isn't alone, since Russell, a scout is aboard to help him out as they encounter bad guys, a strange bird and other obstacles.<br/><br/>There was one aspect of Up that reminded me of WALL-E when there was a stretch of about 10 minutes at the movie's quarter point without any dialogue. It show's why Pixar is so good at telling stories without using a lot of dialogue.<br/><br/>One constant in Pixar's voice cast is John Ratzenberger, who has a role in all of the company's films.

"ryanaustinf","8","0","2","4 June 2009"," One of Pixar's Best!
","Through the years, Pixar has given us films that surpass other films that year. With the humble beginnings with Toy Story to the recent WALLE. Ever since we were kids, we loved their movies. This year however, Pixar may have made their best movie ever. Let me just say that this is all opinion and no fact and the only fact that may appear is a event from the film. --------------------SPOILER LINE--------------- The main characters of this film are Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) and Russell (Jordan Nagai). These two characters are funny and although this is a kid's movie, the kids will still love Carl. They'll probably relate to them like their grandfather or something. The main villain is Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Charles is Carl and his wife, Ellie's inspiration. But since Russell's mouth slips and tells Charles about the rare bird specie he's looking for, he now tries to kill Carl and Russell (harsh for a Disney Movie) and get the bird. He even burns Carl's house, THAT FRICKIN *******! The supporting characters are basically Dug, Kevin, and Alpha. I dislike dogs but you gotta love Dug! He's so cute and SQUIRELL! Kevin is also funny but not quite as Dug. And Alpha, no----ot so much. There's action in here ( a little) and it's can have you laughing (or crying) all the way through. Now the story is simple enoug... oh wait, it could be complicated. Carl gets married to Ellie and they want to travel to Paradise Falls but Ellie dies before they can. Carl now tries to fulfill his promise to Ellie and he ties balloons to his house and flies to Paradise Falls. But Russell sneaks on his porch and they land in South America. They find a bird, a dog, and Muntz but Muntz tries to kill them and get the bird. They save the bird, Muntz falls, kicking the bucket, and they live happily ever after. Overall, I give Disney Pixar's Up, 84% awesome!"

","I'm starting to realize something...Pixar makes good movies. Having avoided all trailers and commercials for this one myself, I'm not sure how much you know about it before going in, so I'll try to tread lightly on the spoilers. <br/><br/>Up is about an old man on a journey to Paradise Falls (why, well that's something you need to watch to find out) using balloons tied to his house. He didn't plan on a young boy coming along for the ride though, and as you might be able to guess he's not too happy about it... That's pretty much the basic plot. Obviously this is Pixar, so the story goes much deeper, and characters aren't just cookie cutter.<br/><br/>The first 20 or so minutes of this movie reminded me of WallE in a lot of ways, one being that there's hardly any dialog, another being that those 20 minutes are better than just about every other movie to come out this year so far. All it took was 20 little minutes for me to care about Carl. That's not to say the rest of this movie is bad, far from it, but it does have a different tone (including some bits that were kind of shocking for a family film). That difference comes in the form of a fat little boy scout named Russell. The movie kind of takes on the form of a buddy comedy for the next act, and it's thoroughly entertaining. Throw in the best cartoon dog ever, a funny giant bird, some heartfelt moments, and you have a potential classic in the making. And then Act 3 introduces the danger...I found some of this to be the weakest part of the movie, but it's nothing bad, it's just...a tad, average. However, there is one beat during the 3rd Act that just tore me apart...absolutely gutted me. It's the kind of thing that elevates a movie from entertaining, to magical. The movie finishes up with a pretty exciting action set, followed by yet another heart tugging moment that might even effect the best of us in girly ways.<br/><br/>Yeah, I know this review has been incredibly vague, but I felt this movie is one worth seeking out and for you to not know too much about it. It's been a full day since I've seen it, and I've grown even fonder of it in that short time.<br/><br/>Highly Recommended. A+"

","With their latest installment ""Up,"" Pixar once again--with canny skill--makes the consistently most entertaining, dazzling films that fall into the category of ""family"" entertainment.<br/><br/>""Up"" is yet another advance in both the skill of animation as well as story-telling but with a maturing respect for its audience. While this doesn't make you as deliriously giddy as ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Wall*e,"" it takes a more traditional story arc and reaps the benefits of a more satisfying catharsis.<br/><br/>While we get talking dogs, the primary characters here are human and therefore ones we fully accept and also know. Their perils--physical and emotional--are rendered fully and will provoke a mature, adult response. There's nothing here as violent as anything in the Indiana Jones franchise, but parents have complained (wrongly, I feel) that the content is too strong for six or seven year olds. However, it is not the pap that Disney is known for.<br/><br/>Again, greater advances in technical digital effects and animation abound. Specfically the pull of and resistance to gravity on characters is impressive. I saw the 3D version, and the depth that's achieved, particularly in any of the aeriel sequences is astonishing.<br/><br/>Was it my favorite Pixar? It's like asking who is your favorite child.

","Up is not Pixars best film. It's still good, but it lacks the adult comedy throughout the picture. Up has a good story with terrific characters and a fantastic concept, but at times takes itself way too seriously. Except towards the end of the picture, the film doesn't take itself serious at all. A little too silly in fact. And the antagonist had a small part. I like the bad guy in films. I also like it when the good guy gets the bad guy at the end. My least favorite Pixar film was Monster INC. Up is my second least favorite. I'm really looking forward to next years Toy Story 3. The short film before Up was fantastic.

","Up is simply masterful. The entire theme of the movie encourages families to be together and to be happy, living life as an adventure. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike, and there's never a dull moment. It delves into such themes of growing old and eventual death without candy coding it for kids, but does not do so in a grotesque manner; its storytelling is simply artistic and adventurous. <br/><br/>One of my only gripes with the film is that the pacing is just a little too quick. Some events in the movie seem to have happened too fast, but its rather fast pacing does not take away too much from the film. Just like a lot of Pixar's other work, it's as entertaining as it is good in advancing the plot. Although telling the story of an elderly man flying his house to South America via thousands of balloons secured to his fireplace lifting it into the air may seem far-fetched and somewhat of a ""running out of ideas"" kind of plot, it makes for one of the most imaginative movies that I have seen. <br/><br/>I love this movie plain and simple.

","Talking dog Dug's greeting--""I have just met you and I love you""--to lonely widower Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) applies just as much to the world's reception for UP, if its current rating as the 151st most-loved movie of all time is any indication. UP tugs harder on the heart-strings during its first 10 minutes than any cartoon in history (for adult viewers, at least). Though this film may give pause to wise and\or precocious kids, such children should have no trouble adding this to their daily dose of doom and gloom. The opening chapter to this story parallels one of the best-loved baby boomer picture books, Virginia Lee Burton's 1942 THE LITTLE HOUSE. However, it uses Asner as a stand-in for actor Frank Morgan's gruff WIZARD OF OZ (1939), whisking an elderly city man rather than a Kansan girl to a cross between LAND OF THE LOST and the current TV show LOST (as in, will this whole bizarre episode turn out just to be Carl's post-traumatic-stress-induced dream, making him a geriatric version of Dorothy Gale?). Carl's chance companion for this trip, would-be boy camper Russell, shares enough of the spirit of young Carl in the movie's opening sequence to shade the rest of the film with a sense of deep irony. Though poignant and bittersweet, this cartoon is fresh, fun, and human enough to merit a projection of its future as a classic with staying power, along the lines of Bambi or Pinocchio.<br/><br/>P.S.--This does NOT seem to be a cartoon that requires the 3-D premium price to get most of the enjoyment. We had free passes to see this in 3-D, but it appeared at least half to two-thirds of the film was virtually undistorted WITHOUT the glasses. So if you're bringing a lot of children and must choose between 2-D with refreshments or 3-D without, it's okay to go for the snacks!"

While it didn't have any cheesy ""pop out of the screen"" effects like Dreamworks' 'Monsters vs. Aliens', the 3-D here was done in such a manner as to make it look as though you were actually there, with incredible attention to detail. Everything came off of the screen as if it stood before me from hair on Dug's body to the minute reflections off of the balloons, even the details on the clouds were fantastic, I didn't even know clouds had details!

","It's getting cliché to say ""the latest Pixar movie is one of the best films of the year"" or ""Pixar delivers again!"" But, they're now 10-for-10 with 'Up' a brilliantly colorful and original story, filled with heart, adventure, comedy and finally a talking animal that not only explains why he (or they) can talk, but what they would really say vs. the writers humanizing them. Also, the movie opens with a great, yet somewhat slow, monologue explaining the background on the main character, Carl, vs. just telling us he's old and grumpy. At a very young age, Carl befriends an equally adventurous young female and its love-at-first-sight. They marry, but their dreams of Indiana Jones adventure is curbed by everyday life. After she passes, and his neighborhood follows, Carl takes flight, literally, avoiding certain doom in a retirement home. Stowaway Wilderness Explorer 8-year-old Russell helps him try and find Carl's (and late wife's) final destination in South America. Comedy ensues, as the life-lessons-learned and typical sidekicks. Best of the bunch is the aforementioned talking dog, Dug. He was hilarious, interesting and like I said, finally an un-humanized cartoon speaking animal. Okay, now the bad, not that there's much to say negative and this certainly wasn't the weakest, though still way above average, of the Pixar bunch. I saw it in 3-D, and it truly was NOT amazing in 3-D. 'Monsters Vs. Aliens' in IMAX was 10x better in 3-D quality and quality. 'Up' was also incredibly predictable, was funny at times – but not all the time and the trailers gave away too much, gave some background on the boy's father and some woman in his life, but never explored it fully and finally, I seriously can't believe CPS wouldn't be following with all the extreme dangers the child was in."

The setup is a little odd, but as expected the film is rich with genuine laughs, great lines, clever gags, a perfect cast of voices, and an appealing, memorable, and heartwarming story.
