"MR_Heraclius","9","40","43","24 February 2020"," love this movie highly recommend
","Sandra Bullock is rapid and compelling in this true story of tragedy-turned-triumph. The Blind Side is an enjoyable that some may consider a bit too soft or safe. Though it won't completely win moviegoers over, they'll still be in awe of the bold lead actress."
"itszombietime","5","138","171","11 October 2010"," I can see why Michael Oher was unhappy with this film
","First of all, Quinton did a fine job in the lead role. Let's get that out of the way. Great acting job. He took the material he was given and played the role very well.<br/><br/>However, this film is pure Hollywood sap, a ""feel good"" movie that picks and chooses factual elements and builds a fictional tale around them. The film loves the character of Leigh Ann (who is really not that interesting, although she is kind hearted and generous), and as a result, Oher is relegated to a shy over-sized charity case with no clue and no skills of any sort, other than his natural kindness and resilient character. That strengthens the focus on Leigh Ann's rescue actions, how she ""saved"" this poor aimless kid and gave him all the life skills he needed to succeed on and off the football field. It resonates with white suburban do-gooder audiences, but it's just not accurate.<br/><br/>In truth, Michael Oher was already a very good football player when the Tuohy family took him in. And he had a bold, confident personality that rubbed off on everyone and made him a natural leader. He was a motivated, focused kid who knew what he wanted, but came from an environment where no one really cared or provided support. He was NOT a shy, introverted pathetic case. He just came from a terrible domestic environment and found stability with a nice rich family. The real story of Michael Oher is how he caught the luckiest of breaks and escaped the ghetto jungle and was able to leave all that soul crushing crap behind, and focus on academics and athletics in a completely different upper middle class environment. It's a study in how important environment is in the life of kids and teenagers, and how it can make a huge difference.<br/><br/>But what we, the audience, receive is a Hallmark channel film that is nothing more than a lazy, formulaic, fictionalized ""warm your heart"" chick flick couched in a football world. Sassy dialogue, woman-takes-charge scenes, tender moments, etc -- all the usual stuff is there. The film would have been FAR better had it focused on Oher as the lead character, instead of Bullock. No offense to Bullock, who is a fine actor.<br/><br/>It is well known that real life Michael Oher was very displeased with this film, and how it portrayed him."
"momomomomo","8","169","228","21 November 2009"," Better than I thought
","I've been reading lot of horrible comments that are based solely on the issues surrounding the movie rather than the movie itself. I wasn't excited to see this movie, I'm not interested in sports at all. The movie kept my attention though and well. It moved along quickly and pulled me into the story and left me feeling inspired. I wasn't excited to see a blonde sandy bullock in a sports movie, I think that's what might have turned me off the most, but she did really good job! It's rare to see a movie where there's a really strong lead female character. Whether you like Leigh Anne Touhy or not in the end, she is certainly entertaining and Sandra Bullock does a great job of bringing her onto the screen. The youngest son did an amazing job! So much talent in him. The character of Mike I think could have used a few more lines, even if he's supposed to be shy and reserved. All the actors really did a great job though for the most part. No it's not an epic Oscar winning film, although I wouldn't be surprised if Bullock got nominated for something for her acting. It is NOT loaded with propaganda as the other reviews might suggest. It's a light entertaining pick me up film that would be an excellent choice to bring the family to, most likely the reason why they released it over the Holidays."
"jeremyscates","10","274","392","20 November 2009"," Very well done!
","I don't usually feel the need to leave comments, but this movie was just to well done not to. I went in expecting more football, more hits & highlights & as a huge football fan that was one of the main draws of the movie. The football actually takes a back seat to a wonderful story that is well executed by everyone involved. I've always thought Sandra Bulluck has been over-rated, but she nails this role & deserves some recognition down the road. The movie is so fantastic that anyone and everyone can relate and feel connected to the characters. The ideal target audience for this movie is children and adults alike. This movie should be an Oscar contender but I know these types of movies rarely ever win. Definitely deserves my vote!"
"tinanwoods","8","196","287","1 November 2009"," Skillful, compassionate and dignified portrayal of an amazing, true personal drama
","I have just returned from seeing the blind side. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, particularly it's more poignant moments. Yes, this is a sports story, yes this is a biopic, but it is also in large part an interpersonal drama. It is rare to see a movie these days that relies on drama to carry it-not special effects, lush historically accurate wardrobe, or astounding make up- just a story that resonates with the viewer. That this story is based on contemporary facts makes it all the more resonant. Events that might have been handled superficially, predictably or exploited for dramatic purposes were instead presented in a nuanced and profound manner. Michael's biological mother was portrayed with dignity and compassion. In short, the aspects of Michael's story that make it moving and inspiring were captured with skill and integrity. As for the negative feedback regarding this movie that began when the only the trailers were available - I think the comments might be more a reflection of the world view of the authors rather than a reflection of the quality of the movie or the reality of Michael's story. Some people think the movie ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was a story about racism in the south, or that ""The Crying Game"" was a movie about the IRA - to me those were the settings for the drama, and not the drama itself. John Lee Hancock really bit off a lot when he took on this project-but as it turned out, it was not more than he could chew. Remember when Attorney General Eric Holder commented on how we were a nation of cowards when it came to openly discussing race? With this movie, Hancock has demonstrated he is not one of those cowards. He did not ignore the racial or class differences of the characters in this movie, and he avoided using the movie to make a social statement with the movie. He allowed these character attributes to be what they were in reality, and told the human drama in an effective and sensitive manner."
"Chris-538","7","109","157","15 November 2009"," My take on the Michael Oher story
","I'm a sports snob. I strongly believe there's only a handful of truly great sports movies. It's just too difficult for filmmakers to recreate the drama that takes place on the field. So when the Creative Loafers at sportschump.net asked me to review The Blind Side, a sports movie I would never see,starring an actress I really don't like, I was skeptical. But they promised me Jujubees, so I agreed to attend the premiere.<br/><br/>I fell into my comfy leather chair at the Cobb Theater Cinebistro in Wesley Chapel, fully expecting to pan everything about the movie. Then a strange thing happened. The film turned out to be pretty good.<br/><br/>Blind Side is adapted from Michael Lewis' novel of the same name. Just like the book, the film begins with a narrative of the game in which Lawrence Taylor broke Joe Theismann's leg. According to Lewis, that hit more than any other moment in football history, heightened the need for a strong, left tackle to protect the quarterback's blind side.<br/><br/>Enter the Michael Oher story.<br/><br/>Oher (Quinton Aaron) is an over-sized, high school kid from Memphis' inner city with no academic records and a crack addict for a mother. He is accepted into a local Christian high school when the football coach recognizes his potential.<br/><br/>Early scenes at Wingate Christian High School depict Oher as uncomfortable and intimidated in his new, mostly white surroundings. One teacher describes him as 'a fly in the milk.' Oher never says much, most of his expressions portrayed through mopey, facial gestures. Aaron's performance isn't groundbreaking, unless of course Oher didn't say much in real life. If that's the case, his performance is dead on.<br/><br/>After their youngest son (Jae Head) befriends Oher, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw), stumble upon Oher one afternoon roaming the streets, avoiding return to his crime-ridden projects. They welcome him into their home to sleep on their sofa for a night, which becomes a week, which ultimately becomes a legal adoption.<br/><br/>Despite Oher's poor grades, school administrators find that he excels in one capacity. He scores a 98% in protective instincts on a high school aptitude test.<br/><br/>The Tuohy's, a well-to-do, Southern Republican family with a strong allegiance to Ole Miss, hire a private tutor (Kathy Bates) to help Oher with his academic troubles. Once getting good enough grades to make the football team, Oher has trouble adjusting to the brutality of the sport. It's not until Bullock compares protecting his quarterback to the affection he feels for his new family that Oher finally understands his purpose on the field.<br/><br/>The word gets out about Oher eventually when a top scout is sent a DVD of his skills. Suddenly, major college coaches flock to recruit him. Sports fans will enjoy cameos from Nick Saban, Tommy Tuberville, Phillip Fulmer, Lou Holtz and Houston Nutt, although LSU fans will cringe seeing Saban wearing purple once again.<br/><br/>The only problem is Oher is failing English, which makes him academically ineligible to receive a football scholarship. It's not until McGraw recites ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" that Oher learns about courage, honor and ultimately passes another difficult test: his final English essay.<br/><br/>Oher decides to enroll at Ole Miss, which draws an NCAA investigation to ensure the Tuohy family did not tamper with his decision. Oher buys into it, then lashes out at Bullock, accusing her of taking him in just to get him to go to their alma mater. A resentful and confused Oher returns to the projects in search of his real mom, then busts up the local gangster's home, a scene which probably warrants the film's PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Little by little, the audience is allowed a peek into Oher's upbringing, not a pretty picture, probably less so in real life. The film features several touching moments such as when the Tuohy's drop Oher off at college or when Bullock confronts Oher's real mother, who can barely remember which man was his biological father.<br/><br/>The film has its share of trite, Hollywood moments including McGraw and Bullock's designer marriage in which they never argue, Bullock telling off her country club friends in a moment of racial enlightenment, phoning the football coach from the sidelines to call in plays and Oher getting flagged in his opening game for 'excessive blocking.' Blind Side also glosses over several racial and class stereotypes, careful to equally bash Democrats, rednecks and Southerners. The film also provides several moments of comic relief in the form of McGraw's occasional one-liners that help to break up the film's drama.<br/><br/>Without reading Lewis' book or knowing the complete Oher history, one might think the film is overdramatized, until the closing credits which show a sequence of real pictures of Oher being raised by Tuohy family. They remind us that Blind Side is not only based on a true story, it is a true story.<br/><br/>Blind Side won't go down in the annals as the greatest sports movie ever made but it does have its moments. It's a touching depiction of what can result when some, give others, a fighting chance.<br/><br/>Mo"
"howard.schumann","8","52","73","28 March 2010"," Humorous, heartwarming, and satisfying
","In the fact-based film The Blind Side, a burly homeless black teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is taken in by the family of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a spunky white Christian mother of two and assisted through school until he achieves success as a football player in high school and college, eventually being drafted in the first round by the professional Baltimore Ravens. The film, written and directed by John Lee Hancock and adapted from a book by Michael Lewis, is undemanding entertainment that lacks a great deal of subtlety but is continuously entertaining and emotionally involving and redefines the true meaning of family values.<br/><br/>Michael who is known initially as ""Big Mike"" has been abandoned by his drug-addicted mother and survives in the slums of Memphis, Tennessee only by his wits. He sleeps where he can find a warm place -- a friend's couch, a Laundromat, a school gym -- when a family friend intervenes and helps him enroll in a private Christian high school. Sensing the boys' potential, football coach Cotton (Ray McKinnon) convinces the administrators of the school to admit him although he knows that he will not be eligible to play football unless he can keep up his grades. Seeing Michael alone wandering the streets, he is given a lift and taken home and made a member of the family by Leigh Anne, an interior designer who lives with her husband Sean (Tim McGraw), teenage daughter Collins (Lily Collins), and SJ (Jae Head) an expressive little boy who provides most of the film's comic moments.<br/><br/>Living with the Tuohy family allows Michael to learn to trust and to begin to express some of his feelings from a life of poverty and neglect. Michael who is so big that Leigh Anne can hardly find any clothes to buy for him is also gentle and lacks the killer instinct required of a football tackle. Tutored by the adorable SJ and counseled by Leigh Anne to view the team as a family he has to protect, Michael begins to develop his aggressiveness as a left tackle and develops his skills, eventually turning the team into winners. To raise his grades to be eligible for a college scholarship, the Tuohys hire Miss Sue, remarkably performed by Kathy Bates, who admits to the Republican family that she is a Democrat, prompting Sean to remark that he ""never thought they would have a black son before they met a Democrat."" Besides his grades, however, Michael must overcome several more obstacles that stand in his way before he can enter college.<br/><br/>The Blind Side shows Michael Oher achieving a transformation in his life based on his relationship with the family who took him and nurtured him to independence and self-respect. Sandra Bullock delivers an emotionally resonant performance as a woman whose life is enriched by her simple act of kindness and courage to act from her values. While the film breaks no new ground stylistically, it also resists genre clichés, has no movie villains, avoids cheap sentiment, and, in spite of patronizing images in its trailers and advertising posters, is a humorous, heartwarming, and satisfying experience. Ultimately, The Blind Side is not a film about sports but about the rewards of showing love and support when it is not always accepted or understood by the community."
"Fedorahawk","6","9","10","13 June 2014"," Whose Story is it Anyway?
","Time to complain about a film that would rather take away then include an important aspect of a true story. When watching the film, one should say this story is about Michael Oher, a man who, with the help of a supportive, slightly wealthy family, was able to overcome his hardships of homelessness and loneliness through perseverance and friendship. But the reality of this film is far from that description. It is more about the stupid sport of football and the rich family taking in Michael. I felt that the film did not put enough into the character of Michael Oher, they instead took away from him. I can see the potential of the character, but the story of the film limits him of almost everything except for being a mindless brute on a field. I know for a fact that the real life Michael Oher is nothing like this, nor ever really was. This film was to shine on the rich family, and the goodness they implanted on the world. In a way, it was selfish to put them above Michael in his own story. Sure Sandra has good acting qualities, but that should not be the basis of the film. Anyway, it was still a movie of an intermediate standard. It lacks in many departments, but the worst is the conversion from the novel to the film. If they had focused more on Michael and not the family, then maybe it would have been a better flick, but alas."

","I just saw The Blind Side last night. As I have read even if you are not a football fan you'll like this movie. I am not a football fan (baseball is my sport) but I loved it!!! So many great performances by the actors. A charming story with laughs and tears. How nice to have a positive movie this time of the year especially. Everybody MUST see this movie. Quinton Aaron does a fantastic job of playing Michael Oher. In the early scenes he has no dialog, but expresses so much just with is eyes and facial expressions. Jae Head is charming as the young ""brother"" S.J. Camped up I am sure, but I go to the movies to entertained which the movie does in spades! Sandra Bullock as I have never seen her before, does a wonderful job, so different that the other roles she has had in the past. And Ray McKinnon as the coach has some expressions that John Lee Hancock should be awarded for his direction."

","I don't think I've seen a Bullock movie since ""Speed"" that didn't leave me watching my cell phone for the time. Her movies have been pretty awful and worth skipping. Not this one. The story received a lot of press and one has to give her much credit for snapping up the rights to it. She also did a fabulous job as the heroine. I was simply amazed. It was really one of the most amazing career rehabilitations since Travolta in ""Pulp Fiction"".<br/><br/>I loved the story. It is a genuinely heartwarming tale of an abandoned teenager adopted by a wealthy family and guided to success. And it's all true. This is what make me love movies. What a great film! Go see this movie. I loved it and so will you."
"cokiwa","8","74","119","18 November 2009"," Another inspirational sport film
","I saw this last night at a screening and found it to be a very inspiring movie. I love sports movies as well as movies based on true stories, so this film hit multiple buttons for me personally, but reactions of others leaving the theater seemed equally positive.<br/><br/>As with any sports movie, you must have an underdog to cheer for, and Michael Oher is that underdog. Having been removed by CPS from his crack-addicted mother's home as a child and bounced from foster home to foster home, Oher has been staying on a friend's couch. He is reluctantly accepted to a private school when the football coach sees potential in him and pressures the school's admissions board to give him a chance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, being an undereducated black youth in a predominantly white private school doesn't magically turn his life around, and in addition to struggling to understand his classes, he finds himself sleeping in an all night laundromat after the stay at the friend's house ends. While walking on a cold, rainy night , Oher is offered a ride and then a place to sleep for the night by the Leigh Anne Tuohy, whose children attend the same school Michael does. It's this single act of kindness that begins a chain of events that will change this underdog's life, eventually resulting in his being a top 2009 NFL draft pick and signing with the Baltimore Ravens.<br/><br/>The actors brought plenty of life to the characters they were playing. It was a pleasure to watch Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy, making a somewhat minor character in the film memorable. Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy was fascinating--I'd really love to meet Mrs. Tuohy in person. Jae Head as SJ became my favorite character in the movie, practically stealing the show as it were. Quinton Aaron's portrayal of Oher leans heavily to the strong, silent type, but there is a quiet grace and gentleness that comes through.<br/><br/>Obviously, nothing is quite as slick and clean as Hollywood plays it in movies like this, and there were issues and controversies surrounding the Tuohy family and the assistance they offered Michael Oher. Some of it is depicted in the movie, though not all, and there are many who will decry this film for that. It's a given that there is more to a story than what you see on the screen...condensing years into a two hour presentation requires some compromise...and it is meant to be entertainment after all.<br/><br/>I only had a couple criticisms. One, at 126 minutes, the movie was a little too long. I think 8-10 minutes of editing would have really tightened it up and eliminated a couple slower moments. Second, Sandra Bullock's accent seemed a little too forced at times. And finally, what happened to Steve Hamilton, the boy whose family Michael was staying with when he started attending Briarwood? Once introduced as his father pressures the coach for scholarships for Steve and Michael, he disappears from the movie. Minor issues that didn't keep this from being an extremely enjoyable movie, but did help keep it from being a perfect 10."
"FilmRap","6","11","14","12 June 2010"," A feel good movie- but no way did it deserve to be one of the top 10 of 2009
","A few months after the Academy Awards we decided to see this movie since it was nominated as one of the 10 best pictures of year and of course Sandra Bullock was named Best Actress. While it was a good performance by Bullock who had a fine southern accent for her character, we decided that she probably was given the Oscar for ""her body of work"". The movie was a predictable ""feel good"" story that in our opinion was not in the same league as the other nominees for best picture. It is based on a true story of Michael Oher, an over-sized black teenager from the wrong side of the tracks ( Quinton Aaron), who gets ""adopted"" by a rich Memphis couple ( Sandra Bullock and country music star Tim McGraw) with two kids of their own. The school football coach drools over his potential as a offensive lineman but it is not until his new Mother knowing that he has tested to have high aptitude in the ""protectiveness"" scale encourages him to ""protect"" the quarterback or the running back as he would protect his own new found family does he show his stuff. He now is able to use his size and power and become a great football player who is recruited by many colleges including his new parents alma mater ""Ole Miss"". In order to play football and stay in the game he had to be tutored by a teacher who also went to Ole Missplayed by Kathy Bates. There are a few mild twists and subplots in the story line but no big surprises. You come away from the movie with a warm feeling, especially as you look at the closing credits interspersed with photos of the real Michael Oher and the family that adopted him, as well as confirmation that he eventually made the NFL."

","Nice to see Sandra Bullock come back after the cinematic travesty, called All About Steve(2009).

But one day while driving home, she sees, a larger then life teenager which everybody calls Big Mike(Quinton Aaron), when she tries to talk to him, he comes across as a little withdrawn, and is nearly homeless, she decides to take him in, with her supporting family behind her. Leigh finds out his name is Michael Oher, and tries to dig up things about his past, in hopes of helping him, but the question is will she? <br/><br/>I really liked this film, it manages to balance humor and drama perfectly. Sandra Bullock gave quite a strong performance, so Quinton Aaron, Lyn Collin, but Jae Head is quite the scene stealer. It also has a good football scene as well.

If you haven't seen it you have to. I usually get really bored watching true life stories but this one kept me interested thru out the whole movie. If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this would be it. Great plot, Amazing actors, Talented directors, etc. Go and see it. And I really think both men and women will like this one.

"che_kiwi","2","78","139","20 February 2010"," Lala Land and Fakery
","I endured this movie wondering How on earth the scriptwriters were able to come up with such fakery! The fact the Sandra Bullock has been lauded for her role in the movie is no surprise given that she is basically the only character with more that a few lines in the movie, she does do a good job, but it wasn't 'outstanding'. Another reason to question the script is the lack of dialogue of the main protagonist - Michael. He is written into the movie as a chap with low IQ and almost mute - now, given that the actual young man is intelligent and a fantastic sportsman, I don't understand why he is portrayed in such a dim light - it actually comes across as racially condescending. On this note, we almost turned the movie off due to it's many cringeworthy moments such as the portrayal of racial differences (the 'oh-my god it's s bunch of black guys smoking pot' scene, stepford wives lunches- so perfectly perfect it is hideous-they even bicker perfectly, the fact that the house is portrayed as being HUGE but they only had room enough for Michael to sleep on the $10,000 sofa, (I could go on...) Though is was so cringy - it bought us much mirth after the movie in acting-out these ridiculous scenes again. Watch the movie if you like to be taken to lala land and enjoy life as fakery. Avoid like the plague if you prefer the scratched, worn, real-spirited portrayal of authenticity. (why oh why did Kathy Bates act in this two bit role?)"
"wlawson60","7","28","45","5 February 2010"," Sandra Bullock as Saint Sandra Bullock In A Terrific TV Movie
","I must confess I was weeping 5 minutes into the movie and that's unusual for me. I had read the book and in the book nothing is that black or that white for that matter, but this is as movie and as a movie it works. I was expecting commercial interruptions every few minutes, the film felt so much like a TV movie. But that is not necessarily a bad thing. The Michael Oher story had to be told even with the poetic licenses that the film takes, shamelessly. Sandra Bullock plays herself beautifully as always and her character with all her saintly stern, southern modern American woman could not move away too far from ""Miss Congeniality"". But it works and at the end of the day, after paying the prices one pays at the box office, it's almost enough. Why they had to ruin it with an Oscar nomination? The nomination makes you look for something in her performance that clearly isn't there. If you go to a Sandra Bullock movie, the quality of the movie may vary but she is always terrific, playing that Sandra Bullock character. Good for her."
"thesubstream","4","58","102","8 December 2009"," Who knows if that guy even wanted to play football?!
","There's a word that I learned listening to smart people talk about issues and subtext and social justice and post-modernism: ""problematic"". When a person has a problem with something like a video game or capitalism or the way coffee gets to my house, when they think it's bad or wrong or unfair but don't actually have a solution or better, correct, more fair idea in mind, things are ""problematic"". They have the aura of a problem. There's a whiff of trouble, a little stinky hint.<br/><br/>John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side is problematic. The film stars Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw as the Tuohys, and Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher, their leviathan adopted son. The film is based on the book of the same name, which details in part the story of how Oher, abandoned by a crack-addict mother and homeless as a high-school sophomore, came to live with and be adopted by the blindingly white, incredibly rich Republican Tuohy family, who helped him eventually make it to the NFL as an offensive linesman.<br/><br/>In the film as in reality, the NCAA had legitimate concerns about the Tuohy's actions re: Oher, suggesting that perhaps they, as massive boosters for Ole Miss football had taken him in and hired him a professional tutor in the hopes that they could convince him, prodigiously gifted as he was athletically, to play for their alma mater, which he eventually did. The film handles this question as if it were a legitimate puzzle, as if the actions of the Tuohys are beyond their own ken – Bullock's Leigh Ann asks her husband at one point, ""Am I a good person?"" Oher in the film is just as puzzled. He has no idea of their motivations, because he is an inarticulate mass, a giant silent looming prop, the obelisk against which the Tuohys can attempt to effect their idea of Christian charity. He's not quite Michael Clark Duncan's obsequious blubbering Magic Black Man from The Green Mile, but he's close enough. To the white, southern Tuohys, to his white coaches and teammates, he's an unfathomable, totemic, black force that might have been dredged up from the bottom of the ocean. What everyone does see, instantaneously, is that he is large, strong and fast, so they without even bothering to ask turn him into a football player. Leigh Ann is asked at one point in the film if what she's doing is out of white guilt, and it's clearly not. The film, though, is going to make a lot of guilty-feeling white people very happy. That's problematic.<br/><br/>What rescues the film from complete collapse is the performance of Sandra Bullock. It's a rare gift for an actor to be able to do work that seems to be a conscious decision on the part of the performer to work to make the film better. Bullock's performance is not just razor-sharp and subtle, it seems calculated, it seems like she as an actress recognized the inherent problems in her character and in the way the film is put together and worked in her performance to correct those problems. Her performance is superb. In every scene in which the film could or would dip into maudlin sentimentality and pathetic white-people-saving-black-people (as long as they're athletic and will help the team full of white people win) sludge, she's a little frosted-haired scalpel, cutting through the dross. Unfortunately the film has scenes without her in it, and those are often terrible.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film does to Oher what the Tuohys did to him. He never speaks about his relationship with the family outside of a few pithy one-liners and smiles. He's never allowed to be articulate about his background, or goals, or disappointments. He's a prop moved around at will by people motivated by a weird combination of religious and athletic morality, a giant instinctual force, aimed by anyone but himself and unleashed. It's not quite offensive, I don't think, but it certainly is problematic. 4/10"

","This relentlessly feel good movie strives and succeeds in all it sets out to do. It reassures us all that not only is all well with the world, it really is a pretty wonderful place. Walt Disney would be proud.<br/><br/>Disney's family fare of the sixties portrayed characters as totally one dimensional. The mean were mean, the kind were kind, etc. etc. Characters simply had no inner conflicts or doubts. Audiences, particularly children, found this spoon fed story telling very enjoyable. If only life were that simple.<br/><br/>Well in ""The Blind Side"" life is that simple. The characters in the movie are unashamedly one dimensional. This good natured family doesn't bat an eyelid about taking in an underprivileged over-sized young black teenager into their smart home. They might as well have picked up a stray pet. Those squeaky clean smiling children take to Big Mike from the projects without a hint of hesitation. <br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with movies reaffirming the basic goodness of mankind. God knows there are enough that have succeeded in proving the opposite. But pandering to the need to believe in such goodness in such a simplistic, needless to say, unrealistic manner is misguided. It's making us feel good at the cost of integrity - and succeeding.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock does with the role exactly what she's demanded to do and that really is not very much in the way of an acting stretch. We've seen her good nature shine numerous times before. Why this time it garnered her an Oscar is very probably as she herself put it, she <br/><br/>simply wore them down."

We could have viewed his struggles up close, seen accounts of his rough past, and caught deep insight into his personality for an intimate portrait of the obstacles that too many American children face.<br/><br/>Instead, the plot of ""The Blind Side"" went something like this: Lee Ann Tuohy is a wonderful person who does wonderful things. And some more wonderful things. And continues to do nothing but wonderful, wonderful things without any sort of real conflict, internal or otherwise. As a commenter on the message boards brilliantly put it, Michael Oher was a supporting character in his own damn story. ""The Blind Side"" was so self-righteous and self-congratulatory, it made me nauseous.<br/><br/>I could probably type forever about the problems I had with this movie, but for the sake of brevity, here are some points: <br/><br/><ul><li>Why didn't the screenwriter take advantage of the MYRIAD of engaging topics that could have been explored in this movie? And I don't just mean race (although I was quite disappointed by it not actually being addressed). What about the kinds of psychological issues that adopted kids face all the time? Abandonment issues? Problems adjusting to the family dynamic? Survivor's Guilt? And did anyone in the rest of the Tuohey family experience apprehension about having a complete stranger stay in their house? Was there jealousy? Sibling rivalry? Oh wait, exploring those kinds of issues would have taken time away from showcasing what a wonderful, wonderful person Leigh Ann was.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There's a very brief part in the film where Michael runs into his estranged brother. They embrace for a long time, but we don't hear anything they say to each other. Then he disappears, never to be mentioned again for the rest of the movie. What gives? What was his story? Why hadn't Michael seen him in so long? Where was he living? Would they ever see each other again? And what about the rest of Michael's background? We're only given vague details and momentary flashes. Why don't we actually get to learn about him, his past and his personality? Oh wait, that would have taken time away from showcasing what a wonderful, wonderful person Leigh Ann was.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Okay, one of my biggest pet peeves in film is when little kids talk like adults. As far as I'm concerned, S.J. gets the brass ring in that department. He was seriously one of the most annoying creatures I've ever, ever seen on a movie screen. I wanted to punch him in the throat the second he delivered his first spoken line.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I understand the concept of suspended disbelief. And if this movie had been a bit better, I would have been able to do just that. But come on, do they expect me to believe that Michael's poverty-stricken drug-addicted mother was not only lucid and coherent, but had perfect alabaster-white teeth? And really, a bunch of armed-to-the-teeth gang members living in the projects were intimidated into silence by a rich white lady? Are you kidding me? </li></ul><br/><br/>And since it's fresh in my mind...<br/><br/><ul><li>When compared to the caliber of performances of the other actresses, I can't believe the academy gave Sandra Bullock the Best Actress Oscar. What a joke.</li></ul><br/><br/>Long story short (too late), stay away. Unless you enjoy vomiting."
"MovieGuy109","6","7","9","23 July 2011"," The Blind Side's motivational, yet no character study.
","The inspirational story of Michael Oher, the performance from Sandra Bullock, and the good camera work, so why did it not come together? I think the blame is on the screenplay. The overall portrayal of Michael Oher seems stylized in a way that never really shows the true grit or sentiment of the character. It is all so glamored up. Yet the messages of the movie still stay true and the performances are finely tuned, especially Bullock's. The racism displayed is reflective and correct. Ther are lots of things the filmmakers got right, but there are plenty they got wrong as well. The results are a serviceable portrait of a very honest and fortunate man that never adds up the way it should have."

","This is a dumbed down excuse of a movie. Honestly, I felt a physical assault on my brain cells. Obviously the producers are trying to target the Christian republican rednecks, who ironically, will probably not like it anyway. For the rest of us, it is simply unbearable to watch.<br/><br/>I like Sandra Bullock. No I really do. But it is completely beyond me how she got an Oscar for such an awful movie. Is portraying a stereotypical character with corny lines worthy of an Oscar?

","""The Blind Side"" finds a wealthy, white and paternalistic Christian family deciding to civilise a helpless, slow-witted, African American kid. The kid doesn't speak, is a kind, gentle bear, and spends the film literally doing whatever the white characters tell him to do, never once expression an opinion, thought or exhibiting any agency or free will. <br/><br/>As the film unfolds, we are shown black people who are unable to help themselves, learn that the white man's way is best, that blacks should be grateful of white aid and that success comes to those who ""are good"" and ""don't do drugs"". The film tries to say that privileged whites should help downtrodden blacks, but of course this is easy to say when the black kid being helped turns out to be a star sportsman who effortlessly succeeds on the field. <br/><br/>Strangely, ""The Blind Side's"" central character - Big Mike (Quinton Aaron) - is largely a non-entity. A giant mute kid, passive but obedient, Mike bumbles about like a tamed grizzly bear in a polo shirt. Elsewhere the film employs racist stereotypes, is condescending and has absolutely no concern for its black character, who plays second fiddle to actress Sandra Bullock, who plays a kindly matriarch with a hot-line to God. Through Bullock, white audiences pat themselves on the back, able to do what's right and decent by proxy.<br/><br/>During flashbacks, Big Mike is shown to have come from a supremely depressing black community. Drug addicts, prostitutes, gangsters, junkies with hopeless lives....the kid's past is but an amalgamation of clichés, a one-dimensional horror-show cynically designed to make his transition into white-hood smooth and frictionless. A better film would have perhaps shown the troubles the kid has fitting into his new white life. Would have really examined the causes of poverty and abandonment. Would show how Bullock's very privilege relies on an unspoken social agreement which essentially perpetuates and sanctions an underclass. Would show how Big Mike feels being the only black kid in school. Would have given him a personality. Would have examined the way sports exploits impoverished black kids. Would have examined the downsides of the white family's Christian fundamentalism. Would have portrayed its characters in a less one-dimensional light (though the Aryan Brotherhood must be pleased to see the black mute gentle giant stereotype making a return).<br/><br/>But perhaps such a film would have made no money. Afterall, ""Blind"" made a staggering 400 million dollars and counting at the box office, proving that people love its very Christian world-view. This is the wholesome view of smiley-faced missionaries who go out to Africa to help god's impoverished children with an open heart. A view which ignores the church's brutal history, its continuing negative effect on the continent (see the rise of brutal church sanctioned homophobia), ignores that for every dollar of western ""aid"" sent to Africa a dollar fifty and more comes back in debt repayment, ignores the way western ""Christian"" nations control trade policies and the lives of peoples in the developing world, never-mind how privilege at home in America relies upon a class system. And all the while, with demented irony, Jesus Christ's supposed home land of Israel, the site every crazy politician believes the Second Coming will occur, receives more western aid than all of Latin America, Africa and the West Indies combined. Hooray for a little Christian compassion.<br/><br/>A more moral film would have probably had Big Mike beat the crap out of Bullock, embrace every racist cliché, get their daughter pregnant, rob their house and steal their car. I'm sure there's something in the Bible which advocates that. Thou shall enact vengeance on hypocritical women or something. Proverbs 21:19 I think. Or maybe not.<br/><br/>7/10 – The always likable Sandra Bullock would win an Oscar for her performance in this film."

","Only a public that has been spoon-fed sugar-coated realities for many years could possibly find anything of merit in this incredibly insipid Disney tale for (white) adults. The horror, the horror, indeed (to quote a previous reviewer, who I believe was quoting a far better film).<br/><br/>I usually tend to review here only when I feel compelled to warn others of the pitfall into which I have fallen, or to cast my vote on a site I frequently use for its prognostic value. This was never truer than with this film (as of this review, 7.7 stars?!?!) I confess that I watched this pap even despite grave misgivings, and I can assure you that all my worst doubts were quickly confirmed! <br/><br/>I happen to love underdog sports films - a plentiful genre - so I had to see why this one had become so popular - what hidden nuggets of wisdom were missing from the previews? The answer: no nuggets, no history lesson, no novelty, no great acting (in fact, rather bad acting on the part of the husband and son), no insight - just the most insanely offensive and nauseating drivel I have seen in a very long time. And somehow people love it and call it ""feel-good!"" I call it feel-bad, because I felt very uncomfortable, and my discomfort was not temporarily relieved with the distraction of great action sequences, such as with the similarly white-savior themed Avatar (as if seeing a soldier betray and kill his own species in his own unit was not disturbing enough).<br/><br/>So what is so great about The Blind Side? Are there deeper meanings I am not understanding? If you want to truly understand how the legacy of slavery still plays out in the lives of modern day black Americans, get to know one! Or to better understand race relations in the U.S., read Obama's book ""Dreams of My Father."" Sure, it's nice that this lady and her family were so generous to a strange black kid, but why make a movie out of it? (Or even a book?) I hazard to say that this kind of story has countless permutations in the black community, where father-less or mother-less kids get taken in by an often equally disadvantaged family that does not happen to live in a mansion and purchase all their meals pre-cooked because they are too busy out shopping for the perfect window valance. So what makes this story so special? Because it resulted in a college scholarship? Or because it was a white family that adopted Big John? <br/><br/>For me the only truly poignant moment in the whole film is the scene with John's biological mother - a central moment in the film that is, sadly, all too brief. Here we see a woman who has survived unknown myriad personal and societal obstacles, but who can still show the strength and grace enough to be polite to this unfriendly, pushy white woman sitting in her living room and demanding answers. Other than this scene I cringed and groaned the whole way through - something that I'd probably do while viewing any schmalz of this type, but there's something more egregious about this particular schmalz being sold. Maybe I just can't stand having my intelligence insulted by cute one-liners and happy endings about what are really important and serious issues our nation should confront. Maybe Hollywood is dumbing down movies more than ever to reach the widest possible audience and bring in more revenue - I don't know, but whatever the reason for its creation or success, this film has no social value in my view whatsoever.<br/><br/>So if you are a fan of good films and good film-making, you'll no doubt already have known better and avoided this film - despite the bizarre accolades from the Academy and the public. Likewise, if you understand that racism and addiction, poverty and capitalism are all pieces of the same puzzle, you'll definitely want to steer clear of this. I would personally prefer to watch Brian's Song (maybe even the remake of Brian's Song) a thousand times over."

","OK, OK, so I was your typical reviewer who saw the trailers to ""The Blind Side"" and expected another football movie where a ""one-in-a-million shot"" with a lot of heart goes on to win the Super Bowl or national championship. And, when everything was said and done I would come home and write a review using the words ""tear jerker"" or ""uplifting"" or ""scores a touchdown."" Then I started to write this review and realized that it was all of those things plus a lot more.<br/><br/>""The Blind Side"" is the story of Michael Oher, (played by Quinton Aaron), a teenager from a broken home with a troubled past who goes onto become an NFL draft pick. His story, as portrayed in this particular film, is not about how he laid awake every night dreaming of someday playing in the NFL. In fact, the NFL was only mentioned at the end of the movie where it actually showed the real Michael Oher being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens. This movie was all about the journey.<br/><br/>It starts with Sandra Bullock's character, Leigh Anne Touhy, narrating and describing the importance of an offensive tackle (something I knew very little about) and moves into Michael being allowed a shot to go to a private school in Memphis. The young man does have a rough life, pretty much homeless, no family, no friends and extremely introverted. By fate, Leigh and her family take Michael in for a night and they become his surrogate parents for a while. They clothe him and shelter him and help him bring his grades up in school.<br/><br/>All along, Michael isn't saying more than a few words at a time. I think this was the strong area of the movie. This gentle giant brought out the best intentions around a lot of the characters in the story. We've all seen the football movies where the gifted athlete comes in and says a lot of smart-ass lines then butts heads with the coach and realizes he needs to listen in order to learn. Well, this movie takes a different approach (and since it was based on a true story I think this was the only approach he had to work with). Michael kept quiet most of the time and the people around him learned a lot about helping another human being.<br/><br/>Should you see this movie? Definitely. Yes. Even if you think you have seen this football formula before, you haven't. The movie used comedy to bring it to life. It used Michael's silence at the right times to make it stick. They thought this movie through before they started filming. Why else should you see it? Because it was an uplifting, tearjerker that will score a touchdown. (There, I typed the words and I enjoyed doing it)."
"electronsexparty","3","41","78","30 November 2009"," Based on true story doesn't mean it's a good story
","Here's a movie that panders to gun-toting dickish Southern ""Christian"" Republicans. You know, the kind who cry when Glenn Beck tells them to and who think Jesus carried a .22 and shot the poor lepers and prostitutes off his doorstep while shouting that NRA membership and his gun are GOD GIVEN RIGHTS and ain't no n----r in the WHITE House gunna take 'em.<br/><br/>The Michael Oher in the movie has no voice and soul, he's just a empty vessel for a rich white family to project their fantasies upon. He's a stray they the found shivering in the cold and the rain and decided to keep instead taking to the pound the next day.<br/><br/>They found a big, dumb black kid and decided he should play football despite the fact he didn't like playing and wasn't very good at it besides his size. They use sick psychology to trick him into wanting to play and trick him into wanting to play for the family's Alma mater too. When college recruiters come to woo the family and beg to borrow their prized horse to put their jockey on, the family realizes that their dumb pet better study up because he won't be able to play unless he has a 2.5 GPA. His academics don't mater until his low grades mean he can't play college ball. So, they hire Kathy Bates who is, regrettably, a baby-killing, God-less democrat (but is still a graduate of the family's Alma mater) to teach Hans to be clever and count enough apples to be allowed to play.<br/><br/>But, the evil NCAA hears of their plan and calls them out on it. Nothing comes of the investigation though, because Michael decides that he'd rather be a pet of a rich family that be no one's pet at all and covers for them.<br/><br/>And, they all live happily ever after. The rich white family who had everything now have everything and fame and the big black kid gets to play football for his sponsors' Alma mater. The movie ends saying: You know, lots of black kids get killed in ghettos everyday. Why can't they play sports instead? The movie is racist and disgusting. it's a movie that says, loudly, ""Hey! Look! I'm a rich white woman who taught this dumb, poor black kid to play sports! Ain't I good person?"" And the crowds respond in kind, ""Yes, you are a good person. Black people are poor, dumb and naturally good at sports. You gave him what he needed. Good for you!"" <br/><br/>It's sick."

It is full of melodrama, stupid clichés and unrealistic events.<br/><br/>Take the scene where Leigh Anne is looking for Michael and she is talking to the guys Michael just had a fight with, and she say, ""You listen to me, bitch,"" and then goes off on an angry rant, and the guys just sit there and seem scared.<br/><br/>Yeah, right.<br/><br/>Another problem with the film is the way it treats black people.

"Kevin2252","1","30","56","9 May 2010"," Why do people like this movie?
","I am absolutely shocked.....and not in a good way. Has American cinema fallen so far that we can consider this monstrosity even an ""average"" movie at best? The story was utterly predictable and failed to instill any sense of surprise in any moments. From the first twenty minutes, you could predict the course of the plot if you'd seen any kind of ""inspirational"" sports movie. The characters were no better. Tim Mcgraw faded into the wallpaper about a third of the way through the movie, and I was about ready to hurl a brick at my TV just so I could pretend I was throwing a real one at SJ. The character of Michael Oher seemed like a baby made from the genes of Forrest Gump and John Coffey, with a touch of Radio, but I'll give the actor pity points for effort. My greatest contempt, however, goes towards Sandra Bullock. I honestly think she did a better job in ""All About Steve"". She seems like an amalgamation of the ""rough on the players cuz I love 'em"" coaches you see in every other generic sports movie, only with estrogen and a TERRIBLY faked southern accent. I was shocked when they chose her for the Oscar over Gabourey Sidibe, who, unlike Bullock, seems to know one or two things about ACTING. All in all, if you're going to watch this movie, I suggest you drink heavily beforehand so you don't have to comprehend the awfulness of this ""film"""

","Boy, The Blind Side tried. It really did attempt to be a tear jerker.<br/><br/>If it weren't for an interview I heard/saw from the real-life Michael Oher (played here by Aaron) who said barely a scene actually happened – stating most were for, well, dramatic effect, it still would fail at being 100% interesting.<br/><br/>Oher's homeless after his druggie mother (of, like 15 kids she may/may not remember giving birth to) doesn't want anything to do with him, as are the other caretakers, he runs into stuck-up rich wife gal Leigh Anne (Bullock) and she takes him in. Showing she's not perfect, even she admits the first night, she worries a person of color will steal from (or harm) her family. Guess what? Oher ends up being someone decent, albeit reclusive and attaches himself to the rich family's kindness.<br/><br/>Eventually he opens up, feels more safe and proves that football's his thing. So much, that the coincidentally ex-cheerleader mom encourages him further and then into a college scholarship. Throw in some outrageously Lifetime drama of a conflict on which school he chooses and you'll get the ""exciting"" climax of him making it big on his own terms.<br/><br/>These all sound like complaints. And they're really not. This movie wasn't bad, per se, but not great. It tried too hard, way too hard for tears of the audience. I'll admit: it nearly got me in a few scenes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, before I could fully get emotional, the movie shifts gears and I'm back to watching a movie that should have, in fact, ended on the Lifetime Channel verses the big screen.<br/><br/>The more I heard about Bullock's performance – Oscar worthy, they say, I had to see this movie. She was really good, I will say. The best? No. Great, even? Again, no. But really good. I believed every scene she was in as mother-of-the-week Leigh Anne Touhy. Was this her best performance? Or the best she could be? By no means, that's a negative. Heck, not only was she better in Speed, her absolute best job was in 2005's Crash, in which, she wasn't even nominated. Like Pacino, who onlyONLY for the love of Petewon an Oscar for one role (Scent of a Woman), Bullock will probably be recognized for The Blind Side, despite her being so much better in Crash. It's those old Oscar cronies way of making up for past mistakes, as they generally do.<br/><br/>Was the movie worth watching? Sure. For the (waaay over used) great (based on, inspired by, etc) true FOOTBALL movies? Not really. If you're looking for that, look elsewhere. And having literally hundreds of the ""true"" football films come out in the past two+ decades, it shouldn't be hard to find. This one has basically one real football game scene and a few practices. It's more about overcoming prejudices, charity, the 'hood and, of course, Bullock's Oscar chances. See it, if everything else is sold out.<br/><br/>SIDE NOTE: Like many other ""TRUE STORIES"" that use a tremendous amount of unrealistic but dramatic scenes that, for the most part, are entered in to move the story along to fit in years of lives in mere hours, The Blind Side hit a nerve with me. In one of the key plot points, the young boy of the Touhy family (Head) films all of Oher's football practices and games. He eventually sends a copy to the recruiter's office and from there, every single, and I mean EVERYONE of the, recruiting colleges/universities want this rather large soon-to-be football player. Here's my petpeeve: Though I know, once again, these types of movies thrive on the heavy drama (to make us weep!) and have to get the job done in under 3 hours (short attention span, audience, eh?) they cut corners with extreme amateur videos (the boy was about 10) that are professionally made. For example, he's completely stationary yet, the film follows the action on the field, namely Oher. Not only did this type of filming never occur, it was extremely hard to buy the recruiters sitting back, laughing, high-fiving their way to dollar-signs in their eyes due to the ""excellent footage"" they're witnessing on their monitors. Give me a freaking break."

Character development is terrible and people are only one-dimensional caricatures. I also felt that the movie only used worn out, negative stereotypes of white Southerners (racists) and blacks (gang bangers, militant NAACP people). Why this movie is even mentioned in the same sentence as the word ""Oscar"" I will never know.<br/><br/>If you want a good football movie with good acting, try _Rudy_.

All the same, this feel-good movie is the type of Hollywood production that blacks have justifiably railed against since ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"", and rightfully so.<br/><br/>Here we have a privileged pretty princess (Bullock) and her pretty McMansion-ensconced family bestowing not just aid but outright salvation itself on a poor and essentially homeless black ""child"".

I freely admit I possess a low threshold for ""cute"", and the family's precocious wise-beyond-his-years young son seemed to single-handedly tip this film into the Oh-Give-Me-A-Break ditch. He seemed to be a character lifted out of a laugh-tracked cookie-cutter '80's family sitcom. Is this how far we've come? AND...What is the wonderful Kathy Bates doing in this film??<br/><br/>There were also a few peripheral yet potent loose strings for which resolutions were never presented (the central character's drug-addicted mother and estranged brother, for example). We get to meet them, or at least become aware of them. But it seems the message we're left to assume is that, since they don't have their own Nice White Lady to rescue them, they don't have any real chance at redemption, so there's really no point in hearing from them again. Feel-good movies never leave such untidiness! Since ""The Blind Side"" is based on true events, the real-life people these actors endeavor to portray deserve better that this icky sweet confection."

A child from a poor family gets adopted from a rich family who seem to have tones of money without showing any proof of actually working for their wealth. This is all very well but the problem with this scenario is that children from bad backgrounds are not friendly bears: This child ""Friendly Mike"" has no aggressive personality and is simply a really nice kid who happens to have grown up in the wrong part of town. A good film would have examined the difficulties of adopting a child from a poor background and would have the problems that develop with this situation. Instead the rich white family happen to have a perfect child who displays no negative attributes. The question that you need to ask yourself is: what would have happened if the child had robbed the family after his first opportunity to live with them? would they have given up on them or tried to teach him the ways of a better life? The blind side doesn't address any of these issues and simply deals with adopting a child from an underprivileged background who just happens to be perfect already. <br/><br/>An unrealistic story line which would never happen.

","First of all, this is a terrific film. The casting, directing, writing and camera work are all first-class, especially Sandra as the lead. Secondly, as a Christian, I was delighted to see other Christians portrayed in such a supportive way. All too often, we're portrayed as narrow-minded Bible-thumpers who's main preoccupation in life is to hate gay people and voice disapproval about everything else. This movie shows us for what we really are; loving, caring people who want to help others, and do. I'm actually flabbergasted that Hollywood made a movie displaying such a kind view of us.<br/><br/>That said, the plot is quite simple. Sandra's character helps a poor homeless youth get off the street, into a good school, adopts him into her home, and helps him get on his feet in life. Her faith is understood, because she always wears a prominent cross around her neck. Her faith is never spoken, because we interpret it so solidly through her actions, which is how it should be in film. No preachy religious dialog, just clear demonstrations of what faith in action is about. The many obstacles she has to go through to help this young man, and her willingness to take risks shows us, through example, what it means to be Christ like. The direction is quite economical in this area, never hitting us over the head with a message, always sticking to the action of the story. But the message is clear, and instructive. I loved this movie. If you are a Christian (and even if you're not!) you will enjoy this rare and supportive picture. 10/10. Excellent!"

","Some have described this as a sports film. It's not. Only the last half of the film has any sport in it, and it's really not about that. Overall the film is about a family helping another child. The sport could have been anything, and was irrelevant to the film.<br/><br/>I found the pace of the film to be dreadfully slow. Probably 30 minutes could have been cut from it, without losing anything. Part of the problem can't be solved by editing. The leaden acting, from everyone including the two leads, and boring directing even make necessary scenes drag on and on. The writing is that of an after-school special or TV movie of the week.<br/><br/>The film is also presented as a true story. But key parts of the film are fabrications.<br/><br/>The presentation of how Oher learned football is false. Oher did not need to be taught football by his mom or brother. He was an aggressive player. Still, he did not throw an opposing player over a fence. The film was not improved by these fabrications, so you have to wonder why they are in the film.<br/><br/>The film notably omits the facts that Oher didn't raise his GPA through normal means, but instead took 10-day internet courses from BYU. All that each course required students to do was to read a few brief passages from famous works or speeches and then answer five questions. These courses provided the A's to replace his F's in English. I know this makes people seem less angelic and heroic, but this is what was reported elsewhere, and should have been in the film. Complex characters and stories make film interesting.<br/><br/>Regarding the airbag scene, I believe the film depicts it as the family does in real life, however it simply isn't credible. Sure, it's a nice explanation to make everyone feel better about what happened, but come on. Most likely Oher was instinctively bracing for impact, or to try to restrain SJ from hitting the dashboard from the impact he saw coming, and his arm happened to be where the airbag later deployed. If you see any video (slowed-down or not) of an airbag deployment, you know how ludicrous the claim is that Oher (a) knew it might deploy on this low speed impact, (b) knew airbag deployment would be dangerous for someone of SJ's size, (c) had time to decide to stop it rather than stopping the vehicle, and (d) was able to move in any way in time to deflect the airbag's deployment. Those bags are only inflated for a fraction of a second, and then deflate to provide cushioning, so hitting it even slightly before or after deployment is just pushing air around. I think hitting an airbag may increase or decrease the pressure in the bag at the time the protected person's face hits it, resulting in more injury to the person. It would be interesting to get Mythbusters' take on it.<br/><br/>Now let's talk bias. Once again, we have a movie where a white family saves a black child. This story has been told to death. There are other families in the US, and their stories need to be told, for once. But if we insist on these stories, can't we at least tell them from the child's point of view? Instead, they make this one about about Leigh Anne. The story by itself is not racist, but when you consider the context of Hollywood film over the years, things start to look pretty bad.<br/><br/>Last, the propaganda angle. This is quite overtly a Christian propaganda film, as opposed to a film with Christian characters. I found the repeated use of the phrase ""good Christian"" to be particularly offensive because it's designed to suggest that being good equals or requires being Christian, or that there is something somehow uniquely Christian about the behaviour shown. These are people who have done a good thing. Maybe they even had ulterior motives, but they did it. That's good enough without the propaganda. Similarly, the repeated focus on the phrase ""with men this is possible, but with god all things are possible"". This is a mis-quote of the actual phrase from Matthew 19:26 ""With man this is impossible ..."". It's just more propaganda, not to mention provably false. Humans deserve credit for what we do, even when we do the right thing. Last, the film ends with Leigh Anne thanking her god that some other kid died instead of hers. It's a line clearly meant to inspire, but when you think about it, is actually pretty revolting. A god that permits these deaths is not deserving of thanks.<br/><br/>I do give filmmakers credit for correctly quoting the oft-mis-quoted line from Charge of the Light Brigade (""do and die"")."

","""The Blind Side"" isn't awful, as some critics are writing. It's also not terrific, as some viewers are saying. It's a mediocre movie with moments of greatness.<br/><br/>As a Baltimore resident, I love to see the Ravens logo emblazoned on screen. Michael Ohers strikes me as both a respectable player and a respectable man. His story is an inspiring one; Ohers rose from poor circumstances and became a national figure. But this isn't the story you get when you put your $10 in the ticket slot, buy your buttery popcorn, and sit down in your sticky seat at the local cinema.<br/><br/>""The Blind Side"" is essentially about a dumb, poor, black man who finds salvation at the hands of a sassy white woman. Clearly, this is not the story of Michael Ohers. I'm not accusing the Hollywood producers responsible for the film of racism, but rather of opportunism. They obviously decided that this sports story would be best served as a Sandra Bullock movie, complete with ""comedic"" stock characters and ""humorously"" ironic situations.These Bullock-pampering comic scenes are then juxtaposed with clearly exaggerated and dramatized serious scenes. The effect is an uneven dramedy with some thudding jokes and some unintentional laughs. Toby Keith and Kathy Bates don't bring much to the table as Bullock's husband and Michael's teacher. However, the film doesn't completely collapse.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock gives one of the best performances of her career. With a game Southern accent and a tough-as-nails attitude, she turns a stereotype into a flesh-and-blood character. Her comedic timing has always been good, and it works especially well here. At the same time, she brings gravitas to her character's more trying moments. Bullock carries the film. While her character's role in Ohers' life is overplayed, her work saves the film from the ""DUD"" label.<br/><br/>Some of the comedy falls flat, Ohers comes off as a wholly dependent idiot, and the film's realism is shaky at times. Still, it's worth seeing the film for Bullock's performance."

Though not to his extent. With that being said, this movie brought a tear (one tear) to my eyes seeing the compassion that Leigh (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Sean (TimMcGraw) showed this young man who had been abandoned my his drug addicted mother. The way Mike bonded with Leigh's children, S.J (Jae Head) and Collins (Lily Collins) was great. Although Mike was a big kid, he was very gentle. Remember the scene where he told Leigh that he did not like being called Big Mike. Also, the movie had religion in it as the school accepted Michael based on their religion principles. Also, the way Sandra reached out to find Michael mother was very impressive. This movie had it all, compassion,drama, sports and religion. It made me appreciate the good in people and I truly want to pass this on. Maybe if more people felt this way, the world would be better."

They saw a life and cared about a life when no one else did. This is not just a story about a great football player but a story about human beings rejecting racism and helping another in need. It is the same as the good Samaritan. I admit this is a tear jerker and there is no action as it relies more on touching your heart than special effects. This movie is worth watching over and over again."

","The only thing separating ""The Blind Side"" from a made-for-TV movie on the Hallmark channel is the fact that Sandra Bullock is probably too expensive for Hallmark.<br/><br/>I know this film is based on the true story about an affluent white family who take in a homeless black youth and raise him as their own. But even though its origins are grounded in fact, the film felt like a congratulatory fantasy conjured out of white guilt. The film is so anxious to be family-friendly and palatable to the least sophisticated film goer that it almost avoids dramatic conflict altogether. Conflicts are there, but most of them are resolved within the next scene or two, never building to any kind of suspense or emotional payoff.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for the same reason Julia Roberts did -- Hollywood loves to recognize appealing actresses for being sharp and sassy. But Roberts had much better material to work with in ""Erin Brockovich."" The material in ""The Blind Side"" is usually just shy of gag-inducing, and at one point -- when Bullock's character confronts a group of gang-bangers with a ""you go girl"" attitude and actually succeeds in intimidating them -- downright ludicrous. At the very least, she would have been laughed at in that situation, and quite possibly would have been lucky to escape without physical harm.<br/><br/>The film also stars Kathy Bates as a sassy tutor, and uses the character of Bullock's younger son for...you guessed it...sassy and damn near intolerable ""comic"" relief.<br/><br/>The success of ""The Blind Side"" with middle America is clearly attributed to its religious and wholesome message and values. Fair enough. But it's precisely simplistic and dumbed down movies like ""The Blind Side"" that make me leery of anything geared toward the Christian community. <br/><br/>However, I will say that it's refreshing for once for a film to have actually been seen by the audience who needs to hear its message. And it's also nice, in the wake of ""The Passion of the Christ"" and other movies embraced by the religious community, to see Christianity associated with productivity and goodness rather than with pain and guilt. <br/><br/>Grade: B"
"Mortalias","6","9","15","18 June 2010"," Lot of hype, little delivery
","This film had some potential, but instead plays it safe to become another rags-to-riches cliché.<br/><br/>From the beginning, it is obvious the team went for a ""family friendly"" film, which certainly holds back its realism. The story is well written and flows nicely, but nothing seems original here. Combined with Bullock's gag worthy cliché lines, it just seems too much.<br/><br/>Bullock's acting is done well, but nothing close to a stellar performance. Quinton Aaron does little, if anything, to further convince the audience of his horrendous life beyond occasional sad glances and moping around. The rest of the characters, including Tim McGraw's, are decent additions to the story.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Blind Side"" seemed like a mass produced, over hyped, rags-to-riches story in a genre that has been overdone (especially recently). If you're looking for a good movie to pass the time on a bored Saturday night, I suggest you pick up the film. But if you're looking for a stellar story with plenty to love, don't even bother."

","A movie that you would expect to have been made in the 80's but not now. Just another example of a portrayal of a harmless uneducated black man that cannot help himself. I can't believe this is nominated for an academy award for best picture. This film collects all of the pieces of racial stereotyping done to the African American male and condenses them into a super downtrodden pity hero. Our hero has the ability to be uneducated, raised by a crack-head, have exemplary manners toward white people and of course be a super athlete. Think Micheal Clark Duncan in The Green Mile, only with more Sandra Bullock and less magic mice (unless you count the ginger child). Micheal Oher is able to block three hundred mile an hour airbags, beat up ""hood rats"" and win our hearts, all under the supervision of his very rich white family which has no ulterior motives than making him play football. The movie addresses this point but never considers any other option except becoming a ""hood rat"" himself. What a great and positive message for America to absorb."
"colinmatts","3","16","31","8 March 2010"," how did this win an award?
","I think the Acadamy is being very kind to Sandra Bullock by giving her the best actress award for this movie. Rarely have I seen a more irritating, feel good fetish. It is so predictable that it would be almost impossible to include spoilers in the review, but for the benefit of the mentally deficient I'll try not to give away too much. Basically, its the story of a gentle giant who gets adopted by the most nauseatingly nice family since the Brady Bunch. Our hero, ""Big Mike"" is a misfit kid from the projects who gets accepted into a high performing high school. One night, as he's making his way to the gym, were he sleeps, the Touhey family take pity on him and take him into their perfect family home. This is were Sandra Bullock takes control of the plot and of the whole movie. There's no doubt in my mind that Director John Lee Hancock molded this movie to make Sandra Bullock look like the award winning actress she isn't. Her husband, Sean, played by Tim McGraw, is the most pointless character in movie history. Even a henpecked husband would be more humorous than the impotent piece of passivity this man represents. Son, S.J., played by Jae Head, is one of those annoying child characters who gets way too much screen time and daughter, Collins, played by Lily Collins has to be the most understanding teenage girl ever to feature in a Hollywood movie. Quinton Aaron, who plays ""Big Mike"" does as good a job as he's let, given that he dare not steal attention from Sandra Bullock's dominance. There's one good scene when he returns to the bad guys in the projects were he grew up. It's the only good scene actually, probably because Sandra Bullock is not in it. I won't bore you with the details of the whole football plot, you'll guess were its going very early on; especially when Sandra Bullock's character starts telling the coach what to do. Apart from the ""Boys in the Hood"" in Mike's old neighborhood, there's just one other bad guy, but he's just a loud mouth racist at a football game who Sandra Bullock deals with predictably. There's shades of ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" ""Good Will Hunting"" and even ""Shine"" in this movie. Sadly though, those shades are quickly obliterated by Miss Bullocks ego."

","America is a pretty good country. We are at once progressive and compassionate. We have an elected president who is not just a man of color, but also highly intelligent and supremely wise. Christ, not even the snooty British or other so-called inclusive European countries- who often rebuke our American character and psychology- can lay claim to such an awesome achievement.<br/><br/>While I am proud to be an American, I'm not too proud to have ""The Blind Side"" be our movie phenomena of the year. This is not cool. What has been created here is an insipid drama that insults audience intelligence. Not only that, it's ineffably racist and poorly dramatized.<br/><br/>Firstly, if I was a black guy I would seriously be insulted by this movie. The character of Michael Oher is little more than a modern reworking of Uncle Tom; while the nice white middle-class suburbanite characters pity his appalling ghetto poverty and nasty urban community whom peddle drugs, take drug or vilify nice white people who are trying to protect them from fooling with drugs and guns. There is not one character of color that can be regarded as three-dimensional. For that matter, there's not even one white character in this movie that's three-dimensional. Everything about this movie: from themes, characters and politics- is lowest-denominator.<br/><br/>The plot is totally by the numbers. I didn't know much about this film before watching it, but 5 minutes in I knew where it was going. I knew all the conflicts that were going to pop up and how effortlessly they'd be overcome. I knew there'd be no real character arc for Leigh Anne Tuohy, and the dramatic growth of Michael Oher's character was without any sort of surprise. It was simplistic in every way.<br/><br/>I read somewhere on in the comments pages that this was Sandra Bullock's 'masterpiece'. I beg to disagree. Ms. Bullock has yet to make a masterpiece, or deliver a performance that can be deemed masterful. (That's not saying she isn't a good actress or not pretty, because she is: very much so.) For that matter, hasn't Kathy Bates played the exact same role in her last 17 movies? Talk about type casting. Furthermore, the kid playing S.J. was the most annoying child depicted in film. He sucked. I wanted him to get written-off in the car crash scene.<br/><br/>This is a bad movie. One that doesn't deserve to be as huge as what it's become."

Only if they follow the path of the white man, will they be successful and respected as equal human beings.<br/><br/>I just can't believe that people give this movie such high ratings.

"zkonedog","7","2","2","8 March 2017"," More Human Interest Than Football
","I made the decision to watch this film for two reasons: One, because I am a football fan, and two, because I like film dramas. Though I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommended to anyone, it focuses much more on the ""human drama"" angle and very little on the actual football.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Blind Side"" tells the story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), who is adopted by Leigh Anne & Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock; Tim McGraw) and given a respite from life in ""the projects"". A giant of a boy, Michael shows an aptitude for football, learning, and family values under the guidance of the Tuohys, and eventually obtains both a college education and a shot at football's biggest stage--the NFL.<br/><br/>Because this is a movie based on a true story, it is tough to know how much of it is actually true. As a sports fan who closely follows the NFL, I know that Mr. Oher himself is uncomfortable talking about the film (or, more specifically, his portrayal in it), so perhaps some liberties were indeed taken to make for a juicier storyline.<br/><br/>That being said, this production (for better or worse) is a strong, emotional, human-interest drama that will both warm your heart and make you think. Though the basic concepts and characters are ""vanilla"" enough for even younger children to grasp, the more over-arching themes can easily be picked out by adults and thought upon. The acting also helps accomplish this goal, as the entire cast shines in their respective roles.<br/><br/>About the only thing that prevents me from giving this film the full five stars is that I felt it could have devoted a bit more time to the ""football side"" of things (ala the Michael Lewis book). If done correctly, this movie could have been a sort of ""Social Network"", but for the NFL. Instead, to create a more family-friendly film, the production eschews all but a few mentions of actual football.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a charming film that is appropriate for anyone. Though not quite ""gritty"" enough to be an outright classic, there is something to be said for its saccharine approach to film- making. View with confidence knowing that you won't be looking at your watch throughout or shaking your head at the end."

","The Blind Side Movie Review<br/><br/>The story of Michael Oher and his adoptive family led to one of the greatest movies of the decade, and one of the best I have ever seen. Between the phenomenal true story, the emotion, and the amazing cast, it was almost impossible to not fall in love with this movie.<br/><br/>Michael is a poor black boy from the hood, while the Touhy's are a rich white family from the suburbs of Memphis. The Touhy family is driving home one night and see Michael walking around with nowhere to go. They generously give up their home for the night but little do they know they will instantly fall in love with this boy and take him in as one of their own kids. Throughout the movie the Touhy's give Michael a home, and education, and a love for football. Michael's life is changed instantly for the better. All because one family forgot about race and took in a boy in need. <br/><br/>The story line is the most important part in any movie, and in ""The Blind Side"", the story is everything. The fact that this is a true story is what really makes it special for me. The director John Lee Hancock did an outstanding job of recreating Michael Oher's life and making such an emotional movie out of it. Seeing Michael's transition academically and athletically all because the Touhy family gave him a home is truly inspirational.<br/><br/>To go with the great story, John Lee Hancock needed an excellent cast to help sell the story, and he got that with award winning actress in Sandra Bullock. Sandra Bullock is arguably the heart and soul of this movie. She plays her role with such a passion that it is hard to believe that she isn't actually the mother of Michael Oher. This is one of the key reasons the story is so believable. Sandra Bullock did an amazing job being a mother in this movie and showing true compassion for Michael's Character. The whole supporting cast was great, and showed a true family bond, but Sandra Bullock is really the main factor in the movie that makes the love so believable. <br/><br/>This movie is very diverse in emotion. From the first moment Mrs. Touhy meets Michael we can feel the love and compassion she has for him. But at the same time the opposing football players have so much hate for Michael just because of the color of his skin. The fact that the Touhy's were the only ones who accepted Michael is very inspiring. They never thought twice about what they were doing, they just did what they hoped anybody else would do. It is nearly impossible to not be moved by this movie and its emotion. The way Mrs. Touhy treated Michael like one of her own kids made me fall in love with the story the first time I watched it. <br/><br/>""The Blind Side"" is a great movie that is perfect for those of all ages. John Lee Hancock did an amazing job turning this true story into a masterpiece. This is not only a heartwarming story about a family who took in a child in need, it is a story about a family that changed a man's life."

By providing, one act of kindness in someone's life forever. In the movie, he's an oversized teenager from the inner city of Memphis. With his potential in football, an upscale private Christian school football coach (Ray McKinnon) took a leap of faith and was able to get into the school. There were many doubts from teachers in the school due to his grade point average, which was a dreadful 0.6. Michael was very intimidated by his new surroundings, majority white and wealthy students S.J. Tuohy (Jae Head) befriends Michael at school, and Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw) see his roaming the streets on a cold and rainy night. They take him in for the night, which turns in a week then finally, adoption. By living with the Tuohy's, gives a sense of comfort and trust away from crime and poverty. With help from S.J. and Leigh Anne, they help him find his killer instinct in football. Before then, he was just a gentle giant and lacked the football skills. Tuohy's hire Miss Sue, (Kathy Bates) to help Michael with his school work. Leigh Anne tells the coach about Michael scoring high in protective instincts, which causes him to protect his team, as well as his family. Leigh Ann helps Michael by providing a mental picture that his quarterback and running back are his family and must protect them. <br/><br/>Michael surpasses any struggles that are against him, in the classroom and on the football field. By breaking free from the environment that surrounded him early in the film, he can exceed in life. The close- up angles in some of the scenes, want to show the anger or happiness depending on the part of the film. I like how the movie focuses on the relationship between humans and look beyond the color of skin. Lighting throughout the movie was great, especially on the football field. It shows depth in the movie and helps provide focus on the main character of the movie. I believe protective instincts is a continuous them throughout the film. An example of the protective instincts is when Michael and S.J. were riding in the truck and the big truck backed out inform of them. Michael first instinct was to protect his family before himself. Everyone needs protection in life, not just a quarterback but even the biggest of giants. This in the case of Michael."

During a scene of the film, Leigh Anne gives pointers to the coach about Michael scoring high in protective instincts, which causes him to protect his team, as well as his family.

The close-up angles used in the film, with a focus on the face, shows the definition of hurt and sadness in their eyes. The movie Miracle has a relevant theme as The Blind Side. Michael holds true to the morals and beliefs that are effective and profound of a perceptive individual. All through the movie, Michael exceeds the circumstances once against him. Equally, on and off the football field the environments that envelop him no longer surround him. The ability to exceed negative environments proves that people do not have to be restricted by the settings that frame them."

","Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron, is a homeless teen until he meets Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Sean (Tim McGraw) and they take him into their home as one of their own. Michael is a seventeen year old, with a drug addicted mom and no known father, therefore he was in foster care, however he kept running away with nowhere to call home. Leigh Anne finds Michael and realizes he has no place to call home, she takes him in to become a part of her family which consists of Leigh Ann and Sean's children, Collins (Lily Collins) and SJ (Jae Head). While the Tuohy's are helping Michael is in turn helping them make transformations of their own. As Michael, becomes a part of the family, he runs into new obstacles. Michael struggles in his new school, with grades and on the field. Michael struggles with his grades, having a low grade point average, however Coach Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon) know Michael is an asset on the field. Leigh Anne learns Michael has low grades scores, however he is 98th percentile for his protective instincts and she decides to use this to help him on the field. However in order to be able to play for the school, the Tuohy's hire Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) to tutor Michael in his studies, to bring his grade point up to at least a 2.5. Miss Sue gives Michael a pep talk to help him understand she will get him to the grades he needs to play. During this scene, you see the close-ups on Miss Sue and Michael as they are talking, with darker lighting to make the scene more dramatic. It comes time for Michael to decide on the college he wants to attend, while it seems, many including Miss Sue are trying to influence him on what college to attend, with Miss Sue and the Tuohy's Alma mater, Ole Miss. Michael decides Ole Miss and then the investigation ensues about the Tuohy's motives to influence Michael. Michael is called in to talk to the investigators and defends the Tuohy's without question, while Leigh Anne is waiting outside. Michael is finished with his interview and walks outside to Leigh Ann. In this scene, you will see they are using the two person camera angle to bring dramatics to the scene, where you see Leigh Anne asking Michael, what school he wanted to go as she realized no one had actually asked him. Michael went from being a homeless teen, to having a family who cared as much about Michael as he did them. He struggled through his studies to go to Ole Miss and becoming a professional football player being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens as a first round pick in 2009."

"courtneyr90","9","2","2","14 December 2015"," Film Appreciation
","The Blind Side directed by John Lee Hancock is a film based off of a true story of the famous NFL football player Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron. The plot of this film is about a young underprivileged black boy that has an amazing talent playing football, but is extremely uneducated. He ends up going to a school where, the Tuohy's, a wealthy white Christian family take him in and become his legal guardians. Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) her husband Sean (Tim McGraw) and their family face many challenges with adopting Michael. <br/><br/>Throughout this movie Michael and the Tuohy's are faced with many different obstacles, from social acceptance to overcoming emotional hardships. From watching this film a common theme has presented itself through the storyline. The main theme in this movie would be to not judge a book by its cover. <br/><br/>The first major indicator of the theme in this film would be Michael being judged from his appearance that he is good at sports. Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon) pushes for Michael's application to be accepted into Wingate Christian School because he assumes because of Michael's appearance he will be good at sports. While Michael has the physical ability to play the sports, he lacks the emotional and mental ability. Throughout this film Michael is coached to become a better football player. <br/><br/>A second indicator of the theme in this film would be Michael being judged from all of his teachers in the school. They assume that he is worthless and unable to learn because he hasn't had a stable upbringing to where he had the opportunity to become educated. One of the instructors Mrs. Boswell (Kim Dickens) can see the potential in him, so she works closely with him to get his grades up to be able to play sports in school. <br/><br/>Lastly Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy being accused of taking Michael in for their own benefits. On the outside it may seem like they took him in to build him up to be a good football player to benefit their college, but throughout the film it shows the emotional bond that the Tuohy's and Michael have created. From an outside perspective it may look like the Touhy's adopted Michael for their personal gain, but the film shows the whole story of the emotional bond that they have created. <br/><br/>In this film there are a few techniques that contribute to the theme. The first being when Burt is talking to the man that brought Michael to the school there are parallel cuts between that conversation and Michael playing basketball. This gives the viewer the indication that Michael is good at sports and that he will fit in at Wingate. Going back to the theme this scene strongly identifies with the theme that you can't judge a book by its cover. <br/><br/>A second indication of the theme through techniques would be in the scene that Michael is being interrogated by Investigator Granger (Sharon Morris). The technique that is being used in this scene would be the high angle shots and low angle shots. In the clips with Michael it was filmed with high angle shots and Investigator Granger was filmed with low angle shots. The high angle shot dwarfs Michael and makes him appear smaller and more like a victim, while the low angle shot makes Investigator Granger seem larger and extremely intimidating. In this scene she is trying to bully Michael into saying that the Tuohy's adopted him for their benefits, which ties back into the theme that you can't judge a book by its cover. Overall this movie is a good film with a strong theme. <br/><br/>I would recommend to watch if you like sports movies with a little more emotion behind them, such as Remember the Titans. Judging a book by its cover is very strong in both of these films and it is prominent throughout the films."

","The story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman (Sandy Bullock) and her family.<br/><br/>The highlight of this film is the scene with S.J. serving as Michael's manager. That is pretty humorous, even if it is probably not close to accurate. (Heck, most of the movie is probably not accurate.) I watched this to check it off as a 2010 Oscar winner. Did Bullock deserve the award? Maybe, but all she really does is talk with a bad accent. We also get an interesting story about race, racism, and stark class differences. The message is not blunt, but maybe that is clever in a way... viewers can take away the message they want to take."

","he Blind Side is the 2009 biographical drama that examines the relationship between a wealthy socialite named Leigh Ann Tuohy and a homeless teenager named Michael Oher, who would eventually go on to a successful career in college football and eventually would be the 2009 round one draft pick by the Baltimore Ravens. <br/><br/>The film is supposed to be about the relationship between these two central characters; however, their relationship is not the primary focus of the film, as it should be, which is the main reason the film doesn't really work as it should.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for Outstanding Lead Actress for her performance as Leigh Ann, a strong-willed matriarch with a heart as big as all outdoors who sees Michael walking on a deserted road in the rain one night and, upon learning he has no place to stay, decides to take him in and it is the slow burn of the relationship between Leigh Ann and Michael that is supposed to be the heart of this story; unfortunately, I found the relationship that develops between Michael and Leigh Ann's son, SJ, a lot more compelling than his relationship with Leigh Ann.<br/><br/>I also think the film loses points for trying to encompass a little too much. The film begins to veer off track as we watch Leigh Ann being mocked by her high society girlfriends and watch Michael being tracked down by the NAACP when Leigh Ann's motives for helping Michael come into question. Writer director John Lee Hancock should have kept the focus of his screenplay where it seems to belong...on Leigh Ann's dedication to helping Michael carve out a new life for himself via a career in college football. Despite the fact that the basis of her inspiration for him lies in some kind of test he took where he allegedly made high scores in the category of ""protective instincts."" I went to high school and college and don't remember ever having taken any kind of test regarding ""protective instincts"", though it does provide the impetus for one of Bullock's best moments in the film, where she interrupts Michael's troublesome football practice by offering familial analogies to help Michael do what he has to do on that field.<br/><br/>The fact that this story is based on real people and events also had me questioning certain parts of the story and their credibility, which easily could have been glossed over or altered for the sake of a more entertaining story. I find it a little hard to believe that Leigh Ann's husband and family were so immediately accepting of Leigh Ann's decision to bring this stranger into their home. I also found it troubling that before beginning proceedings to become Michael's legal guardian that Leigh Ann actually went to Michael's crack-addicted mother to let the woman know what her plans were and the fact that Leigh Ann wasn't troubled by the fact that the woman wasn't terribly upset by the news was also troubling.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock gives a solid performance as Leigh Ann and I understand to a point why she won the Oscar...it was her turn I guess, but personally, I think Bullock has done better work. For the record though, I LOVE Bullock as a blonde. <br/><br/>Country singer Tim McGraw charms as Leigh Ann's wealthy husband, who just seems to go along with everything Leigh Ann wants a little too easily and I find it hard to believe that the real Sean Tuohy was as easy going about this whole thing as the character in the movie is. Quinton Aaron is refreshingly natural as Michael as is Jae Head as young SJ. Mention should also be made of a very entertaining performance by Ray McKinnon as Michael's high school football coach, who is initially baffled by Michael but loved taking credit for everything he did.<br/><br/>John Lee Hancock had a very Oscar-baity story here that he is only partially successful in presenting. Despite problems in story construction and improper focus on character relationships, the film is worth checking out, but it is not everything that it has been made out to be."
"ajs-10","6","2","2","9 April 2011"," Better than expected...
","This film was nominated for the best picture Oscar in 2010, it didn't win, but Sandra Bullock did pick up the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role. Given all this recognition I decided I'd better see what all the fuss was about. I have to say that, as a Brit, I and don't really follow any American sports which it made it a little hard to follow in places, but I expected that. I've seen the Super Bowl on TV and have seen films such as 'Any Given Sunday' which have given me a bit of an insight into the game and the attention it gets over there. Having said that, the film isn't all about American Football, it's more about relationships and how helping out a fellow human being can bring something good. Oh, and it's based on a true story. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please block that guy trying to sneak around the sideline while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>Michael 'Big Mike' Oher has had it rough all his life, his mother is a crack addict, his father has disappeared, but he has one thing in his favour, he's big really big. More by luck than design, he gets enrolled into a predominantly white Christian school. His teachers don't really hold out much hope for him since he seems disinterested in classes, but one teacher, Mrs. Boswell, discovers he is maybe not as dumb as they first thought. He is befriended by young S.J. Tuohy, the son of Leigh Ann and Sean Tuohy. Recognising that Michael has nobody to look after him, Leigh Ann decides to take him in. Eventually his grades improve and he is allowed to play sports. He is, not surprisingly chosen for the Football team. After a stuttering start, and a bit of coaching from Leigh Ann and S.J., he finally gets the hang of the game and from here, as they say, the rest is history. I'll leave my summary here so as not to infringe those NFL Spoiler Police.<br/><br/>This is a very heart-warming film that will appeal to the North American audience more than most of the rest of the world. I found it to be very well made with a few good performances. As far as that goes, I thought Sandra Bullock was good as Leigh Ann Tuohy, but Oscar worthy? I'll let you decide. Tim McGraw did a fair job as Sean Tuohy and I thought Quinton Aaron played the understated Michael Oher very well. Jae Head reminded me a little of a young Macaulay Culkin as S.J. Tuohy and Lily Collins was OK as Collins Tuohy (the daughter). Honourable mentions go to Ray McKinnon as Coach Burt Cotton, Kim Dickens as Mrs. Boswell and there was a nice cameo from Kathy Bates as Miss Sue.<br/><br/>So we have a very rich family taking in a young black boy who happens to be an athlete. The cynical among us would instantly put this back on the shelf and leave it there, but I found it surprisingly better than I first thought it would be. Mainly due to the understated performance of Quinton Aaron, his performance really made the story work (for me). Contrast that with the outgoing and boisterous S.J. and it's a combination that really works. The scenes where this pair is on screen really stand out. Over all, I found it a little too long and a little too schmaltzy for my taste, but worth one viewing Recommended, for the one viewing only then you can move on.<br/><br/>My Score: 6.4/10"

","Initially this film was not really on my list to see of the Oscar nominee best pictures. Why? Not a big fan of Sandra Bullock and kind of thought this might be a maudlin, sentimental, schmaltzy Disney kind of flick. Okay it was not overly maudlin or sentimental but the schmaltz came out and a Disney kind of flick it was.<br/><br/>So what was wrong. First what was right. Yes the story was uplifting. Never knew about Michael Oher but his story was an inspiration. But so was the film Precious where while Precious wasn't homeless her story was just as uplifting and her background just as difficult. And Quinton Aaron did a good job with the part. May have even got it right.<br/><br/>But folks come on. This ain't Father Knows Best or Leave it to Beaver. But it felt like it. We felt like we had been dumped into some 60's sitcom where all the family was just perfect. There was no tension, no grit to this film. Everyone was darned near just nice. Even the daughter who clearly was a bit out of joint acted as if she was just in a nice sitcom where everyone makes nice. And the younger brother - well he just became annoying. The father played by C&W star Tim McGraw - this guy is clearly a lightweight. The love scene between McGraw and Sandra was laughable. <br/><br/>Even the tension scenes such as when Sandra had to confront her Republican matron lunch-mates and their racism was like something - well we don't want to make this real serious or anything. Closest otherwise we came to tension was just after Michael left the NCAA lady and confronted with Sandra and during his visit back to the projects and wound up smashing a few heads. Even Kathy Bates was just too nice (I am a Democrat she says). Wow these Republicans live in a Disney world. They really do.<br/><br/>Finally Sandra Bullock. Okay Sandra you weren't bad - but Best Actress? The Razzies probably got it right the night before when they gave her a Razzie for ""All about Steve"". What an accomplishment - a Razzie and an Oscar all in the same year. I guess the other nominees couldn't cut it. But I gave high marks to the girl that played Precious but I guess giving it to a 200 pound plus black girl who actually played a gritty role wasn't on the agenda when you could give it to Sandra who I suspect played herself. Tough Republican Mom with a heart of Gold.<br/><br/>And Best Picture??? Well I guess they needed a feel good filler. And feel good filler is about all this was. 6 out of 10 which is probably about right.<br/><br/>Dchap"

Michael joins the Crusaders and distinguishes in the championship, being invited to join several universities. However he needs get better grades to join Ole Miss where Leigh Anne and Sean had studied and are sponsors. Leigh Anne hires Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) to work as tutor, giving private classes to Michael to improve his grades and be successful in life.<br/><br/>""The Blind Side"" is the wonderful heartwarming true story of a lonely homeless teenager that moves to the house of a Caucasion Christian family that follows the principles of their religion helping the others. The screenplay is magnificent and the top-notch performance of Sandra Bullock is helped by the powerful and enlightened character Leigh Anne and the stunning chemistry with Tim McGraw. This uplifting movie is highly recommended to make the viewer believe that still there are good people in this wild world and a great family entertainment.

","Appalling Best Picture nominee is a combination After School Special and Hallmark Presentation. The Blind Side is based on a tried and true Hollywood formula and is not remotely convincing. Bullock's Leigh Anne, like Norma and Erin, is a feisty Southerner who succeeds with spunk and one-liners, and like Sally Field and Julia Roberts, Bullock won an Oscar;undeserved IMHO, she's perfunctory, the role is a series of quips, and Leigh Anne is less interesting and detailed than either Norma Rae or Erin Brockovich. It's a feel good film, and of course it's satisfying to watch the indomitable Leigh Anne go toe-to-toe with bureaucrats, dubious friends, coaches and homeboys from the projects. Her weapon:zingers. The film is painless at first but it soon lags becomes ridiculous and finally a series smirks from the annoying SJ. Typically, the car accident involving SJ and Big Mike like much of the film is seen coming and like all situations in the film it turns out miraculously well. Bullock's Golden Globe win was in the drama category, but her performance is largely comedic."

","What is wrong with American Cinema lately? In the old days there would have been drama, passion and suspense in a story like this, today its just goodness all around. That probably makes for a better world, but sadly enough adds up to a rather boring night at the movies. This film has nothing to tell, apart from how great the white American upper middle class is, and I find it surprising that even people in America should be interested in such blatant propaganda. So you might argue, that this tells a true story, but if the story had been that dull to begin with, they either should have put some excitement in it or made a film about my next door neighbor, who's done nothing out of the extraordinary, but who's life is by all accounts more interesting than that of Michael Oher, if this film is anything to go by. But what really pisses me off is the thinly disguised racism that seeps in halfway through. So this big, black kid gets adopted by these nice white folks, who never fight, never have any arguments whatsoever. The big black kid wants a driving license, he gets a driving license, and you know what, because our nice rich white family is so generous, they buy him a pick up truck to go along with it. So he takes their little white son for a drive around the block and crashes the car big time, but do our white parents so much as bat an eyelid and feel any resentment against the big black kid. On the contrary, they are apparently very grateful as he selflessly prevented the son from being injured more severely. Surprisingly enough, no one in this family has ever any issues with this traumatized, rather morose black fellow moving in on short notice. In fact, both kids are rather fond of him straight away. Whatever happened to Douglas Sirk? He could have turned this story around. With John Lee Hanncock it's utterly hopeless. There is just no conflict whatsoever. Everyone gets along like a house on fire. Wait, wait, I forgot, there is Michael's mother (black) who comes across as rather irresponsible and Michael's old buddies (black) who are portrayed as violent, lazy and rude. But as Michael doesn't feel any ties to neither of them, everything would be fine, if it wasn't for an investigator form the National Collegiate Athletic Association (black, what a surprise) who suspects that Michael has been forced to chose a certain University for his career as a football pro. Do you care? We neither do I. The more since American Football must be one of the most boring sports and I wish they would stop making films about this folly."

If anything, the film could be seen as a story of how a kind family opened their hearts, to a poor soul in need. This one act enriched the lives of them all.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock was at her absolute best as she lost herself in this role. Kathy Bates delivered as always she is such a pro. The actor Quinton Aaron won my heart after his first five minutes as I teared up looking at him and feeling his utter pain and despair.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with Tim McGraw as a singer but his performance in this film makes me feel he has a future in this profession. <br/><br/>They all delivered and I was so moved by the over-all experience and grateful for a woman called Leigh Anne Touhy.<br/><br/>This movie deserved 10 stars!"
"Quinoa1984","5","9","16","26 February 2010"," nothing to really get too worked up about - not even Bullock can elevate it past its 'safe' quarters
","I'm sure Michael Oher is an inspiring sort of story. In fact his real story, the one glossed over in the film version The Blind Side, is kind of fascinating (unlike in the film, Oher was taken by several families over the years, some black, until winding up with the Twohey's as seen here). That he could make a difference, if only for himself, is a fine feat. But there's something about the movie that is sanitized, kept in the Hollywood bakery to make it fresh for a G-rated mass consumption. It's not even offensive to any great degree, except for the fact that the filmmakers relegate the main character to a secondary kind of role (rather, if he does have any real personality in real life, it's whittled down to make him a cypher, a character that does what he's told and never questions anything - not even why he becomes a football star).<br/><br/>Oh, it has its moments. And Sandra Bullock has that feisty kind of 'All-American-Woman' spirit, the kind that wins Oscars (you know the kind, re: Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich). And her acclaim for the role isn't unearned as she puts a lot of passion and personality into the part, at least as much as the script allows. And Kathy Bates has an amusing if bizarre cameo as the lone DEMOCRAT of the piece (something she mentions like she's sad to be Satan coming through the door). But it's the character of Oher, and the actor playing him, that brings the film down. The film itself has its conventional pleasures and beats, but I couldn't help but feeling they left Oher out to dry, like a symbol of something for white people to rally around. Again, it's never too offensive, and its heart is in the right place (think of it, perhaps, as a sign of burgeoning White Conservative Guilt peeking out as opposed to garden-variety liberal kind).<br/><br/>Yet characters outside of Oher don't bring much to the table either. I would've liked to have seen some other personality come out from, say, the high school football coach, or understand more about where Oher came from aside from the usual 'oh, it's a bad ghetto' thing. It's ultimately neither too stirring as a human saga nor as a sports triumph, but just run of the mill. And yet for another audience, children, it's a fine little piece of fluff (tell me the director wasn't thinking of a children audience during those plucky scenes where the little boy acts like an agent for Oher in front of the college recruiters)."
"Spaceygirl","3","8","14","17 July 2010"," Boring and offensive
","Simplistic, naive, offensive and overlong. The Blind Side offends on so many levels. It's supposed to be about Big Mike Oher who drags himself out of the ghetto and goes on to be a star football player but instead it's about the benevolent White Christian Republican family who takes him in and makes it all happen. Wow. Good on the christians and good on the republicans. Not. The Christian aspect is rammed home at every opportunity and after an hour, begins to grate. The script is peppered with clichés and some of the scenes badly judged. The film is so manipulative and what Sandra Bullock won the Academy Award for, I'll never know. She plays basically the same part she has in previous films. What was the Academy thinking?"

She actually taught art though! And as for the comments about Bullock over-dramatizing Leigh Anne, she didn't! That is how Leigh Anne really is! She is a very outspoken and determined woman. Just FYI. Also, I know some people have been commenting on Quinton Aaron being to quiet and unemotional... but that fits Mike to a T. He is the sweetest guy... always makes a point to say hi to you, etc... But he was very shy and quiet at first.

This is one of those premises that sounds too odd to be true on the page, but once on the screen doesn't go anywhere. Even the last-minute inquiries into the family's motivations for adopting Big Mike prove too little too late. As for Ms. Bullock, even her post-Oscar scandal seems more interesting than this slight narrative. Her performance here screams Kathy Lee Gifford on Lifetime, not Oscar winner. In fact, even Kathy Bates is in low gear here. Only the brilliant Adriane Lennox proves really memorable.

","""The Blind Side"" is a typical ""feel good"" movie with moderately strong religious overtones and very little conflict. There is so little conflict, in fact, that it's hard for the abundance of warm, happy moments to have very much effect. In short, the movie to come off as cheesy and insignificant.<br/><br/>""The Blind Side"" opens with the climax of the movie, which is probably the moment with the most conflict; the only one to piqué my interest to any degree. The opening is vague and makes things seem much more serious than they really are. Then the movie flashes back to the beginning of the story it has to tell.<br/><br/>Michael Oher is a bastard son, born to a crack-addicted mother, living with the father of his friend. He sleeps on the couch and has never had a bed to himself. Sounds tragic, but don't expect the filmmakers to really show you this. Michael's caretaker is a mechanic and convinces a Christian private school to accept Michael and his son into the school. He talks to the coach and convinces him to push for Michael's acceptance based on a one on one game of basketball that he was playing with the mechanic's son. And for some reason this game convinced the coach that Michael would be good for the football team. I never got that.<br/><br/>After this no more is really heard of the mechanic or his son. The son gets accepted but not even Michael is seen socializing with him. They both just disappear. This is so that Michael Oher seems to be the only black student at the school, but it left me with a lot of questions. <br/><br/>Michael's crack-head mother lives in a ghetto run by gangs in middle Tennessee. Very little is shown of this ghetto and the gang and of Michael's mother. These were some of the moments where there was a lot of potential for strong and meaningful content but everything was glossed over. There could not have been four or five scenes in the ghetto and all of them were less than 5 minutes in length. The focus if the entire movie was the warm happy-go-lucky family moments where the good-Christian white family accepts a poor, uneducated black kid into their home and as a member of the family. Why should I care about this un-dynamic and trite situation. Even if it is based on a true story, it's all been seen before.<br/><br/>The acting ranged from terrible to mediocre to decent. The worst was Sandra Bullock's son and the best was her husband (sorry I'm terrible with names) who felt the most natural. The film focused on Sandra Bullock, but I wasn't convinced by her character as a southern, high-energy republican. The actor who played Michael Oher was flat, but at least it was hard to tell because he had very few lines.<br/><br/>The Christian over-tones at the start of the film urged the most resistance from me, but I realized that just because I'm atheist, does not mean the director and writers are too and eventually grew used to it, even though I'll still always find it cheesy. <br/><br/>I could have liked this movie, if it was more dynamic, but this lacking element caused the story telling to be weak and left little room for any of the actors to shine. It was ""meh""."

Some have said in the message boards that they are angered about the previews that don't say starring ""Quinton Aaron"". And of course the word this is supposed to be prejudice because he is black? Well what about in Tyler Perrys movie. I Can Do Bad All By Myself, not once did his previews highlight Adam Rodriguez, but hem did highlight all of the black characters in his preview...so lets just call him a racist against whites! Its funny how when the shoe is on the other foot its a problem. This family should be praised for the generosity that the showed, Sandra Bullocks character LeighAnn, in my opinion truly displayed a sincere love for this boy. And no this film is not about stereo types but it is how things really are in the world today. There is no reason for anyone to have had 13 children that the state has to support. So the Tuhoys should be praised for what they did for Michael instead of criticized for being wealth and white. The family and the story is truly an inspiration."
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","2","5","8","10 January 2012"," Just not very good.
","I didn't think this was as offensively bad some do, but it certainly wasn't any good. A lot of people cried foul at the ""white woman saves the day!"" aspect, but since it's a true story I didn't mind it too much. What I did mind was the lack of realism in a lot of it. Not only did they change the facts to make it seem like Oher was this doofus nobody who was taught everything about football by Leigh Anne Tuohy, but scenes like the one where she went into the projects on her own just felt so cheap and artificial. I don't know, a lot of the scenes with Tuohy felt like the writer was just sitting behind his computer writing it thinking, ""Damn that bitch is sassy!"".<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock doesn't really help matters, but I was surprised by her restraint in a lot of scenes. When I first heard that awful accent in the opening monologue I shuttered at the idea of spending two hours with it, but was surprised to find her not very grating. Actually, she ended up feeling more flat than anything else, as did a lot of this film. It wasn't a brutal watch by any means, but everything was really brought down to it's lowest denominator and turned into this dry, vanilla TV movie. It also features what has to be some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard. A project gangster actually says the line, ""I'll bust a cap in your fat ass."" What."
"letew0203-634-606627","6","5","8","13 January 2010"," Okay...
","I think that this movie was pretty good as far as real-life sports stories go. This was an interesting roll for Sandra Bullock who normally goes for the comedic roles and I think that she pulled it off pretty well. The story itself just draws in the viewer and the presentation is funny, emotional, and heartwarming at the same time. One thing that I did not like however, was that the film focused more on the mother (Leigh Anne Tuohy) than the boy she was helping out (Michael Oher). Like every movie that is 'based on a true story' you could also tell that it was largely exaggerated at some points, but overall it was a good movie."

","A truly enjoyable and extremely moving film that I would definitely watch again.<br/><br/>From start to finish I was hooked, every character was wonderfully portrayed, the script was excellent and it could be one of the most heart-warming films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock displays a wonderful performance, starring as a wealthy 'redneck' type, who befriends a mysterious teenager from a troubled background and invites him into her family home. Along side her family she tries to 'unpeel the onion' and discover 'Big Mikes' roots and the reason for his behaviour. <br/><br/>The entire cast are wonderful, even the kids are amazing actors and really brought the characters to life. So much so that you feel almost as if you are a member of that very family. <br/><br/>Several times throughout this film I was brought to tears, ""Big Mike"" is one of the most tragic yet lovable characters I have ever seen in a film and seeing him bonding with a mother figure for the first time was captured in a very beautiful way. Kudos to the filmmakers for making something so truly special.<br/><br/>Their were a couple of scenes that went on for a little too long, but I think without them it wouldn't have portrayed the emotions of the scenes correctly. Everything happened for a reason, which many filmmakers forget these days!<br/><br/>I've read some reviews on here that accuse this movie of being racist, but look at what I wrote above, doesn't that sound beautiful to you? Race is not relevant in such a moving tale. (Plus in the end she ditches her racist friends...) Other reviews stated this was just a made-for-TV movie that made it to cinema. Well if that's the case TV-movies are my favourite thing!"
"thornethomas707","10","3","4","4 July 2016"," This movie was amazing!
","I'll first start off by saying this movie was fantastic in every way. The acting was superb by everyone. When the movie first came to theatres I was really intrigued by the story because I've been a huge NFL Fan most of my life. I didn't know who Michael Oher was though going into the movie but that probably was because he was part of the 2009 NFL Draft which was the same year the movie came out... Anyways I was very excited to see it. Now the only thing I wasn't sure on is if Tim McGraw would do right by such a Interesting and intriguing story because I thought he might ruin it since he was a country singer and not an actor but I was so wrong! Tim McGraw was Fantastic as Sean Tuohy. He played such a fantastic father who was super nice and very easy going, he was great! <br/><br/>The Movie was so upsetting in many ways but overall it was such a motivating and positive story! At the end you can't help but have a huge smile on your face. What makes it so spectacular to me anyways was that it's a true story. This huge but very shy and kind young man who seems to have no hope in life randomly runs into these kind strangers who are the parents of some kids that go to the school he was attending. They take him in for the night realizing he has no place to sleep. Leigh Anne Tuohy sees that he is such a kind young man that she asks him to stay for Thanksgiving and from there starts to love him like her own child. They let him live with them and from there amazing things start to happen for Michael Oher. <br/><br/>I can't Say enough about how much I love this film it's just amazing. I recommend it to anyone who feels lost in life or for anyone who needs a little motivation. It shows us that no matter what hand we are dealt in life we have the opportunity to come out on top!! :)"
"Jackpollins","3","12","25","20 December 2009"," Totally uninvolving
","I may sound like a loner, but going into the new drama The Blind Side, I had no idea who Michael Oher was. That's why I did not know what to expect. It was an overused premise, but the trailers looked kind of promise. Unfortunately, the film is an uninvolving, soggy mess from start to finish. The main problem is that they did not focus on the character of Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron, who's good in the little screen time he gets.) Instead, they focus on the character of Leigh Anne Tuohy (played by Sandra Bullock, who's annoying in the ludicrous amount of screen time she gets.) The film felt like it was a good star vehicle for Sandra Bullock, but they're dead wrong. The film should of been the Michael Oher story, not the Leigh Anne Tuohy story. The film also feels too old-fashioned for its own good. It feels like I was watching stock footage from the 1930s. The cast, besides Aaron, doesn't feel like they're trying at all. The character of S.J., the son of Leigh Anne and new found friend of Michael is a good character, but newcomer Jae Head who plays him feels like he knows he's in a bad movie, so he stopped trying. As for Tim McGraw and Lily Collins as Leanne's husband and daughter Sean and Collins, they're both seemingly talented people stuck in lame roles in a lame movie. On second thought, that's everyone in the movie."

When this same coach stupidly calls sophisticated passing plays when he should be calling jam-it-down-their-throats running plays, who steps in? -- White Woman!

Suffice to say the longer you sit through this mess (and long you will sit through many sports montages which would have felt clichéd back in the late 80s) the more offended you should be no matter what your demographic categories you mark on your U.S. Census form. Professional football where careers last approximately 3 or 4 seasons on average and only lucky players are able to walk without pain between their ""retirement"" and their often premature deaths is held out as the only form of success for African-Americans born on the wrong side of Memphis. The white men in the film played with that ""yes, of course, honey"" slack-jawed sitcom Dad cowering perpetuates a burgeoning stereotype of its own. Finally, white woman should be offended that the comely Sandra Bullock won the Academy Award for dressing up and doing something of a southern accent over the less attractive but exceedingly more difficult role of Julia Child that Meryl Streep absolutely nailed in ""Julie & Julia"". I hated this movie."
"filmbantha","6","4","6","13 March 2010"," Two Oscar nominations? Really??
","I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of sports movies, however, the past couple of years has seen great films such as Invictus and The Wrestler, both showing how sports can be an integral part of a captivating story, and reigniting my passion for older classics such as Rocky and The Hustler. Unfortunately, The Blind Side fails to compete with any of these films, despite being based on true events and receiving two (undeserved) Oscar nominations. Following the journey of a neglected teenager who learns the true values of friendship and family, whilst playing some American Football on the way, this is a film riddled with clichés and fairly average performances - I cannot comprehend how Sandra Bullock won the Best Actress nomination - that somehow manages to entertain despite these problems.<br/><br/>We have all seen film like these before, and The Blind Side brings nothing new to the table. Michael Oher, the young boy in question, is a homeless teenager with a troubled past who is kindly taken in by the Touhy family, where he soon becomes one of the family. Although he shows no talent for football, his size means that Michael is soon singled out to be the team's blocker, and eventually learns that his team are his family and he must care for them just like he cares for the Touhy family.<br/><br/>I can see many people enjoying this film; it's an easy watch, suitable for all ages and delivers a message, but to me, this is its downfall. My favourite movies tend to be edgy, controversial films that offer something original whereas the only positive way I can describe The Blind Side is to say that it was pleasant.<br/><br/>I wasn't bored, but I certainly wasn't entertained either. No doubt the huge publicity surrounding the film since the Oscar winners were announced will guarantee its success but I still can't imagine that it will inspire British children to grab an American football and hit the fields when its released on March 26th.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>If you liked this film you will also enjoy these:<br/><br/>Invictus, Dead Poet's Society, The Pursuit Of Happiness, Stand And Deliver"
"secondtake","6","4","6","27 February 2010"," Inspiring and inspired twice: Bullock, and Bullock's character. It's her movie.
","The Blind Side (2009)<br/><br/>I managed to see this in the theater, and I think this always helps a movie through its so-so aspects. But it also magnified the really spot-on characterization of a tough, big-hearted, fast thinking southern cliché of a woman (a white woman in this case, Leigh Anne Tuohy) by Sandra Bullock. She has a compelling if not amazing support cast, appropriately maybe, for this is a kind of finely tuned television scenario, made to Hollywood standards (in the best sense). But I say this because it's true enough to help understand the feel of the film: mainstream, feelgood, well-paced, well-written. Beyond Bullock, the two boys stand out, the big Quinton Aaron and the diminutive Jae Head. And some actual football coaches show up for cameos. It's all pretty fun and at times funny and even at times tearjerky. Not bad for an everyday so-so movie.<br/><br/>The plot is the other lynchpin holding the movie up, but also holding it back. All the personal bravery (however clichéd it looks on the screen), and the crossing of class and race lines, make for good American fodder. I bought into it for two hours. In the long run, it shines light on two pillars of mainstream American society: sports and Christianity, and both glare a little in the light. A little. The big money that drives college sports (and taints it, we presume) and the hypocrisy of ordinary folk who espouse some Christian values and not others (an old theme) are given an honest but very shallow look.<br/><br/>There are scenes that are stretched thin, like the depictions of the projects and poor African-Americans bad mouthing Leigh Anne. But there are other scenes to balance this off that might be just as thin, but which are funny, as when Leigh Anne tells off some of her so-called friends at a restaurant. Low key, acerbic, and justified. Most of all, over and over, however improbable, Leigh Anne Tuohy ""does the right thing."" A curious (and probably painful) counterbalance to Spike Lee's idea of right.<br/><br/>The vibe in the movie review world is that this is a core values, conservative, even (slightly) evangelical film (at least compared to some of the competition). And that's unfair to conservatives, who can't be painted or tarred too easily, and to liberals, who have big hearts of their own now and then. That is: Leigh Anne is a paradigm of someone who is both supremely comfortable, her husband dripping in new wealth, and sharply moral. Her position is not simple. She not just someone who just does good (pulling a black homeless high schooler out of the street and into her white home). She does so with subtle, cunning, unflagging compassion. Yes, she is in a position to do that more easily than most, but she does do it. She is a role model.<br/><br/>And there are those out there who don't like to see role models come from the other side of the aisle, and so a left-leaning saint is a bleeding heart liberal and a conservative saint is a do-gooder. Shame on everyone. See this movie and flinch at its clichés if you want, but settle in to see one performance, by Bullock, that hits just the right notes. She was surprised at how well it has been received, so you may as well be, too."

","Whatever the real story behind the film story of this movie (i.e., upper middle-class white family taking in and propelling a poor - but physically massive - black youth to football success) I didn't especially care for the film. One should read the book of the Blind Side to get the real story that sparked this movie.<br/><br/>As for the movie, itself, it seems to be from the same attitude that brought us ""Ozzie and Harriet"", as well as ""Father Knows Best"", on TV in the 50's and early 60's when white people ruled the earth. This current movie, though, is not about those TV families. It's really about the White, Southern, God of high-school football, and if it takes a hulking, disadvantaged black boy to keep that image of God going, then so be it.<br/><br/>For a less romanticized, but more objective, view of disadvantaged black athletes in a white, Christian, school environment you should compare this movie with the classic movie ""Hoop Dreams"" (reviewed in IMDb at: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110057/) <br/><br/>I'm very glad to see Sandra Bullock win awards for her performance in this film, but keep in mind the awards are for her, not for this movie."

Or broke or lazy or some other stereotype, usually, the only thing we are shown as capable of doing is beating people, stealing, abandoning babies, and drugs-all of which describe every black person in this movie- stereotypes. Crap like this subtly implies how useless and dependent black people supposedly are. It is movies like this that set stereotypes that make it harder for us to get respect in accordance to our personal ability/personality. This movie pith me off, and of all the movies that could have gotten an Oscar, the one that insults the dignity of black people everywhere is the one that got it. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive.

Powerful story, excellent top-notch acting, believable situations, real life drama at its finest. A movie to treasure and watch again and again as time goes by.<br/><br/>I have been reading some of the previous posters' opinions. It does not make me happy to say that I feel many did not get the message it conveyed, but rather, chose to adopt the very same stance the Social Services Dept. rep in the movie took, that of openly doubting the motives from the family of helping the boy, and sullying their reputation by slapping ulterior motives to their ""mission"" of aid. If we all thought like that, none of us would do anything for anyone. <br/><br/>I was a recipient of similar aid myself in the past, not once, but several times. Since I have no family, I saw myself in Michael's position, and mentally, I reverted back to those days and the events that transpired then. Let me say I'd be damned if I thought or said such aid came to me with an ulterior motive in mind. Having been there, I understood Mrs. Tuohy's approach. Why would I call this an example of racism, or of a psychopathic lady with an ego problem?<br/><br/>I guess it takes all kinds, but you just go ahead and watch the movie with an open mind without pausing on negatives, and in the end, see how it appears to you. If you think this is an example of racism and hidden interests, fine then. But if you view it like I did, you'll be glad you saw it, and after turning events over in your mind, see how it appeals to your finer senses.<br/><br/>I wrote this, not because I'm expecting anyone to read it (I don't think anyone will go through over 60 prior posting just to get to mine), but just because I wanted to give it a 10, so well deserved, and I wanted to thank Sandra Bullock and the entire cast for such a wonderful story, the kind that can make you believe in life all over again."

From the opening voice-over scene to the real-life pictures in the credits, I thought the movie was extremely well-made and true to the story. I knew bits and pieces of the Michael Oher story, knew about ""The Play"" from the beginning that changed people's views of left tackles, and recognized every real-life coach in the film, and all of them were extremely true-to-life. I've lived in Arkansas my whole life, so Houston Nutt's small part as Razorbacks coach was especially hilarious and spot-on to me, even given his unfriendly departure. I've seen many sports movies in my life, so quite a few times I thought a corny moment was going to happen, but they never happened. More importantly, it was a great movie about a family who did the right thing and a man who devoted himself to being the best he could be, despite his past.<br/><br/>On the same note, my female non-football-loving friend sitting beside me agreed on the greatness of the movie. It's moving, no matter who you are. Black or white, rich or poor, this movie shows you that love and determination can go a long way."

","That is my experience with this misguided film. No problems no struggles, ask and you shall receive whether you earn your success or just handed it for no good reason. This film makes American Idol look like the ""Elvis"" story. Entitlements on steroids. Sandra Bullock's bad accented character has not sense of responsibility for protecting her family but instead becomes a proponent of correcting all of the social injustices of the world singlehandedly. Of course a few Erin Brocken. strategic moves succeed with flying colors.

"blanbrn","8","6","12","5 December 2009"," A feel good real life fairy tale. That's carried by the tough love performance of Sandra Bullock(her best ever)
","""The Blind Side"" is certainly a touching story and what makes it more compelling is it's based on a true story. Even though these miracles only happen in life rarely it did in this case with Michael Oher an orphaned teen who goes on to athletic stardom by getting drafted to the NFL. Yet ""The Blind Side"" is more than a story of a down on his luck kid that rises to fame, it's main showcase is the tough love of Leigh Anne Tuohy(played to perfection by Sandra Bullock her best performance ever)Sandy really steals the show.<br/><br/>Based on the true story of Michael Oher(Quinton Aaron)who's orphaned from a young age by having a runaway day and a drug addicted mother. He's grown up in a life of the hood and projects his only hope and escape is that a family member has contacted and wedged a local Memphis, TN high school(Wingate)to see his potential as this kid is big as a mountain he certainly has the size to be a powerful lineman. Oher enrolls yet he's awkward not well educated in the books and still homeless only by happens chance while walking along a road one night he's spotted by a family. This family happens to be the Tuohys a well to do wealthy conservative republican family who rank as the class of Memphis, TN. It's when the backbone of the clan Leigh Anne(Bullock) says right in front of her two children and husband Sean(nice appearance by Tim McGraw)to pull over and take the boy home as her children have noticed him from school.<br/><br/>The adaptation is tough at first only to narrowly grow as one by one they get to know Michael and Leigh Anne with her good Christian heart decides that the Tuohys will become his newly legally adopted family. Along the way growing pains are expected but never fear with this families resources Michael is educated and learns a lot as his book skills improve. Still Michael is odd showing no interest in girls yet his one to be discovered talent is playing left tackle on the football team. As his power and god given ability is well showcased in the film. Yet all along his desire to do well comes from his new loving family the Tuohys who give him inspiration mostly Leigh Anne who struts her stuff in memorable scenes by telling Michael on the scrimmage field how to block by giving him words of encouragement. Plus Leigh stands up to her elegant and rich snob female friends at dinner who make fun of her for adopting a black boy.<br/><br/>All of this standing tall love and support lead to Michael getting recruited to play college ball at Ole Miss(where the Tuohys went to school). Then after that journey Michael is drafted by The NFL's Baltimore Ravens and he's currently their starting rookie left tackle. Really this film does have a little to much hyperbole and even though it's real and compelling it's a fairy tale story that's slim even though these stories happen they are far and few in between. Still the wild card and film backbone is Sandra Bullock(Sandy is so good with the southern accent) who's near perfect in her portrayal of Mrs. Tuohy who's such a good hearted and nice Christian southern woman. It proves with a strong mother figure who gives tough love, caring, and support a young man can be molded into not only something great but something special and become a grown man. ""The Blind Side"" is hyperbole and a real fairy tale type that showcases a feel good story of a man coming of age by finding out what a loving family brings. And most important It doesn't blind our feelings of tough love as Sandra Bullock's strong and direct southern belle performance proves a mother figure is so important."
"movieguysla","10","6","12","29 November 2009"," Mind the Bullocks
","When I first saw this trailer in the theater, I teared up. Something about it caught my attention right from the start. I know, I'm a sucker for an underdog movie, but I think I was welling up because I knew Sandra Bullock was going to kick major ass in this movie and I was right. (Oh, and she looked hot as hell too!) Let's not beat around the bush, I loved this movie. I had no idea that it was based on a true story until the end when I saw footage of the real Michael Oher. I don't really like sports movies and I am not a huge football fan, but that's not what this movie is about. This movie is about doing what is right even if it's the harder thing to do.<br/><br/>This is the real-life story of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), her husband Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) and their unlikely new ""son"" Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). Leigh Anne is a wealthy southern spit-fire who speaks her mind and knows what she wants. One night when she spots Michael walking in the cold rain without a coat, that's it, from that moment on, Michael's life would never be the same.<br/><br/>Michael's father left when he was just a baby and his mother is a drug addict. Even though he is homeless and wanders from couch to couch, his spirit is never broken. He has the body of a giant and the heart of a lamb. He just needs a chance and thanks to Leigh Anne, he gets it.<br/><br/>The love that Leigh Anne and her family show Michael is honest and real. I especially found the relationship of the children and Michael to be unique. I kept waiting for the cliché scene where the ""legitimate"" children are jealous of Michael and all of the attention that he's getting. Thankfully, that never happened. I think that speaks volumes to what great parents Leigh Anne and Sean were. Their children learned by their example and did not pass judgment on Michael just because he was poor and from the projects.<br/><br/>For me, the major theme in this movie was: What does being a Christian mean? How many good Southern Christians passed by Michael that night when he was walking in the cold? How many people go to church every week and give to the local food banks but would never pull the car over and invite a huge African-American boy into their car and, eventually, into their life? Leigh Anne Tuohy didn't even stop to think that she might be making a mistake until long after she took the young man into her home and tucked him into bed. That's a Christian who talks the talk and walks the walk.<br/><br/>Oh, and who knew the movie would be so funny?! Tim McGraw (who was so believable as the husband that I didn't even recognize him) has some of the funniest lines in the movie. His performance is rock solid and he holds his own next to Bullock's fast and feisty Leigh Anne. Jae Head, who plays the Tuohy's son, steals scenes with his quick wit and enthusiasm. He's a perfect match to Michael's quiet, Ferdinand The Bull energy.<br/><br/>So, could this finally be Sandra's ticket to the Oscars? I can't be sure of that. But I can be sure that this movie was pretty great, even without Bill Murray in it. (Who knew that was possible)."

More like 'astounded', 'flabbergasted', 'dumbfounded', or whatever the right synonym is for the combination of puzzlement and outrage I have after watching it. I mean this movie is BAD! ROTTEN to the core! LOUSY in every way! What absolute and utter dreck! WHO could have possibly thought this travesty of a movie was one of the ten best of the year? Did they think they were nominating for the Razzies?<br/><br/>What's that you say? What about Sandra Bullock? Exactly! WHAT about Sandra Bullock!? That she can take on a role requiring the most meagre of ranges and stay with it for two hours of screen time? Heck, if this had been a play and not a movie, then instead of an Oscar she could have gotten a Tony - a one schtick Tony!<br/><br/>If Sandra Bullock's performance is the apex of one-dimensional acting (I guess that would give her at least one 'point' in her favor - ha ha!), the script must be the highest (and never before climbed) peak in the range of movies that have used back to back to back and back again clichés. As I watched it, I found myself repeatedly saying, ""Oh no, there not going really use that trope, are they?"" But, oh yes, they sure did! And then another. And another . . . Still, I suppose the screenwriters did show some restraint in this respect. I mean they did, after all, manage to resist using the old trick of showing newspaper headlines to announce Michael's initial successes to the audience. Yup, I didn't see one spinning 50-point font headline screaming, ""Big MIke does it again!!"". Not even an ""Oher leads to team to championship!"". But, please note that I said I ""didn't SEE"" anything like that. Full disclosure - it may have happened while I had my eyes closed in an effort to stem another wave of nausea.<br/><br/>And don't even let me get me started on its race, prejudice, and sensitivity 'aspects'. Like I said, this is a movie where each scene is a cliché about to unfold, dissolving into a cliché, and fading out to, guess what. Oh yeah.<br/><br/>Looking for the bottom line? Okay. Remember Battlefield Earth? (I hope not). Well, Battlefield Earth is to The Blind SIde as Citizen Kane is to Manos: The Hands of Fate (and Torgo was no Orson Welles!)"

","I can't think of anything wrong with The Blind Side that warrants comment.<br/><br/>This movie made my 18 year old daughter and I laugh many times.

","My first impression of watching a Sandra Bullock movie was kinda dicey primarily because of her poor choices over the past few years but this was an eye opener for sure. Startling performance from her as a Tough-on-the- core / Soft-inside mom. Quinton Aaron is the gentle giant. There's a certain charm within ladies for big over-sized guys who have a heat of gold and that is exactly what he has portrayed here. Some excellent scenes where he's shown to be emotionally brittle and vulnerable and his guardian (Sandra Bullock) makes him walk through safe. Being an adopted child, there is that inevitable moment of doubt where he tends to break away but the story culminates in the most appropriate and happy way expected. Nothing too amazing or impulsive to look out for. A very subtle tale of a small bunch of people who loved each other selflessly. :)"

There is some - it's Hollywood so you can expect some but there was less than I thought there would be. <br/><br/>***SPOILER*** A few moments do jar, particularly with the Role of Bullock calling in plays for the football team (up tot his point she has displayed little knowledge or interest in the game), calling out her lunch friends on a racial slur or the 'share the credit' ending with the poem inspiring his English essay and the 98 percentile in protective instincts - he sounds like a guard dog."
"colinrgeorge","4","3","5","6 April 2010"," ""The Blind Side""
","I'm no sports fan, so I suppose ""The Blind Side"" was already fighting an uphill battle for my praise. I dislike the film, but not because the characters are interested in things like high school football, college football, and video game football, but because they exist in a world without lasting consequence. That John Lee Hancock, the writer and director, wants to deliver an upbeat, entertaining film proves his Achilles' heel; he omits clear dramatic potential in favor of sitcomy euphemism.<br/><br/>His breezy plot, based on the true story of a Baltimore Ravens defensive lineman, whisks conflict aside for ""Big Mike"" Oher (Quentin Aaron), who lumbers his way from kindly mentor to kindly mentor, without any indication or expression of the hard life he's led. The film unfolds almost serendipitously for the teen, who is enrolled in private schooling, gets taken in by a wealthy southern family, gradually wins over his teachers, receives a brand new truck as a birthday gift, and is on the fast track to play football for ""Ole Miss"" University. In short, it's hard to feel bad for a guy that has so much going for him.<br/><br/>I don't mean to undermine the personal tragedies that the real life Michael Oher endured, but we really never get a visceral sense of that reality in the film. We meet Big Mike well after the majority of his neglect and trauma has occurred, and he really hits a terrific string of luck. He isn't the victim of any direct prejudice in his seemingly all-white southern suburb, and the kindly family that takes him in, led by headstrong matriarch Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), seems to adapt to his disruption of their family dynamic instantaneously. The tiresome thesis of the film is that the Tuohys are just really great people.<br/><br/>This makes for a surface-level heartwarmer, and I suppose audiences shouldn't be ridiculed for appreciating the film on that criteria, but to me, what's missing underneath is all the more apparent for it. Hancock would have done well to introduce us to Big Mike at the gritty bottom: one of twelve children of a crack-addicted mother, in turns homeless, under foster care, and a struggling student in a revolving door of unsupportive schools. Being taken in by the Tuohys would make a better midpoint for Michael's story, and provide a better sense of the dichotomy of his two lives.<br/><br/>If only by narrative necessity, Hancock eventually throws in isolated sequences of hard drama, but which have almost uniformly negligible impact on the story. For example, Big Mike totals his new truck with Leigh Anne's son in the passenger seat--the paramedics show up, they wheel out the stretcher, and it turns out everybody's fine. The following scene plays out as though the crash didn't even happen. Or later on, the NCAA suspects the Tuohys of forcing Ole Miss on Mike after a heated vetting, which leads him to a brief identity crisis (even though he's always been fiercely loyal to his foster parents)--after which he decides he wanted to play there all along.<br/><br/>These internally-resolved conflict blips are so lonely in the cheerful world of the film that they draw attention to themselves by sheer contrast. Admittedly, I prefer Hancock's optimistic storytelling to an excess in melodrama, but it leaves ""The Blind Side"" starkly overlong and unsatisfying. The film depicts the great things that happen to Michael Oher without providing the context that makes them meaningful. Hancock is under the bizarre assumption that Leigh Anne Tuohy is his protagonist, and the film is more a tribute to the family that hosted Big Mike than the man himself.<br/><br/>I'm no sports fan, but you don't need to be one to call Hancock out. ""The Blind Side"" is a bust."
"VegasB18","7","3","5","31 January 2010"," Uplifting But Often Cliché Story
","Based on true events, The Blind Side chronicles the story of Michael Oher, a homeless boy who, as a result of the kindness of a caring woman and her family, becomes an all American football player. Sandra Bullock delivers a performance that's miles away from her typical portrayals (Miss Congeniality, etc.) and with it has positioned herself as an Oscar favorite. The movie, however uplifting and celebratory it is, seems to miss the mark in a few places. It has come to light that Michael Oher is not as dumb as the film makes him out to be. It appears that the filmmakers took some liberty here in order to make the transformation of Oher look more astounding. Also, much of the writing is classic ""feel-good movie"" writing. There are certain lines and plot points that you just know are going to come back around in the story, making it somewhat predictable. I would have liked to see the filmmakers not resort to such cliché dialogue. The movie is entertaining despite it being fairly slow in the beginning. It's not among the year's best but it's worth seeing for those who enjoy a heartwarming story."
"OhMyGreatScott","6","3","5","27 January 2010"," Could Have Been So Much Better
","After hearing all the good things that everyone had to say about ""The Blind Side"" I just had to see it. Honestely, I don't know what all the fuss is about. Besides the fact that Sandra Bullock plays her character very well the rest of the movie just bored me. This movie had so much potential if they would have explored their characters into more depth. Tim Mcgraw is ugly without a hat btw. The best part was when Sandra's character calls the football coach in the middle of the game. She reminded me a lot of my aunt maybe the only reason I found it funny. All in all the movie was okay. Maybe it's just because I don't really like sports. I recommend you see ""Precious"" much better."
"michaelRokeefe","8","4","8","25 March 2010"," Outstanding story. Exceptional movie.
","John Lee Hancock directs and co-writes an amazing story of a homeless teen that finds fame in the NFL. Michael Oher(Quinton Aaron) knew the streets and projects of Memphis quite well when he was noticed by a caring and well-to-do Leigh Anne Tuohy(Sandra Bullock). This is the down-to-life story of Michael, uneducated and aimless, becoming a star in the NFL. Tuohy and her husband Sean(Tim McGraw)take the boy into their home and gives him his first feeling of security and family. Michael grew into a blue-chip football star, even though he didn't really care for the sport at first. Oher a six foot-four, 309 pound offensive tackle was the first-round pick of the Baltimore Ravens in 2009 after being groomed in the sport at Ole Miss. He was assigned the #74, the same he wore with the Rebels. A heart-warming and emotional film too good to be missed. Bullock is nothing but sensational. Very easy to look at coming and going. For Aaron, kudos for showing dedication and conviction in playing his role. In support, veteran actress Kathy Bates plays Oher's tutor. With cameos are football coaches Nick Saban, Tommy Tuberville, Houston Nutt and Lou Holtz. You don't have to have any knowledge of football or even be a sports fan to enjoy THE BLIND SIDE."
"Chris Knipp","7","4","8","31 January 2010"," You can't win
","'The Blind Side' is a feel-good movie about a rich white Nashville, Tennessee family (the husband is a former athletic star and restaurant magnate, the wife an interior decorator with posh city contacts) that rescues a poor orphaned black boy and nurtures him into becoming a great football player. Based on a book by Michael Lewis, the story is substantially true: Michael Oher is a real person who had a crack addict mom and no dad, went through a series of foster homes, had a miserable young life and lousy school record. When the Twohy family took him up, he had gotten into a fancy school by a fluke when the coach saw his athletic potential and got him admitted. It's not just because of his athletic potential, the coach (Ray McKinnon) argued, in the scene of the movie, but just the good thing to do. 'The Blind Side' talks a lot about the good thing to do. The family and a friendly teacher saw he wasn't dumb, and he gradually improved his initially terrible grades and academic performance so he could play. <br/><br/>The real life Michael Oher lived more or less this experience, got good grades after being tutored, went to the University of Mississippi. The NCAA was indeed suspicious, as in the movie, of Michael's choice of Ole Miss, since both his adoptive parents and his tutor were graduates and huge supporters of its football team. That was forgiven and he had a stunning college athletic career paved with trophies and recently got a five-year, $13.8 million contract to play for the Baltimore Ravens.<br/><br/>The movie is about the miraculous blooming of a humble ghetto boy who learned to repress bad experiences and instead of being angry, is protective -- so he eventually becomes great at playing defense. As ""Big Mike"" actor Quinton Aaron is so quiet and recessive even S.J. (Jae Head), the pint-sized, hyper-active ""brother"" in his white adoptive family, runs circles around him as a personality. But the dominant figure is Sandra Bullock as the wife, Leigh Anne Tuohy. Bullock gives a suave performance: she's a walking cliché yet manages to be quite winning. Leigh Anne not only initiates the adoption when the family observes ""Big Mike"" walking along the road from the school in the rain on a cold day with nothing but a shirt on. She even steps onto the football field later to coach the coach, telling him how to marshal the youth's formidable defensive skills.<br/><br/>Critics are much less pleased by this film than Hancock's previous sports drama, 'The Rookie', another true story from a book, that one about a baseball player, who overcomes initial disappointment to become a pro. Dennis Quaid plays the athlete in 'The Rookie,' and the focus is on him and on the game.<br/><br/>The idea of a saintly white woman who saves a po' black boy sticks in the craw of many, whether it's true or not. Melissa Anderson of the 'Village Voice,' who was added to the New York Film Festival jury that chose Lee Daniels' explosive and lurid 'Precious' last year, complained in her review that ""unlike the howling rage of Claireece Precious Jones, Michael. . .is mute, docile, and ever-grateful to the white folks who took him in. . .'Blind Side' the movie peddles the most insidious kind of racism, one in which whiteys are virtuous saviors, coming to the rescue of African-Americans who become superfluous in narratives that are supposed to be about them."" It's hard to deny that 'Precious' the movie certainly focuses in much more detail on Clareece's grim, abusive ghetto existence. It plunges us into that world and rubs our noses in it. Though deeply flawed, 'Precious' is vivid. 'The Blind Side' tells its story conventionally, taking few chances. But 'Precious' is deeply flawed. It's melodramatic and lurid and omits any glimpse of positive aspects of Harlem life. But it's more memorable than 'The Blind Side'.<br/><br/>I'd like to know how the real Michael Oher feels about this movie -- and about his own story, for that matter. If his experiences turned him into a much celebrated pro footballer, how is their story ""the most insidious kind of racism""? If the Touhy family made his success possible with their support, love, and money, are they not indeed ""virtuous saviors""? What is the politically correct way of telling this story?<br/><br/>The advantage of 'The Blind Side' over 'Precious' despite its risking charges of white condescension is that it provides a positive image of helping the disadvantaged in the face of peer disapproval. 'The Blind Side' is about racism: the Tuohys face it from rednecks on the football field and from Leigh Anne's well-heeled lady friends, who chide her for including a giant black youth in the family's Christmas card photo. Or course this is nothing like the danger Michael faces when he returns to his mamma's neighborhood. A prominent black movie critic, Armond White, hates 'Precious.' He calls it ""the con job of the year,"" and says Daniels, Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey, the powerful black media magnates, ""come together at some intersection of race exploitation and opportunism."" 'Precious' is exploitive. The ""crime"" of 'The Blind Side' is that it shows white people helping a black person. However, Leigh Anne tells her bitchy luncheon pals that she's not helping Michael, he's helping her. But that too will be be debunked: the white lady is doing good so she'll feel good. The Touhys had a wonderful time helping Michael Oher become an athletic star: shame on them! In this kind of subject, you just can't do the right thing. The (predominantly white) audience likes 'The Blind Side' just fine. It plays in three times as many theaters as 'Precious' and has made five times as much money."

","My wife and I saw this wonderful movie yesterday. From TV trailers, my wife was more eager than I was to see it. We both thought this was fabulous! Sandra Bullock's character is clearly the star, and, as portrayed, she was clearly the driving force in her family--not that her husband was a nobody, just a bit quieter than she was.<br/><br/>What starts as a sad, dramatic film, quickly moves to being a largely happy one with many, many things that made us laugh. One part that I liked involved the college coaches trying to get Michael to sign with their school saying lines somewhat like the oft-seen Big Ten commercial with all of their coaches.<br/><br/>One reviewer found fault with Michael returning to his old neighborhood when he questioned if he had been used. I think that is what anyone in his position would do. As shown, he wasn't abandoning everything he had achieved, but wanted to talk to his mother.<br/><br/>We thought the role played by Quinton Aaron was played magnificently. It is difficult to act while saying few words and he seemed most believable.<br/><br/>The Tuohy family wasn't doing this as part of some crusade. They sort of fell into helping the young man for one night, and then continued. It wasn't all planned and, although he seemed trustworthy, they did take a risk.<br/><br/>It was refreshing to see a lack of racism on display. The characters were believable, likable--for the most part, and most realistic. The story is truly uplifting. Knowing that it is true makes it much MORE of a great film!"

","This is a white-friendly, feel good film that will bore you unless you're a football addict. And even then you may wonder why it came up on the Academy Award radar screen at all. Except that Bullock is a big money-maker and it serves the industry to praise her. She hits one note in this film and keeps hitting that note. Again and again she hits that one single note, and when you've had enough she hits it some more. Pretty soon she's SO boring. Ultimately she just wears you down. Help! A goose with a good, strong honk could have played that role. I suppose it's sort of fun to watch rich, privileged white people successfully bulldoze their way to the head of the line while poor non-whites have to wait their turn. Oh yes, and we're clearly supposed to rejoice that Bullock's character patronizes a big needy black person, and is short tempered with her racist Republican luncheon companions."

"MovieManChuck","6","2","3","26 July 2018"," Entertaining, but irritatingly soft-to-the-touch
","2.5/4<br/><br/>There is something so undeniably inept about the way The Blind Side is presented. It's an entertaining movie, but it seems to dispel any hard facts, and glide thoughtlessly over big issues. This gives way to a movie that feels like it was carried by its many embellishments and heavily watered-down.<br/><br/>This is based on the true story is of a 17-year-old names Michael Oher. He lives a life devoid of any opportunities. One day, a family takes him in, sends him to a prestigious private school, teaches him how to play football, and ultimately lands him on the Baltimore Ravens. It's a truly great story, but it was told in a very glib manner. It was also told in an arguably degrading way towards its real-life counterpart. In case you didn't know, Michael Oher himself has been vocal about that.<br/><br/>The acting and character interactions were quality, and probably the best aspect of this movie. Sandra Bullock gives a powerful, if not over-acted, female lead. When the characters don't feel like they're putting on an act, they're actually quite charming.<br/><br/>What is left of the movie runs together much in the manner of a train crash for me. The story seems to rushed to give its own merits any attention. The movie glides in-and-out of focus of what it needs to do: shed light on the issues it introduced. While it told a story well, it didn't leave you thinking about the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, The Blind Side is extraordinarily average. It's neither memorable for its football, nor its drama, and it doesn't give a true story a good movie-screen experience. Remember The Titans? I wish."
"maddiekate-49673","9","2","3","16 February 2017"," Great movie about giving help to those who need it.
","If you love inspirational plot lines, small but important twists, innocent humor and elements of racial prejudice, then this is the film for you. However, if you do not tolerate small amounts of tasteful violence, are a young child, or just don't have much of a heart, then this movie probably isn't your cup of tea. So my opinion of this film is that it's a perfect balance of happy and serious to make for a remarkable re-enactment of a true story. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock shows a whole new side to her acting abilities with her spot on southern accent, and heartwarming punctuality. Behind her at first seemingly hard and cold front, you quickly come to realize, is a sweet Christian lady, who has much more empathy than she would ever let on. This film is made even better with the well known faces of Lily Collins and Tim McGraw as part of the Tuohy family. <br/><br/>The inspirational variation of social economic status and racial prejudice adds diversity and relatability to the film. Michael Oher's sad and dangerous past really touches you, and makes LeAnne Tuohy realize that there is a large social gap, and the impacts it can have. Some might say that the film had too much violence, and may have been too intense at parts. But, these scenes were very necessary to feel empathy and emotion towards Michael and others like him, that lived like that. <br/><br/>The beautifully placed humor, and Sandra Bullock and Jae Head's personalities, really made the film. It lightened the mood of the seriousness of many situations, and just made you feel good about what was going on. The look into different social economic situations gives you a feeling of gratitude and privilege, that really makes you feel compassion towards Michael. <br/><br/>Others might feel that the background and buildup to Michael and his football career is slow, and uneventful. But these events build a story in your mind to how Michael lives. It gives you a strong impression of what his life was like, and why his life is like the way it is now. It's an important part of understanding Michael Oher and his sad story. <br/><br/>So I urge you, if you love inspirational stories of football and breaking the social economic status, then you will love this movie. If you like seeing how someone so broken can accomplish so much, then this is for you. Don't waste your time with made up films about aliens, enjoy a very touching and remarkable re-enactment of an edifying true story."

","A huge disappointment, I'd looked forward to seeing The Blind Side due to it being a star vehicle for Sandra Bullock who I adore and the fact she won the Oscar for it. Oh dear! I'll make a point of avoiding any more films by this director. It was simply that it seemed written and acted for children aged about ten, roughly the age of Sandra's little boy in this film. Being English as I am, I had no clue that this was supposed to be a true story till the end credits which made it even more cringeworthy. Even giving this three stars is probably generous but that's based on the fact that I found it mildly entertaining (not realising it was supposed to be a true event) and Sandra Bullock is so gorgeous. The acting, apart from her, is atrocious. The little boy, who apparently was capable of completing adult quality business deals, was quite amusing in the part up to the point I finally realised he was supposed to be real. I watched Mike Myers' Cat in the Hat only yesterday and this was about on a par with it. Enough said."

And still, this movie can deliver all those moments with some very funny laugh spots. I like how Sandra Bullock acted out here, just the right level of accent, facial expressions and body gestures to get into her character. We can see her portraying moments of being affected without having to shed any tear. Tim McGraw and Jae Head gives the needed depth in building the story's crucial points.

","The Blind Side accurately recounts the incredible journey of Michael Oher, who became NFL champion with the Baltimore Ravens since the release of the movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, John Lee Hancock delivers his story in a monotony inversely proportional to Michael's exceptional ascent. The movie turns out to be too bland, too tidy, the script is predictable, pretty shallow, and relies so much on melodramatism that, after more than two hours, it becomes annoying.<br/><br/>What The Blind Side lacks is emotions, and in this sense, other directors, such as Clint Eastwood or maybe Peter Berg, probably would have elevated the level of this feature for which god knows how Sandra Bullock received the Oscar for best actress."

In hard economic times this is the perfect film. It's feel good, has a message about helping people, and has somebody taking on all of life's hardships and coming out on tops. On top of that, Bullock is well cast as a sassy, touch, but still motherly figure. It has bits of humour and plenty of places for emotion. It is aimed at the widest audience possible, which gets in the way of some of the more interesting/ambiguous issues, and there is a sickly ""hooray for white people"" vibe at times, but if it's well made, solid entertainment you are after, you could do a lot worse."

","This might seem to be just a movie that aims to be heart warming and make you feel good about life, but there is achingly more behind the victorious conclusion of this movie and little of it is heart warming. Since the days when men were judged to be good or of little use based on their size, there has been an undercurrent of thinking that sees bigger males as better males, i.e. 5-7 is dumb and 6-5 is smart. It probably comes from when there was little medicine in the past and bigger people were considered better breeding material. If modern Universities promote dumb guys as normal guys when they are really not, we are back in the stone age again. It is already happening, and many Universities are nothing more than conduits for athletes to go pro after graduation and academia counts for little. Some Universities will engage in little smear campaigns against students who are not into things like football and who see through this stuff, down to the hard core it is. Hooray for Sandra Bullock, she has a big heart and no clue about Universities, in that are often very bad paces to be in if you have any brains and don't stand eight feet tall and weigh a thousand pounds. I liked that the young black dude in this film got his life together. Great for him. Given that he could barely read, I think its wonderful that several Universities wanted him so badly. I think maybe Sandra Bullock is not aware of what damage promoting large not bright guys as University material has done to Universities. Football doesn't last forever. This policy in effect sends these guys on a collision course with humanity when they stop playing ball. Great stuff. I never met a large guy with much in the way of brains. And I think there is nothing worse than trying to turn back the clock on more brainy students at University by playing games with them as if it was grade three and Tommy can't throw a football right. Hell Yeh."

","Based on real events this movie tells of a huge black teenage who is basically homeless and he's taken in by a rich white family who are obsessed with sports. This kid is good as sports, but doesn't really know how to play. They encourage him and help him learn football and his size soon makes him a superstar and the guy that all the major colleges want to draft. His poor background makes for his less than average grades in the classroom and the family also get him a tutor and help him with that as well. In the end it all works out and he becomes a legend in football.<br/><br/>OK thats what the story is about, but it has many deeper meanings and touches on so many things. I kept hearing about this movie and just had to see it. It wasn't perfect but it was a nice moving story that showed the innocence of a young man and how he had been neglected and had a troubled youth, yet he didn't have any hate or animosity in his body. He was one to protect and although quite and reserved he was very full of love.<br/><br/>My problems with this movie was race. I understand they had to show the ghetto and lay it on thick as to how his bad upbringing made him this way, but there should have been balance. His black neighborhood was filled with crack-heads and gangsters, but thats the only Africa Americans shown in this film. It was really sad that they shined such a negative shadow over the black community and made the white people out to be saints for saving this kid...I just would have loved some balance, even in the ghetto not all blacks are trash, so don't show it one sided.<br/><br/>I don't like movies that have anything to do with sports either and this movie was football, football, football... I know it had to be, but I am only saying, it's one reason I can't love this film.<br/><br/>The direction was okay but nothing too great, its funny this guy directed other sports film but I found his sports action scenes to be the worst direction of the film. Acting wise, I do not like Sandra Bullock, and by throwing on a bad southern accents and dying her hair blonde she ended up with so much praise...one of her better roles, but she still sucked, in fact she thought she was so bad she wanted to drop out and not ruin the movie...too late, the hero!!! Tim McGraw has no talent for anything so bad choice here with him. I love Kathy Bates, but even she did nothing for me. Quenton Aaron did great as Michael Oher and Jae Head did great as little S.J.<br/><br/>It's a very moving film, but it wasn't great, it is an okay watch, but its just a movie and I would recommend it to drama lovers but not much else. 5/10 stars"

","Quite often films that are up for Oscars are released in Britain around the time of the ceremony, but with the ceremony being a month later I was able to see the film after. Based on the true story, this tells the story of Michael 'Big Mike' Oher (Be Kind Rewind's Quinton Aaron), the neglected African American teenager, who with little education grew up to become a football star. So the film starts when he was young and homeless, and he seems quiet with hardly anyone to rely on, until he is taken in by the Tuohy family: wife/mother Leigh Anne (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Sandra Bullock), husband/father Sean (Tim McGraw), son S.J. (Jae Head) and daughter Collins (Lily Collins). Leigh Anne, after adopting Michael to be part of the family, encourages Michael assuring him that anyone given a chance can accomplish what they want, and his passion for American football is quite significant. As he practises for his big chance, she gives him an idea of how to play the game, knowing he got a high grade in protection, she tells him to think of the opposition as people threatening her family, and it works. Soon enough he is gaining much attention by American football coaches, seeing his footage, of course there is a low point when his education is getting him down, but with the help of home school teacher Miss Sue (Kathy Bates), he does improve. He is also questioned about why he wants to go the same school as the Tuohy family, but he gets through this, and Leigh Anne and the whole family can be proud of him when he reaches great heights. Also starring Ray McKinnon as Coach Burt Cotton, Kim Dickens as Mrs. Boswell, Adriane Lenox as Michael's mother - Denise Oher and Catherine Dyer as Mrs. Smith. Aaron makes a good not very talkative and sensitive soul, the supporting cast all get their moments too, but the film is of course taken over by the award winning Bullock, who did deserve the Oscar out of the five nominated actresses. As for the film itself, it is a very subtle film, with some kicks (literally) in the American football (which I know nothing about) games, it's up there with Jerry Maguire as a likable sports drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year. Very good!"
"darkraven_109","6","2","3","10 March 2010"," Not as great as they say it's supposed to be
","I really don't know why this film got so much praise and credit, but when I saw it for myself, it wasn't all that astounding and all. The movie follows the story of Micheal Oher before and (mostly) after he is adopted by the well to do Tuhoy family where after staying with the family for some time, he magically becomes one of the best football defenders in the college division.<br/><br/>Beyond that, there's nothing more to it. Once again, we are given yet another inspirational sports movie with the same plot seen in other films; the underdog guy/ team is helped/ coached by the compassionate but unexpected coach and they all live happily ever after as ""better people"" (similar films include ""Glory Road,"" ""Gridiron Gang"" and ""Pride""). There; that pretty much sums up the entire movie. If they're going to make another sports movie in the future, at least bring something new to the genre; I've had it with sports movie being too predictable just like this one.<br/><br/>Massive lack of originality and overused story aside, the one shining point of the movie was Sandra Bullock's performance (which was a big improvement compared to her other movies of the year, which include the okay ""The Proposal"" and the better forgotten ""All About Steve"") but I don't see why she deserved the Best Actress award in this year's Oscars. Compared to her fellow nominees for the same award (especially Gabourey Sidibe for ""Precious""), her performance was really weak. She may have done a good job in an otherwise mediocre film, but giving her the Oscar just doesn't make any sense."

","This film is about a deprived and traumatised black teenager who becomes a phenomenon in the sports world, with the help of a generous and loving family.<br/><br/>""The Blind Side"" maybe about uncovering Michael Oher's abilities, and reaching his true potential when given the chance. However, for me the film is more about The Tuohy's amazing generosity and unconditional loving. I am truly impressed by their acceptance of Michael, a complete stranger, without any questions asked. It is an impressive display of the good qualities of human nature. However, the actual film was not as tense, tear jerking or engaging as I thought it might be. In short, ""The Blind Side"" is a good watch to remind us that humans are capable of good deeds."

Its a well made, well acted film that looks and feels like a real winner.<br/><br/>Why then am I so unhappy? Mostly I'm unhappy since the film is so by the numbers that there is little chance to feel anything but inspiration and a sense that this is ""so great"". Its so wonderfully cheery that I got a sugar rush. There seems to have been very little in the way of obstacles, its just nice people doing the right thing and helping a good kid. Granted it doesn't help that the ultimate ending has been touted in all of the press for the film (Oher was recruited by the NFL) but at the same time it leaves little in the way of discovery for the audience except those who want to be lead by the nose to a conclusion they know going in.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, its not a bad movie, its actually quite good, its just emotionally suspect with any feeling coming from the buttons it clearly is pushing.(I know old Hollywood used to do the same thing but they could at least trick you into not seeing the buttons) Much better than the 6 out of 10 I've rated it, I simply can't rate it higher because its too manipulative."

","Based on the remarkable truly story of Michael Oher, 'The Blind Side' really should have been an inspiring and touching film. If it had simply told the story without injecting artificial Hollywood gloss and melodrama, maybe it would have been. Instead, 'The Blind Side' plays more like a fictional drama filled with clichés and exaggerated scenes designed to manipulate the audience.<br/><br/>I'm not too familiar with Michael Oher's story, but I'm pretty sure he didn't used to walk round with a gigantic sulk on his face 24/7 like is portrayed in the film. It's almost as if the film feels the need to constantly remind us of Oher's unhappiness - we get it.

","The Blind Side, which came out in 2009, showed the struggles of a young blank highschooler as he integrated into a more white society. Michael Oher is a very protective and lonesome teenager who, due to his financial problems, lives from place to place without a real home. One of his teachers, Leigh Anne Tuohy, sees Michael after school, walking on a road. When Mrs.Tuohy asks michael if he has a home tonight, Michael confesses he does not, and Mrs.Tuohy graciously takes him in as one of her own. Throughout the movie, Michael learns how to express himself and learn to love those around him. Many movie critics loved the movie and Joe Leydon even described it as, ""Uplifting and entertaining feel-good, fact-based sports drama."". The Blind Side scored a 67% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 82% in good reviews from movie goers. When I saw the Blind Side, I was touched by the kindness of other people's actions and inspired me to be more open when talking to people and not initially judging at first glances. The acting, while it showed enough emotion, was not as great as many other movies I have seen, it was well enough to advance the plot and help us understand the context of the movie. I liked the idea of the story and thought it was very heartfelt and definitely can make viewers emotional. However, due to the simplicity of the plot, there were many parts that were not as interesting or engaging in the movie. I enjoyed watching it but I do not feel the need to watch it again or suggest it to others."

","For those non-believers, naysayers and pessimists let me begin by unequivocally stating that the film The Blind Side is not a Christian based funded film, and the real Michael Oher's life has been embellished and timelines changed somewhat for the big screen. What cannot be disputed though is the fact that the Tuohy family most likely saved Michael Oher from being an impoverished youth with no bright future. Instead the Tuohy's who had the financial ability, but more importantly the willingness to bring a complete impoverished stranger into their home and blend in with their two existing children as a family unit.<br/><br/>No doubt The Blind Side is an inspirational story that will tug at your heart strings, and you may even shed a few tears as Mrs. Shullivan and I both succumbed to, not once, but twice. Even the second time as we sat down to watch the film several years later after it was originally released. The portrayal by actor Quinton Aaron of the desperate and abandoned young Michael Oher is very real such that you wish you could help this young man yourself. Michael's relationship with the four (4) Tuohy family members especially the mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy played by Sandra Bullock was a relationship that exuded generosity, compassion and understanding. Sandra Bullock went on to win her first Oscar for her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy and I would agree with the Academy members who voted for her. I also felt that Quinto Aaron was deserving of an Oscar nomination as his role was just as difficult and effective in generating empathy for the under privileged youth and how a persons life can be turned around if only given an opportunity to succeed within a decent environment and with a families support.<br/><br/>The Blind Side will stand the test of time and may even inspire a few more families to open their hearts and their homes to a stranger who may need a helping hand. I give the film a high 9 out of 10 rating, and maybe by the third time I watch it again my rating may increase to a perfect 10."

","What we have is a young black kid at the age of seventeen yrs. old with a large body who grew up in the projects in Memphis, Tenn. He left his mother; because, she was a drug addicted, and he slept wherever he laid his head down; because, he did not want to be around that entire negative environment. With Michael's homeless circumstances, Tony Hamilton, Omar Dorsey like a father figure let him stay with his family. One day Tony introduced his son Steven, and Michael Ora, Quinton Araon to football Coach Burt Cotton, Ray McKinnon from Wingate Christian School a private school that may benefit the school's football program; because, of Michael's sizes, and moves. With a GPA.0.6 Michael was accepted to the school, and Michael started going to classes at Wingate. The teachers said, Michael Oher was unteachable, but there was this science teacher, Mrs. Boswell, Kim Dicken who believed in Michael, and needed a special tutor to help him get through school. There was this lady Mrs. Tuohy, Sandra Bullock mother of two kids one named Collins, Lily Collins, and S.J., Jae Head, and her husband name was Mr. Tuohy Tim McGraw the owner of a many Taco Bells who took Michael in has a family member to stay one night, but that one night turned out to be a lot of extra days, to weeks, months, and years of love, and emotions for both. This was an investment; because, Mrs. Tuohy was very patience with Michael as a young teenage so he could fulfill his dream as a human being, and a pro football player the left tackle for Wingate's football team. With Michael's academic problems in the way would prohibit extra activities; because, of his learning abilities, and his life beyond school, and he may not be able to play football. The People around town were asking questions to all the Tuohy's family members why they brought Michael Oher into their family. The theme that I like when the Tuohy family took to kindness; because, this family was friendly to people, help the poor, help other students giving Michael a place of growing up in a positive environment. The Tuohy family helped Michael Oher get his life on track when they noticed he was having problems in school. The Tuohy family proceeded giving him attention, and to get him a special patience tutors that helped him in the long term to graduate. This story of Michael Oher a 17yrs old boy who was homeless, and came from a broken home, and needed some guidance in the right direction to become a NFL draft pick behind love, kindness, and care coming from Mrs. Tuohy, and the family. In my opinion the acting was graces; especially Michael Oher, Quinton Araon acting the age of a 17 yr. old boy being that big with those basketball, and football moves, and taking his time using that graces acting role with a learning disability. What a way to act, being patience, and the way he talk the script, and moving his body language slow in certain scenes.<br/><br/>The movie Miracle on ice is one of those family movies that the whole family can enjoy. The themes in this movie are just like the movie Blind Side where there is teamwork involved, leadership, and Mrs. Tuohy family dynamics; between Coach Burton, and the teachers who tutored him. They all helped him avoid negative language, and any bad behaviors to become a Michael Oher miracle for the Tuohy family; especially Mrs. Tuohy. Miracle, and Blind side, these two movies show what awesome things ordinary human beings can achieve when they believe in one self. With the juxtaposition close, long, mid, and full shots of Michael's neighborhood this gave the audience a feel of Michael's world living in the hood of Memphis, Tenn. The camera shots angles are used to show Michael's life in the hood and a complete full circle of his life being turned around, and being able to adapt to a wealthy family. These kinds of camera angles for example panning and tracking shots, show a group of black youngsters hanging out in the hood on the steps, faces full of hate, and lust like gangster faces; especially when Mrs. Tuohy Sandra Bullock pays a visit to Michael's hood. In my opinion it was the scene In Blind Side first movie where Coach Burton kept telling or yelling at Michael Oher no do not pick up that offensive player, and carry him, and Coach Burton kept going over the plays with the team, again, again, again; especially with the balloons in the air, and everybody stop, and looked at them; while, Coach Burton was yelling they are just balloons, back to practice over, and over repeatedly. This was the same theme as Miracle, Again, Again, Again trailer where you showed us in class two weeks ago a repeatedly motifs where Kurt Russel the coach kept telling his team again, again, again on the ice sprints. Courage can be like pulling at rabbit out of a top hat casting a magical spell telling it what to do wishing there was a rabbit in that hat. Any ordinary person can be brave, but have honor, that is life you make it happen or you do not make it happen. You hope for a Miracle again, again, again, and have the courage, honor to believe in oneself to win a Michael Oher, and the miracle on ice back in 1980."
"Okonh0wp","8","1","1","23 December 2015"," The Blind Side
","The Blind Side rode sentimental appeal, a star performance, and a respectable box office draw to an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The film tells the true story of Michael Oher, a homeless teenager who became an NFL player and college graduate with the help of a loving family (played by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw).<br/><br/>The story runs into the same problem as another 2009 film, Invictus, in the sense that by being true to the events as they happened, there is a lack of conflict. <br/><br/>In the real-life counterpart Blind Side, I might have expected, due to the fact that the story takes place in Central Tennessee and a white family is taking in a black teenager that it would be story largely about racism. In real life, however, Leigh Ann Tuohy was remarkably colorblind and so was her husband and the movie doesn't dare contradict that. A couple confused relatives and a suspicious NCAA infractions investigator is about all we get for a reminder of racial tension in the deep south, but hey, it's the post-racial era, what can we expect?<br/><br/>In spite of that, this is a picture that works. The drama is authentic but it also engages because it's centered around a struggle that takes many forms and stages: the central figure has to learn to open himself up, to trust, to succeed on the field and in the classroom, etc.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Sandra Bullock has a strong consistency to the way she approaches the character. The real-life woman is somewhat of an enigma in her motivations and Bullock makes it believable. <br/><br/>Quinton Aaron is amazing and had as much of a role in carrying the movie as Bullock. He has such presence (partially because of his size) but appears so uncomfortable with that presence at first and gradually transform into it.<br/><br/>Kathy Bates shouldn't be so heavily advertised because her role basically amounts to a cameo."

Of course, it is about the rise of sports star Michael Oher, but in that story we see a lot of social commentary, and two really fantastic acting performances. Quinton Aaron is great as Oher, but it is Sandra Bullock who rightly got the attention of the Oscars committee for her role as well-to-do teacher and mother Leigh Anne Tuohy, who takes in a vulnerable black boy and then realizes his potential.<br/><br/>The American football scenes are actually remarkably sparse, which is good, because I know very little about handegg. There is also a very good voice-over explanation by Bullock at the very beginning, which told me pretty much everything you need to know for the purposes of the story. There is more a bit later, and I have to admit that I wasn't following the subtleties, but I got more than enough to go forward with.<br/><br/>The film does rather lead you by the hand emotionally, but I am happy to accept that from a film as long as it is done well. The social commentary, illustrated in the contrast between 'Big Mike's lack of ambition and the Tuohy family's assumption that the best is available to them, is nothing new either, but the point here is empathy, and the film delivers that in spades.<br/><br/>The pace is fairly gentle throughout, which I think is director John Lee Hancock's forte. When he tried thrills and action in The Alamo, he came badly unstuck and ended up with an expensive, boring flop. He excels in writing, and slowly developing themes.<br/><br/>The subtext is not perfect, certainly. I detected a couple of missteps, or at least sidesteps, but crucially, I could see mitigating circumstances for each decision the screenwriters made. All round, it doesn't put a foot far wrong.<br/><br/>If you are a bloke, and doubt you would like a film this soppy, or you are a woman and doubt you would be too interested in a sports film, I suggest you give this movie a try. I think it will surprise you."
"jmt-86403","9","1","1","4 November 2015"," Michael Oher is a black kid who was raised very poor and his mother was a drug addict.
","Please be aware that this is a spoiler of sorts as it gives the outcome of the movie. The Blind Side is a very good movie starring Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy, Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher, and Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy. Michael Oher is a black kid who was raised very poor and his mother was a drug addict. He was not attending school and was homeless. Michael Crosses paths with Leigh Anne Tuohy. She takes him to her home and they all started bonding. Eventually, the Tuohy's adopted Michael, he started doing well in school from all of the help he was receiving. He also excelled very well in football. Michael has the natural instinct of protection so this served him well as an offensive lineman. The Tuohy's saved Michael and he turned his life completely around. He was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens and is currently the starting left tackle for the Carolina Panthers.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie is overcoming the odds. Michael was setup to fail his entire life until the Tuohy's gave him a reason to fight and stand up for himself. They gave him the drive and the confidence to be better, to overcome the terrible situation that his mom put him in. A good example of this is when Michael is struggling at football practice and Leigh Anne explains to him how to use his protective instinct and that the other football players are his family. Another film that has a similar theme would be We are Marshal. They are overcoming to odds after a horrific plane crash.<br/><br/>The film angle ties in with the theme. Often times, at the beginning of the film, the angle is focused down onto Michael as to portray how low Michael's life is at that moment. By the end of the film you see that the angle is more looking up to him. This is a testament to what Michael has accomplished and overcome. Another aspect that helps with the theme throughout the movie is lighting. You will notice that in the darkest of times of Michael's life that the scenes are much more dark and dull. On the contrary, when everything is going right and Michael is happy, the color and lighting is brighter. It is all about overcoming the odds for Michael Oher and he overcame his terrible odds in a very big way."

","A Touchdown for All<br/><br/>Whether or not you have ever watched a football game, this movie will tug at your heart and have you rooting for Michael Oher right from the start. Through the use of it's dynamic actors, Michael Lewis' The Blind Side shows the importance of family and compassion which grabs the attention of both sports and non sports enthusiasts. <br/><br/>The Blind Side tells the true story of Michael Oher's life. At the start of the movie Michael doesn't have a home and is staying at a friend's house in a little part of Tennessee called ""Hurt Village. I'll let the name of the village speak for itself. Both he and his friend are able to begin attending a Christian school on the other side of town with the help of his friend's desperate father. Michael feels out of place right from the start. He is referred to as ""Big Mike"", and is treated as an outcast by not only students but by the teachers as well. It isn't until he runs into Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) that things start turning around for him. Leigh Anne immediately reaches out to Michael and invites him to stay for the night. One night turns into a few more nights and pretty soon Michael has his own room in the Tuohy household. A lot changes during his time starts at the Tuohy's and he goes from being a reserved, ""Big Mike"" to a confident, ""Michael"". <br/><br/>The acting in this movie is altogether fantastic. From Tim McGraw who plays Sean Tuohy, to Michael's tutor, Miss Sue played by Kathy Bates, everyone of the actors and actresses deserve a standing ovation. In my opinion, Leigh Anne Tuohy who is played by Sandra Bullock steals the show. The audience can really connect to her empathetic character. Sandra Bullock gives all women a sense of empowerment and shows people that a little compassion can go a long way. Both Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron, who plays Michael in the movie help one another to realize how much they need each other. One of the things I love about this movie is that it is not only about how The Tuohy family took Michael in and completely turned his life around, but how Michael became a member of the Tuohy family and gives them all a whole new outlook on life. <br/><br/>After seeing this movie, there is one actor who cannot go unnoticed. That would be Jae Head, who plays the role of S.J. Tuohy, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy's (Tim McGraw) youngest child. Jae has such a big role for such a young child and does it in a way that makes you wonder how someone so young could be so wise. He gives the movie a very lighthearted feel, and keeps people sitting on the edge of their seat wondering ""what will he say next"" whenever he is in a scene. It is clear right away that he and Michael will be close. They hit it off right away when S.J. gives Michael a little advice to ""Smile at them. It will let them know you're their friend"" after he watches Michael scare away two little girls from the swing at the park. It's very heartwarming to see how much Michael listens to what advice S.J. has for him throughout the movie. <br/><br/>The Blind Side has something for everyone. This may seem like another cliché sports movie, but it has so much more within it. The fact that it is a true story makes it one that has and will inspire many. The Blind Side is one for all to see and will leave you with a feeling of the utmost compassion towards the people in this movie."

I thought this movie was very fascinating and very interesting, because I became a huge football fan that year, so I thought this movie would probably make very good use of teaching high school students in the U.S. about who Michael Oher is, and how he got drafted to the Baltimore Ravens from Ole Miss. I thought Sandra Bullock was a phenomenal actress, and I was glad she won the Best Actress Academy Award. I really thought that this should have won the Best Picture Oscar rather than ""The Hurt Locker"", and I additionally think that this movie really deserves a higher Metascore because it was really good. I even remember getting this movie on Netflix when I was a sophomore in high school, and my family and I watched it together on a day that school was canceled, because we got heavy snow. In short, all I can say about this movie is that I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes to watch sports, and is interested in learning about current NFL players like Oher."

","The Blind Side was an enjoyable movie. Although, the movie was based on a true story it was delivered in a very appealing manner. The movie cast really brought the movie to life. Sandra Bullock played the role of Leigh Ann Tuoly, Quinton Aaron played the role of Michael Oher also known as Big Mike and Jay Head played the role of Sean Jr. Tuoly also known as S.J. The cast made me forget I was watching a film that was based on a true story. It was as if the storyline was playing out for the very first time. Big Mike was a high-school age teen, who played football. He lives in poverty, going home to home, school to school, without much family support or stability. Big Mike, is ultimately befriended by S.J. who is much younger than he and they develop of friendship. The interactions of Big Mike and S.J. caught the attention of S.J's mom, Leigh Ann Tuoly; Big Mike, did not go unnoticed from Leigh Ann from that point on.<br/><br/>The complexity of Human relationships and Coming of Age were two of the most prevalent themes throughout the movie. Most people that came in contact with Big Mike, were intimidated by him because of his size. No one took the time to get to know him or understand his plight; until Leigh Ann did. Even when Leigh Ann, decided she wanted to take Big Mike in, her family and people around her weren't very supportive initially. People simply did not understand and most people are afraid of what they don't know. Big Mike dealt with the complexity of human relationships in several facets. Once Leigh Ann, took him in, he went from living in poverty to living very comfortably. It wasn't until he began living with Leigh Ann, did he have a bed of his own for the very first time; which was a big difference from how he was accustomed to living. Big Mike was also as a large black man, now living in a community that was primarily white. He had to adapt to the stares, glares and some people just not liking him.<br/><br/>Another film that comes to mind with a similar theme is Precious, only it's more intensified. While the main character Precious played by Gabourey Sidibe, also dealt with the complexity of human relationships; the complexity was with someone really close to her; her mother. The person we seek love from the most, naturally. Fortunately for Precious, she encountered someone at school who saw past her flaws; her teacher; Ms. Rain played by Paula Patton. Ms. Rain, seen something good in Precious, just as Leigh Ann, seen in Big Mike.<br/><br/>The techniques in ""The Blind Side"" seemed to be the coolest at night, on the football field. The view of the stadium lights gave for such a great illusion, gearing our attention to the football field and the football players. There were many other people and objects in those scenes but we were drawn to the football field. I also really appreciated the slow motion effects, it made you anticipate what was going to happen next. It really pulled you into the scene, you felt as if you were there.<br/><br/>The movie was definitely one that dealt with the complexity of Human Relationships and it was interesting to see some of the complexities overcome the throughout the movie. By the end of the movie Big Mike did not deal with as many complexities, nor conflicts, which made for a great movie."

"bailey73","10","1","1","16 March 2015"," Review of Blind Side
","The movie Blind Side is a non-fiction story about the life of Michael Oher and his struggles to overcome life's obstacles such as social problems, the struggle for human dignity, human relationships and coming of age. The plot of the film is that a teenager Michael Oher (played by Qinton Aaron) has been surviving on the streets with little closing and no place to live. He is spotted by Leigh Anne Touhy (played by Sandra Bullock) and as she questions her children she learns that Michael, commonly called Big Mike by other kids, is a classmate of her kids at Wingate School a school predominately for those with social status. On that first meeting she insists that Michael, who is scantily dressed for the winter, get into the car and takes him home for the night. Once there she is a little scared that he will do something, but in the morning finds all the covers neatly folded on the end of the couch and Michael gone. This first moment of kindness on Leigh Anne's part, and the unfamiliar behavior expected by Michael, to later draw the family to make Michael a member of the Touhy family. <br/><br/>Although there are extreme differences in background, Michael accepts to live with the Touhy's an in turn undergoes a entirely new set of challenges. Some of those challenges include, fitting into the school, trying to pass classes to be able to play football, and making friends. SJ Touhy (played by Jae Head) becomes Michael's closest friend and helps him to overcome many of the social obstacles. At one point Sean Touhy (played by Tim McGray) mentions that Michael is ""basically a fly in a bowl of milk at Wingate"". As the story goes on Michael eventually begins to change the lives of the Touhy's as they make discoveries into their own lives and how they have grown accustom to having money and overlooked those who don't. An example of this is when Michael questions what happens to all the uneaten food at the restaurants the Touhy's own. Leigh Anne even stands up to her lifelong friends as they question her intention with having Michael around all the time and admits that Michael is changing her life. <br/><br/>This film gives you the sense of caring and makes one take a look at their own life and how one might overcome adversity to become something much greater in life. The background in which you come from does not make the person. It is how the person treats the world that makes a difference. Yes Michael becomes a football player (high school, college & later NFL), but at one point they had to ask him if he even wanted to play football. It's a great real life success story, but one has to look past the achievements of Michael Oher at the real meaning of what the Touhy family did. It a movie about the best in humanity and how, if those who are blessed with financial and spiritual resources reach out and share those blessings, they can change the course of someone's life for the good."
"ANAMARiiEE","10","1","1","18 January 2015"," Faith in humanity restored!
","This movie never gets old to me. I often find myself questioning why people are so prejudice towards others. I see it every day. This movie melted my heart. Most kids born and raised in an environment such as Hurt Village would have gave in to the idea that they are destined to do drugs and live the life they were born and raised in. Some feel as though they have no choice or that there is no hope for them to make something more of themselves or their life I should say. Michael was not one to let that environment shape who he is. He didn't like the idea of drugs and violence. He did what he could to take care of himself and he truly had a good heart. He wasn't one to be rude or talk down to others. He had a great personality and longed for the support of a family that he could love and be loved by. My favorite part that shows an example of prejudice comments was when Mrs. Tuohy tells her selfish, rude, stuck up friends or sisters or whatever they were to her at lunch... ""Shame on you."" for their comments about a big black boy staying in their home and assuming right away that he was a danger to Collins. Mrs. Tuohy didn't let peer pressure get the best of her and she didn't care what the other's thought about her taking in Michael. If those ladies would have taken the time to get to know Michael, they would see how important it is to not judge people so quickly. There were several other times when the Tuohy family restored my faith in humanity and I have respect for all that they did to support and care for Michael. The movie was entertaining and meaningful. It displays an important outlook on life and the people you encounter. It was inspiring and uplifting. The actors played their role perfectly and I enjoyed every minute of it!"

","This was one of the best movies I have ever seen! The actors playing the characters were phenomenal and the script written was very well done. This move had tons of humor - which I did not expect at all - and quite a few heartwarming moments that almost make you cry. I can easily see why the actress playing Leigh-Anne won so many awards. She has one of the best southern accents I've ever heard. She was also a great mom and sassy, don't-mess-with-me character which was fun to watch and easy to relate too.<br/><br/>I seriously recommend this film for anyone who loves sports, football, heartwarming movies or movies you can watch with your family. :)"
"Kinoviewer","6","1","1","18 June 2013"," Good movie but not what was expected
","I was curious to watch this well-praised movie ""The Blind Side"" for the role in which Sandra Bullock got her Oscar award. Although her acting was good and this movie is based on a true story I was not impressed by this one. If I had not known that was a real story I would think of this one to be another fake American dream-based movie where a main character had life full of deprivation and abuse, but then a fairy came and changed it to a fabulous one. While watching I recalled another movie I watched several years ago called ""Radio"" with Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris that was also based on a trues story of a mentally retarded boy who ended up as a support guy to the High School football team. The plots of these two movies are similar to some extent but I liked ""Radio"" more. Watch both and then you can decide which one you like more."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","1","18 October 2012"," Has all the subtlety of the busted chainsaw
","The opening scene of The Blind Side successfully establishes a football analogy that, for someone unlearned in the game (like me), helps to explain the game from the coach's point of view. Over real-life footage of Joe Theissman's gruesome 1985 career-ending compound fracture, the narration tells us that ""The first check you write is for the mortgage, and the second is for the insurance. The left tackle's job is to protect the quarterback from what he can't see coming. To protect his blind side."" That analogy comes from Leigh Ann Tohey, who is our guide for the rest of the film. Her explanation had me nodding my head. Something of the strength of the game is held in that tiny moment. Unfortunately this is the only scene in the movie that works.<br/><br/>The Blind Side is based on a true story, yet it has all the dramatic subtlety of a chainsaw. Every moment feels manipulated for our enjoyment, with no thought to the free-flow of real life. Heroic characters and their naysayers are set up like pins in a bowling alley. The good guys bowl down the naysayers and that's that. Here is a movie that has the potential to tell a great story, but avoids challenging us with hard truths by burying reality in a vat of pitiful easy clichés and over melodramatic punches. This is melodrama at about a 4th grade level.<br/><br/>Bullock plays Leigh Ann Tohey, one of those southern women who always gets her way by talking sassy and making big speeches. She has one of those beautiful, smiling families that you usually see in coffee commercials. By her side is husband Sean (Tim McGraw) who has the sole function of reminding others that this little Philly always gets her way. Their daughter is pretty teenaged Collins (Lily Collins) whose sole function is to be pretty and teenaged. And there's little S.J. (Jae Head), a freckle-faced kid who is so precocious and irritating that he brings the whole movie to a screeching halt. Imagine the early years of Jar Jar Binks and you've got the idea. They live in one of those grand estates where everything is sunlit like a magazine cover.<br/><br/>The story kicks off when Leigh Ann and Sean notice a sad-eyed black kid walking home in the rain. Leigh Ann takes pity on this poor kid and offers him a room in their home. He is Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), the son of a crack addict whose sad life has been a rotating series foster homes throughout Memphis, nearly all of which he has run away from. Before his solemn stroll in the rain, he got help to get into Wingate Christian School despite a disastrous academic record. He got in because the coaches at the school were convinced that he could revive their sorry excuse for a football team. Mike accepts Leigh Ann's offer and is soon living at the Tohey house where the family adopts him as one of their own. Leigh Ann notices that he has protective instincts and decides that his wide girth might make him a great defensive tackle. No points for guessing that he is a natural on the football field.<br/><br/>The scenes on the football field should be the center of the film. Unfortunately, very little of what happens on the field is of any interest. Those scenes never have any tension or dramatic impact. We never feel as if we're watching a team. The scenes are set up as if Michael is the center and the other guys (who we never see in the cold light of day) are there to support him. Football scenes in the movies are among the most difficult to get right. Like battle scenes, there needs to be strategy, placement, logic so that we can follow the action in order to get a sense of the dramatic tension. Here, director John Lee Hancock takes the easy way out. He focuses on squarely on Michael as a way of avoiding dealing with anyone else. In one scene he sets up a night game with Michael on one team and a loud-mouthed racist kid on the other (who has an equally loud-mouthed racist father in the stands). The scene is set up so that Michael can knock he kid over the fence. Why was that necessary? Why create such an offensive and clichéd character that is set up for a cheap and easy payoff? The reason, I'm afraid, is that the movie wants to get the audience on its side. Instead of trusting their intelligence, it manufactures phony situations for an easy pay off. The good characters in the movie are saintly, while the negative characters are hateful scorns or one-dimensional dummies. Take, for example, the coach at Wingate. His name is Cotton (Ray McKinnon) and his sole function in the film is to say and do the wrong thing so that Leigh Anne can prove him wrong. He stands at the sidelines looking perplexed. After a while you wonder how he ever became a coach in the first place.<br/><br/>The one saving grace in the film is Sandra Bullock who maintains her dignity in the midst of terminal dreck. She looks great, she photographs just right but her character in this movie is given scenes that make no sense or are outside the boundaries of reality. One unbelievable moment has her marching down the projects and getting in the face of a gangbanger who has threatened Michael. She's allowed to walk away from that situation, get in her car and drive home. Yeah, not gonna happen.<br/><br/>The basic problem with The Blind Side is that it is so sanctimonious. Every single emotional high point is rung like the bell at the strength-tester at the county fair. The fact that this is based on a true story means nothing because the screenwriters haven't been honest with us. It deteriorates under the weight of its own good-heartedness."
"roedyg","6","1","1","9 May 2012"," Not really a football movie
","When this movie drifts into football it becomes totally predictable and boring. The game on the screen is necessarily fixed and staged. There is no tension as in a real athletic contest. It is like watching a re-run. You have seen the same plot formula 100 times before.<br/><br/>Happily, most of this movie is not about playing football.<br/><br/>The Sandra Bullock character is great fun, a take off on the bossy competent southern woman. She is SO audacious I burst out laughing time and time again.<br/><br/>The Quinton Aaron character holds very little interest.<br/><br/>The plot is completely predictable and sugary.<br/><br/>The most writing originality was Michael's little ""brother"" negotiating with college football coaches.<br/><br/>I watched this movie because Sandra Bullock was in it. That is the main reason to watch it."
"Hitchcoc","6","1","1","31 July 2010"," Did It Really Happen This Way?
","This is a decent story about decent people. What it lacks is a sense that all this happened. When one has a recent biographical film, we wonder how much is created to move the story along. Take a fun football film like ""Remember the Titans."" It is based in the fact of busing and segregation. Did it really happen that way? Did those guys really bond that way. Or did they pretty much accept the fact that football requires them to put up or shut up. It's still a great story, as is this one. The real story is the fact that a wealthy white woman who actually exists brought Michael Oher into her home. All the details surrounding this may have been brushed over a bit. I feel it's missing a down and dirty part. Even the confrontations in the neighborhood a bit sanitized. It's a good human story; I just have a sneaking suspicion that some liberties were taken."

","Michael Oher is a kind gentle young boy who has no home, no family. He eats left overs, has only one pair of clothes and sleeps in a laundromat.

It is the tale of race and how it does not matter what colour you are, what religion you follow....Simply that we are all human beings...<br/><br/>The cast is not the best at giving a great performance, but Sandra Bullock carries the cast through.

","The blind Side is a very touching movie inspired in true story of Michael Oher, a homeless African-American youngster from a broken home, taken in by the Touhys, a well-to-do white family who help him fulfill his potential. As a football player and student, Oher works hard and, with the help of his coaches and adopted family, becomes an All-American offensive left tackle. The story is very interesting, the plot is convincing enough, it is a drama but it has its very good moments of humor. The cast is wonderful and their performances are excellent. Sandra Bullock giving the performance of her life, no wonder why she took the Oscar home, Quinton Aaron in the role of Michael Oher was a really pleasant surprise, Kathy Bates in a short appearance as Oher's professor was quite convincing and Jae Head, the kid that performs as Bullock's son was and excellent comic relief for the movie. In conclusion, The Blind Side is a inspiring and heart breaking movie worthy to watch and very recommendable"
"bob-rutzel-1","9","1","1","28 April 2010"," Wonderful Story
","This is based upon a true story.<br/><br/>Leigh Anne Tuohy (Bullock) and husband Sean (McGraw) take in Big Mike Oher (Aaron) and help develop his potential. <br/><br/>Since I knew I was going to watch the DVD and saw what the promos promised, I went and bought a box of Kleenex. Good move. <br/><br/>What a wonderful story and true too. If more people were like the Tuohys, the world would be a better place. But, just think about it for a minute, the high risk they took taking in a kid from the streets. However, if Big Mike's real mother Denise (Lenox) didn't instill in him his good character, maybe we would never have heard of him and his place in sports and, of course, the Tuohys.<br/><br/>Yes, some will say that much of the movie is sappy, maybe corny, but when you know this is a true story, and you like and believe the characters and the dialogue because you want to, then it's not sappy and corny. It's just right. See?<br/><br/>The thing that impressed the most was the understatement of all on the screen. That had the most impact for me. And, in a true story the little things like the looks, subtle comments, and some good comedic lines go a long way to making this most enjoyable. Also, the support the entire family gave Big Mike. In the beginning, the Tuohy's son SJ (Head) was kind of annoying, but he grew on me and helped the comic relief along. Good job. <br/><br/>I do have one complaint. In the High School games some of the camera angles could have been better showing how Big Mike protected the Quarterback's blind side. To be fair, there were a couple one-on-one scenes with Big Mike and the Defensive End where Big Mike pulverized that player. <br/><br/>All in all a very good movie for all the family. And, it was nice to see Sandra Bullock deserve and win the Best Actress award. <br/><br/>Most of us, by now, know that Big Mike wants to be called Michael and that he went to the Baltimore Ravens of the NFL where he is today. It almost makes me want to root for the Ravens, however my loyalty lies elsewhere, but I will keep an eye on Michael and wish him well. Hey, I invested in a box of Kleenex on his behalf. I now know I should have bought 2-boxes. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

","The Blind Side is a movie like a thousand others. It's the same movie that you can find on Sunday afternoon on TV, that nobody really has heard of before. Why was it such a blockbuster then?<br/><br/>Honestly...? I have no idea!<br/><br/>Yeah, the story is true, I know that, but even when the story is true you don't have to make a movie absolutely predictable - that's just bad directing. What's even worse is the screenplay - the dialogues are completely unrealistic, unbelievable and often simply trashy. Some scenes are like copied from B class trashy family movies. That's how bad it gets. As for the acting, the main character Big Mike - Quinton Aron - is just not really good, the scene when he's walking on the street 'being cold' is the best example of that and the sad facial expression gets boring pretty soon, he's still likable when he starts smiling etc. though. As for Sandra - nothing even close to being worthy for an Oscar NOMINATION, - and award is a joke. Not that I don't like her - it's just... just no.<br/><br/>Overall, don't get me wrong, the movie is OK-made, it is enjoyable, it's a good movie for the whole family, that teaches values as... family and not only, and has got some pretty good Football scenes, but for those of you that prefer something better in the cinema, it's just not the right choice, sorry.<br/><br/>Highly overrated!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. The Sandra Bullock factor kept me away from this for the the first month. I just couldn't bring myself to watch her same old lame act one more time - especially since she has already been in about 12 movies this year. Wow, what a pleasant surprise this was.<br/><br/>Based on the amazing story of Michael Oher, Bullock delivers her best work in years, maybe ever. On top of that, Quinton Aaron is terrific as Mr. Oher. The bond is uplifting and believable. Yes, it has some fluff and mass appeal formula, but it is certainly watchable and quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>We see very little of Oher's roots and the high school football coach is miscast and tough to watch, but those are the only minor quibbles I have with an otherwise fine movie that will (and already has) appealed to a wide audience. I often worry about my film snobbishness, but I bought off on this one and thanks go to director John Lee Hancock (The Alamo) for teetering, but not falling into full blown chick flick."

","Why does everyone seem to think that this is the must see movie of 2009? Why are people saying that they cried in this movie? Why are people saying that they laughed in this movie? I REALLY do not know. <br/><br/>The plot follows the ""true"" story of Michael Oher (in the film played by Quinton Aaron) who is adopted by a white southern family at the request of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock). I am not denying that it isn't a powerful story, and not taking away anything from the Tuohy family, because what they did was very kind. I just wish it could have made a better movie.<br/><br/>The problems with the film start with Sandra Bullock, who does a reasonable job given that she has to play a PSYCHOPATHIC mother! Seriously, the actions of Bullock in this movie made me want to cringe. Things like calling the coach during a football game and threatening to cut off your adopted son's penis does not make you endearing and likable. It makes you a psychopath. <br/><br/>Another annoyance that pops up way to often in the movie comes in the form of S.J Tuohy (Jae Head). At first he seems innocent and sweet and then he just started to annoy me to no end. I mean the kid gets into a car crash, is covered in blood and then he gets up to ask his mom if she thinks the blood will wash out of his clothes (?). And his Mom instead of being worried about her son, just shrugs it off saying that he enjoys the attention. Another scene that annoyed me with the kid was when he tried to mooch off of ALL of Michael's college offers. Jesus Christ does this kid have an off switch?<br/><br/>The thing that annoyed me the most about these characters is that the film seems to say that all of their actions are justified because of what they are doing for Michael. Sure, what your doing for Michael is nice, but that doesn't give you permission to be snobby and holier than thou. <br/><br/>Quinton Aaron was the only person in the movie that I felt something for...Mainly because he doesn't really speak until the very end. When the end comes however and he does have to act, he doesn't impress me. <br/><br/>Aside from that minor characters like the father (Tim McGraw) the tutor (Kathy Bates) and the teacher ""with a heart"" (Kim Dickens) seem like good people. Maybe because the camera doesn't spend too much time with any of them. Although the tutors line ""I'm a democrat"" (?) REALLY got under my skin. (Not because of the politics; mainly because it comes out of nowhere.)<br/><br/>And looking upon this review you might be saying, ""This was based on a true story, there's nothing you can fix about it."" And to that I say, just make something up! Take the inspirational story of the Tuohy's and loosely base it off of their story. But I guess I'm in the minority here. <br/><br/>*1/2 out of *****"

","Blind Side, The (2009) <br/><br/>* 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Typical sports drama about a poor black kid (Quinton Aaron) who is living on the streets when a couple rick folks (Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw) take him into their home. They try to get his grades up at school so that he can play football and soon they discover his true talent. You know going in what to expect from this true-story but the amount of sugar really got under my skin after a while as did the fact that this thing followed every sports cliché in the book. Every once in a while a film will come along and makes millions of dollars and I'm left there scratching my head as to why. I think I know why but this film pretty much plays to a simple crowd who probably aren't going to expect too much. I'm not sure how many times this film followed a cliché and delivered the same type of clichéd line and I honestly couldn't help but laugh. Just like the scene where Bullock walks up to some gangsters in the ghetto and insults them. Now, this gangster just pulled a gun on her son and has probably killed a few folks in his day yet he's going to let this white woman come up on his turf and insult him? It's doubtful but it's one of those ""cheer"" moments that only take place in movies like this. If one hasn't seen a lot of sports movies then perhaps they won't get annoyed with all the stuff here but I've seen quite a few in my day and by the hour mark I was wishing I was somewhere else. The film has been getting a lot of attention for its performances and they're pretty good throughout, although I certainly attach the word Oscar to any of them. Bullock gives the Southern accent her all and delivers a fiery performance but to me the real breakthrough was Aaron. He does a pretty strong job at playing quiet and really delivering emotions without saying a word, which is a lot more impressive than just shouting out lame dialogue. Even McGraw does a nice job but I must say the real NCAA coaches don't come off as good. The subject matter has been sugar-coated to the point of being watered down but this is to be expected since this is a mainstream film trying to capture as many people as it can. It certainly worked because as I was walking out there were many people crying, myself including, but my tears were of frustration for just wasting $20."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","4","9","23 November 2009"," Plain Decency
","Sandra Bullock catches our attention when her Leigh Anne Tuohy says, ""Don't you dare lie to me!"" She had asked Big Mike (silently strong Quinton Aaron) if he had a place to sleep for the night in the pouring rain. Bullock commands the screen in ""The Blind Side"". She is smart, sassy, and strong—brilliantly deflecting a gentle soul not easily moved. My friend Robert told me, ""Sandra Bullock rocks!"" That says it all. I also think that Bullock gets an Oscar nod for her heart felt and powerful performance. Director and Writer John Lee Hancock's ""The Blind Side"" is based on the book by Michael Lewis which tells the inspiring true story of Michael Oher. Oher was a homeless black kid, taken in by the Tuohy family, who became an All-American Football Player drafted in the first round by the Baltimore Ravens. Oher is now starting left offensive lineman—protecting the quarterback's blind side. ""The Blind Side"" celebrates the decency in all people. I was touched by and enjoyed ""The Blind Side"". And much like the title, one is blind sided by the decency of people. I love this movie.<br/><br/>Leigh Anne (Bullock) is married to Taco Bell franchise king Sean Tuohy (solid Tim McGraw). She has two kids, daughter Collins (smart and pretty Lily Collins) and son S.J. (scene stealing Jae Head). Collins is a volleyball star and cheerleader. S.J. is the precocious kid with his finger in everything. Leigh Anne is an interior designer, who often lunches on $18 salads with her lady friends. Her life changes when she chooses to take hulking Big Mike (Aaron) into the family. Director Hancock punctuates family throughout the movie. Early on Big Mike tells Leigh Anne that he doesn't like being called ""Big Mike"". Leigh Anne obliges, ""I'll call you Michael."" And when they shop for clothes in his old neighborhood, Michael reminds Leigh Anne, ""I got your back."" <br/><br/>This is the amazing and endearing thread of ""The Blind Side""—it's about protecting your own, protecting family. At the narrative arc Bullock fearlessly stares down a street thug, ""You threaten my son! You threaten me!"" In another great scene, Leigh Anne storms onto the football practice field, and instructs Michael how to play the game. She says, ""This team is your family Are you going to protect the family, Michael?"" <br/><br/>The soul of ""The Blind Side"" is Bullock and her touching relationship with Michael authentically played by Quinton Aaron. Aaron is deceptively expressive and strong. He movingly narrates his essay that the only thing that matters is honor. At the story arc, Michael tells Leigh Anne, ""Don't you dare lie to me!"" Really this is Bullock's movie. She amazes throughout with her spirit, compassion, and her powerful silence. When Leigh Anne makes up Michael's room, he tells her that he never had a bed before. Bullock walks to her room, and sits on her bed in solace. When Michael's crack addicted Mother tells Leigh Anne that she doesn't want Michael to see her the way she is, Bullock sits next to her and holds her hand in silence. And we are in awe as well.<br/><br/>Everyone is amazing in ""The Blind Side"". Lily Collins as Collins ditches her girlfriends to keep company with Michael in the school library. She confides, ""It's like were studying together at home."" Jae Head S.J. is simply awesome when he asks the recruiting Coaches, ""So what's in it for me?"" Tim McGraw is solidly understated when Leigh Anne asks him, ""Am I a good person?"" Kathy Bates rules as Michael's tutor Miss Sue.<br/><br/>The only goofy narrative twist involves NCAA Investigator Granger (in your face Sharon Morris). Granted this seems like a plot device, because we kind of know how this true story goes. This is a minor distraction, because at the core of ""The Blind Side"" is family, honor, and unconditional love. There is such a great moment when Michael tells Leigh Anne, ""You need to give me a proper hug."" ""The Blind Side"" just touches your soul."
"scotts863","Null","3","6","1 December 2009"," Delivers An Emotional Punch and a Great Message!
","Any movie that starts with the infamous LT destruction of Joe Theisman and ends with actual clips from the NFL draft has a lot going for it. Certainly not a pure football movie, this film delivers an emotional punch and a great message. I've read invalid criticism of this movie that tries to say that the main characters aren't fleshed out enough. I couldn't disagree more. When Sandra Bullock's character says, ""I'm not changing him, he's changing me"" you clearly see why. Experiencing life through Oher's eyes is like re-experiencing everything for the first time. You appreciate EVERYTHING and learn that there really are no ""little things"" in life. Simple things taken for granted like food and a bed are to be savored and never overlooked. This movie manages to remind us all of that while delivering great entertainment. The performances are outstanding. Sure, it's predictable and there are some clichés ranging from inner city portrayal to a dufus high school football coach but those things are easily forgiven in my book. If you're too jaded to enjoy a film like this then I feel sorry for you."
"eastbergholt2002","9","3","6","29 November 2009"," Entertaining Feel Good Movie
","The Blind Side is a Hollywood feel-good movie. My wife and I saw it with some friends and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. We found it uplifting, inspiring and often funny. However, I saw this movie reviewed on At The Movies and it was given a terrible review so it's not for everyone. The film is based on a true story and was written and directed by John Lee Hancock (The Rookie, The Alamo).<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy a wealthy Memphis decorator. She and her husband send their two kids to a posh private school. One of the students is Big Mike (Quinton Aaron) a poor, homeless black teenager who has been given a football scholarship. Big Mike has an awful life, his mother is a drug addict and he has no father. The Tuohy family find Mike walking in the rain, they take him in and he becomes a member of the family. Big Mike is renamed Michael and becomes a high school football star.<br/><br/>Bullock is brilliant as a tough Southern lady with a heart of gold. She turns Michael's life around by providing him with a loving home and hires a tutor to make sure he gets into college. She even on occasion helps to coach the team. Overall, the Blind Side is an enjoyable and entertaining movie."
"jonahetheredge","1","3","7","14 April 2019"," This is garbage. Borderline propaganda.
","This movie credits Sandra bullocks character for everything that happens. She just swoops in and gives Michael all his ability.

Just another white savior movie with a one dimensional version of the actual hero."
"digitalbeachbum","1","2","4","9 June 2013"," Too much fiction, not enough reality
","I liked this movie the first time I saw it, but I knew it was like all ""based on a true story"". It was sugar coated and made to make people get all teary eyed. There is very little in the movie which I think is actually true and that is why I do not like it now.<br/><br/>For example, the scene where the NCAA investigator tells the ""legal guardian"" that they want to chat with Micheal alone. Huh. No. That's illegal.<br/><br/>You can Google ""The Blind Side is a lie"" to find a link to the NCAA website concerning the real investigation which took place at the HOME and not an office, plus the parents and the author of the book ""The Blind Side: The Evolution of the Game"" were present.<br/><br/>And I quote: ""In the movie, the NCAA investigator is a hard-nosed authoritarian. She tells Bullock's character that she isn't allowed to sit in on the interview with her adopted son, and the interview takes place in an office. Thompson said it is against NCAA policy to refuse a parent or legal guardian from attending the interview.""<br/><br/>In closing, I find most of the movie fake. Just about the only thing real is a big, talented, black guy who played football."

","So I watched the Blind Side last night, well was it good well no. This  movie is the flip side of this blog. One side is to hopefully find  other movie geeks like myself, and create a forum for introducing good  movies to one another. The other is to discredit those that are  supposedly good but lets face it are not. So why would I watch a movie  I normally would not watch. Well, it was Sandra Bullock's academy award  winning performance of course. I looked over the list of past winners  from 1980 on, and one thing stuck out whether the performances were  memorable or not they all came from good flicks. This thing seriously  felt like a made for TV movie. I think the Michael Oher story is truly  incredible, and the family that adopted him just incredible, when I see  pictures of the very white, very rich, and very southern Leigh Anne  Toughy with this enormous black man from the wrong side of the tracks I  admit it brings a tear to my eye. This movie as of the day I wrote this  review has a 7.7 on IMDb, which on their scale is up there among the  best. Each of these reviews is obviously one mans opinion but come on  people, if we continue down this path of calling movies like this good,  America may someday become no better than one of the f'tard nation of  this world. Come on America we can do better, there is better, please  do not allow Mediocrity to become the new gold standard. Come on  everyone U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, say it with me and burn this movie and  melt that statue Sandra Bullock won. Oh and the kid who played Michael  Oher actually did a good job of acting, where is his award."

","The Blind Side is based on a true story staring Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) and Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). Michael ""Big Mike"" is a traumatized boy who becomes an All-American and first-round NFL draft pick player with the help of a caring woman and her family. Leigh Ann sees Michael in the rain one night after her sons school play. He spends the night and ends up staying for Thanksgiving dinner with them the next day. Leigh Ann decides to give Michael a home and the love of a family. She sees that he has a proper education and makes sure he has every opportunity to succeed. When Michael expresses an interest in football, Leigh Ann does everything she can to help him. He doesn't do good in school but can write poems very well. Leigh Ann gets him a tutor to help bring his grads up so he can graduate and attend college. Throughout the movie Michael and Leigh Ann's son S.J. (Jae Head) become very close. S.J. helps Michael train for football and seek fame. He also is his wing man when it comes to meeting college recruiters about playing football in college. Be kind to others and don't judge is the theme to the film The Blind Side. Leigh Anne meets Michael, a homeless boy who she takes under her own wing. Leigh Anne gets a lot of ridicule from her friends but she sticks up for Michael, because he is changing her life for the better. At first she isn't sure if taking Michael in is the right thing but throughout the movie they build an unbreakable relationship that she wouldn't change a thing for. The film shows how important family is and how they can be there for you no matter what. Accepting someone such as Michael into your family is priceless and the film really captures that. There is a scene in the movie where the Tuohy's are taking their family picture for their Christmas card. Leigh Ann tells Michael to get in the picture. He looks very out of place due to his color and clothing but, Michael is family. Leigh Ann's brother calls after receiving the Christmas card and lets her know that there is a colored boy in their photo. He doesn't seem to understand why they have a colored boy in their family photo. Sandra Bullock really does a great job of acting in this film. The film Radio also has a theme of helping others and not judging. It is also a true story of a young underprivileged boy who makes his way into the hearts of the football plays and town. The coach's commitment to helping him is unforgettable. The bond Radio makes with the characters is more important than aptitude, intellect, or athletic ability. Three elements used in the film to help reveal the theme are color, lighting, and angle. The element of color was used a lot, especially in scenes within the household. All over throughout Leigh Ann's house the colors are very natural and inviting. Leigh Ann is a very caring mother and the color scheme presented in the film fits her personality and character perfectly. The lighting in the film is very surreal. The film is shot mostly outside on the football field with natural lighting; however it is also shot in the house with on scene lighting. The different angles the director uses are very important. They convey emotion and set the mood. In one scene in particular all of these elements are used and it's like you were sitting with the family. It's the scene of the Thanksgiving dinner. The family is gathered around Leigh Ann's dining room table. They begin by holding hands and saying prayer. The close up angle of Michaels face represents that he is scared but very thankful to have the Tuohy's in his life. The close up of S.J. nodding his head and looking at his sisters hands lets Michael know that it's OK. The scene is perfect, the room is light by natural lighting thought the windows. The colors and emotion expressed are bright and happy. The different angles bring the setting and mood together, making the movie heart touching and interesting."
"silverslueth","9","2","4","30 March 2010"," A Movie That is More Than the Box Score
","The Blind Side is a film about Michael Oher and his inspirational journey in overcoming adversity, turmoil and an uncertain future. I am not that big on writing reviews of movies especially movies such as the feel good sports one because they all end the same, but for some reason this movie struck a different cord in me. The reason was because the movie focused more on the path to him achieving greatness then just him being good at football. It showed him rise above his GPA of .06 to succeeding to the Dean's list in college. Being a college student myself I can say that in just doing that there should have been enough to have a movie after him, not including the broke past of a drug addicted mother and gang affiliated friends that was leading him towards the short lived life of crime. Obviously the acting was superb, especially Sandra Bullock, but my main focus was on Michael's character. He brought a sense of innocence to the movie that I think can be lost in the script. He brought to his performance emotions that the audience can relate to, especially the depressing and hopeless ones. I think that many people have felt these emotions in their own life, where they think they cannot go on. His performance gives hope and courage to people and show them that they can be lifted above these vices that stain their past. To see the courage in his eyes and the slow smiles when he knew life can change is something that I personally hope everyone can relate to. Slowing know that not only is your life changing but it is because of you is something money could not buy him. The clothes and car was just a material plus but looking past the big and tall shirts and shorts is a man who did it himself and changed his own life.<br/><br/>As an avid movie watcher I would have to rank this on my top ten SPORTS movies just because of the different direction it took. It didn't just focus on the sports aspect but showed his courage to let someone, a total stranger, help him. It showed us to have the courage to take control of our own life because many times people feel as if everyone else just dictates us what to do. It shows us that family is not always the people you are related to, family is the people who love you and care for you regardless of the past or the present. Finally the movie shows that they are people in this world that do good for others regardless of the social norms but instead because it is the right thing to do. In the end doing the right thing can not only change others lives but yours as well.<br/><br/>In closing take what you want from this review but I thought it was not an underrated movie. Though will say that I was skeptical at first, Sandra Bullock did deserve that Oscar because she did more than just read the lines, she captured something that can easily be forgotten. She captured the sense that love and support can surpass any terrible thing past or present and lift us up to places that we thought we could never reach."
"EUyeshima","8","2","4","13 December 2009"," Bullock Makes Her Mark as a Steel-Willed Memphis Belle in an Emotionally Driven Football Drama
","This empathetic 2009 sports-oriented drama is what professional critics would call an uplift film, unabashed in pulling all the necessary emotional cords with an undemanding audience. Screenwriter/director John Lee Hancock is no stranger to the genre since his last two films reflected similar against-all-odds story lines, the Texan band of brothers in ""The Alamo"" and the over-the-hill pitcher in ""The Rookie"". However, there are two key factors that transcend the potentially manipulative structure of Hancock's adaptation of Michael Lewis' intriguing 2006 fact-based book about the evolution of the left tackle in pro football. The first is the irresistible pull of the true-life story of six-foot-six, 345-pound Michael Oher, plucked out of destitution in the Memphis projects by a well-to-do white family to become the starting left tackle at Ole Miss and now with the Baltimore Ravens. The second is Sandra Bullock, bleached blonde, immensely likable, and heavily into no-bull ""Erin Brockovich"" terrain, in a solid performance as Leigh Ann Touhy, the feisty decorator wife and mother who takes Oher into her family home.<br/><br/>The film begins when the coach of a private religious school sees the otherwise lumbering Michael display natural athletic ability on the basketball court. The coach sees untapped potential in Michael as a football player because of his huge size, so much so that he gets accepted despite his poor academic record. It also turns out that the taciturn Michael, referred to by everyone as ""Big Mike"", is homeless, sleeping wherever he can since the state took him away as a child from his crack-addicted mother. The upscale Touhys have noticed him before since he goes to school with their children, S.J. and Collins, but it isn't until they see Michael wandering in the freezing cold that Leigh Anne impulsively takes him in. Despite some initial hesitation, he quickly becomes a part of the family, and his performance at school improves enough for him to show what he can do on the football field. Once Leigh Ann crystallizes the team-as-family metaphor for Michael, the 345-pound behemoth starts to realize his talent for smashing the defensive line. College football coaches from throughout the South come to the Touhy home to recruit Michael aggressively to play for them. Ole Miss is the Touhys' alma mater, which leads to an unexpected but inevitable dramatic turn.<br/><br/>It's not that Bullock does anything all that new in the movie. Rather, it's that she leverages her winning, every-person screen persona so very well within a character that would seem antithetical to her sensibilities as an actress. While it's true that the story probably puts too much emphasis on her character's role in Michael's ascent, Bullock is one of the few film stars today that can generate such an instant rapport with her audience, and she carries the emotional weight of the story with grit and dexterity. As Michael, Quinton Aaron has to be such an impassive presence at the beginning that when he starts to form into his own person, the actor brings a gentle, palpable force to his character's evolution. It's really the scenes between Bullock and Aaron that tug most at the heartstrings (I welled up at least three times during those shrewdly engineered moments). On the sidelines, country singer Tim McGraw plays supportive husband Sean credibly, and there are scene-stealing turns from towheaded Jae Head as the indefatigable S.J. and Kathy Bates in her usual gutsy-broad form as Michael's tutor, Miss Sue. Broadway actress Adriane Lenox - who originated the role of Mrs. Miller in ""Doubt"" - provides the film's most heartbreaking moments as Michael's haunted mother. This is far less a sports movie and more of a story of individual need and the power of family. The film is powerful in that respect."

","First and foremost a note for doubting parents- disregard the PG-13 rated. There are made 5 words and a total of 2 minutes of material that gave it that rating. I think it is suitable for anyone 10+ and I strongly suggest you go as a family.<br/><br/>I wanted to see this movie the first time I saw the trailer because I'm a sucker for a good underdog story and my Dad filled me in on Michael Oher. I can say point blank it was so moving that I'm still thinking about it two days later. It did a wonderful job of show casing a blessed family, blessing someone in need and changing as people along the way. I was very pleased with how well they handled the Christian ideal throughout the film so that it was clear what the Touhys morals were, yet not being preachy. I adored Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne because when I looked at her I saw my mom in every possible way... A tough cookie on the outside, but soft as snow on the inside. The young actor that played SJ captured my heart because he was so pure and sincere about everything he did. I had just wrapped up a series at my church about how it is important to remember the ways you are blessed and find ways to bless others in need so the movie fit right in with that. No matter what your race, religion, age, gender, social class, or even political affiliation is I hope you come out of the theater inspired."

","The Blind Side does nothing short but hit home, Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw do a phenomenal job of coming together to take in this man who is homeless and rugged looking. While raising two other children of their own, and fighting the many battles of two, very much Caucasian taking in an African American. On a side note who is freakishly tall to say the least. Most would be quick to judge and assume that he is stealing from them, or using them. But ""Big Mike"" was just grateful to have a home and a place to lay his head at night. He didn't know how to react or what to expect because he had been homeless for so long. His mother was a drug addict and was not able to provide for him. When Leigh Ann (Sandra Bullock) observes this she acts fast on taking him home, and what was thought to just be a few nights turned into Leigh Ann and Sean (Tim McGraw) adopting him and eventually sending him off to college. This changed both his life and their own and their children as well. You can easily see that this film contains a drama theme. While it could also be a ""sport"" themed movie, due to Michael becoming a well renown football star, I really think that drama is the most important piece here.<br/><br/>Sandra and Tim do an excellent job, parenting together, bringing this man into their lives, despite the judgements they Receive from people in the community. As well as the judgements that SJ and Collins are thrown into for being white and being around Michael is is not white. Those are just some prime examples of why this has a theme of drama. Michael had been in and out of schools, and Leigh Ann wanted him enrolled in the private Christian school where the other kids are going, while he really struggled with school due to being in and out of the school system, his athletic ability is what got him into this private school.<br/><br/>The acting by all characters is nothing short of excellent, these specific actors work really well together and make this film seem more realistic as it is based on a true story. I would say that motif is a common and appropriate technique, due to the repetitive judgments that the family is getting for taking Michael in, the other important technique is lighting, especially in the scenes where Michael is in the field playing football. All of this easily ties together making this a drama film, also showing the love that this family creates for Michael to make him feel at home, and feel accepted into their family."

","The Blind Side is the story of Michael Oher who overcomes incredible struggles as a youth and eventually finds himself playing professional football for the Baltimore Ravens. Quinton Aaron plays the gentle giant, Michael Oher. Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw play Michael's adoptive parents, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy. Kathy Bates stars as Michael's tutor and friend, Miss Sue. Many actual college coaches make appearances through out the film such as Lou Holtz and Nick Saban.<br/><br/>To say that Michael Oher is an overcomer would be an understatement. From a young age, Michael had to deal with a mom that was a drug addict. His father passed away and he was left on his own. Being passed from one foster house to another, then living on the streets, he eventually crosses paths with a man named Burt Cotton that was the coach of a high school football team. Michael's size and athletic ability made him a perfect fit to join Coach Cotton's team. Michael becomes friends with a younger student named SJ, and is eventually taken in by SJ's family, the Tuohy's.<br/><br/>Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy care for Michael as if he were one of their own children. Leigh Anne connects with him like any mother connects with her son. She fights for him and pushes him to grow academically, with the help of Miss Sue, as well as on the football field. The Tuohy's make sure that Michael is not only on track to get a high school diploma, but that he also will be able to continue his education while playing college football. Their alma mater, Ole Miss, would be their top choice for Michael but knew the decision had to be his own. He meets with many different Division I coaches and struggles with what would be the right decision for his future. Some people in the NCAA thought the Tuohy's care of and interest in Michael was born out of their desire to make sure he played football for Ole Miss. The NCAA authorities even begin to make Michael question the Tuohy's sincerity. Eventually, after returning to his old neighborhood and realizing how far he has come with the help of his new family, Michael casts away all his doubt of Leigh Anne and Sean and returns home.<br/><br/>Michael does eventually pick Ole Miss, but not because the Tuohy's wanted him to. He does it because he felt like it was were his family goes to college. He had found his true home with his forever family. Not since Remember the Titans had a sports film had such a strong impact on so many viewers. Michael Oher's strength in character shines through the actor honored to portray him in this movie. He deserves all of the success that he achieved through his perseverance and hard work.<br/><br/>The director does amazing work showing the contrast between Michael's original neighborhood and the surroundings that he is eventually brought into. The settings make the viewer feel that the scenes were actually filmed in Michael's home town. Pulling the actual college coaches in to meet with Michael for recruiting purposes was another incredible aspect of the film making it feel that much more true to real life."

Her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy has to be, to date, the best of her career (and my all time favourite of her performances). Even when Tuohy is cold or harsh, you still fall for her. Love and empathy just radiates from her character, no matter the situation.<br/><br/>Another honorable mention goes to Quinton Aaron playing the wayward teenager, Michael Oher. Initially, he exudes the lack of self confidence and childlike qualities that you would expect from a kid that has been abandoned by his drug dependant mother. After being bounced around the system, he ends up couch surfing for a while but ultimately ends up homeless when he meets the Tuohy's.<br/><br/>You don't have to love Football to love this movie, but it sure is better if you do!<br/><br/>Excellent movie; well worth your time!"

","Fondue, Margherita Pizza & The Blind Side... 3 of the cheesiest things to ever grace this world. The Blind Side takes a heartwarming, charming story and turns the cringe up to a solid 10/10.<br/><br/>The story takes us through the life of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) as he meets Sandra Bullock's Leigh Ann and has his life drastically turned around for the better. The narrative is the most alluring aspect of this movie, with the 'real-life' story of Michael and Leigh Ann's relationship providing most of the sentimentality. Michael is a loveable, gentle-giant that you instantly warm up to and Sandra Bullock provides a career best performance as the no-nonsense, (very) southern, cheerleader mom who takes Michael into her family home and under her wing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. The boring cinematography and the laughable score, reeked of TV Movie standards and at some points the film felt like a Disney Channel Original Film (and not a good one). The script was held back by it's cheesy dialogue and forceful attempts at humour (including an uncomfortable James Corden esque Carpool Kareoke that goes horribly wrong). The script offers no surprises and follows a very formulaic rythm, with most of the film being very easy to predict.<br/><br/>Despite Sandra Bullock performing at her best, the cast still left a lot to be desired. RJ (Jae Head) was just wholly annoying ; the writer clearly not being able to write for kids, and Lily Collins' coincidentally named 'Collins' was a blank canvas of a character. The only stand out performance was a brief cameo from Kathy Bates -who is always brilliant- whereas the rest of the supporting cast seemed to be exaggerated caricatures (Including some scenes of Bullock's Leigh Ann).<br/><br/>A corny score, cheesy dialogue, ridiculous characters, vapid acting and a predictable narrative leaves the Blind Side fumbling on a 4th down and long.<br/><br/>4/10."

However, this story is really about a man's fortune being turned around by a loving woman and family, and in turn, he also changing their lives forever for the better.
The theme of this film is that we can never judge a book by its cover. In this film we see Leigh Anne's compassion and Michael's true character turning into a lifelong bond between the Tuohy family and Michael Oher.
Michael is a very large African American man, and many people may be afraid of him just by looking at him. Leigh Anne meets him, and quickly they begin to bond. She looks past his physical traits and she can see the man that he truly is. In the film, she invites him to stay for a night. That turns into him staying every other night; at first, her husband, Sean, seems to be a little hesitant. However, she is a very strong-willed woman and convinces him that it is the right thing to do.
Throughout the film, we see Michael's fortune completely turned around, but we also see the Tuohy family's lives changed for the better because of Michael. We see at the beginning of the film that Leigh Anne's daughter is not on board with bringing him in. She is very skeptical, and I believe afraid of him. Once she realizes the person that he is, you see a bond grow between them and a brother-sister bond form.
This film reminded me of watching Coach Carter. Another sports film, but it was about a person who cared more than just what happened on the court, or in the case of The Blind Side, on the field. Coach Carter and Leigh Anne Tuohy's compassion for the people in their lives and not caring as much about what they do in sports, but what impact they could have on a young person's life in directing them in the right direction.
When watching this film, I thought the filmmakers did a great job of using different film angles to show how big Michael was, compared to other people. He is a very large man and the filmmakers used camera angles to enhance his size and spotlight his overall size compared to others. The filmmakers also kept using the motif of lower-class vs. the upper class in this film. We repeatedly see people questions Leigh Anne and her motives. We see them make it obvious to see who the upper class was and who was a lower class by clothing, homes, vehicles, etc. Showing was important because Michael was a homeless man, and the Touhy family were very wealthy.
The Blind Side is a heart-warming film about how compassion towards other lives can be changed forever. Michael and Leigh Anne show us that you can't judge a book by its cover. Both characters come with their own biases based on their social statuses. However, in this film both people show their true character, and they both benefited from a lifelong bond."

","A movie based on a touching true story. The male lead is a tall, well built kid. He makes me think of my son, who is of the same appearance. It is interesting when he appears with the little and short son of his adopted family.<br/><br/>In addition to the female lead, i think the male lead is also worthy of an award. His role is a quiet boy with not much facial expression. But he is cute and innocent even in such a role. His acting, to me, is more captivating than the female lead.<br/><br/>The movie is like a male version Snow White, proving that the world is still full of hope and love."

","... but the Real Leigh Ann Tuohy must be excited to be portrayed by Sandra Bullock. I only just found out Sandra won an Oscar for this Perfomance. IMO that gives the Oscar Award a complete different value: Sandra Bullock played her role just like any other before! There was really nothing new, Special or extraordinary. Please think of Leonardo DiCaprio, it took him Ages to win an Oscar and he did so many different roles with a much wider Performance.<br/><br/>Anyway, as a European this movie shocked me to be honest.
The movie started so nice, everyone was nice, everything turned out good, no arguements fell, no agression, no doubts or rethinking of decisions. I waited the whole movie to the Point where the Boy hits someone, steals or something dramatic would happen. It just didn't. Well yeah, when he went back in his Hood - this was quite realisitc. More of this needed to happen, to make this movie into something that has to do with real human Feelings.<br/><br/>This movies had 2 sides: Fantasy and reality.
The Fantasy side was obviously the White Family, living the dream, picking up a stray black Boy from the street, try to adopt him, making him into whatever they think is good for him without asking. Leigh Ann was a saint, she was beautiful and had perfect Kids. She managed everything so stepford wifish, it was creepy.
The Reality side was Michael. I work with drug addicted children who already have lived on the streets. How they descibed his life, losing his home, brother and mother and father, everything that happened to him, beeing in High School but not able to read and write correctly - yes! That is absolutly possible and happens often. Could have been a White Kid also.
Non realitstic however was his behaviour. Having experienced so much pain, loss and bonding issues this kid is unlikely to just be Kind and nice.<br/><br/>Now let me rant: Oh Gosh! What was it with this stupid Thing about his intelligence: he has no IQ but his skills in protecting are at 95% - lets make him a Football Player. What?
Also, the husband? Please - he owns Tacco Bell, KFC and I dunno what, brings home millions of Money but the wife just decides everything. This men has no rights whatsover in this Family. I feels it is all about Leigh Ann and showing how good she is. It really made me cringe so often. I just could not enjoy this cool Story made so stereotypically.
The worst really was one of the last Scenes. Leigh Ann read out some newspaper Storys about missing children or a child beeing killed on the streets. She was greatful to god that is wasn't her child, she smiled and thanked god.
Lord! It still was someones child! That left me really angry when the cedits rolled."

","The Blind Side is a sports drama story based on true events. It is the Story of how one very large teenage boy who has not had an easy life makes it to the National Football League. Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron is a teenage boy who has been in out of foster homes his whole life. Michael gets the opportunity to go to a private school. At the private school he meets the Tuohy family. The Tuohy's are made up of Leigh Anne Tuohy a southern belle who knows how to get things done played by Sandra Bullock, Sean Tuohy the Husband of Leigh Anne Tuohy played by Tim McGraw, the families two children S.J.

Michael and the Tuohy family's lives will change forever.<br/><br/>The very power theme of the movie is that individuals can overcome their circumstance if given the right opportunities and when they make the right choices. Throughout the movie Michael and the Tuohy family have to face some challenging choices. They all have to make sacrifices and they all get the chance to learn from each other. The Blind Side reminds me of a movie called Rudy. The two movies are completely different stories but in both movies you have a young man who faces hard odds and come out on top.
In the movie The Blind Side, director John Lee Hancock uses great lighting and camera angles to make the story come to life. When Michael is on the football field you are on the football field as well. The sounds in the movie match perfectly to the feelings of what the viewer is watching. Sounds are the best effect in the movie. The sounds, be it the dialogue, sound effects or music are very well done. In one scene Michael gets into the car accident. He is driving his truck when out of the blue, he hits another vehicle. The smashing of the truck into the other truck, the brakes squealing, the sound of the airbag being deployed and the smashing of the glass is so real it makes the views feel like they saw the accident in person.<br/><br/>The Blind Side is entertaining with outstanding performances and great dialogue. This is definitely a movie worth the 129 minutes of run time. I recommend this movie for family viewing."

","""Blindside"" is a great portrayal of a movie showing the struggle for human dignity. Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) plays a young man thrown from place to place because of a mother on drugs. Through this journey of living from one place to another, one family helped to get him into a Christian School, and the meeting of the Tuohy's, Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw). Their journey together becomes the epitome of the movie. 
 This movie helps you see both sides of the story and the conflict of both. You have Michael who was brought up with nothing and the Tuohy's who have it all. Through the relationship that they formed, it helped to open the eyes of Tuohy's of how fortunate they have it. Because of the relationship that was formed with the Tuohy's, it shows how not to judge the rich no more than you judge the poor. Through the interactions between Michael's past and the Tuohy's present the Tuohy's learned a lot about not to take things for granted. 
 After Michael starts to play football, hearing and seeing the crowd of rednecks and southern prejudices it is clear of the struggles that needed to be overcome, not only by the crowd but the opposing team. Through it all, Leigh Ann and the rest of the Tuohy's showed Michael he was loved and was there for him, which is something unheard of for someone from projects of Memphis. Another movie that comes to mind similar to ""Blindside"" would be ""Remember the Titans"". Both movies show the struggles of a black athlete trying to make his way into a white mans world. 
 The scenes were very believable in the ""Blindside"", from the projects where Michael grew up and the gangs all around to the school that Michael goes to with the Tuohy's. 
 This is one of my favorite movies to watch, a comfort movie if you will. It shows that a never give up attitude along with not letting your past make you who you will be in the future and that you can succeed no matter where you come from. To me this movie helps to show people that you should never judge a person for where they come but see them for who they are. This not only applies to Michael but also the Tuohy's, poor or rich, everyone deserves to be treated equally until they lose that privilege. 
 Very good movie and I a well recommended movie to anyone. You don't need to be a sports fan to enjoy this movie, but a fan of seeing good conquer over bad."

","One of my favorite movies of all time is The Blind Side. The Blind Side is a film based on the true story about Michael Oher, who went from being a homeless black teen to a professional football player. When Michael is walking outside alone at night the Tuohys give him a place to stay. The Tuohys not only welcome Michael into their home and pay for his education, but also give him a real family. Although Michael struggles with his academics, his large build lends itself to football. Working hard on and off the field, Michael accepts a football scholarship to the University of Mississippi, and later becomes a first round NFL draft pick. The Blind Side is and inspiring movie that everyone should watch.<br/><br/>The movie is really about what it means to be a family. Most people would say that their family consists of their mother, father, and siblings. Although Micheal clearly loves his mother, she struggles with addiction and is unable to support him. As a result, Michael was taken out of her care from a young age and wanders in and out of the foster care system. When Leigh Ann Tuohy sees Michael walking alone at night with no where to stay, she opens up her home. At first, the viewer wonders why she makes makes the decision. The decision seems impulsive, and her motives are unclear. Is she planning to use Michael to make herself look better? I would argue that at this point there really was not much to her decision besides instinct. She was not trying to calculate how much that one decision would change her life, but was just doing what felt right in that moment. However, as the movie progresses the viewer sees their relationship grow. Tuohys and Michael become a family overtime. They care about how he is doing and want to she him accomplish his dreams. Your family is there to support you, and that is what the Tuohys are able to do for Michael. <br/><br/>The main issue people have with ""The Blind Side"" is that it is racist. You have a poor black boy from the projects with a crackhead mother taken in by a generous and affluent white family who gives him a chance at a better future. I think that it is unfair that this movie has to criticized for the racial oppression that is intrenched in American society. While race is definitely apart of the story, which takes place in Tennessee after all, I do not think that movie tries to bring down African Americans. The reality is that many African Americans are living in the projects because of the racism which still exists in our society. Its a movie which is not necessarily trying to tackle the bigger issues in our society, but does show them. African Americans do not have the same opportunities as white people, and the director has to show that. Michael is a poor black kid from the projects, and the Tuohys' did open a lot of doors for Michael. However, the movie is not only about what the Tuohys' did for him, but also why they did it. The director presents the movie in this way because the movie is meant to uplift everyone in the audience.<br/><br/>I like watching this film because it is an inspiring rags to riches story. We all like to see the heroes prevail. Except this movie has a team of heroes. While Michael is the one who overcomes poverty he was born into and becomes a football star, his success is a team effort. 
The movie brings together people of who are different races and have different political opinions, but who all care about seeing Michael succeed. They all help Michael achieve something and become someone he may not have been able to on his own. The viewer sees people doing what they can and working together to help him. They share in Michael's triumphs, challenges, and defeats. The movie shows that when people working together and help each other incredible things can happen. It is a great movie, and you do not need to understand sports to enjoy it because it is really about family and hope."

","Oftentimes, the opportunity to change someone's life completely is disguised as an isolated random act of kindness. John Lee Hancock's 2009 feature The Blind Side starring Tim McGraw and Sandra Bullock in a career-defining role shows just how far a series of kind acts can go towards changing someone's life and giving them purpose. Seventeen-year-old Michael Oher could have been like the thousands of other disadvantaged persons of color ending up in gangs or victims of violence had it not been for the intervention of one family from Tennessee. In a world where everyone had given up on him, Michael Oher just needed one reason to shine, which he got, and it all started with a new shirt.<br/><br/>One rainy night after a high school basketball game, Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is walking back to the gym, hoping to find some food left behind and a dry bleacher to sleep under. Also leaving the game are Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock), Sean (Tim McGraw), Collins (Lily Collins), and S.J. (Jae Head) Tuohy, an affluent family from Memphis. Seeing the cold, wet young man walking aimlessly in the rain, Leigh Anne instructs her husband to pull over and check on him. When Michael indicates that he is intending to sleep in the gymnasium Leigh Anne insists that he stay overnight with them, intending to figure out his situation in the morning. When the sun rises, it is revealed that Michael has no permanent address, and has gained entry to his exclusive high school through a favor of a friend. Leigh Anne then buys Michael some clothes and designates a room for him in her home, bringing him into their family. As their time together progresses, it is clear the impact the Tuohy family is having on Michael, but what is unexpected is the impact Michael is having on the Tuohy's. Michael is teaching the constantly busy philanthropist Tuohy family to come together more as a family and enjoy their time together, and more importantly, to rise above the societal expectations of their wealth and to always do the right thing. In the deep south, the presence of an African American teenager in a rich white family is heavily judged against and misunderstood by friends and family alike. Nothing will get in the way of Leigh Anne, however, and when Michael shows an interest in football, she stops at nothing to instruct the coach on how to motivate Michael on the playing field and goes the distance to help him qualify for play by improving his grades. When Michael proves to have a natural ability toward football, scouts instantly start noticing him and offering scholarships. After Michael plays for a Division 1 football team, he is selected in the NFL draft in 2009. None of the opportunities that befell upon Michael would have been possible without the Tuohy's, going to show just how much positive impact people can have on one another when they set their mind to it.<br/><br/>The Blind Side wastes no time outlining its message, opening the film with video of the break heard 'round the world. The opening shot of the infamous tackle of Lawrence Taylor to Joe Theismann and the way it changed the game of football was a perfect opener to introduce the left tackle highlighted in the film. The film was also bookended well with mention of Lawrence Taylor at the end of the film as well, wrapping together the vehicle that paved the way for Michael Oher's brand of football. Sandra Bullock looks as good as I have ever seen her on-screen, completely capturing the heart and attitude of the real Leigh Anne Tuohy, more than earning her well- deserved Oscar. This film teetered the line between serious and fun in an exquisite way, never disrespecting the real family, and never being too much of a tear-jerker in the wrong places. One of the best examples of this tight-rope walk is the cameos of all the famous college football coaches that made their way into the film. The coaches were a great way to conceptualize the process and a great deal of fun for college football fans in the audience. Kathy Bates as the democrat tutor, the first democrat the Tuohy's ever knew personally to be exact, was a fun addition to the film. It was also nice to see the real Tuohy family pictures as the credits rolled on. The story of the courageous kindness of the Tuohy family is an exemplary example to all of us and a well-needed dose of goodness for the world to see. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's portrayal as a protective, independent, take no nonsense mother was the shining part of The Blind Side. Her brand of ruthless kindness and an unwavering moral compass was a refreshing change on the common female character that blends into the background. There is no blending with Bullock's portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy, she is clearly in charge of her family and seeks to raise upstanding human beings, whether they are related or not. Her bringing in of Michael Oher into the family was a wonderful mutually beneficial gesture, and one that sticks with the audience to emulate in whatever way is feasible for them."

The film focuses on the relationships that characters develop, and how these relationships change the characters.<br/><br/>The character progression throughout the movie creates a sense of personality, allowing you to be empathetic towards them and therefore pull you more into the story. The variation of ages and personalities makes the film appealing to everyone in the family because it is easy to identify with one or multiple characters in The Blind Side. The movie portrays the struggles of this unusual family in a comedic yet touching way, leaving you feeling uplifted. The movie does a really great job of reflecting the feelings the real Touhy family experienced during the early days of Michael Ohre's football career and life as part of their family. <br/><br/>Watching the movie alone brings back the best feelings of growing up in a happy family, and makes you appreciate the things you had on an everyday basis that others were not fortunate enough to have. Aside from bringing back memories, the Touhy family is an inspiration through their love and compassion for Michael. Michael returns the feelings in his own subtle ways that prove how grateful he is to his family. <br/><br/>Watching this movie is guaranteed to uplift and inspire all ages.

","The juggernauts of gridiron cinema—such as Rudy and Remember the Titans— almost all have one thing in common: they're unapologetically formulaic, but they're also extraordinarily well done. Sports movies of one variety or another are produced every year, but it's rare that any of them really leave a lasting impression on the collective American consciousness. More often than not, they're nothing more than exercises in the art of telling the classic inspiration story; you know, the faithful underdog overcoming crushing odds (think ""David and Goliath""). In Rudy, it was all about a runt with larger-than-life aspirations. In John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side, it's all about a larger-than-life (literally) teen who just wants a bed he can call his own. He's not thinking about what will happen years down the road; he's only thinking about where he'll find his next meal.<br/><br/>It's based on the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a down- and-out Memphis teen who regularly wanders in and out of foster homes. His mother is a coke-fiend, and he has no family to watch after him. However, thanks to the generosity of a friend, he's introduced to the football coach of a private Christian school and is admitted on the basis of his formidable athletic presence. Michael still has no home, however; he picks up half-eaten bags of popcorn at his school's gym after volleyball games so he's able to eat. He spends his evenings keeping warm inside a local laundromat.<br/><br/>One night, Leigh Anne Tuohy, the wife of a wealthy fast-food entrepreneur, sees him walking the streets and brings him home. Her family provides him with new clothing and a bed of his own. All of this happens so quickly, in fact, that my first instinct was to say, ""Wow— this would never happen."" The whole setup, in fact, seems so naively optimistic that it screams Hollywood contrivance. However, there's one catch to all this that's easy to forget: like the previously mentioned Rudy, it's a true story. As such, the movie has, to a certain degree, some wiggle room in terms of exploring scenarios that would otherwise reverberate as totally unrealistic or totally clichéd. I suppose, however, that clichés sometimes receive their namesake because they are, in fact, reality for so many people.<br/><br/>To my surprise, this fact actually causes The Blind Side to excel where other movies might've fizzled. The whole thing—though often derivative— feels very ""matter-of-fact."" The deeper into the story you go, the more genuine it feels. Wisely, Hancock has chosen to spin his tale by letting the actors and a steady camera do the work. There are no overly dramatic camera angles, and the soundtrack is minimal. The dialogue is a little over-the-top at times, but it's not so much that's distracting. Really, what we get here are a lot of unadorned scenes that depict our protagonist going about his daily activities, merely trying to survive. The 128-minute runtime does start to wear a little thin as things come to a close, but it's hard to imagine much of the story being cut. I guess that's one of the difficulties of telling a ""true story"": it's often hard to know what is essential and what's extracurricular.<br/><br/>What really stands out in The Blind Side, however, is its penchant for probing the social class divide that so many Americans either ignore or pretend doesn't exist. Despite its references to Norman Rockwell and the plight of the working poor, I'm not quite ready to heap unconditional praise on the movie. It's exploration of these concepts is far from subtle, and is often presented in such a way as to almost shout, ""Hey, stupid! Do something about this!"" It's not that I question the film's call to action, it's just that its presentation is like a brick to the forehead. We're bombarded with images of dirty apartments, broken homes, and life ""on the other side of the tracks."" My hope was that the movie's early use of flashback would get this particular job done in a much more subtle way, but Hancock and co. decided to take a more blunt approach that, in my estimation, takes a little something away from the overall ""bite.""<br/><br/>So, what are my final thoughts on The Blind Side?<br/><br/>It's frequently gooey and predictable. At times its unabashed desire to make you blubber like an infant will be infuriating. Oddly enough, though, it's also very genuine, and no one can deny the inherent truth of its many messages."

","The Blind Side is written and directed by John Lee Hancock. It stars Sandra Bullock, Quinton Aaron, Tim McGraw, Jae Head, Lily Collins and Kathy Bates. Music is scored by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Alar Kivilo.<br/><br/>17 year old Michael Oher (Aaron) has been denied a stable upbringing in a loving family, wandering the streets devoid of an education of note and perhaps one step away from falling in with the wrong crowd? Big Mike is taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Bullock) and her family. Motives and means will be questioned elsewhere, but Leigh Anne taps into Big Mike's psyche and unearths a potential football star, but he, and the Tuhoy family, must overcome obstacles first.<br/><br/>A big hit at the box office whilst garnering Bullock the Academy award for Best Actress, The Blind Side is proof positive that in a world that is often crappy, a simple button pushing movie can soar high and provide airy relief. Based on a true story, the film never lacks for emotional thrust, it is undeniably a sweet, and at times, uplifting picture, yet it lacks a dramatic edge, a boldness to really make the story grab you around the throat, forcing us to gasp for the emotional air floating up there in the sky. There's a tangible feeling of manipulation, a good ole whitey saves the down on his luck black fella narrative, where regardless of truth, it's a bit annoying to see Michael Oher (you know, the guy who the story is about) playing second fiddle throughout.<br/><br/>With scenes involving Oher's mother (Adriane Lenox) lacking any emotional gravitas and the trips to the Ghetto devoid of genuine grit, Hancock is fortunate that the audience reaching out for some uplift was prepared to forgive these errors. That he had Bullock on top form also helps considerably. He should be commended for getting a performance of such unswerving charisma from her, even if it relegates everyone else around her to the sidelines. It was a role Bullock kept turning down (it had been offered to Julia Roberts first), she wasn't sure she could portray well enough such as strong religious lady as Leigh Anne Tuhoy, but eventually she signed on and etched her name into the annals of Academy Award winners.<br/><br/>If it's the best actress performance of 2009 is up for much debate, as is if it is even Bullock's best career performance in fact? But undeniably it's a star turn that manages to hide the failings lurking under the sweetly stitched quilt pieced together by Hancock. In Bullock's hands the Tuhoy character holds our attention throughout with a mixture of strength, spunk and unflinching beliefs. If she's shouting down a redneck idiot, correcting a football coach or fronting up to a big mouth Ghetto leader, she has us firmly on side and eating out of her hands. She's the main draw card here, which is both a blessing and a hindrance. Best to roll up for this one expecting to be moved and cheered, but be prepared for a lack of complexity and guts. 7/10"

","The first part of this film, dealing with the growing relationship between Michael and his new family, was heart-warming and excellent. Sandra Bullock was delightful as the iron-willed Mom. The boy, S.J., was used only for humour, which was a shame. Much more could have been made of the girl, Collins, if only for eye candy and to take some of the spotlight off Ms. Bullock. The Dad was pretty much a non-entity. But I thought by far the best part of the movie was about the relationships among all these people. Did everything really go that smoothly inside the family? I doubt it. A lot more could have been done with the family.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I was moved by the film. Then came the football part, which was pure Hollywood schlock. Oh my goodness, it's the big game, and guess who's not succeeding? I think I'm gonna have a heart attack. Time's running out. He's going to fail, he's going to let everybody down. Oh, no! But wait. Wait! Can it be, is it true? Glory hallelujah, in the nick of time, he's redeemed himself. Cue the victory music and crank it up loud. Ycchh! For me all that entirely predictable storyline, that stale old sequence seen in hundreds and hundreds of movies coming out of Hollywood, purely paint-by-numbers plotting, took a whole lot of the polish off what otherwise could have been a much, much better film. Shame on the scriptwriter who let himself be talked into that junk."

","You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy this story of helping others. Its competent for what it is.<br/><br/>Bullock is good. She does not overact. Lucky it wasn't a heavy competition year or she might not have won for this role which didn't require that much acting.<br/><br/>The movie avoids sentimentality. The only thing is the saintliness of Leigh Ann and her family is almost hard to swallow.

","Micheal Oher (Quinton Aaron) was a large black kid who grew up in the Memphis projects living on people's couches because his crack addicted mom was unfit to take care of him. One day, Tony Hamilton (Omar J Dorsey), trying to enroll his kid into Wingate Christian School, also gets Micheal enrolled in the school. Moving from place to place to find shelter, Michael finally comes across Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw) who invite him to stay at their house, and eventually invite him to be a part of their family.<br/><br/>The story of Micheal Oher is really a quite amazing one. Oher traveled from place to place never really having a place to stay, until he was invited by the Tuohy's to stay with them. Having never remained in a school for more than a year, and failing miserably, the Tuohy's helped him raise his grades to be able to play football (and basketball) in school. Eventually this lead to him being one of the most sought after high school players for college recruiters. Just before the 2009 NFL season he became a first round draft pick for the Baltimore Ravens and became the 2009 Rookie of the Year. With such an amazing story of ""rags to riches"" how does Oher's story translate to film? Very well. One thing that surprised me, and I found refreshing was the fact that a such an openly Christian family was actually treated respectfully and without ridicule. I say this because the movie itself actually has a genuine spirit to it, it doesn't completely feel like a by the numbers inspirational sports movie. The writing does a great job at keeping many of the true things that happened in real life in the movie, moving things around as is typically necessary for screen stories, without making things feel forced. As sports movies go, this movie feels fresher than many that have come in recent years.<br/><br/>This, of course, is the movie that not only earned Sandra Bullock her first Oscar nomination, but her first Oscar win as well and for good reason. Playing a character based on a real person is already a daunting task, but for an actress known most for playing America's sweetheart type roles, playing a strong willed genuinely philanthropic Christian woman is definitely not an easy task, but Bullock equips herself well and steals the movie. And Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher does a fantastic job playing Oher as a person who is shy, quiet, and even somewhat cynical, but doesn't allow his cynicism to define him. Throughout the film we watch these layers removed as he becomes more ingrained in the Tuohy household.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie is some of the changes they felt the need to make to this already fantastic true story. Michael Oher already knew how to play football before being placed on the team at Briarcrest (the real school that he attended while in the Tuohy home). Making it seem as though he didn't, to me, is an insult to the true character this film is trying to portray. On top of that the story, as portrayed in the film, is a little too good to be true. Having researched the matter a bit there's a lot in the real account of the story that does seem that way, but there was also a bit more struggle to get Micheal's grade's up, and he also wasn't the perfect teen that they depict him as in the movie. This lack of an inner struggle for the main character, as well as the lack of an outer struggle throughout most of the movie drags it down a few notches.<br/><br/>All in all, I think it was a really good movie, and while it might not, in my opinion, be an Oscar worthy movie on the best picture front, its definitely one of the better inspirational sports movies to come out in recent memory. Check it out for the performances, the heart warming story, and the inspiration that you will derive from it.<br/><br/>3.5/5"

","This 2009 drama follows the Touhy family as they learn that love and compassion reach past what makes them different. When Leighann Touhy (played by Sandra Bullock) meets Michael Oher, she is immediately drawn to him. After a difficult childhood with an absentee Father and drug addict Mother, the African American teenager was homeless and fending for himself. After much persistence, Leighann convinces Michael to spend time with her family. He quickly finds that he has a place within the family despite their obvious differences. With the help of Leighan, her husband Shawn (played by Tim McGraw), daughter Collins, and son SJ, Michael becomes a star football player who completes his high school diploma and earns a college football scholarship.<br/><br/>One great example of Leighann Touhy's love for Michael is when she travels to speak with his Mother. Leighan wanted to adopt Michael, but knew needed permission from his Mother. In order to do that, Leighann had to travel to a dangerous part of town and risk her safety. Leighann know the dangers of this neighborhood from a previous trip with Michael where he made her stay in the car. This word of caution from Michael did not stop her from making this trip alone. She did this knowingly and willingly because she wanted to give Michael a permanent place in their family. <br/><br/>To portray the danger in the neighborhood, the scene was shot in an area with run-down apartments that were close together. The element of fear for Leighann's safety was the use of people to crowd the neighborhood in small groups. This example plays on the common fear that women are in danger when they travel alone. A technique that was used to give viewers the idea that Michael's Mother's apartment was run-down was the use of lighting. The lighting was dark, giving the impression that the house was dingy. <br/><br/>While the story of The Blind Side is in a class all of its own, parts of the story do resemble that of the 2003 movie Radio. Both movies are about strangers who come across a child in need. Through love and understanding these strangers take these children and help them to find their true potential in the game of football. They teach that love reaches beyond differences. It sees no color, social class, or social norms. Love is pure and unconditional and this is demonstrated in both movies."

","I don't have too much to say about "" The Blind Side"" . Sandra Bullock looses herself in the role of Leigh Ann Touhy who practically adopts a young African American teenager and takes him off the path to becoming a sad statistic and puts him on one to success. She does this through a shock and awe campaign of southern charm and sassy attitude ( having a boatload of money doesn't hurt). Her character looms so large in the movie as to eclipse everyone else even Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) who you would have thought would be the center of the story. I like many others was taken in by Bullock's performance but for all of the attention ""The Blind Side"" received it was a pretty lightweight movie."

","Sandra Bullock won the Oscar for best actress in her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy who became ""mom"" to this extra large boy without a family or home.<br/><br/>The movie begins with film clips of the 1995 incident where linebacker Lawrence Taylor puts quarterback Joe Thiesman out of commission, for good, hitting him from his ""BLIND SIDE"", and thus making the left tackle (for right handed QBs) the most important lineman. This movie is the story of a lost oversize boy who became a left tackle.<br/><br/>Quinton Aaron, a young 6-8 actor from the Bronx, is Michael Oher, a gentle giant of a boy whose mother and father were always in trouble and he finds himself homeless. The Tuohy family notices that he attends school basketball games and stays to pick up food, uneaten popcorn etc so that he can survive. Leigh Ann is a generous person and, with two school children already, decides to give Michael a couch for the night, then eventually a shopping trip for clothes and his own bedroom. The Tuohys eventually also become his legal guardian.<br/><br/>Factually Michael became an all-star high school football tackle, and played at Ole Miss, the alma mater of the Tuohys. And now he has become a first-round pick in the NFL draft. But the story isn't about football, it is about how much can be done when we allow ourselves to look beyond ethnic, racial, and economic differences to actually help others and make a difference.<br/><br/>Tim McGraw is very effective as the dad, Sean Tuohy, former star Ole Miss basketball player and now the owner of a large number of fast-food outlets. His son SJ is Jae Head. Brit Lily Collins (daughter of singer Phil Collins) is good as the daughter Collins Tuohy.<br/><br/>Part of the story is the task of getting Michael's grades up to a 2.5 average so that he would be eligible for division 1 sports, and Kathy Bates is excellent in the role of Miss Sue who the Tuohys hire to be Michael's personal tutor.<br/><br/>Excellent, touching story."

","As a cinefile, we expect two different (and often separate) things whenever we go to the movies to review a film: a) we expect a deep and intelligent story that will stir our minds and drive us into thinking about any number of topics and the artistry employed in interpreting them on screen, and b) we expect to be moved, touched, impressed, rushed, scared and/or any other verb which applies to making the film memorable and making it, more than a pastime, a viewing experience. Most importantly, it's a rare (and I DO mean rare) feat when a movie fulfills both expectations, and it's films like those that make us film critics rush at our laptops and start pounding away excitedly at the guilt-less keyboard. One such film is the one I've recently returned from watching, namely John Lee Hancock's ""The Blind Side."" The premise is simple and, to a point, overused: poor African-American kid with no hopes in this world and no brains to call his own gets the attention of a white, Christian family who help him smart up, discover his talent and subsequently lead him (through a number of emotional scenes) to success in his area of expertise, usually sports (football). ""The Blind Side"" is the very same thing. It's a poor kid (Quinton Aaron), who looks retarded but is actually quite intelligent and who comes from an abusive, coke-inducing family in some ghetto finding a rich, happy, white family, spear-headed by a cocky, righteous and brave mother (Sandra Bullock) who gives him a home, helps him find his true self and discovers his latent talent for football, which is born out of an instinct for protection. As the kid, called Michael Oher, grows to love and care for his family, he begins to feel he's their protector, and from such intense protective maneuvers such as saving his little brother from a car accident or protecting Sandra Bullock from gansta thugs, comes out his great skill playing Defense on his school's football team, earning surefire attention from all major colleges around the country and close-to immediate success. All of this while understanding the true meaning of family, love and leaving a troubled past behind.<br/><br/>Yes, the story is quickly growing stale, and that's the reason why it didn't attract me at first. But after Sandra Bullock won her Oscar for Best Leading Actress for this film, my curiosity got the best of me...and, oh, I'm so glad it did. There are two things (two VERY exceptional things) which make this an intelligent, engrossing and memorable film. First, there's Sandra Bullock's performance which I must admit is more-than-Oscar-worthy and which captivated me from the first second she's on screen to the last one when the credits roll. There you see her, crossing a school hallway ten minutes into the film, gorgeous in a designer outfit and talking heavy business on the phone with some associate. Five minutes later, you just KNOW this is a posh, fancy woman with an attitude and with more balls than anatomically-allowable; you really don't wanna mess with such a strong-minded, fierce woman. And after she meets Michael Oher, your preconceptions of Bullock's character melt away into a pleasant uncertainty and tridimentionalism, where we discover a strong woman with a gentle and caring heart, a whimsical and funny woman with a scared heart, all in one. Bullock has managed to take a single character and make an entire film all about her. You end up caring about this character as if it were your own family you were staring at. She's THAT good! The second thing is the dialogue which is as witty, quick-fired and moving as ever. The story is a ""tale as old as time"" but the dialogue sets fire to the characters and to the plot, and out from the ashes of an overused story rises a phoenix of something refreshing, poignant and with a HUMAN heart we can all relate to. And, of course, most of the dialogue is dominated by Bullock, so you can imagine the quick, memorable, incendiary kind of thing you're going into.<br/><br/>Yes, it's rare when a film is both intelligent and memorable...but that doesn't make it an instant classic. Sandra Bullock and the dialogue give this film a wide shelf-life, but the story (which is, in a word, unimpressive), the typical cinematography and the (uncharacteristically) muted score by Carter Burwell figure among it's low points. This film is not an instant classic, and I can't even say it's one of the best films of the year (although it DID earn an Oscar nod in that category), but it's among the films you'll enjoy the most and you'll remember for some time, complete with a reflectively-smiling face and a sense of fulfillment. You CAN'T be disappointed.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 stars and a half out of 4!"

"jantoniou","8","0","0","19 April 2010"," A fine story about a fine family doing a fine thing
","Having read and, by word of mouth, extracted so many positive reviews for ""The Blind Side"" it was nearly impossible not to head into watching it without any preconceived idea of how great - or, for that matter, how poor - it might turn out to be.<br/><br/>I see its central theme summarized in one sentence delivered by the woman portraying Michael's crack-addled mother who, upon learning Leigh Anne Tuohy (portrayed quite beautifully by Sandra Bullock) has taken in her son to her home: ""Well, what a fine Christian woman you are."" That is it, really, summed up: The Tuohys did the fine, if extremely improbable, Christian thing by taking a very large black teenage boy into their home. Not just from the wrong side of the tracks, Michael Oher is from the wrong side of life: His mother, not so much a terrible person as a conglomeration of terrible decisions (and, yes, it's often hard to separate the two, but I think it's a useful distinction to make in this case), is so deeply disabled by her addictions that she couldn't care to attend to more needs than her own basic physiological ones, have largely left her many children to whim and circumstance.<br/><br/>Michael is a product of this immense, criminal neglect, of an educational system that has discarded him and an environment that merely chews up those who are unfortunate enough to be born into it.<br/><br/>But something happened on the way to a dead-end life: Someone - a few people, actually - stood up for Michael, without knowing who he was, really, but rather they saw a faint glimmer of something special in him. Sure, they saw athletic skill - and that has pragmatic value to people these days, especially at the professional level - but they also saw someone of character, a kid who hadn't just given up and succumbed to the lifestyle being offered to him.<br/><br/>And the movie addresses, head-on, the controversy bound to be associated with the notion of a well-to-do white family stepping in and ""saving"" a black kid who seemed destined by circumstance to be neglected and forgotten. Not being black I can't say if the idea that white people - especially white Republicans from the South - ""saving"" black kids is a particularly repellent one, but I suspect from the generally militant ideology that tends to surround modern ""blackness"" being true to your being black - even if that ultimately means sliding by this mortal coil with few, if any, prospects - does indeed make it quite repellent.<br/><br/>Of course, if a well-to-do black family had taken Oher in there would be no issue and that, really, is the problem: The inherent - and not entirely ungrounded - general distrust of white folk by black folk. The NCAA in the movie merely sits in to speak for millions of blacks who are casting a jaundiced eye to the notions being presented by ""The Blind Side."" For the rest of us - blissfully ignorant white folk, I suppose - ""The Blind Side"" is a great story about a great family who merely decided to the right, Christian thing and step into and ultimately embrace what might be considered by most a very uncomfortable situation. Against considerable odds, Oher has succeeded where few have, even those born to considerably better circumstances. He has triumphed and, by extraction, so has the family who adopted him and made him a permanent part of their lives."

","I am English and as such quite ignorant of the specifics of American Football. Fortunately I am not a lost cause as 'The Blind Side' does not revolve around the sport, despite featuring it heavily. In truth, the movie tells the story of the influence that one unfortunate individual and a wealthy family have on one another. 'The Blind Side' the title refers to is not the technical aspect of the game so much as the aspects of life that each party has been missing, the aspects of life that they discover through each other's presence. In essence the story is a rags-to-riches tale, which may contribute partially to its emotional power; however, this film is not so shallow, focusing on spiritual, rather than material wealth. Even when dabbling in clip montages the picture is never superficial.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock delivers an Oscar-worthy performance in her award-winning role as Leigh Anne Tuohy, who takes broken youth Michael Oher under her wing when he starts attending the same Christian educational institute as her own children. With the love of a family and the support of a determined mother and father figure, the initially troubled and introverted Michael begins to excel in both studying and sports, despite the low expectations of his teachers. 'The Blind Side' encompasses not only Michael's transition as a character, but also the transition of his carers.<br/><br/>What is most refreshing about 'The Blind Side' is that the film does not lose itself in its serious tone, delivering the full spectrum of emotions including humour, entertaining the audience by allowing viewers to share not only the moments of grief and strife that these characters suffer, but also the moments of joy that they experience. Why should movies (Oscar contenders or not) sacrifice such affairs in order to maintain critical integrity?<br/><br/>Immersing and inspiring, 'The Blind Side' is a rare achievement in storytelling that, notwithstanding heartache and sorrow, conveys a consistent sense of realistic satisfaction that is sadly often lacking.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This movie is inspired by a true story about no one from a slum area and then became a professional football player, after he was adopted by a rich good American family.<br/><br/>I think blind side is a good movie. The story line is very inspiring, because the movie told one way how to be a good Christian family when you live at United states (because there were many dialogue that mention about Christianity). And the journey of the poor boy Michael Oher, who at the first did not know the Tuohys and then became a part of The Tuohys and protector for the youngest member of the tuohy, S.J. Tuohy.<br/><br/>The screenplay was very good, you can see many parts of their life. From the first time when The Tuohys met Michael until he got to the university. And there are real footage and pictures from the real character too, and they really helped me to knew the real persons behind the story.<br/><br/>I wasn't very surprised when Sandra Bullock got an Oscar for her performance as Leigh Anne Tuohy, because she had done a great job by acting as a kind rich mother. Especially her accent, it was very convincing.<br/><br/>Don't worry just because that this is a drama movie so you have to cry all along. I think this movie is fun to watch.

","Sandra Bullock has never been a great actress. The 46 y.o. has had her fair share of commercial hits – Speed, Miss Congeniality, The Lake House - but none of these struck gold at the box office because of her dramatic talent; she's easy on the eye and has an endearing personality. Which is why you'll be as surprised as I was when you witness Bullock acting the house down in Blind Side. Powerful, convincing and affecting, she gives her best performance to date as Leigh Anne Tuohy, even if it's not Oscar-worthy as many would have you believe. Although with the Golden Globe already in the bag, the shiny statuette could well find its way into Bullock's hands - a damn shame for Carey Mulligan who deserves the win for An Education.<br/><br/>Getting caught up in the hype surrounding Bullock's comeback it is easy to forget that this film has so many other things working for it, least of all that at its core is an intriguing and absorbing story. Writer-director Hancock has an obvious affinity to the material and he doesn't hold back in attempting to wring every drop of emotion from it, even if occasionally a subtler approach would have been favourable. Thankfully, Hancock has crafted some tremendously touching scenes that go a long way in glossing over the seldom spill into pensive melodrama. Those who are excited about seeing some Gridiron action, a la Remember the Titans, best lower their hopes as unfortunately the movie is strangely devoid of any hearty sporting scenes – excluding a pointless training montage that'll make you cringe – which is a severe drawback.<br/><br/>Aged 26 in real life, relative unknown Quinton Aaron plays the 16 year old Michael with a nice balance of damage and hope. Big Mike, as he's known in the 'hood, is extremely reticent and withdrawn yet we feel a close connection to him thanks to Aaron's thoughtful portrayal. Kathy Bates continues with her underdone roles of late, here not getting the screen time she deserves as a quirky tutor. Also failing is Jae Head's gregarious S.J.; Leigh Anne's young son who loves the attention his new stepbrother gains him.<br/><br/>The content isn't quite strong enough for a runtime of 128 minutes but you'll find it hard not to be swept away by Michael's story.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

Groomed by his unlikely guardian angel, the youngster defies the odds to make it to the professional league.<br/><br/>Peopled by an always believable set of characters like the teen's tutor (a welcome return to form by Kathy Bates) and his drug-addicted mother, the film engages us with its many moments of humor and tenderness. The scenes between the middle-aged housewife and her gentle-giant houseguest are particularly warmly etched.<br/><br/>However the dramatic conflicts -the racist snickering of the white folks, reservations about the foster family's motives for sponsoring the footballer and a face-off with the gang of his former ghetto buddies --- are resolved complacently. Also, the athlete's younger brother is introduced in a restaurant scene only to be then left out of the narrative altogether.<br/><br/>The story is given much of its sinew and spleen by Sandra Bullock.

","I usually am not one for the sappy, beat all odds athlete stories because usually they are a dime a dozen. The Blind Side follows the usual trend. The story is laden with clichés, predictable and at times a little melodramatic. This film though was quite touching and the vehicle for that was Leigh Anne Tuhoy played by Sandra Bullock. While the role is showy and at times maybe a bit over the top, I blame that on the writing and not Bullock. There are several outstanding scenes in this movie that should assure Bullock of her first Oscar nomination, hell maybe even a win. The one scene that moved me the most is when Leigh Anne was talking to Mike's real mother. Not much was said, but the facial expressions on Leigh Anne's face said it all. It was so touching to see Leigh Anne begin to realize just where this boy came from.

","This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I smiled, laughed and cried. The story line was great. I hope that is was accurate, it would be good to know that people like this really do exist. The casting was well done, I believed the story line and the actors. Sandra Bullock was exceptional, but all of the others were great as well. I loved Big Mike and SJ especially. It is so nice to see a 'feel good' film that is based on a true story - very heart warming. I would recommend this move to anyone - it is a movie that anyone can watch regardless of their age. If you want to see a movie that has a great story and makes you feel great when it is done,then this is the movie for you to see."

","Another lovely family seen on DVD during the festive season. For a Brit living in south east Asia most of the time, I think a narrative caption explaining to a non-American and non-enthusiast of US football who is lawrence Taylor - would have been appreciated, opening scene of the football match didn't do it for me I am afraid and was the weakest part of the film.<br/><br/>I loved this film, similar for me like Juno and yes, it has Oscar potential. Sandra Bullock was average in The proposal and disappointing in All About Steve, this was her at her best and clearly she must have some enthusiasm for US football - but what with this Tennessee/Mississippi thing? Can someone please explain.<br/><br/>Big Mike was great. Nice simple story in essence of an affluent American family doing a good turn for a homeless coloured kid; the football element I think was secondary to the social integration which Big Mike was trying to experience at school and in the new family home. Even his real Mum in her short role was a star.<br/><br/>Does an American football player really have to have brains to progress his career? God help some of the English soccer players if there was ever such a requirement applied by the British FA! Did wonder what the husband did all day with his work/business to be sop affluent and allow Sandra bullock carte-blanche pretty much on running her family life and other peoples as well. Thought the children characters in the movie were a little stiff and unimpressive but this was really a film vehicle for Sandra bullock to really excel, she dominated this film much more than big Mike.<br/><br/>OK, I finally got to understand about The Blind Side as part of the football game but as I said, i thought football was secondary in this films. It was well directed, overall well acted and it is quirky comedy which will make you happy at the cinema or on DVD"

","There's a lot of accolades out there for Sandra B. She does a fine job. But if this is her best role ever: She still has a lot of room for improvement. We're not certain about her Southern accent: Why does it come and go? We're not sure why she is getting a lot more positive critical press than Quintin Aaron (Big Mike). After watching the movie; one feels that Quintin WAS Michael. He transformed. That is what acting is all about. If 'acting' were the football field; Sandra gets slammed. Seems rather ironic that just because Sandra Bullock has a 'name' that all the acting accolades are pointed towards her. In fact; I would say all four main actors (including the young boy) actually did a better job than Ms. Bullock. But the winner is clearly Quintin. Hmmm. Is there something 'stinky' about Quintin not getting much attention? Is it possibly because he's not pretty and white? MbF"

","Okay, The Blind Side may be based on truth, but it is still a hokey story about a rich Republican who adopts a black ghetto boy. That being the case, that this is one of those movies, The Blind Side is still a really good example of the genre. Sandra Bullock has really matured as an actress and without her playing the powerfully willed woman who takes a million chances and has unyielding faith, this movie would be nothing at all. That is not to say that the rest of the actors weren't cast well; the casting is perfect. But Bullock is the show and that's all there is to it. The Blind Side is long and drawn out at over two hours, but ultimately it is satisfying and not boring. The Blind Side is more about the relationships between human beings than it is a sports movie, so if you are hoping for a lot of exciting football scenes this one won't deliver. Instead it is like a really well made, sentimental Lifetime movie. It works on all levels and is safe for the entire family. I think the foulest word in the entire movie is ""penis"". I have to score this one and eight simply for the love it delivers. I'd like to see more movies about love. Love is a tough subject to tackle but The Blide Side does a good job at it."
"mr_congenialityng","9","0","0","21 December 2009"," They don't make feel-good movies like this anymore, and it's about time that they did.
","One of the ironic things about ""The Blind Side"" is that it's a feel-good movie that is too good to be true, but in this case, it actually is a good movie that happens to be based on a true story. Many people going into this movie are not going to have an idea in hell that this movie is actually based on a true story, but those people are only going for a reason and one reason only, and that is to see Sandra Bullock put on the best performance of her career. The performance she puts on is the likes of what Julia Roberts did with ""Erin Brockovich."" It's that good.<br/><br/>You will also be glad to know that not only does Sandra Bullock put on one hell of the show, but so does the entire cast. It's a rare feat to see in any movie. Frankly, I've never seen Sandra Bullock like this before, because for one, she's embodied a character fully and completely, and secondly, she's not the center of attention. It's a nice change. I also failed to recognize that Tim McGraw played a pivotal role in this film. That's what makes a really good movie, is that you are so enveloped in the characters that you forgot (let alone don't even know) who is portraying them. It makes everything feel real.<br/><br/>This film is not along the lines of ""Remember The Titans"". Yes, it does have it's scenes of football games, and the players around it, and it does tend to drag just a little bit, but while the film is a feel-good movie, it doesn't overdo it one bit like ""Titans"" did. In fact, I can't stand watching ""Remember The Titans"" again, either because every teacher in my high school had a copy of it on VHS and played it at least weekly, or of its excessively overdone feel-good story. ""The Blind Side"" should be awarded with multiple viewings, and has a good balance of light and dark, and an overall sense of realism.<br/><br/>However, there are places in the movie where you can tell some bad things are going to happen, and of course, they do, and that is my only complaint is that maybe that director and writer John Lee Hancock made it too obvious. Still, it doesn't drag this movie down, and once things play out, it is a rewarding viewing experience. The movie isn't without its PG-13 rating though, it's obvious because of the dark drug-related material and the antagonists, even if both do play very small roles.<br/><br/>But I have to say it again: This is the performance of Sandra Bullocks career, and I will be disappointed if she doesn't take home at least a Golden Globe award this year. But this is not the reason you should see ""The Blind Side"". You should see it because of the moving story, the strong cast, and the diverse characters that they play. What else could you ask for? Another really positive thought on this movie is that the director has made a movie for all audiences, not just blue-collar audiences. The characters, while religiously conservative and based in the south, do not adhere to hypocrisy. Neither do they bash each other with politics or religion. These are very good people, and they mean well, and they try their best to do things well. It just goes to show you that religious denominations or political affiliations are not what define you. It's who you are that defines you.<br/><br/>They don't make feel-good movies like this anymore, and it's about damn time that they did."

So, pathetically, I went into the movie ALONE. but just after the movie started, I didn't feel lonely anymore. It's a movie about football, but not much a bout football, it's actually about the love between two strangers, that sometimes made you feel really heartwarming. Personally, I don't like Sandra with blond hair, but it did help her to portray the character to make it more realistic. The unreserved love happens between a family and a homeless boy. It's really moving when you saw how they treat him. I was not a football fan before, but now I'm starting to have some interested in it. hope you guys enjoy that"

I watched this on opening day but never got around to reviewing it yet.Teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is surviving on his own, virtually homeless, when he is spotted on the street by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock). Learning that the young man is one of her daughter's classmates, Leigh Anne insists that Michael—wearing shorts and a t-shirt in the dead of winter—come out of the cold. Without a moment's hesitation, she invites him to stay at the Tuohy home for the night. What starts out as a gesture of kindness turns into something more as Michael becomes part of the Tuohy family despite the differences in their backgrounds.<br/><br/>Living in his new environment, the teen faces a completely different set of challenges to overcome. And as the family helps Michael fulfill his potential, both on and off the football field, Michael's presence in the Tuohys' lives leads them to some insightful self-discoveries of their own.<br/><br/>Based on the best-selling novel by Michael Lewis, ""The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game.""

","I was a hater. I went into this film with the lowest of expectations. I expected a one sided, melodramatic, lifetime movie with an odd looking badly cast Sandra Bullock at the films center. Boring, unnecessary and too silly to take serious. well I'm happy to say that I was so wrong. I had heard good things about this film and they were hard to believe but they were all true. The true story on screen here is inspiring and heart warming. The film is handled with a genuine sincerity and never falls into melodrama instead touching and than avoiding only to further the films complex and unique story line. With themes of racism, class, love, fear and courage among many others. The blind Side handles them all with a soft ease making for a wonderful experience. it's intelligent and objective with a truly moving performance from Sandra Bullock the best of her career. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll love this film."

","As I walked into the theater, I must admit I was unsure of what I would think of this film. Mainly, I questioned whether Sandra Bullock could pull off a much more serious role than what she is used too. As I watched this film I could not help but notice how many times I would catch myself smiling. The Blindside is truly an inspirational story about Family, Friendship, Faith, and Will. In most films I see now-a-days that involve Christianity, I feel they normally show a terrible portrayal of what it is about and ultimately makes Christians look very judgmental and radical when that is far from it. It brings up the question of, what would God want you to do in this situation? Sandra Bullock was excellent in the movie as Leigh Anne Tuohy, the mother of two children who go to school with Michael Oher. As I watched this movie, seeing a portrayal of a proper southern upper class woman take in a poor black teenager and embrace him with open arms as if he were her own, I could not help but question myself on what would I have done if I had been in her position. Quinton Aaron who plays Michael Oher was very good in his role. His emotions and how he acted really helped me relate too him and better understand the positions he is in. His apprehensive, shy demeanor is exactly how I would've expected anyone to act if they were in his situation. There are many scenes in the film that honestly made me wish I could just reach out and embrace this gentle giant. Another thing that I really liked about the film was the involvement in college recruitment as that is one thing that I am extremely passionate about.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I felt that in my personal opinion, The Blindside may be one of the top 3 sports films I have seen and may top Remember the Titans as the top football movie of all time. Again, this is my personal opinion. This film will truly inspire those who watch it!"

","Oh, me and my decisions!<br/><br/>When I heard all the buzz about Sandra Bullock's performance in The Blind Side, I decided that I just had to rent the DVD. Similarly, when I heard all the buzz about papaya, I decided that I just had to try some. Both of those decisions left a bad taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>Perhaps I will post a critique of papaya on some food review site (Rotten Kumquats?), but here I must review films.<br/><br/>Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a plucky gun-wielding mom with a lot of spunk (remember what Lou Grant said about spunk?) One day, Leigh Anne notices a behemoth named Michael Oher (played well by Quinton Aaron) walking around shivering and homeless. She invites him to stay overnight in her upscale home.<br/><br/>Now, I don't know about most guys, but if some rich woman that looked like Sandra Bullock invited me to stay overnight in her home, I'd be there faster than a Viagra-laden Superman flying to his date with Lois Lane. However, after a few minutes of listening to Tuohy's junior- high psychology as well as enduring her general all-around annoying personality, I'd be out of there faster than Sarah Palin's ouster from a Mensa meeting.<br/><br/>Then there's Bullock's performance itself. I don't know if it suffered from the fact that she was portraying such an irritating person. I was hoping some hulk from the football team would mistake her for a blocking sled and... well, not really. But maybe the fact that the character got under my skin so much says something about Bullock's acting. <br/><br/>I doubt however that this is what was intended by all those involved in making this flick. But even discounting the annoying main character, John Lee Hancock's dull and tedious direction makes this movie hard to bear.<br/><br/>And, by the way, I'm still waiting for the first great football film to be made (the best of the bunch, Jerry McGuire and Heaven Can Wait, can only marginally be considered football films).<br/><br/>However, I wouldn't be surprised if someone has already made a movie about papaya that is more palatable than The Blind Side."

","The Blindside is based on a true story about Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron. He is a homeless boy that is taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy played by Sandra Bullock, her husband Sean played by Tim McGraw, their son S.J played by Jae Head, and daughter Collins played by Lily Collins. Michael had a rough upbringing and ended up at a private school when one of his friend's fathers tries to get his son into the school but won't allow him to go without Michael. The Tuohys take him into their home and eventually end up adopting him. We see Michael turn into a great football player and eventually get a scholarship to college which is a big accomplishment considering his GPA was at a .06 when first starting at the private school. <br/><br/>The movie shows that if you are given the chance with will and determination you can do anything that you want no matter what the situation you come from. It also shows that there are people who care about others and use their good situations to help those in need. Michael is given the chance to better his life and when the Tuohys and the teachers at his new school give him the chance he shows that he can do it with a little guidance. He raises his grades, gets into college, and eventually gets drafted to the NFL. <br/><br/>The lighting used in the movie really fit the theme. When Michael would visit his old neighborhood the lighting would be low and dull giving you the sense of the bad situation he was in before. When he begins to play football and better himself the lighting is brighter. The dialog is also used well in showing the theme. I like the flashbacks to some of the things that Michael went through as a child I actually think it could have used a little more to get a better understanding. <br/><br/>The acting was also great Michael was portrayed as a silent shy boy in the beginning who wasn't smart and didn't trust anyone. As the movie goes on he becomes more talkative and more trusting in the family. He also feels as if he is part of the family before he is legally adopted. All the characters were portrayed beautifully. This is a great movie for anyone to see as it shows us we can do whatever we want with will and determination."

","This happens to be my first. I was reading through some of the reviews here. Most of them had judged this through the wrong lens. Normally I don't care, but this movie deserves better. A ""sports movie""?? C'mon!!. This is bigger than that. Someone also talks about white and black.<br/><br/>Well, for me, I being an Indian not familiar with the American football or the black and white stuff, this was one of those which had a lot of warmth to it. Please see this without prior notions...<br/><br/>This is a simple story, or would have been one, if it was not a true event. A simpleton, who don't keep a grudge on anybody or anything, happen to meet a great family, pure luck, and his life is changed forever. Forget football, forget being black and/or white guilts, savor this one. You will feel that genuine warmth that seeps through in each character and if that's half what actually happened in that big family, the director deserves a standing ovation. It is easy to depict people's feelings using apt dialogues, but the main character in the movie rarely talks. Even then we get to see how he is a changed person, not by his grades, not by his football, but by that simple ""Big Mike smile"" he begin to put on when he is accepted as one of the family. And that gets through even to the sister. Watch it for those moments where you will feel for him, for the genuine concerns of the mother and that little brother. If you ever felt being loved by someone, this movie will fill your heart. And do appreciate those wonderful performances, Sandra Bullock shows why she's highly rated. watch it like you read a story..you'll love this. I just did."

","The Blind Side tells the inspirational story of an unfortunate teenager who becomes the ultimate football star. The film, unfortunately, is filled to the brim with scenes resembling those from T.V. movies of the week. The film tries too hard to go for tears over detailing the racial controversies, but the film benefits from strong source material and an inspirational ending. Sandra Bullock, while strong, does not have a single Oscar moment in this film that blew me away. The first half is very well-executed, the second to a lesser extent. I do not think this deserved its Best Picture nomination over (500) Days of Summer, Star Trek, or Crazy Heart, but it is an uplifting tale about the fascinating sport of football. The Blind Side may focus too much on Bullock's character, but as a Thanksgiving/family movie, it is worth seeing."
"Turfseer","5","2","5","29 May 2010"," Average Hollywood treatment of true life tale of Christian charity
","The Blind Side is one of those movies that manages to evoke a huge difference in opinion as to whether the film works or not. I'm somewhere in the middle. Certainly the saga of the White Republican Tuohy family who takes in Michael Oher, a black kid from the 'other side of the tracks' and then helps him to become what he has become today, a very successful NFL star football player, is an inspirational tale of true Christian charity. On the other hand, the story is riddled with so many clichés that ultimately the film devolves into a predictable Hollywood tale of an underprivileged youth making it in the sports world.<br/><br/>Some posters argue that the white characters in the film, particularly the Tuohy family themselves, come off as saintly and the black characters are all presented as negative stereotypes. I don't see that at all. For starters, the first black character we meet, 'Big Tony' Hamilton, is a self-sufficient and kindly man who ends up being responsible for getting Big Mike into the Wingate Christian school where he eventually thrives. Leigh Anne Tuohy is hardly a saint as she is depicted as sensitive but also a thoroughly pushy and sometimes obnoxious woman who is capable at times, of putting her foot in her mouth. While Michael Oher is a slow learner, the film makes it quite clear that he has street smarts and inherently is a lot smarter than what the teachers at the Wingate school pegged him to be. Unfortunately, the film's scenarists know a lot more about Leigh Anne Tuohy's personality than Michael Oher's. This is perhaps the major shortcoming of the film as the warm, winning ways of Oher are not shown here; rather, he's depicted as thoroughly introverted and socially inept and rookie actor Quinton Aaron is unable to make much of a part that is quite thin to begin with.<br/><br/>The first third of the movie is perhaps the most moving as it shows Leigh Anne's Tuohy's growing realization that she has led an isolated life. In a most poignant scene, Tuohy is startled when Michael reveals that he's never slept in a bed before. Leigh Anne's willingness to take Michael in is tested in the scene involving the car accident. After Sean Tuohy Sr. buys Michael a new car, he gets into a car accident while the the young SJ is in the passenger seat. Somehow all is forgiven when it's revealed that Michael prevents the full force of the air bag from hitting SJ. Never discussed are the events preceding the crash—Michael and SJ are engaged in singing a rap song without Michael paying attention to the traffic ahead of them. I also wondered if Leigh Anne would have forgiven Michael so easily had SJ actually been seriously injured in the accident or even killed. Christian charity I suppose has its limits! <br/><br/>Once Oher is acclimated to his new family, 'The Blind Side' picks up the Hollywood mantle and offers up another tired and long-winded high school football scene, replete with the young SJ obnoxiously 'coaching' Oher before the big game along with Leigh Anne later fending off the token white racist in the stands. Oher not only gains confidence as a defensive tackle but the big teddy bear flips an opposing player over a fence after the bully has been mocking him before every play (how cute!).<br/><br/>Again, the second half of 'The Bind Side' ends up with mixed results. There's more 'cute' stuff when Leigh Anne hires a tutor (Kathy Bates) who tutors Michael to get his grade point average high enough to qualify for college. Liberal Hollywood needs to let us know that the tutor is a Democrat so that both conservative Republicans (the Tuohy family) and a Democrat both have a hand in helping Michael reach his goal. There's a stab at comedy when all the college recruiters start courting Michael and again the obnoxious child actor who plays SJ attempts to get the 'best deal' for himself in the event that Michael is recruited (stuff like walking out on the field at the beginning of the college football season).<br/><br/>When an NCAA Investigator questions the Tuohy family's motives in 'adopting' Michael after he accepts an invitation to attend Ole Miss, Michael impulsively returns to his old ghetto haunts. There he's taunted by Alton, the head gang member, brilliantly played by IronE Singleton (this actor has the potential to be a major star!) Michael gets into a fight with Alton and gets the better of him and then disappears. Leigh Anne looks high and low for Michael and confronts Alton. Some posters say the scene is implausible since the gang member would have retaliated when Leigh Anne challenged him. I'm not so sure—when she claims that she's friends with the DA, that in itself might have given Alton pause to take revenge. After all, he's a drug dealer who doesn't want any outsiders calling attention to his business. Finally Leigh Anne finds Michael after he calls her. There's a reconciliation and Michael of course goes on to graduate from high school and is drafted by the NFL.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock does an excellent job of conveying the brash personality of Leigh Anne Tuohy. Tim McGraw as Sean Sr. and Lily Collins as Collins Tuohy have little to do during the film. As previously mentioned, the youngster SJ (played by Jae Head) is simply obnoxious and Quinton Aaron does not know how to make Michael Oher into an engaging character. As 'The Blind Side' is based on a true story, it certainly is worth watching. Just don't expect much complexity when it comes to the majority of its characters."
"DICK STEEL","8","2","5","14 January 2010"," A Nutshell Review: The Blind Side
","Much of the hype in this film comes from Sandra Bullock's fine performance as Leigh Ann Tuohy, a God fearing rich woman who had chosen to adopt a kid off the street out of plain human compassion, offer him a home, school, even introduced him to football, and essentially turned his life around without ever wanting anything back in return. Incredible as it may sound, it's actually based on the true story of Michael Oher's life given a new lease to stay off the streets, and the opportunities extended to him as part of the Tuohy family, to turn him into the pro-footballer he is today.<br/><br/>And this heartwarming story reminds us that while it's easy to pay lip service to charitable organizations, or at times feel overwhelmed with the myriad of societal issues that need fixing, all it takes is that small step forward to spark a massive change for the better, especially when help comes from within and from an honest and sincere heart. We cannot change the world and cure it of all its ills, but it's the little things that we do within our capacity that will make the most difference and impact.<br/><br/>The story may not be something new, and you've probably watched countless of films with similar themes and the fusion of inspiration and sports. Moreover, some may feel that the rich characters here have within their means to extend help, but pay no heed to that, because just how many out there would find it compelling to do something like what the Tuohys did? And I kid you not when I say the marketing of the film tried to pass this off like a cliché rags to riches film where a character finds his true calling in American football or learn about values such as teamwork and group above self and so on. It's not exactly a sports or football movie, but one about compassion, change and the belief that with effort comes result for a fellow human being who had been tossed an unfair circumstance to cope with.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's come a long way from the days of driving a bus in Speed, to various average romantic flicks, and finally settling in a role that calls for plenty of gravitas, which she pulled off wonderfully. In Erin Brockovich style complete with blonde hair, Southern drawl and Maximizer bra, she plays Leigh Anne as the tough cookie who gets her way and never takes no for an answer, which explains how what may seem like a whim, turn and become something of a crusade in genuinely fighting a prejudiced system to get others to open up to Big Mike / Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) and get to engage with the quiet boy in more meaningful ways through out of the box techniques. I have never seen Sandra Bullock come close to playing any character like Leigh Anne, and this is indeed busting any preconceived glass ceiling that dramas are not her forte.<br/><br/>Quinton Aaron also provided that perfect pairing opposite Bullock as the lumbering giant with a heart of gold, knowing that his strength is not in the physical sense (not that he doesn't have that in abundance), but in his innate ability for ball games and protective intuition. He may be slow in learning, but he's not stupid, contrary to many especially his teachers who seem resigned to the fact that he cannot be taught subjects through the proper schooling channel. Aaron plays this role with plenty of sentimentalism and sensitivity, that it's extremely hard not to empathize, nor to feel for him when the chips are down or to cheer and root for him even when good things happen.<br/><br/>And the rest of the cast, especially Tim McGraw, Jae Head and Lily Collins all add a little sparkle as members of the Tuohy family (who owns a chain of fast food franchises) who because of Leigh Anne, all learn to accept and embrace Michael as one of their own. Kathy Bates round off the wonderful cast when she enters the picture in the final act as Miss Sue, Michael's personal tutor engaged to ensure he passes high school with a decent GPA needed to further his studies as well as the sport of choice.<br/><br/>The Blind Side will open up your eyes to a worthwhile ""true life"" story that you should be aware of, and be inspired from, and I'd say Sandra Bullock should be quite the shoo-in for the Golden Globe, and way overdue for an Oscar as well. Highly recommended as her performance alone is well worth the ticket price!"

Then, the family gets put under a microscope by an investigator who wants to know why Sandra Bullock adopted Michael, suspecting that she did it so that her alma mater would have a powerhouse football player rather than out of a sense of charity. It is that last part that makes this movie so good, because we live in a cynical society where we want to know what the charitable are gaining by being charitable. It doesn't dodge that question.<br/><br/>The only possible complaint I have with the story is that, under the correct viewing, the story could come off a bit racist. It inadvertently asserts that white culture is superior to black culture. The generous white people save one poor black kid from the horrors of living in a black world. This could have been subverted some by having the ghetto not be uniformly black and the white world being so uniformly white. However, being a true story, maybe that's how it happened. In fact, it does sort of come up as a plot point when Michael writes in his journal about feeling isolated by being the only black kid in the school. So, I don't think the movie was trying to be racist, but I do think some people will be offended. B <br/><br/>Acting: Sandra Bullock's character came under fire by Scott and Phillips as a one dimensional idealized characterture that didn't grow throughout the story. They were particularly harsh on the line where Sandra said that Michael was changing her life, arguing that she showed no signs of that. I disagree. She was growing, but very subtly. Yes, she was headstrong and stubborn and changed very little, but she did grow, and if she hadn't been so persistent then this story never would have happened.<br/><br/>Quinton Aaron also fell under fire, saying that his portrayal of Michael Oher was reduced to reaction shots and that he became an ancillary character in his own movie. Again, wrong! Yes, Michael doesn't say much, but he said everything that he needed to say through those subtle looks. Quinton did a fabulous job.<br/><br/>Jae Head made this movie a lot of fun with his enthusiasm through playing SJ, Sandra Bullock's biological son who immediately bonds with Mike. Even the most jaded cynic will be smiling during SJ's scenes.<br/><br/>Lastly, I knew Tim McGraw was in this movie and I kept wondering which character he was playing. I was shocked, absolutely shocked to learn that he had been playing Sean Tuohy, Sandra Bullock's husband. He disappeared into the role utterly, totally and completely. I had no idea that it was him until the end credits rolled and then I kept wanting to see his character again to see if it really was him, but instead the movie ends with photos of the real life Michael Oher and Tuohy family. Props, Tim! You were able to match energy with Sandra Bullock and were awesome! Acting gets a big fat A! Visuals: This movie did a good job (perhaps too good considering the potentially offensive racial message it sent) of making Michael's world and the Tuohy family world seem completely different. One is soft and pretty, the other is dark and gritty. The football action drew me in, an accomplishment when you consider that I don't enjoy the sport. All around, the visuals get an A.<br/><br/>Sound: The soundtrack felt a bit southern, but it fit the movie and the mood they were trying to send. The foleys kept me believing that there really was a football game being played and didn't kick me out of the movie at any point. A <br/><br/>Overall: This movie is really good. It's uplifting and generally gives a feeling of hope for the future. I hope no gets too terribly offended by it, but by and large I think you should see it. A"

","What starts out promisingly as a coming of age bio about a downtrodden kid from the bad side of town quickly turns into a semi farce replete with set up jokes and useless scenes where this boy/man can do no wrong and get's 2nd chances and preferential treatment from everyone. The first half of this film is actually good although a very over simplified covering of the subject matter.<br/><br/>Character development is minimal, we know nothing of the motivations of the wife or her reasoning only that she has an answer for everything, nothing about the husband other than he is rich and he does whatever his wife says, and the rest of the family is made up of a pretty girl whose unlike 95% of normal teens in the fact that she doesn't question her mother bringing home a strange kid from her school to live with them, and the son is just another Hollywood wise cracking 8 yr old who speaks way above his age level and somehow has the ability to coach a football player even though his only experience has been watching it on TV. The mother is a football expert too who calls the coaches cell phone to tell him how to run the game and mouths off to racist redneck fans without any consequences. The coach is just a horrible caricature with the worst lines in the movie.<br/><br/>We get all the typical black/white and football clichés and from there it just goes into this boring montage of ridiculously overacting college coaches promising him the world if he plays for them and of course his little brother unrealistically is in on every meeting demanding things for himself by pushing around grown men. This is interspersed with shots of his tutor (a dull Katy Bates) and teachers all seemingly on the verge of tears because they are so inspired by this kid who barely speaks. Then Michael Oher briefly turns into to a action hero and the mother into Dirty Harry who threatens drug gangs and they don't even respond because she's packing heat but so are they. Then suddenly hot young white chicks are attracted to this dorky overweight guy during his college orientation.<br/><br/>The oddest thing is the end where they show the real Michael Oher and family simply proving to us that movies are mostly made up as the actors portraying them are twice as good looking as the real folks.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie but it was so meandering and silly that it failed me early on and from there on I just wanted it to end."

I thought it did a good job of portraying the value of each and every person as equal.

"poetellect","10","2","5","7 December 2009"," Film: All-Around Excellence; Bullock: An Understated, Powerful Masterpiece
","Everyone involved in this film's production must have been at the very peak of their game- no pun intended- because the movie fires on all cylinders and continues to do so after every genuinely earned laugh, genuinely earned tear, and genuinely earned ear-to-ear smile. In fact, that is a better ""Summary"" for this film- genuine. The adjective works. I found myself entranced by the humor the writer injected into the dialogue and banter interspersed between a poignant biographical drama. I found myself astounded at what great cinema can achieve- a panoramic, lyrical look at race at an individual level, and what one individual's kindness and love can transform in another's life. All in all, a film that reminds you how the truest stories are the ones that leave you speechless, with eyes watering.<br/><br/>Above all, Bullock absolutely won me over. She takes the film not only to another level, but to a Best Actress nomination for herself, and perhaps even a Best Picture nod. Her acting is subtle, understated brilliance, yet hard and powerful when she needs to be. Actresses like Kate Winslet and Julianne Moore could even- WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT!?- take a lesson here- in places where Bullock could have cried, could have shouted, could have done any number of Hollywoodized set pieces, she restrains herself and lets the story, and the life of her character, tell this story. I will be very surprised if she doesn't get, at the very least, a nomination. She certainly deserves it. Kudos!"
"tavm","8","2","5","2 December 2009"," The Blind Side was a compellingly filmed version of the true story of Michael Oher and Leigh Anne Touhy
","Whenever my movie theatre working friend sees a trailer of an upcoming film and likes what he sees, he always says, ""That's going to be good."" He said that when we watched the preview ad for this one and when he does that, I sometimes have a skeptical mind about it since I don't always share his tastes in entertainment (his favorite form of such is pro wrestling of which I can do without). Such it was for this movie especially when the new critics of ""At the Movies"", Michael Phillips and A. O. Scott, both gave good reasons for saying, ""Skip it."" But while it seemed to be more about Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her family than it seemed to be about Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) and his background, that's only because we don't find out about his past until later on. And I did disagree a bit with Phillips and Scott about not seeing Ms. Tuohy actually mean it when she says to her lady friends, ""I'm learning from him."" She seems to be the smartest one in the whole picture with the way she convinces nearly everyone to her point of view. Oh, and as an Independent, I can appreciate the different ways a conservative, religious, and wealthy family can seem so compassionate toward both a poor, seemingly mentally slow, African-American teenager and a Democratic, possibly liberal, tutor (Kathy Bates). In fact, there was quite a funny line about that and one toward former president George W. Bush at a motor vehicle place where Michael was trying to get a driver's license. It wasn't a nasty one though, so I don't think anyone should be offended. What really impressed me, however, was Michael's turning point after having doubts about his choice of college seemingly based on his adopted family's history there-not to mention his trip back to his former neighborhood in which he sees how wasted his former ""friends"" truly are-and really sticking up for himself about why he made that choice. So, fine performances on both Ms. Bullock and Mr. Aaron's behalf, and good ones on the rest of the cast's especially that of Ms. Bates. Okay, maybe not so much on the actual university coaches' scenes especially that of former LSU coach Nick Saban who's on the longest (though if he was still with the Tigers and not at rival Alabama, I might be a little more lenient, LOL). But with all that I've said, I highly recommend The Blind Side."

"aharmas","10","2","5","27 November 2009"," Bullock rocks!
","I have enjoyed Bullock's work for the last two decades, even since her fresh face showed up in ""Speed"". She was the perfect damsel in distress in ""The Net"", and she has shown a comedic side more than once, most recently with good results in ""The Proposal"". Her latest entry is mind blowing, as she takes on a real life inspirational icon and walks away a winner.<br/><br/>What this film gives is more than an inspirational tale and a positive message, one that one rarely hears in a crowd-pleasing movie. It's a proved formula, but one that is botched more often than one would expect. Here we have the underdog and a protégé, a story that we know will usually result in a few tears and quite a thrilling conclusion. This time out, the formula veers a bit and it works well, as the focus is not placed on our underdog but on the forces that shape him and help him succeed. There is also plenty of love thrown around, and the most interesting thing is how sincere the whole mix feels.<br/><br/>Bullock plays a wealthy southerner who takes it upon herself to rescue a most unlikely prospect; with her tough love and support, he eventually reaches his goal, not without giving us plenty of opportunity to see that her road will be a little bumpy. What is most satisfying about Bullock's performance is how deep and complex her approach is. She conveys several emotions simultaneously as we listen to her deliver lines that are close to a bit overdone, but take on interesting tones with her looks and gestures. In one of my favourite scenes she must face a group of thugs and the steely delivery is as much as crowd pleaser as Dirty Harry's ""Make my day"".<br/><br/>There is a lot to like in ""The Blind Side"", with strong support by the secondary characters, and the way the story is kept from becoming over-sentimental. It moves well, and it does give you a refreshing twist on something we have seen before. Here it all depends on how it is executed and much of the strength lies in Bullock's inspiration both on and off the screen."

","Blind Side was not as motivational or inspirational as I thought it would be. It's not worth the money to see it in the theater. Nice story, shows us we can all be a little nicer to people and it was great that it's a true story but that's about it. Not worth seeing it in the movies, wait for the DVD. The acting was OK. There was a side character that we could've become more attached to. The link to this character just wasn't there and I felt bad that the had a tragic life and I know there should have been a parallel to Michael and this kid but it wasn't developed. Even when Sandra Bullock's character had to say good bye to Michael when he went off to college, it should have been an emotional moment but it was just OK. The real footage at the end of the movie was cool. Stick around until the credits roll so you can see the real pictures and real footage of him being drafted."
"redryan64","10","3","10","6 December 2009"," First there was ROCKY, then we had RUDY, now we draw inspiration and 'enjoyment of Film at its finest in 2009's THE BLIND SIDE!
","OKAY, WE HEAR you! ROCKY was a fictional character in a make believe story about imaginary events, bouts and Boxers. In this we heartily concur; but with this one caveat. While ROCKY Star Sly Stallone's screen play is a work conjured up the characters and events from an obviously deep and fertile imagination. The work reflected a keen intellect; far from being that of a real life Rocky Balboa.<br/><br/>IN SHORT, we hold that there is real life inspiration here; that being to a 1975 Heavyweight Bout between Champ Mohamed Ali with an unranked and lesser-known non-contender in Chuck Wepner. There were many elements in the real life fight that were replicated in the ROCKY storyline; including the Challanger knocking the Champ off his feet, the fight's going the full distance of 15 Rounds, the Bigger Than Life Personality of both Ali and 'Appollo Creed', etc.<br/><br/>AS FOR OUR second compare-a-movie subject, we all know that RUDY is based on the real life story of one Andrew 'Rudy' Ruettiger, the kid who wanted more than anything to grow up and to play Football for the University of Notre Dame; eventually doing that thing in spite of being ""5 feet nothing', 100 nothing' pounds"", etc.<br/><br/>ALTHOUGH THE TWO films both involve the stories of young boys growing up to be apart of Major College Football programs, that's where the similarities between RUDY and today's sacrificial offering,THE BLIND SIDE, end.<br/><br/>WE MUST CONFESS to having a large dose of ignorance operating in our household; being at least in the knowledge of the 'Man of the House'(Me!). The 'Little Woman' (my long-suffering Wife, Deanna) suggested that the two of us sneak off early last Saturday for a 'Matinee'. (Now Schultz, we mean at the nearby Quarry 14 Multiplex in Hodgkins, not any sort of 'Romantic' getaway!) <br/><br/>VERY MUCH TO my surprise, the film was very, very good-on all fronts. It has a great and true story, told in a most enjoyable manner. The casting was excellent with young Quinton Aaron turning in a masterful performance as the abused and neglected young Michael Oher. He at once gave us a main character who was intelligent & deep, yet isolated, under taught, emotionally scarred, lonely and affection starved. He also is discovered to have a great deal of untapped potential in scholastics as well as some obvious potential in athletics. (Can you say Football & Basketball? Can you, Schultz?) <br/><br/>AS HIS ADOPTED family, Tim McGraw does an excellent job of the bread winner (Sean Tuohy) who has the means to financially take on the responsibility of another 'family' member, without there being an immediate strain on the old budget. Mr. Tuohy, you see, owns a string of drive-in fast food restaurants; as it is explained in the movie.<br/><br/>AS FOR THE performance of Miss Sandra Bullock as the Mrs., Leigh Anne Tuohy, we believe that she brought a lot of depth and understanding to the role; being a part that really gave her a chance to show off some very skilled Thespian-type skills! So much of the story turns on the realizations and subsequent actions taken by the one in the role of Mother. The scene where the Tuohy Family encounters 'Big Mike' alone, cold and hungry on a rainy evening in Autumn, is powerfully and realistically rendered. It was truly pivotal to the story. It is at this point where they ponder if their adhering to a Christian way of life was just a matter of words or would they take a real life stance and make their actions speak for them.<br/><br/>ALTHOUGH WHAT WE see is a movie, the story that unfolded to us should make us aware that we all can do even a small act of Chrustian love and kindness toward those in need; not necessarily as great and complex an effort as did the Tuohy Family. Who knows how much human talent and abilities are wasting right now. That's ability and talent that would make the world just a little better place.<br/><br/>AND IN CLOSING, let us try to remember a quote from the Good Book, that goes something like:<br/><br/>""What so ever you do for the Least of My Brethern, you do for me!""<br/><br/>WHAT'S OUR RECOMMENDATION? Well, see it and buy the DVD when it comes out! It's bound to be an Oscar Nominee, at least!"

","I absolutely love Sandra Bullock. She is elegant and just so charming with every performance, and her execution in this film is another triumph. With that said however, I will admit that sadly, I don't feel that this was an Oscar Winning performance. Again, I absolutely love Sandra, and her portrayal in this film is awesome, but... Oscar, not too convinced.<br/><br/>The Blind Side is incredibly enjoyable and a pleasure to watch. It is heartwarming, and quite inspiring, but, I feel that it really could've been more - still remain what it is, but more. The editing and direction was somewhat uneven... The pace, a tad bit unstable, but again, enjoyable.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with The Blind Side though, was Quinton Aaron. This role proved too big and too heavy for him to carry. Outright, Quinton Aaron was unsatisfactory. He just, couldn't deliver, and the film suffered greatly because of it, given his role. It's obvious almost, that a limited amount of actors could play the role of ""Big Mike"", considering the age and size combo, and that worked well for Quinton, but, I feel, at the demise of Michael Oher's story.<br/><br/>Tim McGraw and Jae Head were awesome and their characters were somehow the glue that put this story together very well. They may not have had big roles, but, they played extremely necessary parts.<br/><br/>The Blind Side could've easily been a 7+/10, but the editing, direction and Quinton's woeful outing, compromised what was an absolute joy to watch otherwise.<br/><br/>6.4/10."

","Quite the opposite of Avatar, my expectations were low for The Blind Side, a film whose trailer rubbed me the wrong way. I'm all for inspirational films, but this one looked like an overcooked, manipulative tearjerker with Sandra Bullock stepping way outside of her comfort zone to play a Good Samaritan Southern Belle who helps a struggling black teen with a painful past. I was afraid the film would exploit or gloss over the true pains of African-Americans struggling to escape the projects. I was afraid Sandra Bullock, whose forte is romantic comedies, would annoy with an attempt at a Southern accent. I was afraid that the power of this true story would be lost in hackneyed and trite film-making.<br/><br/>My fears were unfounded, and one cannot, it appears, judge a film by its trailer. This is one of the best mainstream films about Christians I've ever seen, possessing charm, integrity, and honesty in spades. Bullock's stab at a Southern accent, while dubious in a two-minute trailer, is actually quite convincing when viewed in the complete film. She truly loses herself in the role, and much to my surprise, I'd like to see her win an Oscar for her tough-love portrayal of a woman whose cannot help but help others. Country- music superstar Tim McGraw, as her husband, proves himself a capable actor, Granted, he doesn't have to do any heavy emotional lifting in the film, but his ability to deliver lines of dry humor was an unexpected delight. Newcomer Quinton Aaron, as the young man helped by Bullock's family, conveys a great deal of pain, sorrow, and joy with his eyes."
"ck-13483","9","1","2","9 December 2016"," Inspiring movie, worth watching
","""The Blind Side"" is an America sports drama film. Actually, I have never watch a football game before. Nevertheless, I enjoy the whole plot a lot, and I was inspired by the non-fictional story.<br/><br/>It's talking about the life of a homeless teenager - Michael Oher and the process which he struggled to conquer obstacles, especially grades, social problems. After Michael met Leigh Anne, he became a member of Tuohy's family. Not only did his life change, but it also made Leigh Anne think that her life was changed, too. Thanks to Michael's over-sized shape and amazing talent, he became a football player.<br/><br/>In my opinion, you cannot choose the environment where you live or even every predicaments you meet. Despite that, we have the chance to struggle so as to overcome all the plight. In the process, it is necessary to find a reason to stand by you, such as the Tuohy to Michael.<br/><br/>The part which I like the most is the lunch that Leigh Anne with her friends. When they are discussing Michael, one of the lady says"" You're changing that boy's life"", but Leigh Anne response, ""No. He's changing mine.""<br/><br/>Furthermore, I love the theme which can see SJ, the little son of Leigh Anne. No matter what he say or what he does, he always make me laugh. It's no exaggeration that he is an important role to this film.<br/><br/>I learned many valuable lessons by watching this movie and it was definitely a fabulous experience. By the talented cast, brilliant directing, sentimental story, ""The Blind Side"" is definitely worth watching."
"DogFilmCritic","5","1","2","21 September 2016"," Praising Sandra Bullock
","It's a fact that Sandra Bullock is a box office star but I never saw her as an Oscar contender nor as a winner, don't get me wrong she is good but she is a Ron con queen not know as versatile actress, people love her and will see her in anything she is in and giving her Oscar credibility even better. <br/><br/>To me this is the only reason she won so big name studios made her a cash cow, no matter what she dose she will fill their pockets, and honestly this movie is no different.<br/><br/>If you saw the trailer you seen the movie...at least an hour into it I mean there are no surprises in it, it's not that interesting either. Being honest almost no one knows who Michael Oher is, this movie is focused to make Sandra Bullock look good, besides her real life counter part looks nothing like Bullock in real life she is not near as attractive as Sandra is in the movie. What I can say good about it is that Bullock plays a genuine Christian who actually dose what the bible says we should do, and if the undertone of this movie is we should help other well I'm cool with that, but the problem with this movie is there is no real conflict other that having this kid get good grades so he can play football, if you think it was when he was applying for collage and he was interrogated on why this people were helping him and influence him to go to this particular collage and by that point the movie is almost over...SO WHAT nobody watching this movie is convince on that fact it's not like we get the ACTUAL story anyways, you can ask if he was skinny and weak would Bullock would pick him up...don't know and probably will never get the straight answer.<br/><br/>I don't think she deserves the Oscar well maybe just maybe for Gravity but not for this movie."
"CinematicInceptions","5","1","2","26 July 2015"," Okay, but not all it's hyped up to be.
","I'll start by saying what this movie is not. It's not a sports movie, even though it's advertised as one with the poster featuring Big Mike in football pads and everything. It is not about never giving up on your dreams, since Michael Oher had never played football prior to living with the Touhy's and succeeded, at least in this portrayal, more by talent rather than drive. It's not as good as its ratings suggest and does not feature an Oscar worthy performance from Sandra Bullock, at least not according to me or a lot of people I've talked to. I just wanted to address those ""nots"" because all of them seem to be misconceptions surrounding this movie.<br/><br/>It's based on a true story, so of course that doesn't leave much room for critiquing the setup of events. The main plot motivators are integrating Michael into the Touhy family, maintaining sufficient grades for Michael, and dealing with the college scouts that come to recruit him. I guess this is most of why the movie is designated as ""feel good"" because nothing really goes downhill until the last twenty or so minutes. The term ""rags to riches"" takes about the most literal form possible in Michael's transition from being homeless to getting drafted by the NFL. There are some more poignant scenes as well, mostly involving Michael's past.<br/><br/>Our protagonist is Leigh Ann Touhy, who takes the homeless Michael under her family's care. She obstinately faces the discontent of her friends, which kind of gives a visual replacement to her parents' extreme racism that is lightly hinted at but never really addressed. I guess she was written well, even though I didn't like her very much. Michael wasn't written great because at first I, and others, were under the impression that he was mentally challenged. His character got better as the story went on, but it still could have been better put together. Sean, Collins, and S.J. Touhy are all prominent characters and are incorporated and acted well. The only other people worth noting are Michael's teachers, tutor, and football coach. They come off well for the most part, but the antagonism of a couple of the teachers felt more than a little forced.<br/><br/>The acting and directing were both decent, tough again, Sandra Bullock's performance was not as good as it was given credit for. The script was fine for the most part, but there is room for criticism in S.J. being made to sound older than he was and in some of the more emotional scenes being too dramatic and therefore unrealistic.<br/><br/>I saw that a number of people who rated this low felt like the story was very racist because it portrayed the rich white family as the heroes. The charity shown by the Touhy's is a little, I guess you could say, excessive or unrealistic, so I can see where they are coming from with the white hero thing even though the country would be better off if we had more of that kind of charity. However, I think that it ended up the way it did because the people involved were kind of a ""match made in heaven"" in the sense that the Touhy's were exactly the right people to employ Big Mike's exceptional football talent and Michael was the last person who would pose a threat to their family.<br/><br/>I hope I didn't make it seem like this was a bad movie, because it isn't. It's just not as good as people have given it credit for. That's really what I hope you take away from this review as a prospective viewer. Try to shake off any expectations you have because they will more than likely not be met. Pretty much the only parallel between what it is and what it's advertised as is that it's inspirational, though not in a championship sports way. If you're debating whether to show it as a family movie, know that it does deserve its PG-13 rating, but doesn't feature anything that would be outside of an 80's PG movie. Overall Rating: 7.1/10."

","The Blind Side is a most inspiring film about Michael Oher a gentle giant of a kid who's not gotten too many breaks in life. But all he needed was a helping hand and he gets one from country singer Tim McGraw and Sandra Bullock and now Michael Oher is one of the top defensive players of the National Football League.<br/><br/>Quinton Aaron plays Oher and for most of the film he's pretty mute, almost catatonic answering in monosyllables. He's brought out of the Memphis ghetto by a man who would like to get him just off his couch. Aaron's mother is a crackhead and she's long abandoned him. <br/><br/>McGraw is a football coach at a private Christian High School and Bullock is his wife. The story here is how Bullock proves to be the mother figure this young man needs badly in his life. He becomes a member of the family as much as her two natural children with McGraw are. As for Tim McGraw he shows some acting chops and holds his own with Bullock and the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Aaron is a catatonic gentle giant, big enough for defense on any team, but lacking in aggression. Best scene in the film is when Bullock teaches him the necessary aggression needed for that sport.<br/><br/>Rivaling that is a voice over narration of a composition that Aaron writes interpreting The Charge Of The Light Brigade. Aaron in the voice over proves to be quite articulate and definitely not stupid as was thought by many. I'd give the paper an A.<br/><br/>The Blind Side is a wonderful family film for which Sandra Bullock copped a Best Actress Oscar. The Blind Side was also in the running for Best Picture of 2009. Quite deservedly so."
"rawiri42","9","1","2","16 November 2014"," Absolutely Beautiful
","For years I have adored Sandra Bullock. For me, she pales all those screen sirens through the ages into insignificance and ""The Blind Side"" expresses her unequaled talent and natural beauty superbly! As an Aussie, I know nothing at all about American Football (and, from what I have seen on movies and TV, I don't particularly want to!). That's not to knock it though - I just don't understand it and, since it is pretty well exclusive to the USA, I have no real need to. However, that's not the point of this review. In actual fact, the game doesn't matter. The point is that the Tuohy family - and Leigh-Anne (Bullock) in particular see the potential and the need in a young man who couldn't be much more different from their own lifestyle and they give helping him their everything (and MORE).<br/><br/>Bearing in mind that ""The Blind Side"" is based on a true story, all I can say is that I would have loved to have known the Tuohy family. What awesome Christians from Dad to the young son. Actually, all the time I watched this film, I couldn't help seeing a family that attends my own church here in Queensland. The total absence of any sort of jealousy and the genuine love that emanated from every member of that family was just SO like my friends. (Actually, my friends here would make great subjects for a similar biographical drama - but I know their modesty would never let that happen! Pity really!) <br/><br/>When the pictures came on with the credits at the end I was amazed at how well all five actors portrayed the real Tuohys and Michael. (Didn't Sandra look gorgeous as a blonde too! - I'm not biased!!) So this is the second time in as many weeks that I have sat through a movie centred around American Football and loved every minute of them (the other one was ""The Grid Iron Gang""). I don't mind admitting that I had to wipe the occasional tear from my eye during this one too. How refreshingly pleasant to watch a movie where the predominance is on decent, loving and caring people rather than an over-abundance of violence, profanity and unpleasantness - especially when it's a true story. If I could, I'd give this 11 out of 10 and, if it doesn't win some major awards, the judges are all dormant!"
"masandaglinus123","9","1","2","15 November 2014"," Sandra Bullock really deserves her Oscar..
","The Blind Side is sentimental, brilliant and one of the best film of 2009. You will learn many valuable lessons in just 2 hours by watching this movie and it was definitely an amazing experience. Sandra Bullock really deserves her Oscar for playing a devoted Christian who helps a homeless and traumatized boy and throughout the film, you really feel her love, acceptance and care for Michael Oher, and there are so many reasons why you will loved this film. Quinton Aaron was brilliant too. He perfectly delivers his character on to the big screen and it's satisfies me. It also has some funny moments, but other than that, this movie will surely touch your heart. Talented cast, brilliant directing, wonderful story and a well-done film!"
"cognassome","10","1","2","5 November 2014"," Heartwarming, inspiring and memorable
","Heartwarming, inspiring, and memorable. The Blind Side directed by John Lee Hancock captures all of these emotions. Based on a true story of love and family, you will learn to protect your blind side.<br/><br/>This movie is about the Touhy family and how they took in Michael Oher, an emotionally traumatized high school student who has a talent for playing football. The Touhy's are a wealthy Memphis family that includes Leigh Anne a headstrong designer and mother of two who first took action to Michael when she saw him talking to her son.<br/><br/>This moving film had many great features including the contrast of characters and the actors who played them. Sandra Bullock's role as Leigh Anne was breathe taking thanks to her strong personality and not to mention her charming southern accent just for the role. Also, the different characters and background made this movie come to life. I honestly cried each time I saw this even though I knew all the parts. Because of the flashbacks and heart breaking events that took place I couldn't stop watching it. There was also a good balance between the football aspect and the background story to understand what was happening. I really appreciated the recognition this movie brought to people who are well known like Michael Oher. To most he is a just a football player but this movie expressed that even people who are popular or have a talent that is shared, still had a past to get there that may have been difficult. <br/><br/>Another reason why I recommend seeing this movie is because its based on a true story. Throughout the show I couldn't help but think that their are people who have had negative events in their life such as these in the movie, but I almost feel like this movie brought a sense of awareness to that. Its also pretty amazing to watch Michael Oher's past and see what he is doing now. The best part about this though is the Touhy family. They created such a positive effect on Michael through their generosity and love. Not to mention Leigh Anne who first decided to help Michael. My absolute favorite part of this movie is when Leigh Anne is at a fancy lunch with her lady friends when they make a few comments about Michael. One lady says ""You're changing that boys life"". And Leigh Anne response is,""No. He's changing mine.""<br/><br/>Overall, I completely recommend watching, renting, and even owning this movie because of it's heartfelt message of finding your strength and making your future brighter than your past with the help of kind people."
"byson5186","4","1","2","18 October 2014"," Good Story, But Not Worth 2+ Hours Of Your Life
","I haven't seen this movie in 4 years. The last time I remember seeing this movie was when I was on a Cross Country team at college before a Cross Country race, just watching a motivational movie. I saw the whole movie one other time at the movie theater earlier and while my parents own a copy, it's not a movie I'd put on if I wanted a movie night. I think this movie is way too overrated. Before I talk about the cons for this movie, I'll talk about the pros. It's by all means a good story, I mean it would be somewhat interesting to read an article about the true story from the movie. It's interesting to think of the real story of Michael Oher, now a professional football player. I hope this doesn't count as a spoiler, but since it's based on a true story and we frequently hear this movie being referenced in pop culture, I'm sure almost all of us are aware that this movie is about, A black guy who went from being homeless, to being adopted by a rich Christian Caucasian family, and with his football skills, Oher eventually becomes a famous football player. Other pros for this movie, is it is somewhat nice to see a normal looking community and normal family activities. Bullock also did a great job playing Leigh Anne Tuohy. It's also a great Christian story, seeing how Oher goes into a Christian Private School, and how a Christian family welcomes him over. So, a very positive act done by a Christian family. But, here are some of the cons from this movie. A lot of the story has to do with what I wrote above, and while there is more to it than what I mentioned and could be summarized, the movie is a little over 2 hours long. It would have been better if it were just cut down to an hour and a half to explain Michael Oher's story. From what I remember, a lot of the scenes in the movie are slow showing how a family accepts Oher into their family, just showing typical family life and football games/practices where not many interesting things happen, at a slow pace. What else is also annoying about this movie, is it seems like the characters in this movie are obsessed with Michael Oher. I mean in almost every scene Oher isn't in, the characters from the school administrators to Sandra Bullock are basically just talking about Oher as if they had nothing else or nothing better to talk about. Now to mention a few other cons, a lot of us agree that S.J. is an annoying kid which is true. SJ really seems to look up to his adopted brother Oher, we could have gotten to know S.J. a little better other than those details, like school. Let's talk about S.J.'s sister, Collins. She's a character we hardly get to know. She doesn't seem to care at all or mind how the mom just invites some random guy over at their house too live with them and eventually adopt him, like she wouldn't care if her mom did or didn't do what she did. From what I remember, we did not get to know the Dad, Sean Tuohy too well either. The movie seemed mostly about Leigh Anne Tuohy and Michael Oher, and then the next main character S.J. So, the movie shows typical slow family activities of the life of a guy who became a great football player. It's not something that I'd think most people would want to spend two hours of their life watching. There's a 2+ hour movie that came out months later that is also a more motivational movie, a movie with more motivational action scenes, a more funny movie, and not to mention the main character in that movie is black like in this movie. The movie I'm referring to is Karate Kid. I feel like Karate Kid is a much better film and should have earned more money than The Blind Side as I feel like there's a lot more interesting things to Karate Kid from the scenes in China, to showing Martial Arts. However, that movie did do really well in the cinemas, but not as well as Blind Side as Blind Side made over $250 Million. There was even a good inspirational story which I feel like is a better story than this that also shows a Christian's faith which came out a little over a year later called, Soul Surfer. I feel like that story is more motivational and inspirational. One other movie I once saw with my Cross Country team is Cool Runnings. The main characters in that movie are Jamaican and it's a great story showing Jamaican guys making the first Jamaican bobsled team, it's also more funny too and fast paced to watch. So, I'm just saying that a lot of these things in this movie aren't worth so much of your time and Hollywood seems to make a big deal about Bullock's performance and of this inspirational true story. I give this movie a 4/10."
"BeneCumb","8","1","2","5 August 2014"," Interesting movie on a non-interesting main topic...
","...at least for me as I am not into sports, and the phenomenon and rules of US football have remained mystery to me. However, from time to time, I watch some sports movies, usually if the persons I admire are involved.<br/><br/>As for The Blind Side, the plot based on real persons and events provides a strong additional value, otherwise it could have become a moralizing story about racial tensions, wealth vs. poverty, naive attitudes on helping and alike, quite often present in Western movies aimed at as wide audience as possible. Here, it all makes sense, and we can follow a story of a young Afro-American lad from his scanty upbringing, through his years at Christian school and his adoption, to his position as one of the most appreciated prospects in college football, then finally becoming a first-round pick in the NFL. All the performances are at least good, but my favorites are Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy and Jae Head as Sean ""SJ"" Tuohy, Jr., whose roles distinguish from all the others, including Quinton Aaron as Michael ""Big Mike"" Oher who apparently was rather dull in real life. In addition, it was pleasant to notice ""Cinematography by Alar Kivilo"", probably the most known Estonian in Hollywood.<br/><br/>All in all, a good movie, although the start was protracted (plus without Bullock), and sports scenes covered quite a big share of the total length. But those ""minuses"" did not call away this generally smooth creation."

","I had not seen this movie in a long time, and I saw it on television last night. It is an incredible story and very well done movie. I think Sandra Bullock is great in it, as is the rest of the cast. You really felt like you were watching the actual family while tuning into the movie thanks largely to Bullock's performance. While I was watching it this time, I searched around online to see how much of it is true and it is surprisingly accurate. Some of the subjects quibble with some of the details, but less than in most true stories. The family is all still very close today in fact, which put a smile on my face.<br/><br/>I just think the story is so fantastic and inspirational that it is worth everyone watching, children or adult. The story of how the family helped Oher and at the same time Oher united the entire family is touching to say the least."

","The movie is based on the 2006 book The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game by Michael Lewis. The movie is heart touching and grabs your attention from the first scene .It's written and directed by John lee Hancock starring Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, and Quinton Aaron.<br/><br/>In his childhood, a 17 year old boy, old Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a huge, physically imposing black youth, grew up in Memphis. He left his drug addicted mother, but he goes to a foster care when he isn't running away to sleep anywhere else he can find.<br/><br/>Michael gets accepted into Wingate School, an exclusive private school, despite his low grades. After Michael starts attending classes at Wingate, most of his teachers believe he is unteachable, except his science teacher, Mrs. Boswell (Kim Dickens), who begins to understand that he learns in a different way. <br/><br/>Believing he is homeless, Leigh Anne Tuohy(Sandra Bullock), mother of Wingate students, Collins Tuohy (Lily Collins) and S.J. Tuohy (Jae Head), and the wife of wealthy businessman Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw). invites Michael to stay in their home for the night. But that one night slowly extends itself both in terms of time and emotion as the Tuohys begin to treat Michael like one of the family.<br/><br/>Part of that emotional investment for Leigh Anne is fully understanding Michael as a person so that he can fulfill his potential as a human being, which includes giving him opportunities such as what Coach Cotton initially saw in Michael as a potential American football player. The film ends saying that he'll succeed and become a professional player later on.<br/><br/>The movies has a moral lesson behind it, in my opinion, it is to be open minded about your surrounding and everyone is unique and has a different way of learning things."
"alexcomputerkid","9","1","2","23 February 2014"," The Blind Side is a majestic, heartfelt and insightful film that would work perfectly for the Relationship classes that are now taught in High School and College
","From 2009 to the present day, I wrote off The Blind Side like it was nothing. I've never been a big football fan even though it is the most popular sport in the United States and I just got tired of all the praise that this film got. As with any film though, The Blind Side can't be judged until it's watched. It offers like a dozen things that seems to come out of nowhere and it's very likable indeed. An overall great film.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, The Blind Side follows around homeless teen Micheal Orr (Quinton Aaron) who never grew up with parents who were there for him and who's really got nothing going for him. Like a billet family, Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) take Micheal in and raise him in a proper home that he never had. They show him the ways of life and Michael ends up turning into a football star through it all.<br/><br/>It sounds exactly like a football film but it also has the elements of family, how to do well in school and also how to channel violence in the right way. Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw play perfect parents and Bullock's work here won her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar Award in 2010. Collins (Lily Collins) and S.J. (Jae Head) play the kids of the family and both come off as unexpectedly good and add fun and humor to the film.<br/><br/>Another reason this cannot be considered just a full football film is the racial issues touched on here. This part of the story is of a African-American teenager trying to live in the South where we know it can be hard and the film tries to deliver the message that everybody is the same regardless of the color of your skin. I think this is one of the important messages in this world today and it is always nice when a film touches on this.<br/><br/>Once we get to the football scenes, we can't stay it's bad either. It's typical in the sense that it shows the character Michael Orr developing a toughness that wasn't there before. It also adds a football flavor to an already packed film and it is fun to watch cameos from college football coaches Nick Saban to Lou Holtz. Don't expect any good acting from these coaches but that is to be expected and the quality of the acting by the cameos is kind of beside the point anyway.<br/><br/>The Blind Side is a majestic, heartfelt and insightful film that would work perfectly for the Relationship classes that are now taught in High School and College. The film is mostly for teenagers but also for the whole family too. Expect a tearjerker though."
"kschmitz21","9","1","2","18 February 2014"," Family movie about love and football.
","In football a left tackle is the protector of the team. According to Leigh Anne Tuohy, an Ole Miss football fan, wife and mother of two, he has to be ""wide in the butt, massive in the thighslong arms, giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup."" But who is there to protect the left tackle on and off the field? The Blindside, based on the novel by Michael Lewis, follows the true story of NFL left tackle Michael Oher, from homelessness in, appropriately named, Hurt Village of Memphis, to the football field of Ole Miss and beyond. Under the direction of John Lee Hancock and supported by a marvelous cast, this film of love, family and football shares Oher's story of poverty to triumph and proves true family runs deeper than blood. Hancock took on the difficult task of turning the bestseller into a film. The movie accurately depicts Oher's story with only a few slight detours. One mistake is made on Oher's first day of football practice at his new school, in upper class Memphis, where he appears clueless on the rules, including not knowing the basic three point stance. Although this was designed to give the movie a light hearted comedic moment, Oher was knowledgeable. He came to school on an athletic scholarship. Other than this mistake the film brilliantly shows the relationship between the Tuohy family and Michael and the characters real life persona's. Oher grew up only miles from the Tuohy's, on the other side of Memphis, but seemed to be from a different universe. Hancock does an excellent job illustrating the polar opposite worlds. He shows Michael in baggy, worn out clothing, coming from a broken home, broken family and broken world filled with drugs and violence. While the Tuohy's, fast food tycoons, come from country clubs, fancy cars and designer clothing. From the beginning their relationship felt natural and welcoming. Quinton Aaron assumes the role of Oher with ease and excellence. He captures Oher, a gentle giant, as person and an athlete. Even though Aaron plays the main character, he has relatively few speaking lines throughout the movie because Oher was very closed off. Aaron relies largely on emotional execution and body language to tell the story. He does so in many ways including rubbing his knees when he felt anxious or out of place. Leigh Anne puts it best when she says ""he is like a fly in milk,"" because he stands out at his new school, on the football field and in the world because of his race and size. Many people have a hard time expecting Michael. The Tuohy's son, SJ, played by Jae Head, is one of the first people to befriend Michael. Head charms as Michael's pint sized side kick with a contagious smile. The chemistry between the two feels like they have always been brothers. Head stops at nothing to make sure his, ""big brother,"" is treated fairly and Michael always sticks an arm out to protect SJ. Leigh Anne and her family see they need Michael just as much as he needs them. Sandra Bullock steps into the shoes of the fiery and feisty Leigh Anne, where she gives the performance of her lifetime. She transforms into a sweet southern belle, not afraid to fight for her beliefs. The perfect balance of bossy and vulnerable, everything from Bullocks wardrobe, to her southern accent and body language screamed Leigh Anne. Bullock brings out her natural maternal instinct when starting down a gangster and fighting the NCAA. She shows that even though he is from a different world Michael is her son. The Tuohy family becomes Michael's left tackle and fill the cracks of his broken world. The movie reminds you of the importance of love and protecting your family. All 129 minutes are worth your time as it pulls at your heartstrings and truly changes your life."
"carli-johnson13","10","1","2","17 February 2014"," The Blind Side is the true success story of Michael Oher and how by the help of the Tuohy family he went from the streets to a star.
","'The Blind Side' Tackles the True Story of Michael Oher<br/><br/>Based on a true story. Showing these words at the beginning of a film immediately captures the attention and emotions of the audience. Films based off of a true story naturally make it easier for the audience to relate to the characters and empathize with them. This holds true for the emotional, heart-warming film The Blind Side. The true story of Michael Oher touches the hearts of all audiences.<br/><br/>Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), the African American son of a crack-addict mother and absent father, grew up in the stereotypical 'slums'. Michael literally had no direction when Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) found him wandering the streets in the middle of winter and offered him a warm bed for the night. This turns into many nights and then a permanent home. Michael Oher turns his life almost completely around while living with the Tuohys. He improves in the classroom and becomes a star on the football field. Michael Oher's 2009 draft into the NFL made this movie a blockbuster when it was released because of his true life story.<br/><br/>The Blind Side was nominated for 22 awards and took home eight mainly for the phenomenal acting by Sandra Bullock. She shined brightly in her role as Mrs. Tuohy, a rich, Southern-belle, white woman who takes Michael in. The conviction in every single one of Bullock's lines validated her decision to defy social norms and make Michael Oher part of her family. Though some may say the story whose focus was supposed to be on Michael Oher, focused too much on Bullock's portrayal of Mrs. Tuohy, the balance and relational dynamics between her and Aaron only enhanced the story. Bullock's soft but direct expressions like, ""you threaten my boy, you threaten me,"" perfected her role as an authoritative and proud mother. Mrs. Tuohy and Michael developed a completely believable mother-son relationship on screen. <br/><br/>The story of Michael Oher is nothing short of emotional however, director John Lee Hancock never forces the audience to break down and cry. The emotion-laden scenes like when Mr. and Mrs. Tuohy ask Michael if he wanted to be part of the family and he replies, ""I kinda thought I already was,"" are quickly balanced with a spark of humor, typically exhibited through the lively younger brother S.J. played by Jae Head. This balance is key to an emotional film because the audience remains emotionally invested without worrying about constantly having to dry their tears. The audience can grieve through the struggles Oher faces with school and his absent family and then laugh with S.J's way of describing football plays with the entire contents of the Tuohy's spice cabinet. <br/><br/>Hancock, did an amazing job portraying the true story of Michael Oher and his shambles to fame life. Some may critique him for turning the 'true story' into a more Hollywood version, but in films this is usually for the better and in this case it definitely is. He may have embellished a few parts of Oher's life, but unlike other 'true story' films he does not add unnecessary violence, sexual innuendos, or romance, yet he still captures the audience.<br/><br/>After seeing this film, prepare to have a heavy heart and a smile on your face. The story of Michael Oher and Mrs. Tuohy will leave you longing to make a difference in someone's life just as the Tuohys did for Michael, or at least longing to see another 'based on a true story' film."

The slam boy Michael was living by himself until a woman takes him to her house. Then he became adopted by that family. He had never played American football, but with a lot of effort and his big strong body, he becomes a good player. He also studies very hard and become smart enough get a scholarship. He then becomes famous and he is scouted by NFL. What is good about this film is that the family is treating him like a real member of the family. The way Michael contact with his brother is funny. What is interesting is that this is a true story and Michael Oher is doing very well in NFL. I don't really see NFL games but this film moved my heart a lot."

","The film The Blind Side directed by Hancock (2009), written from a true story about Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron, is a fun and touching view into how lives can be changed when a selfless family helps someone without any family of his own to speak of. Leigh Anne Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock, a busy career woman, wife, and mother sees a need and fills it, when she and her supportive husband Sean (Tim McGraw) find Michael homeless and walking in the rain. Humble Michael blends well with the Tuohy family as he learns and teaches lots of life lessons, ending up a star. <br/><br/>The themes of the drama touch on several categories. Categories such as social concerns around the disparity in income and access within the same city; and human dignity as a young man struggles to survive outside of the community he knows. But, most of all, the human relationships of people from a variety of social and financial backgrounds and how they can help and learn from one another as they grow into more fulfilled individuals. In addition, the film shows how people can grow to love and nurture others like family in a relatively short period of time. <br/><br/>Though the film begins rather slowly, the editing and sound crews do wonders in bringing to life. The use of flash and parallel cuts by the editor brings attention to the drama, fears, and action throughout the film. Both produced and ambient sounds along with the music in the movie heighten the experiences as if one were sitting in the car, the stands, or the living room with the family as they go through their daily adventures. When the time is taken to analyze the techniques used in the making of the film, it is amazing what the professionals behind the scenes can do to enhance the viewer's experience. <br/><br/>All in all the film is masterfully put together and may be useful in teaching many the joys and self-fulfillment received when stepping out of their comfort zone to share themselves and their good fortune with others. Much like the film Pretty Woman produced by Milchan (1990), also starring Sandra Bullock as Vivian, not only does the family rescue Michael from a life of despair and misfortune, but he ""rescues them right back"" by teaching them humility and gratitude. One can be fairly certain that Michael has not forgotten his ""family"" as he moved on to enjoy a successfully career with the Ravens."

","The blind side is not a biopic on Micheal but a family biopic that showcase the amazing changes one can do with family bonding.<br/><br/>It is meant to be a heartwarming movie, but what makes it different from most other heartwarming movies is that the script is designed to make anyone waste off tissue boxes in every few scenes. The director certainly maintains the neutrality of the movie very well; he did not eliminate the stereotype issues like racism but instead embrace them just enough to be undetectable.<br/><br/>However, this comes at its own costs of deterring from reality to a slightly more fairy tale-like sequence of events. For instance, the encounter of Leanne with the drug dealers, and the encounter with the real mother who, surprisingly, is much more stable and receptive of the situation than what I would expect (considering the actual timeline where the racial tension is supposed to be more vile?).<br/><br/>Otherwise, this movie succeeded in draining a large water amount from me. And, yes, I think Bullock does deserve her Oscars, even though there may be other nominees more deserving. From her interview it was clear how much effort she put in to portray as close to the real person as possible but admitted that it is 'impossible because Leanne is simply original'."

","I never liked movies with Sandra Bullock. I just don't like this actress. In this movie though, she is watchable. This movie is about a white Christian family who takes care of a black boy and give him everything his own parents never could give him, because he comes from a poor family. He gets a car, wrecks it and the white people don't care. He gets his own room, gets private schooling, his little brother and very, very beautiful sister take him as their brother.<br/><br/>Now I have seen Untouchables and now I have seen this movie, they both are lovely movies. But to me they are not very realistic. Maybe they happened in real life, I don't know, but as a colored boy I grew up in a white neighborhood and the one thing I learned is that white people, they just don't care about colored people. So maybe I just grew up in the wrong areas of the world, but movies like Untouchables and The blind side are just like Disney movies to me; What you are watching is just good entertainment, but it ain't real.<br/><br/>Good acting though, good story.

","I've just watched this film. I read this story as written by Michael Lewis, which is very interesting to read also. Great book, very good movie indeed. I never thought Sandra Bullock, who is a star, could also be as good as she is in this role. Her performance is not spectacular, because her character is phenomenal, but she clearly understood the essence of Lee-Anne Twohy as described by Michael Lewis. I've enjoyed the film very much. I was expecting some dramatic Hollywood-twisted scenes without any link with the real story of Michael Oher, who is also a phenomenon by himself. But not. There are a couple of scenes when you can guess, even if you have not read the book, that are just too much. But it's made with a nice sensibility. And it's a true story, totally unbelievable. A screenwriter would have imagine this story, any producer would have dumped it. It's impossible to dislike this film. Just a small problem: for people who are not fluent in English, the Southern accent of Nashville characters is hard to catch. But it does not reduce the fun to watch it even if translated. This family is unique and their story was to be told."

","The Screenplay "" The blindside"" is an awarding winning film starring Quinton Aaron, (Michael Oher)Sandra bullock (Leigh Anne Tuohy), Tim McGraw (Sean Tuohy), Lily Collins (Collins Tuohy), and Jae Head (S.J Tuohy).The film is based on the life of a lost, homeless African American teenager named Michael Oher. Michael's mother is a drug addict, and lives in the inner city projects ""Hurt village"". Due to his mother's lack of stability he was taken out of her custody. Overall Michael had a challenging childhood, endured a lot of pain and observed some horrible events. As Michael grew older he lost some of his close to the streets. He slept on couches of neighborhood friends. Eventually, luck landed him in a popular private school. Although Michael had what would be consider an ugly past he was a very manner able young man. His story touched a lot of people hearts. He was adopted by Tuohy's, a wealthy suburban white family. Over time the Touhy's helped him fulfill his potential as a student and athlete. Michael Oher became the NFL first draft pick. I think this film is excellent. However I did find the theme a little hard to decipher. Some would say that this nothing more than a bibliography of an NFL player's life whose story was really touching. Other may say this is just and demonstration of white guilt. I think that the theme is that everyone story is different, but at the end everyone has something that could be an asset to someone else. Coach Cotton used his creditability to get Michael in to school. In Return Michael made won championships for his sports team. The Tuohy's used their wealth and family oriented lifestyle to change to give Michael a second chance at life. In Return Michael embraced protected and showed them how life is on the less fortunate side. During the film some of the techniques I noticed were Subjective view point. During some of the scenes at the actual football games once Michael started to tackle his opponents you could feel his rage, and intensity. Another point of view used was the director's interpretive point of view. There were numerous of scenes where the director has manipulated the viewpoint of the viewers to make us see things in a different way. The lighting also had it effects on this film. It seemed to me that lighting in the suburban areas where brighter, versus the lighting in ""hurt Village"". During the scene where there was a lot of thought the lighting was dim. For example when Mrs. Tuohy was in the bed wondering if she had made the correct decision inviting Michael into her home. The Blindside is a very good film. I would give this movie five stars. The actors did I very great job fulfilling the roles of the characters. Not only did the actors learn something from one another, but it taught me some things too. I learned that some may not been given the same things as me, but to treat them as if they were equivalent to me. In return you may receive something even greater than what you had offered in the first place."

","The Blind Side describes a story about a homeless teenager who is taken in by a family who fulfills Michaels potential and changes their life in the process. The Blind side was about a true story with Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy who was played by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw who decide to take in a teenage boy Michael Oher who was played by Quinton Aaron. Michael's biological mother was a drug addict and Michael was a ward of the state. Leigh Anne did not know he was a ward of the state until she and Sean decided to adopt and take care of Michael. Michael has had no established education and in order for him to succeed in high school and keep his grades up, Leigh Anne and Sean hire a tutor to help his improve his GPA which in turn will help qualify him for a NCAA Division scholarship. Leigh Anne and her son S.J. Tuohy played by Jae Head, help train and get Michael into playing football. But because of Leigh Anne and Sean's contributions to their favorite college Ole' Miss, there were certain discrepancies brought up Michael wanting to attend that college. A NCAA Lawyer assumes the Touhy's were using Michael for his abilities and Michael felt used. Leigh Anne reassured Michael that they were not using him and they he could go to any college he chose to go to. Michael decided to attend Tennessee College and was the first pick to the Baltimore Ravens in 2000 of the NFL draft. Michael became an All-American offensive left tackle For the Baltimore Ravens with the help of his family and coaches. The motif of this movie has to be Leigh Anne continuing to go to the apartment complex where Michael grew up, whether she was looking for him or they were looking for his mother. The lighting of this movie was natural lighting for the most of the scenes in this film and the use of artificial lights for indoor scenes. The film was a very inspiring movie based on hard work and determination. The film shows people that if you want something on life you have to work hard for it and not every hard working family will pass someone up on the street, they are just as determined to help people out and this movie proves the love for family."

","The film The Blind Side, based on the true story of Leigh Anne played by (Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy played by (Tim McGraw), two people who take in a homeless teenage African-American, Michael Oher, also known as ""Big Mike"" played by ( Quinton Aaron) . Michael has never really had a true family, and does not know the whereabouts of his father and or his mother, whom he has left because she was a drug-attack. Michael has had little education and few skills to help him learn. With help of the Tuohy family, and teachers at the Wingate Christian School, he soon begins to gain the proper knowledge and skills he needs to be able to try out for the school's football team. Leigh Anne soon takes charge, and helps to ensure that the young man has every opportunity to prosper. Leigh Anne starts off by giving the coach a few ideas on how best to use Michael's skills and help him become a football player with such ""protective"" instincts. The Tuohy family, not only gives him a loving home, but hire a tutor, Miss. Sue played by (Kathy Bates) to help him improve his grades to the point where he would qualify for an NCAA Division I, and be eligible for an athletic scholarship. With the help and support of everyone around Michael, he was the first-round pick of the Baltimore Ravens in the 2009 NFL draft. (Hancock, 2009) In the opening scene where Michael is sitting in the back seat of a car with his friend and his friend's father, the viewer sees life though Michael's eyes as he is riding along in Big Tony's car and the viewer gets the idea the kind of life Michael has while driving through the ghetto and into a better neighborhood as they get closer to the school. The camera angles are very observant to the characters view. Another scene that shows good lighting and has specific relevance to the theme, is where Leigh Anne shows Michael his room and he then tells her he has never had a bed before. The lighting is very bright but as Michael scans the new bedroom he is given, it gets lighter as he explains to Leigh Anne he has never had a bed the lighting grows darker as Leigh Anne exits the room and goes to her room to ponder the information Michael had just given her. This gives the viewer the feeling of emotions that have overtook Leigh Anne as she has realized she has just given Michael something he has never had before. One of my favorite scenes in this film is when S.J. played by (Jae Head) and Michael are driving in Michael's new truck and listening to music and they get into the wreck, the director uses a slow motion type affect that shows the truck smashing into the truck and the airbag deploying and Michael stopping it from hitting S.J. The angles used in this scene give the viewer the feeling as if they are in the accident too. This film reminds me of the film Radio with Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. The theme is somewhat close to the theme of The Blind Side. Both characters are taken under the wing of white people who give them the guidance and love they deserve along with a chance to prosper."

With the family being so accepting, loving, and open to this boy loving him enough to eventually adopt him. We could learn a few things from this family ourselves. ""The Blind Side"" teaches us not only to love others and treat them like we would like to be treated but also not to judge a person before we know them. The person could be one amazing person just afraid to shine and show their true colors right away.

Don't get me wrong, she is pretty good in the movie. But it's the overall impact of the whole thing, that made her win (is my guess).<br/><br/>While it might also be the TV movie of the week, the naturalistic approach by our main actor does upgrade it quite a bit.

","""The Blind Side"" tells the true story of Michael Oher, a recent first round NFL draft choice whose path to the pros was fraught with adversity. As a homeless teenager he is taken in by a woman and her family who help him to succeed both academically and on the football field.<br/><br/>The story as presented in the film is compelling but it also bears the unmistakable imprint of Hollywood at every turn. The feel-good, inspirational plot points often seem too good to be true and, from what I've read, many (unsurprisingly) aren't true. Moreover, the Tuohy family life is portrayed as little short of idyllic and their clan even includes a precocious youngster. More troubling than these manufactured elements, though, is the fact that the script seems to treat Oher as little more than a prop, never giving us much of a glimpse into his personality.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Sandra Bullock was rewarded with an Oscar for her performance as Leigh Anne Tuohy, the woman who takes Oher under her wing. As always, she's a likable presence and this is probably her best performance to date. Quinton Aaron plays Michael Oher, giving what I suppose is a decent performance, though it's hard to say since the character is pretty flat. The rest of the cast, which includes Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates, is up to par.<br/><br/>On the technical side of things, the film shows polish but not much character. The direction and score are both solid but forgettable.<br/><br/>In the end, the appeal of the ""The Blind Side"" is somewhat paradoxical. The film has all the hallmarks of a cookie-cutter Hollywood production yet it hits its targets so accurately that one can't help but get caught up in the story. Thus, the film is hard to dislike, even though it's not without its problems."

","It would be easy to be cynical about ""The Blind Side"" - to point out how it's just another tale of a do-gooding rich white person condescending to help out a struggling minority; that it once again shows a minority at the mercy of the generous white folk; and that it is filled with heart-tugging but implausible Kumbaya moments designed to make us feel good about ourselves and our own nobility. Yes, it would be easy to do that, but the fact that it is based on a true story - that of Michael Oher who went on to play in the NFL - goes a long way towards nipping at least some of that cynicism in the bud.<br/><br/>Based on the book ""The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game"" by Michael Lewis, ""The Blind Side"" is what ""Precious"" might have been had it been designed with a mass-audience in mind - a lump-in-the-throat, feel-good crowd-pleaser about a generally inarticulate, plus-size black youngster who's falling through the cracks big time due to poverty and wretched parenting. Only, in Michael's case, he's ""rescued"" by the Tuohy family - primarily the feisty, socialite mom, Leigh Anne - who not only provides him with a beautiful home and a loving environment but lessons on how to be a world-class football player as well. A behemoth of a kid who's as shy and reticent off the field as he is aggressive and domineering on - at least once Leigh Anne has given him a good talking to - Michael doesn't seem nearly as scarred by his upbringing or as embittered towards humanity as one might expect given all he's been through as a child (he's certainly miles ahead of Precious in the coping department).<br/><br/>True story or not, none of this comes across as all that convincing, and there are times when ""The Blind Side"" threatens to drown itself and us in a sea of sanctimony and almost constant sentimental uplift. But it also manages to pull itself back from the precipice, at least periodically, thanks to the performances by Sandra Bullock - pushy and aggressive without being off-putting - and Quinton Aaron, who turns Michael into a sweet, likable kid. And little Jae Head (""Hancock"") steals every scene he's in as Michael's wise-beyond-his-years little ""brother,"" S.J. Writer/director John Lee Hancock doesn't bring a whole lot of ingenuity to the plotting or depth to the characters, but he gets the job done, which, I suppose, is all one can really ask for from a film in this genre.<br/><br/>As a drama centered around high school football in the South (in this case, Memphis), ""The Blind Side"" can't hold a candle to the magnificent TV version of ""Friday Night Lights,"" but its inspirational story may get to you anyway - whether you choose to give yourself over to it or not."

","The Blind Side was a movie I really didn't think much of to be honest, I thought it was another typical sports biopic, but when I heard all the praise for it, and how good Sandra's performance was, I had to go see it. Quinton Aaron's portrayal of Michael Oher is absolutely terrific. You are able to feel the pain with him, because he does not know how to learn properly and the more harder he works at it, the more you root for him. I think the most amazing aspect about this movie is the fact that a rich Southern Family like the Tuohy's let in a poor Black man into there lives, let alone parent him it was really quite amazing and humbling to watch. One of the scenes that truly hit me the most had to be when Leigh Anne|Bullock| goes and visit's Michael's mom|Aaron| at her place, even though she's as high as a kite, it was emotional and well done. The Blind Side isn't an overly complicated movie, in fact it's rather simple, but in the end it's a touching film that is mostly worthy of all the acclaim it's received.<br/><br/>Performances. Sandra Bullock gives a career defining performance here, and believe me it is worth the hype. I've always adored Sandra Bullock but here she takes her game to the next level. She deserved her Oscar completely, because she put her all into the role, and she completely resembled the real Leigh Anne, it was quite remarkable. Quinton Aaron is brilliant as Michael. His facial expressions told all a lot of the times, and in the end I loved his performance. Tim McGraw surprised me with his excellent performance here, and his chemistry with Sandra was fantastic. Jae Head gives a sly and wonderful performance as the kid S.J. I don't like kid actors, but he was terrific, I especially loved his scenes with Quntion Aaron. Kathy Bates has a small but very important role in the movie, and once again brought some class.<br/><br/>Bottom line. The Blind Side is one Of the best movies 0f 2009 by far, and thankfully lives up to the hype for the most part.

","BLIND SIDE is a quiet little film, one of the type we usually see on Hallmark Hall of Fame on television, that carries a tender message without really offending anyone or challenging the mentality of the viewer. It just happens to be based on a book by Michael Lewis who in turn based his writing on a true story 'the story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy ho became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family.' John Lee Hancock adapted the novel for the screen and directed it. He scored a hit when he decided to cast Sandra Bullock as the brave society no nonsense mother Leigh Anne Tuohy, giving Bullock the opportunity to polish her acting chops to a fare-thee-well. Tim McGraw is very strong as the husband/father Sean Tuohy and the two young actors who play the biological Tuohy children - Jae Head and Lily Collins - are equal to their 'parents' performances. Quinton Aaron is the quiet pacifist Michael Oher who is taken into the household of a Southern family as an equal in Memphis Tennessee where racial bias still exists. It is the transformation of Michael as well as the florid transformation of the Tuohy family (especially the brilliantly realized Leigh Anne) that makes this little film glow. Kathy Bates makes a brief cameo as a tutor for Michael and Ray McKinnon makes his role as the coach credible. And the rest of the cast offer of a very high quality of support. <br/><br/>BLIND SIDE is not a great movie, just as 'PRECIOUS etc etc etc' is not a great movie: at the core of both of these films are the moments of light that enter the lives a unfortunate youngsters who then radiate the lives of those who have the courage to believe in the equality of mankind.

Personally I am generally turned off by this genre of film. I like dark Indie movie, Stanley Kubrick,action films and everything unpredictable. I am not saying that people who generally share the same taste has me would like but it worked on me.<br/><br/>The story is about Micheal a gigantic Black teenager from the projects who gets a scholarship I upper class white school. The reason for this is his size and the possibilities he has for the football team. A mother, played by Sandra Bullock, gets concerned and takes him in her wealthy family.<br/><br/>The main qualities of the movie is that it's packed with original jokes, a very solid script, unpredictable, captivating characters, and excellent acting.<br/><br/>The movie had two mistake that weaken the intelligence of the film and they are two cliché moments. Like I said it's a very American film, I was expecting to have those spread around all over the film, which is not the case. But only two times. It also has something I cant explain.<br/><br/>He are those moments do not read or you'll be spoiled.<br/><br/>Micheal, the black kid, passes by a park and small kids seem to like him and ask him to push them on the swings. The daughter of the Mother sees that and at that moment she becomes sympathetic of him. A little later he plays football and gets distracted by balloon flying by and it's funny. I felt she should have became sympathetic at that moment. The scene with the kids was a bit unreal I don't think a Black guy from the project would play with little white kids, even pushing kids nicely on swings. Never the less everyone around the knew him so it's not impossible either. Also it's not executed in a over the top cheesy manner too, like it may sound, but we have seen this before.<br/><br/>When Micheal trains for football there is a training montage with an unessential homage to the Rocky films. It's not over the the top but obvious.<br/><br/>They hire a tutor, played by Katie Bates, to help him in school. She is sympathetic the whole film. When Micheal needs to choose a university later in the film she convince him to choose a university instead of another, because extremely fantastic weird stuff. That gets Micheal in problems, down the line it is never explained why she did that and she isn't punish for it... I find very odd.<br/><br/>Excellent film"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","27 February 2010"," Top-notch melodrama-rendering of a true story of inspiration
","When people say ""real life is stranger than fiction"" they can't be talking about making a motion picture from a true story. What usually happens there is that ""artistic touches"" have to be applied to give the audience what they usually expect from a movie – suspense, explosive conflicts, convoluted plot twists, tragic turn of events and such (within limits, not over-fictionalizing). In short, people want melodrama. Some movies overdo it. ""The blind side"" has just the right, sensible touch.<br/><br/>The same thing can be said from the angle of a football (this is not soccer, sorry) fan. The exciting positions in an offensive team are the quarterback (leadership, impeccable combination of intelligence and skill), running backs (bread-and-butter action), wide receivers (spectacular feat and punishing price to be paid – a rock-hard helmet ramming at the unprotected ribs) and tight-end (versatility). Less exciting are the five guys at the line of scrimmage – centre, guards and offensive tackles (Michael Oher, our protagonist, is one). Throwing a block can be exciting to watch, but not quite as much as what these other guys do. Again, ""The blind side"" has the right touch in extracting the excitement out of this aspect of the game without overdoing it.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, this is a true story, quite a simple one: an upper-middle class Republican family bringing a depraved and deprived black kid into their home, first out of charity, then eventually making him truly a part of the family. This is a feel-good, heart-warming story but being a true story, limits the cinematic elements mentioned above. What makes it work is a good, solid, unpretentious script that moves the story along with good humour and not overwrought sentimentality. Almost overused is the technique of ""echoing"" a line spoken earlier in the movie, for comic or poignant effect. It works every time. Doubtlessly, some would allude to such things as manipulation of the audience's emotion. If you think about it, this is like going to a health spa and then criticising the masseur for manipulating your muscle! The audience do go into the cinema to have their emotions manipulated. The point is how it is done – tastefully or clumsily. With ""The blind line"" it's obviously the former.<br/><br/>But most importantly, it's the two protagonists, played admirably by Quinton Aaron and Sandra Bullock.<br/><br/>The key to the character of all star defence tackle Michael Oher, as portrayed in this movie anyway, is one particular aspect of his psychological profile – the near perfect (98%) score in protective instincts. This has double meanings, as the movie sensibly makes no mystery about. The first is self-preservation. Childhood trauma taught Michael to hide in a shell and reveal as little as possible about himself. The other is the more literal, application – the essence of the job of an offensive tackle. Aaron plays his role well, taciturn (but not sullen, as there is always a barely discernible suppressed smile when something good happens) at first, then gradually opening up and all the time portraying also the impeccable decency of his character.<br/><br/>This movie, however, is Sandra Bullock's show. Leigh Anne Tuohy should be pleased of Bullock's portrayal of her, Memphis southern accent and all. Happy also are Bullock's fans, for her first major award, the Golden Globe. Her achievement in this film has also been recognized by her peers, in the Screen Actors' Guild award. It's most interesting to compare the two top rom-com stars in the last two decades – Bullock and Meg Ryan – their transition to a more ""mature"" phase of their screen persona. At one point, it seems that neither is getting anywhere, especially Ryan, with the failed attempt in ""In the cut"" (2003). Bullock tried with ""Murder by number"" (2002) without much success. Now, with ""The blind side"", she has served notice, loud and clear, that she has landed. The reason seems clear. Ryan's sweetness cannot be carried over to the next phase of her cinematic progression while Bullock's rough edge becomes her as a mother with a teenage kid. As a woman who knows exactly what she wants and dares to stare down any adversary, trash-mouth red neck white coach and threatening-talking black drug dealer alike, Bullock shines, helped also by her cryptic, punchy lines in the script. The additional edge that wins her Golden Globe is her ability to add a touch of the tenderness in her heart ""underneath the layers of onion"".<br/><br/>The rest of the cast radiates warm alike: Tim MaGraw as the perfect husband, Lily Collins as the sweetness personified teenage daughter and, best of all, Jae Head as the know-it-all little brother with one tenth of Michael's size and a larger-than-life screen presence. Deservedly, he won a couple of ""young actor"" awards. Finally, in a small role as Miss Sue, Michael's private tutor (and heavens forbid, a Democrat), Kathy Bates is simply wonderful, as always."

Her husband Sean (Tim McGraw) knows better than to say a word. She is that kind of woman, and I certainly want to stick around to see what she does next.<br/><br/>She is a formidable woman and with a great supporting cast that including Ray McKinnon and Kathy Bates, along with Jae Head and Lily Collins.<br/><br/>I laughed all through the movie, but, what is more important, I was inspired by Leigh Ann Tuohy. I have always believed that you should live your life keeping in mind that you may be the only Bible someone ever reads. Leigh Ann lived the Christian life. It was reflected in her actions every day.

"3xHCCH","8","1","2","19 January 2010"," ""Precious"" in a More Positive Light
","One of my favorite actresses finally gets a Golden Globe Best Actress award, and most likely an Oscar nomination will follow, with a role in this movie. So with that incentive, I went and sought out to watch Sandra Bullock in ""The Blind Side."" <br/><br/>This movie is a true story about an abandoned black gentle-giant teenager Michael Oher adopted by a wealthy white Southern family, the Tuohys. It is a story that is pushing the boundaries of racial relations. It is amazing in that this unlikely story actually happened in real life. A fictional story like this could potentially be offensive. However, with genial storytelling and the general good will of the stars, a warm feel-good message is sent across to the audience. I personally felt that this movie is like ""Precious"", in an infinitely more positive and watchable, albeit somewhat sugar-coated, light.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is very much herself here in the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy. I do not really see anything special that she did to merit awards consideration. She is her reliable good-natured persona that made her star since ""Speed"". But that said, I am glad that she is recognized for her fine work. The other members of the cast were also very good. I did not recognize country star Tim McGraw without his hat, but he held his own against Sandra. The youngest Touhy kid is scene-stealing cute without verging into annoying. The actor who played Michael is well-cast, a charming embodiment of the meek yet tough character.<br/><br/>For the general local audience unfamiliar with American football, these scenes may be lost on most of us. They did try to explain in layman's terms what the left offensive tackle (Michael's position on the football team) does. The actual cameo appearances of real American college football coaches will certainly be lost to us as well. However, the very heart and soul message of the movie, that of helping out the less fortunate among us despite social repercussions, will surely reverberate."
"serghei_romanu","9","1","2","15 January 2010"," One of those great films to be remembered in time.
","""The Blind Side"" is the most successful Sadra Bullock film ever, maybe Speed and Crash having something to say over this statement.<br/><br/>Based on true events, this title tells the story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized Young boy, the product of a poisonous environment in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods. His only chance is the Tuohy family - a wealthy family to say at least - , Leigh Anne Tuohy to be more specific, as she offers her support and invites Michael, to join them for one night at their mansion.<br/><br/>Later on,Leigh Anne becomes more and more interested Michael's situation, as she realizes this boy's sufferance and misery. Not long after, the Touhy family decides it's time to legally adopt Michael in order to make him a real member of their family. Meanwhile the discover that Michael has something special, a self-preservation instinct which makes him suitable for contact sports, like American football, and the Tuohy family loves football...<br/><br/>The acting was high quality, Sandra Bullock did a fabulous job as Leigh Anne, she was genuine and succeeded in transmitting the wonderful personality of her character. I liked the little actor too, he was very energetic, always in the mood for conversation and funny things to say. It's a fair judgment to say that the entire cast did a great, great work as the film looked realistic and authentic, at least to me<br/><br/>I say it one more time, ""The blind side"" is one of the most inspirational and emotional films I've seen in quite a while. I respect and admire the Touhy family, because they didn't just gave Michael a shelter, but treated him with love and care, made him feel like part of their family, and that is really special.<br/><br/>I rate this title a well deserved ****1/2 out of ***** (9/10)"
"TOMASBBloodhound","8","1","2","10 January 2010"," Delivers what you'd expect.
","A quintessential feel-good movie, about the only thing unexpected here is that Dennis Quaid didn't play the father! Instead we get Tim McGraw hiding under a wig and delivering a fairly decent performance as the successful hen-pecked husband of Sandra Bullock. The Blind Side is the mostly true story of Michael Oher, a disadvantaged Memphis teen who is taken in by a wealthy family and turned into a good student and a great offensive tackle. I just watched Oher and his Baltimore teammates run wild over Tom Brady's Patriots today, as a matter of fact.<br/><br/>Obviously when you go to see a movie like this, you already know the ending. Unless you don't watch football or have no idea who Micheal Oher is. So the challenge for the filmmakers is to construct a compelling story of how he got to where he is today. And for the most part John Lee Hancock and company make it worthwhile. Not only do we come away understanding Oher's very difficult childhood, be we also get a feel for just how big a risk the Touhy family is potentially taking by inviting him into their home. Though it is suggested at one point that they are only grooming a great athlete for service at their alma mater, we can clearly see that the Touhys care about Michael as a student and a person as well.<br/><br/>The cast is generally up to the task at hand. Bullock is fairly convincing as an attractive southern belle whose idea it originally is to offer Michael a place to stay. Will she get any Oscar consideration? Probably not, but who knows. Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher might have been a bit too pudgy for the role but his portrayal will make you care about the man's plight. There are also quite a few real-life coaches playing themselves to varying degrees of success. None of these men currently hold the coaching positions they did when this movie takes place. Congrats to Tommy Tuberville on his getting the Texas Tech job this weekend. He's a good man who won't be locking any players in closets like someone we know. Football fans more than anyone else will like this movie best of course. 8 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"Deckard-16","9","1","2","7 January 2010"," Blind-sided by Quinton Aaron, bullish on Bullock
","Disclaimer: I often think that movie makers DO get the books right at least 50% of the time (& sometimes they actually improve upon them).<br/><br/>This movie proved to be a really nice surprise.<br/><br/>I love the book & 20/20 piece did a nice job on the story so I felt I had already seen the movie. (So why spend $10 on it?)<br/><br/>The actor cast as Oher did not look intimidating enough (as he is initially portrayed in the book) to pull off the unlikely transition that is the key to this true story so I thought this would be Leigh Anne Touhy's story due to all the press about Sandra Bullock's performance in it.<br/><br/>I was wrong. Oher is the main character & Quinton Aaron proved more than capable of portraying this complex young man as I remember him in Michael Lewis's excellent prose. BUT it is also the Touhys' family story as well & Bullock well deserves the Oscar nom she is likely to get. Unfortunately for her & the movie it may too down-home-value oriented for her to get the statue.<br/><br/>The movie is schmaltzy, a bit corny & pushes some obvious emotional buttons (things I typically hate in a movie) but John Lee Hancock & his players never push too hard. The true story itself is incredible. The movie's makers know this & are smart enough not to over sell it --in fact they actually pull back from a scene on the football field that Lewis described in further detail when Oher finally decides enough is enough.<br/><br/>If you liked REMEMBER THE TITANS (which pushed buttons much further & got away with it) then you'll love this movie. It is one of the best of the year, but be quiet & don't tell ""Hollywood"" that."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","2","5 January 2010"," A very good film because it remembers that its story and characters are real
","Sometimes all it takes to make a movie is a good story with a director and a cast capable of seeing it for what it is. ""The Blind Side"" is an excellent example of why our interest continues to peak at the tagline ""based on a true story"" in movie trailers. You get the sense that Warner Bros, John Lee Hancock and star Sandra Bullock understand that the story they're telling is real, it's positive and it's heart-warming.<br/><br/>""The Blind Side"" is the story of real-life football player Michael Oher, currently a left guard with the Baltimore Ravens who went from homeless to a first-round NFL pick with them help of the Tuohy family, who took him in and gave him the confidence to succeed at football and life. Although the details of the story have been stretched to make the film more dramatic, the essence of the story and the values it preaches are the same and they're what count most.<br/><br/>Hancock has taken necessary liberties with the story. To be truthful, there's not a lot of bad or a lot of conflict and the film might have been too fluffy without exaggerations. The Tuohy's took Michael, a boy from a bad neighborhood who was enrolled in their school with some convincing from the football coach, and they helped him attain the grades to not only stay eligible in high school but also earn a scholarship to play football in college. Hancock resorts to a lot of dramatic conventions to keep the story engaging and the audience feeling sympathy for Michael but also excited to see him succeed. They all work, even if they're a bit cheap at times.<br/><br/>The cast, however, really brings it all together. Everyone in this film natural and relatable. No one is written as or behaves like a stereotype or fit a specific mold -- at least none of the main characters. They realize they're playing real people leading normal lives. Only Jae Head as the little brother, S.J., tries hard to create humor where it doesn't come naturally but he gets away with being cute. The standout example of this is the hiring of all the real-life coaches to act as if they were in their former jobs and recruiting Michael. It seems gimmicky, but it's fun and it shows the effort to honor the truth of the story.<br/><br/>As for Bullock, I've finally seen a film where she has really impressed me. I'm not sure about the Oscar talk, but I can't say a bad thing about her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy. She creates such definitive portrait of Leigh Anne as tough, loving, selfless and even a bit abrasive. She plays her as sensitive and well-meaning where she could have just gone overboard with southern bell housewife stereotypes (considering we all know she's done plenty of over-the-top characters), but she realizes this is a real woman she's playing and gives Leigh Anne the dimension she deserves. Most importantly, she is naturally funny and doesn't shove humor down our throats like in her ditzy romantic comedy roles.<br/><br/>""The Blind Side"" is a likable film, one way more about family and achieving ones goals than it is about football. This is not a cheesy, football-focused sports drama with typical sports themes and dramatizations of football games. Hancock understands the importance here is not football. This does make Bullock's bookend narration about how former football pro Lawrence Taylor changed the game of football for left tackles a bit irrelevant, but it serves as another reminder of how Michael Oher's story is real and it's an interesting and important one.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"
"clivechristy","8","1","2","2 January 2010"," Surprisingly Good
","This movie belongs to Sandra Bullock, who I will admit, I dislike as an actress. I think in movies generally the RomCom genre she usually appears in, makes her roles tired, and she often appears tired in those movies. When she has done serious, she always appears to me to lack the chops to make the roles believable or real. This is different. This movie starts off with characters, and builds them. Remember when films used to require a script, and acting...well ""The Blind Side"" is that kind of movie. Sandra Bullock is astonishing (not sure if it is her, or my generally low expectations for her) but she takes the role and makes it her own. I am not American and have no idea about American Football, but that is not the core of the story.<br/><br/>The heart of the story is a family that opens their home to a boy who seems to have nothing, but of course has so much...it just requires getting over petty stereotypes. It could have fallen into cliché, and there were moments when it teetered on the verge, but it always managed to stay on the rails. The support cast is outstanding, and altogether it is a positive and uplifting film without being cloying or chocolate box. For someone who had low expectations, take it from me, this one is worth the time and money. Sandra Bullock deserves her Golden Globes nomination for this movie although having been nominated for ""The Proposal"" as well might take some of the sheen off this gem."

This hardworking, warm-hearted man shows us how anything is possible, doesn't matter where you come from. But the family support is essential for anyone. The actor who portrays Michael Oher performs beautifully and Sandra Bullock has a, may I say, Oscar-winning performance.

They are both alums of Ole Miss or University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi. Bullock does her best as portraying Leigh Anne to be both flawed and credible. She doesn't overdue her performance as the wealthy white woman who brings Big Mike home to their million-dollar home in Memphis for one night which lasts a couple of years. She warms up to him who changes the family in ways that probably wouldn't have been possible. Big Mike prefers to be called Michael. Until he became homeless, he was living on the couch of a neighbor in the slums who offered a place to stay because his mother has substance problems. Michael has flashbacks to his childhood but the film doesn't dwell on it so much. Michael gets into a private Christian school because they think he can play football.

","Actress Sandra Bullock is on the top of her game in the sports drama ""The Blind Side"". The movie is based on the real life story of a wealthy southern socialite's caretaking of an underprivileged inner city teen who turned out to be NFL Rookie Left Tackle Michael Oher. His childhood was not too different than other young black boys living in the inner city. His father had mental issues, and his mother was a crack addict trying to raise a handful of children. Young Oher traveled from foster home to foster home during this time. As a teen, Oher was reserved, isolated, and near mute. But one could not be blinded to his enormous body frame and athletic talent. A catholic high school coach gets introduced to Oher and convinces school administration to bring that Oher on board even though he does not have the academic aptitude required in such a school. But here enters Leigh Anne Tuohy, the wealthy wife of a restaurant franchise owner, who takes in the solitaire teen Oher into their home. Leigh Anne has two kids of her own in the sweet teenage girl Collins and the charismatic young boy S.J.; Collins is a bit more reserved at first in welcoming Michael while S.J. adores him from the start. Like S.J., Leigh Anne's husband Sean (played by Tim McGraw, yes that one country boys & girls) is also very supportive of Michael from its huddling beginning. Eventually, the Tuohys become the left and right guards of Michael by becoming his legal guardians. Writer-Director John Lee Hancock does not block the formulaic inspirational & sentimentality themes of most sports films but in ""The Blind Side"" but he presents it with goodwill tones instead of salvation armies rah-rah's as most other sports narratives; so kudos to Hancock for his superpower donations in quarterbacking ""The Blind Side"". Hancock's screenplay is a bit cliché filled but he did open up the lines for some touching messages on caring for others. But what will sweep you away the most of ""The Blind Side"" is the commanding performance of Sandra Bullock as the vigorous but yet endearing Leigh Anne Tuohy. All the supporting acting performances follow her lead; but not even in the same ""pro acting bowl"" category as hers. Even the great master Bates, (Kathy that is) playing Michaels's tutor could not compare to Bullock's tour-de-force work. It would be complete bullocks if Sandra is not handed off a Best Actress Academy Award. I think I have tackled my viewpoints on ""The Blind Side"" so now it is your turn to call your plays on this non-offensive movie which I am sure will open your hearts. ***** Excellent"

","Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) has just had the ""good fortune"" to be accepted into a private, Christian school in Memphis. Once the football coach got a glimpse of ""Big Mike"", he was determined to get the teenager enrolled, for the lad is very tall and very broad. But, unknown to everyone, Michael has had a difficult life up to this very moment. He has been in and out of foster homes for years, after the authorities discovered his mother's drug habit and his father's absence. At the present, he is living at the all-night laundromat, where each night he washes out his two shirts. The teachers at the school learn Michael is bright but can not read or write well. Alas, too, the other pupils don't extend the hand of friendship. One day, however, an elementary student named SJ strikes up a conversation with Michael that makes the big guy smile. Later that night, SJ and his parents, Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) are driving home from a school event when they spy Mike, coat-less, walking out in the cold. When Leigh Anne learns SJ knows the teen, she insists on asking Michael to come home with them for the night. Learning a few necessary facts, Leigh Anne and Sean soon invite Michael to stay with them as long as he wants. Before many weeks have passed, Michael is a part of the family and has his own room and some new clothes. The Tuohys also help Michael with his school work so that he will be able to make the football team. But, will Michael's past come back to haunt his relationship with his new, loving family? This is an outstanding movie that is very touching and very inspirational. Michael Oher is one truly courageous and hard-working athlete who opened his heart to a new family and a new life when he met the Tuohys. Yes, this rich Memphis couple deserve much praise, also, for their efforts to turn Michael's existence in a new direction. But, only Michael could have made the extreme changes and dedication that allowed him to flourish, on the football field and in school. Bravo, Michael, bravo and more. As the principal characters, Bullock, McGraw, Kathy Bates and especially Aaron are most wonderful. All of the lesser actors are very fine, too. The setting in Memphis is authentic, from the worst side of town, where Michael was born, to the best, where the Tuohys reside. Costumes and production values are terrific, as are the script and surefooted direction. In short, make certain that you include time for you and yours to see this absolutely winning movie. No one will be blind to the beauty of its tale of love and triumph."

","Although the plot is depressing at times, the story is positive and heart-warming. Personally I don't like movies circling around sports too much and I don't even understand Football, so these parts eluded me. However, Sandra Bullock definitely had a role of her life with an excellent performance. Because the story is sentimental it would have been easy to screw up the movie by a weaker actress. Unfortunately, I was a bit unhappy with the performance of Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher. Oher's character comes across as too sluggish so it is difficult to believe that he pulled off his achievements. The whole Tuohy family also remains a bit undifferentiated except Jae Head who also plays a great role as S.J. Overall, it is a very encouraging movie about courage, (white) privilege (or the lack of it), and how to make a change."

","When Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a wealthy Memphis wife and mother, meets homeless teen Mike Oher (Quinton Aaron), she brings him into her home as one of the family.<br/><br/>The movie, based on a true story, is fairly predictable as it heads toward its happy and tear-jerking ending, but it's told so well that it's never corny or maudlin. The traumas Mike endured early in life are alluded to rather than graphically shown, and one is left with overwhelming admiration for him and the Tuohy family. Sandra Bullock is great as the feisty Leigh Anne and singer Tim McGraw is very likable as her husband. Quinton Aaron is excellent as the abandoned child who went on to graduate from college and play professional football. Many real-life college football coaches play themselves as Mike is wooed by all the top schools. Highly recommended."
"Miles-10","8","1","2","10 December 2009"," Three Strikes and a Touch Down
","This movie had many strikes against it going in. I am not crazy about football movies, or feel-good holiday movies where everyone is without a mean bone in his or her body (except some clichéd curmudgeon who has a Scroogian change of heart in the end whether he/she be a major or minor character). Nor for the emotional manipulations and simplifications that go on when a movie is based on a true story and the filmmakers melodramatize it and dumb it down for the audience. In ""The Blind Side"", if these people were half as good in real life as they are made out to be in this picture, there probably never was any conflict that amounted to anything as melodramatic as the climax here. All that being said, I must give this movie a positive review.<br/><br/>""The Blind Side"" also had a strike against it because it reminds me of the cynical joke in ""The Hollywood Shuffle"" about a TV sitcom where a white person takes in a bat played by a black actor and the name of the sitcom is ""There's a Bat in My House"", which is clearly meant to parody every clichéd sitcom about a black person living with a white host.<br/><br/>""The Blind Side"" overcomes an awful lot of the strikes against it by being well written, directed and acted. They don't seem as much like clichés while you're watching them. Yet the clichés are all there. That is an amazing achievement. I wouldn't go to a sequel or a remake or other attempt to recapture the magic of this movie because nobody could do it without turning it into utter schmaltz.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is at the top of her game as Leigh Anne Tuohy, the real-life Memphis woman who decided to take Michael Oher, a good-natured sixteen-year-old underachiever (played sensitively by Quinton Aaron) into her home one Thanksgiving Eve and never let him leave until she and her husband sent him off to college two years later, in the mean time having become his legal guardians, hired a tutor so that he could improve his grades and seen him become sought after by dozens of college football coaches.<br/><br/>The only major conflicts in the plot (there are minor conflicts, of course, but we are never really afraid of them) stem from the appearance of impropriety in that the Tuohys and Michael's tutor are all alumni of the University of Mississippi and they all are seen encouraging Michael to accept a football scholarship to ""Ole Miss"". As the investigator from the NCAA suggests, it looks as if the Tuohys did everything that they did for Michael just so that they could boost the football fortunes of their alma mater. In the movie, Michael, who has never considered this possibility until the investigator spells it out, suddenly considers it seriously, and runs away from Leigh Anne and goes back to the projects where he spent part of his childhood. There he nearly gets killed. I smell an injection of melodrama into a more placid real life story where the dramatic conflicts were more mundane if not absent. If the Tuohys are half as good in real life as they are made out to be in this movie, I suspect that Michael would never have believed for a second that they were that nice to him just so that they could exploit him. Human beings are capable of great deviousness, but nobody can sustain an uncrackable facade of faux affection toward someone they do not really love for two whole years, especially if that someone is a teenager.<br/><br/>As is often the case in these sorts of movies when they are done well, the pathos is judiciously mixed with gentle humor. I laughed, I cried, goes the cliché and here it was true. I actually enjoyed being manipulated by this movie, and that says a lot considering that it had so many strikes against it going in.<br/><br/>Disclaimor: One thing ""The Blind Side"" had in its favor from the get-go is that it stars Sandra Bullock whom I absolutely adore."

","I would not be surprised if ""The Blind Side"" and Sandra Bullock are nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress '09. It's a most unusual story of how some of us really do take their Christian faith and obligations seriously instead of how many false money-grabbing prophets and faith healers inundate us all. And needless to say those Christian Aryan White Supremacists as well. Come to think of it, this film must infuriate the latter to the supreme height of hatred and frustration. And it's a TRUE STORY TO BOOT.<br/><br/>Google Michael Oher and up will come info about his playing tackle for the Balt. Ravens. This year is his NFL Rookie season. Just another excellent prospect? Heck no, there's a beautiful story attached to the evolution of Mike. A story about a Memphis based Caucasian family headed by Sandra Bullock whose compassion is as limitless as the spaciousness of their mansion. Just the opposite of the stereotypical Southerm ""red necks.""<br/><br/>""Big Mike,"" a gigantic, lonely, uneducated African-American, is transformed, through love,understanding and compassion,into a literate gentle giant by a family with great affection for the University of Mississippi. In fact we ask ourselves why Mike was never that crazy about Ol' Miss being that he ""hangs"" with such loyal boosters. <br/><br/>Enough said. An amazing transformation occurs and that's it from this end. By the way, an amazing job of acting is done by the young son of Sandra and husband played by Tim McGraw. The kid's name is ""SJ"" played by Jae Head. A real up and comer."

","I spent an evening with my grandsons, age 9 and 11. Both of them play little league. This was a great movie to show them that you can overcome your environment. Michael could have taken the quick road to money like the majority of guys in his neighborhood but instead he took the high road. This was a great heart wrenching movie to believe that this was truly someone's life. The only downside I experienced was I felt the movie condensed too much and I would like to know what happened with his mother and siblings. My heart and my grandson's heart goes out to Michael and his new family. It is good to know that there are good Christian people in this world. Michael is blessed to have found them and they to have found him. The Touhy family saw passed color and just reached out to help."
"kylehodgdon","8","1","2","5 December 2009"," A Feel Good Film That Will Leave You Smiling
","I really liked this movie quite a bit. It is a very ""feel good"" film (almost too much so at times) with a main character who you will really root for. <br/><br/>I liked the initial set up for the film, using the play with Lawrence Taylor to set the stage. They then show a scene ""two years in the future"" of Michael being questioned by an investigator. At this point I was under the assumption that this story might lead up to Michael killing somebody through protection of his family or something; however, this scenario never plays out. Instead, he comes to be questioned for an entirely different reason. I like that it is not the tired murder scenario, that has been done to death. It was nice to see something different.<br/><br/>The characters are all very likable in this film. I am not normally much of a fan of Sandra Bullock, but I think she did quite well with this role. Quintin Aaron did great playing Michael, and it was always suspenseful to see how Michael would react to each situation. What would he do when offered to sleep on the couch the first night? Or how would he react to the family's thanksgiving traditions?<br/><br/>The ending was nice as well. I really liked how it synched up to actual footage of the Real Michael Oher at the NFL Draft. Up until this point I was not sure if this film was based on reality or not. <br/><br/>I think this is a really nice film to watch and would probably suggest it to anyone."

","Everybody feel bad for Michael Oher! He didn't have a home, he didn't have a bed to stay in, he wasn't being fed properly (although he sure looked like he was being fed more than enough), his teachers didn't think he was smart enough, he was left walking around in the cold etc... Overall he just wasn't good enough. But then! Sandra Bullock comes along and saves his life gives him food, bed space, and a roof above his head. Then she helps him with his education and guides him to join the football team. Then woah, all these colleges take interest in him and want Michael Oher to play football for his team, and as if this isn't enough the family that brought him in and claim him as their own helps get him a tutor so his grades will be good enough for a college football scholarship and entry into a school of his choice. <br/><br/>But! When questions and rumors start flowing about the whole football world, did Michael Oher choose the University of Mississippi? or was he tricked into being raised to go and play football and run off to a college that everybody else wants him to play for? Michael Oher doesn't like that rumor so he runs back off to his ghetto where he gets into a scuffle with some of his old friends. <br/><br/>This is where the movie went from bad to suck. Am I supposed to give a crap about some fat idiot that got a damn piggyback ride to money and education and then feel bad for him when he doubts his families intentions of raising him? I mean I have troubles of my own, this kid doesn't do crap for himself except be ginormous, if I were in the Tuohy family I would've said ""screw you Big Mike you don't trust me after all the stuff I've done for you? enjoy your life on the streets jerk off!"". This movie is insulting not only to the Touhy family but to the viewers. I should have known though, John Lee Hancock being the terrible director and writer that he is couldn't deliver even a decent movie worth watching.<br/><br/>Don't see this movie, unless you have a Sandra Bullock obsession."
"bg11731","7","11","76","15 November 2009"," Wonderful message but bad approach
","I managed to catch a preview of the so called inspirational football saga THE BLIND SIDE. Based on a true story, the message tells us, regardless of what horrible background you have in life, what sort of set-backs, you can push yourself to be a winner. This is nice, but what kills the film is the character Sandra Bullock plays. She is very self-righteous defiant (She is photographed too often with a sneer and arms crossed) soccer mom type. She comes across more like ""I need to show who is boss, who is tough..."" as opposed to ""Gee, I want to help this kid."" The slum-kid she is helping usually has a sad beaten-puppy expression -like the only way this guy can help himself is if a tough-love spitting python like Ms. Bullock comes along. The film-makers are clearly tiring to win over the soccer-mom crowd, which they may do and help this film gain a profit, but others may be turned off by Sandy's ""I'm a B---- because I can be."""
"JohnSeal","7","2","8","28 November 2009"," Which side is the blind one?
","I went into The Blind Side knowing little about the film, and less about its back story. Color me surprised to learn that the film depicts 'a remarkable true story', because until the final credit crawl I was convinced I was watching a skillfully made racial fantasy designed to assuage some serious liberal white guilt. In fact, until the crawl I was convinced the film had seriously overdone matters: who could possibly believe not only that an upper-class white family would take in an impoverished African-American youngster, pay his way through private school, and even buy him a truck? Misgivings aside, The Blind Side is an emotionally satisfying drama featuring a bravura performance by Sandra Bullock as Mama Tuohy and an excellent script by director John Lee Hancock. Quinton Aaron isn't much of an actor (though I should probably watch Be Kind Rewind again before jumping to conclusions), but he brings a degree of mystery to the character of Michael Oher that offers intrigue for the first half of the film--intrigue that isn't very satisfactorily resolved by an awkward sub-plot involving his birth mother. I still think The Blind Side was mostly made to make white people feel good and virtuous--perhaps I need to read Michael Lewis' book to convince myself otherwise--but that doesn't mean it isn't a good film. If the story is true, then the worst it's done is humanize rich Republicans--and if it isn't, it still appeals to the better nature in all of us. If we all acted on the kindness exemplified in The Blind Side, the world might just be a little bit better."

"alexwahl","10","1","3","12 October 2014"," Awesome movie
","The Blind Side is one of the most inspiring movies of all time. However, I feel like that that movie should have done better in the box office. Based on a true story, current NFL player Michael Ore has had a rough life since childhood before getting drafted by the Baltimore Ravens. He was taken by the state from his mother at a very young age and had nowhere to go until a family adopted him and got him to get a football scholarship to the University of Mississippi. They gave him everything he needed like a tutor for school, a truck, a place to live, even his own room that he never had anything like one before. This movie shows that even if you had a very rough childhood, you can still make the best out of life because of it. Even though the movie did do well by receiving over $255 million, it could have still done better, especially if it's based on a true story. The one star that really shines out in the movie is Sandra Bullock, who plays as the mother of the family that adopted Michael. Sandra Bullock has always done great movies, but I believe that ""The Blind Side"" is by far her greatest movie yet just because of how she acts like it was really happening in real life."
"samkoseoglu","4","1","3","20 August 2014"," Religious Agitation
","At first, this movie cannot ensure a solid element of comedy, even if it tries to amuse you, somehow, with its dramatic theme inside, biographically, it cannot. Sandra Bullock's stance as Leigh Anne seems so false, pretended, and ""studious"" which makes an actress, simply, a character, not a part of authenticity that audience expects. <br/><br/>The story telling a real struggle is presented as a fine family portrait, and due to that weak description it loses its dramatic sense. Although the movie is based on a real story, the points it makes are so conventional that I thought I was watching a Boys Town type narration, roughly fictional and maybe more like a part of The Visual Bible: Acts with its excessive lines. If, again, we are to analyze the movie, as a movie, not a part of real life story, we most likely ponder on the moral values that the movie covers. Leigh Anne helps a boy, and it is a favor appearing sincere and disinterested. Yet, with a deep thinking on her change after doing this favor, one can clearly observe a sense of selfishness and egoism. As a result of this help, Leigh Anne, obviously, feel happy for herself and as for his husband's, Sean Tuohy, observation it seems like a satisfaction out of helping someone. This issue, which is perhaps something to debate philosophically, annoyed me throughout the film. Other than technical and reasonable causes for helping someone, this abstruse cause of relieving yourself with someone else's deprivation bothered me most. This is again a religious drop that can be interpreted as doing something good for the prize that relieves a vassal, heaven. <br/><br/>Yet, with the help of Quinton Aaron's performance, movie completes its biographical theme and story. Mediocrity makes this movie's possibly extraordinary story, so banal, and naturally ordinary."

","This movie was excellent. It was magical when I saw it in the theaters and just as wonderful watching the DVD at home, three years later.<br/><br/>The balance of real facts and humor was great, I was laughing at one part and crying five minutes later.<br/><br/>I am a little confused at the reviewers calling the film racist...it is based on a very true story, who actually experienced most of the events in the movie. Yes, some of the situations are exaggerated, but I feel as though it makes the film easier to understand. If the racism was any more subtle, it may seem less important, which is not true. I read the book; liked the movie better, but still great.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie yet, I suggest you run out to the store right now. A must-see! Go, go, go!"
"qormi","7","1","3","18 June 2011"," A Feel-Good Movie, but it's a True Story
","This film had its moments. The actor who portrayed Big Mike did a great subtle job of portraying a young man who was in the process of being rescued from a nightmare life. Sandra Bullock portrayed a real-life person who just happened to be bigger than life. I don't think the movie was all that realistic and I don't think all the issues were explored in depth.It was definitely sugar coated and could have benefited from some realistic dialogue and better screen writing. I don't think Sandra Bullock deserved Best Actress. She didn't seem to add any depth or emotion to her character. SJ was played by a cute kid, but he needed to act more like a kid. The daughter and the husband were complete cyphers; walking scenery.The scene where Michael is tormented by gang members while sitting in their apartment in the projects was played out very well. It was very realistic when Michael snapped. Very good acting. All in all, I would recommend this movie. Good entertainment. The true story is quite remarkable and the tragedy turns former high school athletes into dead thugs was also addressed."

"plutus1947","10","1","3","13 September 2010"," Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction
","Sandra Bullock is a very rare kind of lady. I hope she will forgive me for saying this but when she first hit our screens I could not see her as beautiful, although pretty. However from the first time she stepped in front of a camera I knew she was an actress of undoubted talent Now as she is getting older (but still a young woman of course) she is and indeed has transformed into a beautiful woman.<br/><br/>One thing she has a knack for is picking the right movie to appear in and every movie she has made has been at the very least excellent. The possible exception to this is Miss Congeniality 2.<br/><br/>I have given a synopsis of the movie below so if you don't want to read it simply skip over it.<br/><br/>The Blind Side is one of those movies which I feel is flawless in both the dialogue, directing and of course the acting.<br/><br/>Michael Oher is played by Quinton Aaron, a relative newcomer to the silver screen and in his first starring role. Although he played his part to perfection and I feel choosing him for this role was inspired by the Director John Lee Hancock I am wondering if he is likely to become typecast due to his size and will end up playing bully boy roles. I really do hope not as the way he portrayed Michael Oher tells me he deserves a lot more than that.<br/><br/>He was nominated for four awards for his acting in The Blind Side and I am surprised he did not win even one. Morgan Freeman beat him for two of the awards for his role as Nelson Mandela in Invictus. If Aaron is up there with the mighties like Freeman it shows that he is an actor of enormous potential.<br/><br/>14 year old Jae Head played the role of SJ Tuohy and the many scenes he played with Aaron were marvellously played and I certainly got the impression that both Arron and Jae developed an affinity with each other. Jae won a PFCS Award for Best Performance by a Male Youth and was nominated for Best Young Actor by Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards. He certainly deserved this.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock played her part of Leigh Anne Tuohy as usual to perfection and I feel she portrayed her role as a combination of Mother Teresa and Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg, Sister Habit). As wonderful and caring as Leigh Anne was she certainly knew how to take care of herself and did not suffer fools at all. Poor Coach Burt Cotton, played by Ray McKinnon found that out.<br/><br/>Did you know that Sandra turned the part of Leigh Anne down three times because she was concerned about playing the part of a devout Christian? Sandra won several awards for her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy including her first Oscar and a Golden Globe Award. There has been quite a few excellent contenders for Oscar's this year and for her to scoop this for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role is praise indeed. Sandra has been nominated for 37 awards and won 36 of them which is a record many actors will be extremely envious of.<br/><br/>There is not a lot we can say about Kathy Bates who portrayed Missy Sue (Michael's tutor) except that when she appears on the screen you know she is going to give an excellent performance, as she always does, and she did not disappoint us this time.<br/><br/>I feel that every aspect of this fact based movie, the script, direction and acting was superb. Although Aaron and Sandra were the stars each and every other actor played their parts admirably and it was coup being able to get all of them together to make a very memorable and touching movie.<br/><br/>My advice is either get it out on DVD rental or get to the cinema and watch this movie. You won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>SPOILER BEGINS: The Blind Side is the fact based story of Michael Oher, a black young man, who in his young life had been shunted from pillar to post. Although he was a giant of a lad he was and I am sure still is as gentle as a lamb.<br/><br/>Michael was eventually taken in by a white family from Tennessee where he was nurtured and loved by the whole family.<br/><br/>Although he was an extremely intelligent adolescent he found it difficult communicating with anyone and learning.<br/><br/>With the love and help of both Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), the wife of the family and her son SJ. Tuohy (Jae Head) Michael gained in confidence and managed to get high enough grades to play in his college football team.<br/><br/>It took him a while to 'fit' into the team but once he had he took his team to the championship title where he was seen by several high ranking universities including Mississippi. These universities wanted him because of his immense talent on the football field.<br/><br/>Because his grades were not good enough he could not join any of these universities, so Leigh Anne engaged a private tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) in the hope that she could get him up to the required grades.<br/><br/>All those who have heard of Michael Oher will know that the rest is history.<br/><br/>SPOILER ENDS:"
"lasttimeisaw","8","1","3","14 August 2010"," The Blind Side
","This is surely a feel-good film which tries its best to tell the story of a wealthy white couple adopt a black teenager who has talent in football, in a drama-free and encouraging way. Surely enjoy the whole process of watching this film, but if one has time to reflect his mind, what's under its superficial surface is that the film proposes an important question, how to balance the pity and conscience. <br/><br/>As nowadays ""selfless"" good deeds are covered with some opaque disguises which makes people question the original intention, and I do believe every single action and word all has its own intention, ever subconsciously to the person himself. So Lynn selflessly takes care of Michael, behind which hides her own intention like Sean (her husband) mentions in the film because it gives you satisfaction. Sometimes maybe the answer is that simple, which I admire a lot from this film. <br/><br/>The film is based a true story and considered a mainstream film aiming to all different levels of audiences and it succeeded it box office as a sleeper hit last year (earned more than 200 millions dollars domestically alone) and even nominated for 2 Oscars including BEST PICTURE and won the BEST ACTRESS award for Sandra Bullock. (One year before, who could imagine Sandra won an Oscar?), it truly shows that Jennifer Aniston, Cameron Diaz or even Demi Moore and Meg Ryan will have their chances in the future! <br/><br/>I will talk a little bit more about Sandra's Oscar winning for her role in this film. It is very tricky because some say it is a brave decision and others say it is a shame even worse than Gwyneth's winning in 1999. <br/><br/>Five nominees, Sandra, Meryl Streep (Julie & Julia), Helen Mirren (The Last Station), Gabourey Sidibe (Precious) and Carey Mulligan (An Education). I haven't watch ""The Last Station"", but just several years after ""The Queen"", Helen needs to be more patient to gain her second Oscar, so this nomination actually is more suitable to be considered as a warm-up for this year (who has 3 Oscar-baiting films at hand). <br/><br/>Gabourey and Carey are both wonderful in their roles but as both are new-comers, their votes is definitely split which makes them difficult to win. So my original prediction was going to favor Meryl, who totally would deserve her third win. But generally speaking I didn't have too much confidence in Julie & Julia, firstly Meryl don't own much screen time (she is the co- leader with Amy Adams) and I think there is a thin-line of difference between acting and imitation. I did fear that the only surprising nominee could beat Meryl was Sandra, which actually happened. <br/><br/>So, let's take a look at her performance here, Sandra is the sole focus of this film, I think the director even sacrifices the deeper depictions of Michael (who should have been the obvious main character of the story). Actually Sandra's role is a little bit plain but she manages to carry the whole film and creates an unexpected chemistry with her comedically deadpan acting which surprisingly saves the film's tame storyline, and makes the film much more watchable and enjoyable. Thus in all respects, chooses Sandra is a more reasonable choice as Oscar still a local film awards anyway and most Americans love Sandra Bullock.<br/><br/>http://xingshizuomeng.blogspot.com/"
"tburke85","9","1","3","26 May 2010"," The Blind Side An Excellent Drama Based On A True Story
","The Blind Side is an excellent drama based on a true story with exceptional performances by the cast. This film is about Michael Oher a homeless teenager who went on to become a first round NFL draft pick of the Baltimore Ravens for left tackle in 2009. Writer/Director John Lee Hancock is admirable in bringing Michael's true story to the big screen that was much better than expected and it left me feeling entertained from beginning to end. It has a compelling coming of age story with a nice balance between drama and humor. Sandra Bullock turns in one of her best performances as Leigh Ann Tuohy and I for one believe she deserved the Oscar she won for the role. She's proved in every movie despite it's flaws her talent as an actress and this one is no different. Bullock plays Leigh Ann who through an act of kindness takes in a homeless teenage African-American, named Michael ""Big Mike"" Oher played effectively by Quinton Aaron. I haven't seen him anything before but I thought Aaron was equally impressive as Michael a poor teenager looking for something he's never had before; a family. Bullock, Aaron, and the rest of the cast had nice chemistry with each other on screen making their growing friendships believable. Tim McGraw turned in a solid performance as Leigh's husband Sean who becomes a surrogate father to Michael. I haven't seen McGraw in too many movies either but he still gives a good performance none the less. The rest of the cast including Lily Collins as Leigh's daughter Collins, Ray McKinnon, and Kim Dickens are effective as the supporting characters. Jae Head as Leighs son S.J. was the stand out who like the rest of his family forms an unbreakable bond with Michael. Jae Head impressed me with his performance whether it was acting like a drill sergeant while training Michael or demanding full access to him while he's in college. He provides the film with some great comic relief and his dialog delivery makes it that much funnier. He also had genuine chemistry with Aaron (Bullock, McGraw, and Collins) in their scenes together. Well done. Kathy Bates shows up in a small role as Mike's tutor Miss Sue and she does what her brief part requires. I heard this film was good but it surpassed by expectations. Besides some characters who aren't really developed (Bates) and a few predictable moments. Overall the good more than outweighed the bad because I enjoyed The Blind Side. I became invested in the main characters and the story which made the 128 minutes running time move at a steady pace. The moments of humor are executed perfectly mostly from Jae Head's great comic timing. I'll admit I wasn't expecting much but after watching this I can see why many people including critics liked it. If you're in the mood for an inspirational true to life story with drama, humor, and solid performances by the cast (Sandra Bullock, Quinton Aaron, and especially Jae Head), you can't go wrong with the Blind Side. It has everything you could ever want and expect from one of this films. Give the Blind Side a chance. It was much better than anticipated."

In few words, i liked the film but it's not as great as it seems. Although Sandra performs it correctly (rather than excellent), its storyline is weak, tending to make the viewer feel thrilled for a story that lacks of emotional situations and it only attempts to develop unstructured lines among its characters. There's no need to say that you'd better read the previews before watching it <br/><br/>Nevertheless, if you stay in home, and it's raining and you have nothing to watch on TV, ""the blind side"" it's a great choice."

Making a biopic on the early years of an icon is a great idea. Plus, the relationship between the Mother & her Newly-Born Child is beautiful. On the flip-side, 'The Blind Side' runs of a slow-pace, it hardly has a lively moment.<br/><br/>I can't just write a sentence & insult Sandra Bullock's performance.

In this movie, Big Mike was taken from his mother at a very young age due to her drug addiction, forcing him to live his life on his own. In the very beginning it shows his uncle trying to get him into a top line school, called ""Windgate."" He gets accepted but has nowhere to live or go, and his education level is very low. One night after the Tuohey family is leaving a school event they see Michael walking in the cold, pouring rain with only a tee-shirt and shorts on. They stop and offer him a place to stay. The Tuohey family is a very wealthy family that lives in the nice part of town. They drive nice cars and have a lot of money, and they step out of their own routine just to help Michael to a better life. After some time, the Tuohey family and Big Mike become very close with each other. They take care of him, and see that he is a nice young boy who just needs a family. As Michael is staying in the Tuohey household he begins to become part of the family. After they adopt him they give him his first bed and brand new clothes. Throughout the movie they teach him manners, the importance of life, what it's like to have a family and to be loved. SJ, Mikes best friend, and new little brother, who is played by Jae Head is the comedian in the movie. This little guy keeps you laughing and makes you want to have someone like SJ apart of your family. SJ and Leigh Ann teach Big Mike how to play football. At first he lacked experience on the field, not using his talent to the best of his ability. One day at practice Leigh Ann tells him the football team is like their family and you must protect them. From that moment on he is unstoppable. Michael learns a good lesson about never letting his family get hurt and he sticks to that for the rest of his life. Michael ends up getting football scholarship offers from many schools across the country and he earns grades that make him eligible for college. His school of choice is Ole Miss (Mississippi) which is also the Tuohey family's favorite school. Both Leigh Ann and Sean Tuohey attended Ole Miss and are a huge part of the booster club. If it wasn't for Sandra's ability to convey a strong sense of leadership, courage, and strength, the movie would not have been as successful. She plays a lead role that truly touches your heart. She plays a great part with being a hard working determined mother to raise her kids to grow up the right way, and she goes out of her way to help someone less fortunate. After watching Blindside, the story of Michael Oher will never be forgotten. Blindside is a must see hit film that you and your whole family will enjoy. Its dramatic elements and frequent moments of comedy make this a movie that you will always remember. This film is a powerful inspiration to us all. It makes us want to get out there and help by showing us the power of love, family, and kindness."

","The Blind Side - one of the best movies of this year. I can't say that it is good, because it is amazing. I really enjoyed every minute of this film. If you like American football, you have to see this movie. If you like Drama movies, you also have to see this one. If you like Sport Drama, than this one is for you. If you like Sandra Bullock, than you definitely have to watch this film. If you want to see great movie, just watch ""The Blind Side"". The history of a boy from not very good family, with difficult childhood, and with such a great changes in his life, couldn't have been filmed better. Great performance by actors, great work by director and all the people who worked at this movie. The fact that this movie is based on True Events makes it even more interesting. I don't want to use the words ""best"", ""great"" in this review any more. I just want to thank everyone, who worked at this picture. Moreover I would like to say thanks to Michale Lewis, the author of the book. And I just want to say thanks to Michael Oher and Tuohy family. I was really touched and I'm sure that all of you will also like this film."

I've never been much of a Sandra Bullock fan, but she deserves to win every acting award one can get, and I'm sure she'll get a lot for this performance! I've now seen it three times, and will probably see it a few more before the DVD comes out, which we will surely buy! Most amazing of all, this is based on a true story! WOW!!!

","After a long gap we get to have a nice film like this. The Blind Side is recommended for any one who is looking for family oriented, feel good and inspiring stuff. The story and the presentation were so good that one can even hope that movie should never end.<br/><br/>The story is about a troubled and bit enlarged teen called Big Mike and his savior Sandra Bullock. Sandra Bullock has gave performance for her lifetime. I even liked her other two movies this year,i.e., All About Steve and The Proposal. She has been presented as caring mother, great wife, beautiful lady and genuine human being. Kathy Bates as Miss Sue was really fun to watch especially her teaching skills.<br/><br/>I liked the ending in which Sandra Bullock said that very few are lucky as Michael... followed by newspaper report of killing of an African American teen. We can imagine what the life of troubled killed teen could have been if he had been picked by a benevolent kind of person like Mrs. Tuohy.<br/><br/>Repeat watch is guaranteed and watch along with family and friends."

","I think i might have had preconceptions when thinking about wanting to watch this movie or not. The trailer was good and so it did its job of enticing me straight in to watch this film. I notice a lot these days that there aren't any true story type movies in circulation any more, i guess its a dying breed and quite a rarity with not many people wanting to take a chance on such a story.<br/><br/>I bet that anyone who would have read this script would have jumped at the chance to work on this film (me included). I thought that the casting of Sandra Bullock was an odd one at first judging by her acting roles in the past (Miss Congeniality, Speed, etc etc) but then again this was another one of my misconceptions coming back to haunt me. I decided to take a chance on this one and boy I'm thankful for it. Bullock executed her role down to a tee, i think what grabbed me most about her performance is how convincing she can be in her roles especially in The Blind Side. Its quite a difficult thing to do but i feel like she conveys so much more through her eyes, it sounds odd but i think when Bullock is in front of the camera, she can act with such emotion that it can bring so much more to the story and i think that its quite a gift to be able to do that, Im not sure if many other actresses could be so believable, sure there will be some but i think Sandra nailed it! <br/><br/>We shouldn't also forget about Quinton Aaron, for such a 'newcomer' i think he stepped up to the plate and gave a very memorable performance and also executed ' his role perfectly and i hope he gets more great scripts like The Blind Side because he could be one to watch. The classic story line where the struggling kid on the wrong side of town ends up getting in school with a little bit of extra help has been seen before (Coach Carter, 2005) and previous to that, with this plot though, i feel as though there is more to it, obviously the fact that a black man being accepted into a white Christian home where racism is still prevalent in society is another interesting take on this 'classic' plot. I'm some-what glad that i saw this film because it does remind us that we are in uncertain times but it just goes to show that with a lot of hope, faith and courage that it seems nothing is impossible. <br/><br/>Thank you for this movie, it made my day!"

","The best stories in life (and film) have simple plots and complicated, inspiring and intriguing characters.<br/><br/>I want to see the film again and here are two of my reasons:<br/><br/>Reason #1: I Don't Like Football<br/><br/>I've never understood the strategy, except ""throw the ball and catch it, or try to stomp on any one on the opposing team."" I admit that's a shallow understanding of the sport, but that's where I was, before I watched ""The Blind Side"" last night.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock plays the mother, Leigh Anne. The film opens with her giving a play-by-play color commentary of a real football game, focusing on the role of one of the defensive linemen, the left tackle. I just might watch a football game this weekend. Even if I don't, this new awareness of how football works, or at least, how a part of it works, inspires me to see parallels in other parts of my life.<br/><br/>Reason #2: Sandra Bullock's character was a b - - - - h, and I mean that in the nicest possible way.<br/><br/>b - - - - h: The female of the canine kind, from Anglo Saxon, ""bicce"" (1949 Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary). By the 15th century the word was used to describe a bad woman. Why? It is helpful to look at how dog breeders and trainers regard the word, ""b - - - - h"" (""Male Dogs vs. Female Dogs: A Guide to Dog Behavior"", by Mary Stasiewicz, http://www.howtodothings.com/pets-and-animals/a4104-how-to-choose- between-male-and-female-dogs.html). <br/><br/>""b - - - - hes tend to want to be in control of the entire situation. They may come to their owner when they are seeking affection but will often move away when they have had enough.""<br/><br/>The mother, Leigh Anne, is an interior designer, shown in the beginning of the film on the phone, dictating requirements of a project to a supplier. She sounds firm, knowledgeable and in control. She makes decisions quickly, she sees the big picture, and she's obsessive about quality and appearance, in life and home. Leigh Anne's first response, in almost all situations, seems to be one of taking control and solving the problem by moving and shaking.<br/><br/>""In many packs, a b - - - - h is typically the Alpha dog. Female dogs crave more control of situations and are quick to respond to perceived challenges with fierceness.""<br/><br/>Leigh Anne packs heat. She never pulls her gun out of her purse, but her strong words and ""in your face"" confrontation with bad-side-of-town tough guys who threaten her son leave no doubt: She's going to do whatever it takes to protect her own.<br/><br/>""Female dogs mark in the same way male dogs do. A spayed female may continue to mark for her entire lifetime regardless of when she is spayed while most males will cease marking behaviors shortly after they are neutered and the testosterone levels subside.""<br/><br/>Leigh Anne's home is visually stunning, with beautiful furniture and art placed intimately and comfortably. She has a place, a room, for every purpose, designed and furnished for that purpose. From landscaping to the laundry room, and from great room to guest room, Leigh Anne's aesthetic marking behaviors are clearly seen.<br/><br/>""B - - - - hes are generally less affectionate and friendly than male dogs. This characteristic is noticeable in puppies and becomes more pronounced with age.""<br/><br/>This is an interesting generalization. Discussing it with my wife, we couldn't definitely agree that this was true of Leigh Anne, or of women in general. The film offers a good representation of the complexity of human emotion and ambition. There were definitely instances when Leigh Anne demonstrated a business-like approach to solving family problems. However, she also showed a compassionate side, a weaker, softer, needy and caring side.<br/><br/>""It is also important to note that if you do not spay your b - - - - h, she will come into heat at approximately one year of age and approximately every six months thereafter. During this time, there will be some bleeding as well as a change in mood or behavior. Keep this in mind when you adopt a puppy and make the decision of whether or not to spay her.""<br/><br/>I laughed when I considered comparing this characteristic of female dogs to women. The classic descriptor of a women enduring her monthly cycle of menstruation, or the hot flashes and moodiness of menopause, is the rough, vulgar term, ""b - - - - hiness"". Cute bumper stickers and T-shirt slogans testify to the reputation that hormonal changes in females is cause for extreme wariness for all that may consider interacting with them.<br/><br/>The film included no scenes that implied that hormones were involved in any of Leigh Anne's actions. But with a pistol in her purse, I would indeed tread softly if I were anywhere near her when she feels her pups were in danger!<br/><br/>Go see this film.<br/><br/>It will give you an itch to watch a football game this weekend. It will make you want to redecorate your living room. It may even inspire you to reach out in love to someone completely different from you, just for the joy of it!"

There were a lot of hilarious moments, heart-breaking moments, and heart-warming moments throughout. A homeless 18 year old named Michael 'Big Mike' Oher is a quiet and peaceful person. He keeps to himself. He is under-educated because of his past. Leigh Anne Tuohy sees Michael and offers him a room in her house. He soon becomes apart of the family, because they adopt him. The Tuohy family help him become involved in football. Other coaches from universities see what he can do, and offer him a Scholarship. Which college will Michael pick.

","The characters were pretty two-dimensional, and were for the most part as transparent as glass. That is to say, you'll feel no sense of intrigue when introduced to the characters because you'll know exactly who they are and what their place is in the film as soon as they first appear. This is with exception to 'Michael' who was really the 'main' character of the film. Nonetheless, I felt this movie was more about everyone else being nice to him rather than being about him and the turmoil he had face being a young African-American coming from an impoverished background. Therefore you'll find that the one character you want to know more about remains some what of a mystery for the extent of the movie.<br/><br/>The one character that stands out in this film is 'leigh Anne tuohy', played by Sandra Bullock. This character was 'The Blind Sides' biggest down side. She came across as being arrogant and self-righteous for the duration of the film. And although the character was supposed to be a heroine, it seemed to me the only reason she was doing the things she did was so she could feel smug and good about herself.<br/><br/>Although the story itself was quite 'nice' and had some sentiment behind it, I found it very tedious to watch. There was no conflict of any kind in this movie and the plot was so predictable I felt like I knew what was going to happen before even the writers did.<br/><br/>I understand that some people enjoy 'feel-good' movies, and on occasions, so do I. But this movie takes the genre to a whole new level- to the extent where you're just praying for something bad to happen to one of the characters just to add a bit of depth to the movie.<br/><br/>If I were going to sum up the plot of this movie in one sentence it would be; things start off OK, they get better, everyone's happy, things get even better, every feels great, the end. If I were going to sum it up in one word it would be 'cheese'.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a low brow, feel good movie that isn't going to make you think than this is the movies for you. If you want to sit down for an hour and fifty minutes and watch something that's going to make you feel so good about life that you're probably gunna want to puke afterwards then watch this film.<br/><br/>The only reason I've given this movie a half decent rating is because I can see the merits of it, despite the fact I found it quite boring to watch. The dialogue, for the most part, is pretty good and the direction was brilliant. I just felt that it was poor story telling, for the reason that there was no real story- at least not one worthy of being made into a movie."

"bob the moo","Null","1","4","25 March 2010"," A TVM with a Hollywood cast – solid but nothing more than that
","Sandra Bullock's Oscar was perhaps a given but the award gave this film a bump for those who have not already seen it – which is all of us in the UK as the film only came out recently. Watching it though it is hard to shake the feeling that in about 10 years (once the terrestrial premier etc has died down) this will find its rightful home on daytime television surrounded by other overly sentimental ""true-story"" movies. If you take the couple of Hollywood faces out of this film then there is very little else to it that you wouldn't get there.<br/><br/>This is not to take away from the basic story which is engaging and quite touching when you go through it, but rather the way it is done. The material is delivered without any insight or depth and what this results in is a rather schmaltzy film that has regular musical cues to let you know how to feel and never really gets to the heart of any of the characters. In doing this it is still an OK film and the actual story is warming and solid enough to do the job – albeit even those who don't know the outcome will have that spoilt for them by the film opening with the assumption that everyone already knows who Michael Oher is. It wonders along with lots of touching moments, sad looks, cute kids and lots of ""overcoming"" but it doesn't manage to lift itself above the clichés in any way other than how professionally made it all is.<br/><br/>Bullock doesn't deserve her Oscar for this but who could begrudge her since she is as charming as she is profitable. She does have good moments and she does get the mix of tough exterior and inner emotions but she doesn't do more than that and it is hardly a brilliant performance. Aaron is suitably large and quiet and, from the archive footage at the end, certainly seems to capture the manner of the real person, even if there is always a sense of ""air brushing"" about his performance. Head is irritating as one would expect while McGraw and Collins are so-so. Bates adds another famous face to the mix but nobody really does more than the basics.<br/><br/>It is not that The Blind Side is a bad film because I did actually quite like it in an obvious sort of way; it is more that the film itself is sentimental and clichéd without anything in the way of genuine grit or character to get into. The performances are solid and Bullock does her stock no end of good with an engaging ""professional conservative Mom"" turn that has sold well in the areas you would expect, but nobody can do a great deal with this material."

","The Blind Side was a great movie. I love how the story plot leads into the feelings of the characters. All I want to know is how did Mike leave the one guy who got him into the school? The movie never explains that for the viewers. They also didn't mention he was good in basketball. How many times do you see some big teenager walking around homeless? The movie is giving us a message that we need to have hospitality. Without that we are not caring. If you don't care for others you don't care for yourself. The family helps Mike academically and physically. SJ is a very funny child who loves attention. Would you put your life in danger for someone you love ? Mike was so good in football that he made it to the All-American team. Then he was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens."

Your answer would probably be ""Malcolm X? Martin Luther King?"" I'd answer ""is that all you got?""<br/><br/>Other than that it has a sentimental feel but, I cannot bypass the subliminal racism teasing in this movie. The acting and the story in general is fine. The development is fine too."

","Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) lives in the ghetto and has never known his father and has been living with his mother who is a drug addict. Michael is poorly educated and he finds himself at rock bottom until one day when wealthy family the Tuohys take Michael in and help him turn his life around and help him achieve his ultimate ambition and become an all American football player...<br/><br/>Whilst there's no denying that the story behind Michael Oher's journey is inspiring and the Tuohy's assistance in helping achieve his goal is honourable it's actually the way everything is presented here which I took issue with...<br/><br/>For a start I found a lot of things happened very conveniently; Michael agreeing to stay with the rich white family without much in the way of resistance. The family (more particularly the kids) being so readily accepting of someone so different to themselves without so much as batting an eyelid. I agree that this is the way someone from a different social background should be accepted, but given the fact that Michael was one of the only 'black' kids in the school it seemed very strange how 'nice' everyone was with Michael at the start given how practically everyone else showed prejudice towards him.<br/><br/>The convenience and simplistic nature of the narrative doesn't end there either though; once Michael starts his home-tutoring and starts to train as an American football player I just found that everything came together far too easily meaning that I never once felt that I was watching an individual actually progressing. This caused a problem for me as I really wanted to feel a sense of struggle for Michael; I'm aware that the Blind Side is based on a true story and has been adapted from a book so I'm not sure how accurate a reflection this is of Michael's journey, but I really struggled with how simplistically this film was presented as whole. For me I found the film slightly lacking from an emotional perspective which unfortunately meant that I couldn't enjoy the film as much as I'd have hoped.<br/><br/>The acting is OK with Quintin Aaron being quite good in some scenes, but unfortunately most of what is asked of him is surly silences and long stares. Sandra Bullock is good and gives a fairly passionate performance and did a good job in making me believe that she genuinely cared. Tim McGraw is not given much to do and Lily Collins felt more like window-dressing (she's very pretty though which was a plus at least). As the son Joe Head was the 'fun' character and his scenes where he effectively becomes Michael's broker when Michael starts to get 'head-hunted' were amusing.<br/><br/>The Blind Side is watchable in the sense that it moves along without ever really being boring, but at the same time I just didn't find it to be a particularly emotionally involving film due to the convenient and simplistic way that the whole film was presented which meant that it didn't quite resonate with me in the same way that other sports drama films have done."

I am well aware of the fact that some think of it as a ""Hollywood sap"", but what else do you expect? It was marketed to be a Hollywood movie, and that is just what it is. You can't watch a horror movie and then complain that it was not as funny as a comedy, because they're completely different genres. Without Hollywood appeal the movie would not have received half the attention it got. In fact, without Hollywood appeal, great Hollywood movies would not be great Hollywood movies.

","This movie was amazing. Leigh Ann was everything a mother should be and more. She took in Michael as her own and showed him unconditional love. The lighting of the film depicted the events happening in the film. In scenes such as when Leigh Ann was visiting Michaels mother, their was low-key lighting but when Michael received the news that he was becoming a Tuohy, their was a lot of high key lighting. This movie gave us what we needed to make the connections at the right time. John Lee Hancock didn't give us so much that we were overwhelmed after the film. I give this film a five stars."

","The movie ""The Blind Side"" is based on a true story and is about a homeless boy named Michael Oher who gets adopted by Leigh Anne (played by Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy (played by Tim McGraw). After some time, the Tuohy's eventually become Michael's legal guardians and he attends the same school as their son, S.J., and daughter Collins (played by Lily Collins). Michael begins to play football and realizes the talent he has. I believe there are many different themes within this film, but I think generosity is the main theme. A family took in a young boy who was struggling that they knew nothing of or about and gave him a home, clothes, and helped further his education and eventually football career. The Tuohy's changed his life for the better. I think another theme would be to not let the bad things that have happened affect who you are and to keep striving. Michael was put into many unfortunate situations but remained a good person after all of it and tried hard in school and football to better his life, and he did.<br/><br/>To further elaborate on my idea of the themes, Michael was abandoned and homeless and for someone that is going through these things at such a young age to keep a good character is amazing. For the family to help a kid and give him so much when they didn't have to is also a wonderful thing. I think the acting between Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron who plays Michael was really fantastic. You could see the connection between them grow as he becomes apart of the family and when she eventually becomes his mom. The first time I saw this movie I teared up at how sweet and genuine their connection was; the acting was great from everyone involved. I think another film that has a similar theme of generosity or given opportunity would be The Pursuit of Happyness.<br/><br/>The lighting throughout the movie is fairly light and balanced because it's a story about a boy's life getting better with a happy ending. The only scenes where the lighting is dimmer would be when it shows flashbacks of Michael's life before the Tuohy's. Motif also plays into this story. At the beginning of the movie it shows Michael speaking with a social worker which is actually a scene that they show later on in the movie but expand on it and show what they are really talking about. Overall, I really like the theme of this movie and I thought it was very heartwarming and sincere"

","In the movie ""The Blind Side"", Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron, is a homeless kid that grew up in a bad family with no one to take care of him or put clothes on his back. SJ Tuohy played by Jae Head, notices Michael walking to school every day in the pouring rain and sees he's wearing the same clothes every day as well. When SJ spots him walking again in the rain, he tells his mom Leigh, played by Sandra Bullock, that his name is big Mike and she picked him up in the rain due to her sympathy. As Leigh is asking many questions about Michael, she finds out he really doesn't have anything and is homeless and she offers him to stay at their place for a little while. As he stays there for a few days, Leigh wanted him to play football for how big he is and the whole family loves football. Michael soon makes the team and becomes noticed by many college recruits because of his size. As he gets many school scholarships, he has trouble with grades in school and might not be able to get scholarships from the schools. Leigh and Sean, played by Tim McGraw, hire a tutor for Michael to help him get his grades up for the college schools. When committing to Ole Miss for football, him and his family come across some troubles about Leigh and her family influencing him to go to Ole Miss because that was their favorite school. As they got through their troubles, they turned Michael into a good kid and a good football player.
""The Blind Side"" is a great movie that shows someone that had nothing, and he turned his life around and made it to the NFL. The theme for this movie is someone that had nothing worked for something. Michael Oher in the movie had no family around him until Leigh and Sean came along and brought him in. They gave him the opportunity to be someone and he put his time and effort into becoming who he is today. There were some elements that made this film look its best in certain scenes. When Michael was choosing which college hat to put on, the lighting of the camera was on him that showed the moment of his life on where he was going to go next. Another element used is when Michael runs into his old friend that he used to know as a kid and he hugs him in the restaurant and at that angle, you can see Leigh, Sean, and SJ in the background looking at Michael and saw how happy he was to see someone he knew. This true story is great to be shared and watched and understand what some people go through to become what they are, and it can be used in real life examples. Another movie like this theme is ""Pursuit of Happyness"" which had the same idea of someone homeless and poor putting their effort into their work and having it pay off for them in the best way. Just like a lot of movies that portray this theme, they are always great stories to watch and watch the great outcomes that come out of movies with this theme."

"ElMaruecan82","8","0","2","22 December 2017"," The Blind Side is how Political Correctness can blind one's judgment...
","Wow, can you imagine the nerve of John lee Hancock! How dare he portrays a family of good Christians, of wealthy people without any problems and expressing a strange and mutual feeling called love! Can you believe there's also a big African-American kid from an impoverished neighborhood, abandoned by a drug-addicted mother... only to be saved by the knights in white shining armor! And don't get me started on the sappy, schmaltzy, happy ending where they're all celebrating his entry In National Football League.
Well, it's all based on a true story! But still, to pile up so many insults to political correctness and combine them into one movie!!! Now, I'll stop the rant. In case you hadn't noticed, I was being sarcastic. Now, let's be serious and consider what ""The Blind Side"" is truly about.<br/><br/>There are two ways to look at the sports biopic: a succession of clichés serving the images of good white savior, and giving a subtle unnoticeable flavor to the infamous ""Uncle Tom"" (some even felt Magical White Negro vibes in the performance of Quinton Arron as Michael Oher) OR you can just enjoy it as a touching movie praising values like love and family, and showing that sometimes, it's not about the ethnic background but the level of violence you've been raised within and that inevitably condition your chances of a successful life. In other words, the rich socialite Leigh Anne Tuohydidn't adopt Mike because he was black, but because he was cold, hungry and in clear need for help. His ethnic race had no more relevance than his size.<br/><br/>Speaking of his size, many viewers have criticized the prospect of making him play football, but this isn't an aspect where the Tuohy family had a role to play. The football premise is set-up when one of his friend's father introduces him to the football coach of Wingate Christian school Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon), the coach is impressed by his size but ""Big Mike"" can't enter the team without good semesters' grades. It's during his struggle to find a way with studies that his life path leads to an encounter with Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock). She didn't use him to satisfy some football- related ambitions but let's just be fair and accept that the guy was also born to play football, if not for his size, but for his wonderful protective instinct. Not to mention that he found something to do with his life and that brought joy to thousands of fans.<br/><br/>So give the film a break, it's just about the way loving and caring determine one's path. Take two singers with equal talents, Celine Dion and Whitney Houston, look at the two men of their lives and how each singer ended, it has nothing to do with race, Houston might have had more talent than Dion but her life partner was trash and look how it ended up affecting her, Dion could count on the indivisible love of her husband René.That's all. The whole ""Blind Side"" story revolves around the importance of family and love as drivers, even religion is as secondary as race, it is cleverly used as the ""marketing"" asset behind Mike's recruiting but the film doesn't try to make 'market' it. <br/><br/>I'm not surprised by the critics though but they should really pass over people's heads. Quinton Aaron was also criticized but he stroke me more as someone with a capability to listen and whose first reaction after a gesture of love was to be surprised by it because he's not used to. But he doesn't refuse a gesture of love, he smiles and nods. Many times, I expect the film to play the cynical card or inject some conflict but I loved how smoothly it went, how everyone in that family respected and loved Mike, even Lily Collins didn't play the awkward or jealous teenager but was rather sweet and open-minded. Well, little SJ (Jea Head) got on my nerves a few times, but I loved how he negotiated with all the football coaches, the kid meant business! And finally, there's Sandra Bullock in her Oscar-winning role.<br/><br/>What I liked about her performance is the way she never overplays it, it could almost pass as a one-note performance until you get the idea that this is woman who must maintain a facade of cold formality and yet finds the proper way to communicate her feelings toward a kid with a totally opposite background, but that's her power, she knows exactly what language to speak and put some people in their place, she's really one cool mom.It's a good comedic role and very entertaining, which makes the more dramatic moments powerfully resonant.<br/><br/>There comes a point where the film questions the motives of Leigh Anna and allows Mike to have a rebellious moment, but if you know the real history, you won't be surprised that it's a feel-good movie, which is quite rare from movies that are not comedies. It's a good old traditional family picture that can be enjoyed on a second watching and a third, it it somewhat superficial but not in a bad away, the film doesn't just try to be some grandstanding hymn to tolerance but keeps it simple and straight and humorous.<br/><br/>The film was also nominated for Best picture, its second nomination, forcing the Academy to revise their criteria, it was in 2009 and I still remember how surprising the line up was, but retrospectively, there's something Best Picturesque about ""The Blind Side"", once you decide to cut the PC vision and look at it for what is is, a nice and tender family movie, touching, heart-warming and funny.<br/><br/>So let's not be blinded by the whole PC conspiracy agenda."

","The Blind Side is a wonderfully engaging film, a film you might just pass off as another Good Will Hunting, Finding Forester type pic. You would be right, but this is a fresh or refreshing movie, if judged against that context. The film features knockout performances from it's black lead, another reason there's such a high pool of black acting talent about. Big Mike, we'll call em, though he doesn't like it, has grown up tough in his environs. Currently living on the street, at the request of a friend, where we're not really sure if he's the father, he's accepted into college. A gifted athlete, yet no intellectual, his grade point average close to nought, Big Mike,we see can shoot basketball hoops more than I can wolf down Krispy Kremes. He's taken in by a woman- a school sponsor, where he becomes part of Bullock's warm wonderful family. Bullock who's pushy character kind of irritated me a little, does shine, in her pinnacle worthy Oscar nominee moment. This inspiring film you enjoy, the more it progresses. It'll surprise you and grow on you, like Bullock's little son and very familiar Malcolm In The Middle face. Don't be blindsided and pass this one off. Film could of done with a better title and Collins, what sort of name is that for a girl, which had me initially thinking one of Bullock's too."

","Blind side is not your typical sports movie. It is not focused solely on a guy that comes out of nowhere and makes a losing team become the greatest thing in history.

"ciarahovest","8","0","1","6 May 2015"," The Blind Side - Excellent Movie
","Being a sports fan, I really enjoyed this movie, especially since it is based off of a true story. Having Sandra Bullock, play as Leigh Ann Tuohy, and Tim McGraw playing as Sean Tuohy is a great combination. Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses and Tm McGraw happens to be one of my favorite country singers. To me, this movie is very touching. I think many of us can see from this movie, and know from being a human, that no matter where you come from, never give up. Sean and Leigh Ann are two of the most loving parents. The have two children, Collins and SJ. One night, Michael was found by the Tuohy's walking on the side of a road. Later on, he ends up staying with the Tuohy's. He starts going to Wingate Christian High School, and he starts playing football for them also. His grades aren't the best being at Wingate, so Mrs. Tuohy talks to all the teachers to see what he needs help on. For the classes that Michael needs help with, Leigh Ann gets a tutor go raise his GPA. She want s ""Big Mike"" to get a good GPA so he can get accepted into a college and play football. This is when Michael never gave up, he pushed himself to learn more about the things he didn't like than he needed to. <br/><br/>Coming from the streets because of his dad leaving and his mom being on drugs, he knows a lot about protective instincts. SJ and Michael got in an accident the day the Tuohy's gave Michael a truck since he got his driver's license. Mike stopped the airbag with his forearm from hitting SJ in the face. When Leigh Anne arrived to the scene, Michael wasn't worried about anyone but SJ. He is so loving and has a warm heart. Thinking about someone who came from the streets, you never know what you're going to get out of them. The Tuohy's helped bring out the best in ""Big Mike."" <br/><br/>During the end of football season, many colleges were interested in him. Coaches were going to practices, and leaving lots of messages at the Tuohy household. Different colleges would come to their house and have a meeting with Mike, and SJ. SJ was looking for what college would fit Mike the best, and of course, allow SJ to do something special with the team. At the end, ""Big Mike"" went with a college near and dear to the Tuohy's heart. During college, he got the first-round draft pick for the Baltimore Ravens. The Tuohy's couldn't be prouder of Mike. Even though a lot of people judged the Tuohy's for having a black man in their family, they were so proud to have Mike a part of their family. It's crazy to see how big of an impact one person has on a family, and how big of an impact a family has on one person.<br/><br/>Although Step Up isn't a sport related video, it has the same theme. Tyler (Channing Tatum) vandalizes a performing arts center with a couple of his friends. He had a bad past, and to not get in trouble, Tyler did community service for the school such as mopping, changing lights, and other janitorial duties. He then meets Nora (Jenna Dewan), and begins dancing with her because she wasn't impressed with anyone who tried out for that position. Tyler and Nora then make a great final performance going through many struggles. Tyler is a changed man after all that he went through."

"bovaldi","8","0","1","21 March 2015"," Faith-based to the core
","The juggernauts of gridiron cinema—such as Rudy and Remember the Titans— almost all have one thing in common: they're unapologetically formulaic, but they're also extraordinarily well done. Sports movies of one variety or another are produced every year, but it's rare that any of them really leave a lasting impression on the collective American consciousness. More often than not, they're nothing more than exercises in the art of telling the classic inspiration story; you know, the faithful underdog overcoming crushing odds (think ""David and Goliath""). In Rudy, it was all about a runt with larger-than-life aspirations. In John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side, it's all about a larger-than-life (literally) teen who just wants a bed he can call his own. He's not thinking about what will happen years down the road; he's only thinking about where he'll find his next meal.<br/><br/>It's based on the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a down- and-out Memphis teen who regularly wanders in and out of foster homes. His mother is a coke-fiend, and he has no family to watch after him. However, thanks to the generosity of a friend, he's introduced to the football coach of a private Christian school and is admitted on the basis of his formidable athletic presence. Michael still has no home, however; he picks up half-eaten bags of popcorn at his school's gym after volleyball games so he's able to eat. He spends his evenings keeping warm inside a local laundromat.<br/><br/>One night, Leigh Anne Tuohy, the wife of a wealthy fast-food entrepreneur, sees him walking the streets and brings him home. Her family provides him with new clothing and a bed of his own. All of this happens so quickly, in fact, that my first instinct was to say, ""Wow— this would never happen."" The whole setup, in fact, seems so naively optimistic that it screams Hollywood contrivance. However, there's one catch to all this that's easy to forget: like the previously mentioned Rudy, it's a true story. As such, the movie has, to a certain degree, some wiggle room in terms of exploring scenarios that would otherwise reverberate as totally unrealistic or totally clichéd. I suppose, however, that clichés sometimes receive their namesake because they are, in fact, reality for so many people.<br/><br/>To my surprise, this fact actually causes The Blind Side to excel where other movies might've fizzled. The whole thing—though often derivative— feels very ""matter-of- fact."" The deeper into the story you go, the more genuine it feels. Wisely, Hancock has chosen to spin his tale by letting the actors and a steady camera do the work. There are no overly dramatic camera angles, and the soundtrack is minimal. The dialogue is a little over-the-top at times, but it's not so much that's distracting. Really, what we get here are a lot of unadorned scenes that depict our protagonist going about his daily activities, merely trying to survive. The 128-minute runtime does start to wear a little thin as things come to a close, but it's hard to imagine much of the story being cut. I guess that's one of the difficulties of telling a ""true story"": it's often hard to know what is essential and what's extracurricular.<br/><br/>What really stands out in The Blind Side, however, is its penchant for probing the social class divide that so many Americans either ignore or pretend doesn't exist. Despite its references to Norman Rockwell and the plight of the working poor, I'm not quite ready to heap unconditional praise on the movie. It's exploration of these concepts is far from subtle, and is often presented in such a way as to almost shout, ""Hey, stupid! Do something about this!"" It's not that I question the film's call to action, it's just that its presentation is like a brick to the forehead. We're bombarded with images of dirty apartments, broken homes, and life ""on the other side of the tracks."" My hope was that the movie's early use of flashback would get this particular job done in a much more subtle way, but Hancock and co. decided to take a more blunt approach that, in my estimation, takes a little something away from the overall ""bite."""

The acting is spot on by all concerned with Sandra Bullock excellent as the feisty mom. <br/><br/>The plot is fairly predictable however the performances are so natural that this film really does leave you with a warm glow.

"mkcarli","10","0","1","4 October 2013"," The Blind Side is a very inspirational movie based on a true story.
","The Blind Side<br/><br/>Review<br/><br/>In this movie, there were several scenes that greatly impacted the movie and it was a struggle to just choose one. The scene I chose was towards the beginning and it set the foundation for the entire movie. In this scene and through out the entire movie, Leigh Anne Tuohy becomes the focal point and is most involved in Michael's life. This scene instantly reveals Leigh Anne's role as the caring and kind woman she is. The scene starts off with the Tuohy family driving home from S.J.'s school play on a cold wet winter night. As they are driving home, they spot a big African American boy walking on the side of the road. Leigh Anne begins to question her son, S.J., about who the boy is. S.J. tells her that his name is Big Mike and at that moment, Leigh Anne's character begins to show because she instantly became very concerned about Big Mike. As they begin to get closer to him, Leigh Anne's husband, Sean, rolls down the window and asks him where he is going. Now, in today's society most people would not have even acknowledged his existence, I mean face it, we are selfish human beings and we tend to only care about ourselves ninety percent of the time. However, in this movie, that was not the case. Big Mike answers Sean with a soft and timid voice by telling him he is going to the school. The Tuohy's hesitantly drive away after they let Big Mike cross the street. It does not take more than five seconds for Leigh Anne to tell her husband, Sean, to turn around. He immediately turned the car around and Leigh Anne tells Sean to stop the car. She gets out and begins walking towards Big Mike. She asked him why he was going to the school gym because it is closed. He would not answer, so she persistently asked him again and he said ""Because its warm."" She asked him if he had a place to stay the night and he shook his head no. She looks back at her family in the car and made a look at her husband that said it all. She then invites Big Mike in their car and as they are about to start leaving, Sean states ""Where are we going?"" and Leigh Anne says ""Home"" in a way that implied, where else would we be going, of course we are going home. As they pull up to the Tuohy's mansion of a house, Big Mike looks out the car window and his eyes said it all. He could not believe what he was seeing. <br/><br/>If this scene does not reveal compassion and love towards people who are in need, then I do not know what will. This scene set the groundwork for the movie in that it was not going to be the normal white wealthy family saving an African American poor homeless boy. This movie was much more than that, it was an inspiration to the viewers that it only takes one person to step up and make a difference and an impact in someone's life. Leigh Anne was that person for Michael. It did not matter the difference in skin color, she just saw a homeless and abandoned boy and reached out to him. She did not have to, but she chose to because of the caring and loving woman she was. James Berardinelli, a critic, states, ""This is more about simple human decency and economic disadvantage than it is about racial inequality (although it would be disingenuous to ignore a link). Leigh Anne helps Michael not because of the color of his skin or his potential as an athlete - she does it because she sees another human being suffering and reaches out to him."" Throughout the entire movie, the whole family, mostly Leigh Anne, helped Michael become confident, strong, and most of all loved. They helped him become a star athlete that was drafted to the NFL Baltimore Ravens in the first round. Without this particular scene, Leigh Anne stepping up to the plate and not caring what anybody else would have thought of her, Michael would have never had a career in the NFL or a family that loved and cared for him. Kevin Carr stated in his review of the movie, ""And in the end, I really felt the film should have been more about Michael Oher rather than a spectacle of how awesome Leigh Anne Tuohy is, 'cause that gets rammed down your throat a bit too much here'."" I disagree with this statement because Leigh Anne Tuohy was bold and without her demanding and outspoken character; Michael would have never become the person he did. After all, in 2010, the actress playing the role of Leah Anne, Sandra Bullock, won an Oscar at the Golden Globes for her role in The Blind Side, so I'd say she did her job well. Overall, The Blind Side was a very inspirational movie that displayed the kind of character we should take on in our everyday lives."
"tryan2012","9","0","1","23 September 2013"," Sighting ""The Blind Side""
","Based on a true story and best-selling book, ""The Blind Side"" depicts the story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a troubled, homeless teenager who is taken in by the family of Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw). The Tuohy family provides Michael with a bed, buys him clothes, and assists him with his school work. More importantly, they shower ""Big Mike"" with much needed love and help him reach his full potential. Michael uses this love and help to transform his life in ways that you will have to see to believe. This makes ""The Blind Side"" a truly inspirational film that I would recommend to anyone and everyone. The film goes above and beyond in many aspects, but the one that clearly stands out most is the phenomenal acting and directing. The actors, actresses, and director do a remarkable job bringing Michael's incredible story to life. Quinton Aaron plays the giant role of Big Mike to perfection. Most actors try to portray a large personality, but Aaron does the exact opposite; he manages to play a shy, quiet, introverted role. Aaron stumbles around dragging his enormous feet on the ground with his skyscraping head hung low. He doesn't talk very much; and when he does, his words are mumbled with little confidence. However, after being taken in by the Tuohy family, Aaron gradually starts to play his role more enthusiastically. He takes pride in his academics and athletics, dances and sings in the car, and shines his vast smile often. Without Aaron's incredible acting, viewers would have a hard time seeing the positive effect the Touhys have on Michael's life. Likewise, the acting of the Touhys shows how much they care for and want to help Michael. McGraw turns himself into a dad who wants nothing more than to see his kids succeed. He treats Michael like a son, goes out of his way to teach Michael football, and even buys him his own truck. On the other hand, Bullock plays the role of a ruthlessly loving mother who never stops fighting for what she thinks is right. Bullock develops a southern accent and a powerful strut that she uses to defend Michael. For example, when she goes into the city slums by herself to look for Michael's real mother, Bullock is the one threatening gang members and not the other way around. There are not too many actresses who can pull off something like that; after all, there is a reason why she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Of course, the characters wouldn't be able to perform their remarkable acting jobs without the script and directing of John Lee Hancock. Hancock did a brilliant job taking Michael's unbelievable story and created a script with dialect that will take your breath away and send shivers down your spine. Furthermore, he found the perfect actors and actresses with personalities and characteristics identical to those of the real-life Michael, Leah Anne, and Sean. After seeing the hardship and triumphs of Michael Oher, viewers will leave the film feeling grateful and motivated. They will feel grateful for everything they have in life and motivated to make the best out the life they have."
"delpheniafields","Null","0","1","23 September 2013"," The Blind Side Review
","After review this movie I feel it's a wonderful movie that implements family values, struggles and success. Sandra Bullock (Leigh Ann Touhy) shows how it is still important to still have human values as she takes in a teen kid, Quinton Aaron (Mike Oher ) who has developmental an social issues. She gets him to see that he don't have to become a product of his environment, and although he is from a broken home and has no family, not only does he have a family in her, her family also accepts his situation instead of having a stranger in their home, they look at it as they have a new sibling and embrace him.<br/><br/>This movie demonstrates how everyone may not accept the circumstances and may even become judgment as she battles her family, and friends to do what she know and feels is right. She takes a ride on the other side as she deals with issues in Michael Oher's troubled neighborhood and becomes faced with issues that she was surprised he survived though. He came from a rough neighborhood, drug addict mom who was never there, and dealt with losing contact with his brother. His only means of survival was walking around all day from the laundry mat to the gym finding different places to sleep.<br/><br/>In dealing with the acceptance of their new sibling the Touhy children Lily Collins (Collin) and her brother Sean Jr. or nick named SJ (Jae Head) accepted her new brother no matter how she was looked at a school, and her brother SJ also embraced having a big brother, he helped condition him for his goals in football, and open up socially as they gained structure and developed into a family.<br/><br/>The lighting for the film seemed bright, I take it this way because it was a family film, and it encourages families to want to see it. It theme to me is similar to Remember the Titans with Denzel Washington, they both had a big message with great family values.<br/><br/>This is defiantly a must see film with great organizational structure of telling the story of Michael Oher. It shows his success and failures as he gained trust and love for his new family, and they push him all the way from being on the streets with no real future, to being drafted into the NFL, and having a successful Career. The film shows a mother who convinces her whole family to care for a love a young teen, It is a sincere film, and shows how the love of one family can not only change another kids life, but set him up for a positive future."

","Based on the novel by Michael Lewis, The Blind Side portrays the classic storyline of trying to find a place in the world. A powerful script written by John Lee Hancock strengthens the impeccable performances of Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron. Their authentic expressions and flawless delivery leave viewers enthralled with The Blind Side. <br/><br/>Michael Oher is a young man from Hurt Village of Memphis, Tennessee. He has never had a permanent home, having been passed through the foster care system since a young age. He has been accepted to the elite Wingate Christian School mostly due to his size. The coaches want Micheal for their sports teams, but his grades need to improve greatly. Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy are typical wealthy southerners. Their children, Collins and SJ, attend Wingate and after Collins' volleyball game the Tuohys see Michael picking up left behind popcorn to eat. They see him again walking in the icy rain after SJ's play. Leigh Anne decides to invite him into their home for the night. The next day, the Tuohys welcome Michael to stay for their Thanksgiving meal. After that, Michael never wants to leave.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock delivers a strong performance as Leigh Anne Tuohy. Dressed in white she gives off an air of perfection, power, and protection that can not be duplicated. She upholds the definition of a matriarch being career driven but still soft at heart and feels compelled to help Michael. As Leigh Anne looks at Michael and gives him a hug, the audience feels the quickly building love that she has for Michael. This relationship takes two to complete and Quinton Aaron develops his part beautifully. Even though he has few lines, he is able to demonstrate his complex emotions through his expressions. When the Tuohys first see Michael, his past pains and current fears are expressed without him having to say anything.<br/><br/>This film earns its acclaim through Bullock's and Aaron's performances, but even more so from its powerful script and storyline. The Blind Side is based largely from Michael Lewis' book, The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game. As writer and director, John Lee Hancock connects his viewers to the picture. He illustrates for them a story of a family opening their home to a boy most would just leave in the streets. Through scenes of love and affection between the Tuohys and Michael, Hancock melts viewers' hearts.<br/><br/>The Blind Side is an excellent depiction of a classic cultural struggle. Slightly disguised by a strong storyline and terrific acting, this movie brings up the social and racial divisions that are still present today. The Blind Side shows how one family chose to break those barriers for one boy. Leigh Anne Tuohy took many strides to prove to others that she loved Michael in spite of his difficult past. Hancock asks viewers to look beyond the cultural norm and see the possibility of fewer societal divisions."

","This was simply an amazing movie. I have been wanting to see this movie for a very long time. I'm not a fan of sport movies, but this movie was more then just sports. It was about family, trust, understanding, love, respect, and breaking barriers. I cried, I cried throughout the entire movie. I cried happy tears, sad tears, and angry tears. My heart felt like it was going to burst from such emotions. When I learned that this movie was based on a true story I was even more moved. I have to say Sandra Bullock did an amazing job, she has definitely grown as an actress. Quinton Aaron is a great actor and I'm glad he got his big break, I'm looking forward to see him in many new movies. I was very surprised to find out that that was Tim McGraw. I have never seen him without his iconic black cowboy hat, scruffy beard and drunk swagger. Hopefully he can do more movies in the future. Overall an amazing movie."

"thard631","8","0","1","18 August 2013"," Good lessons to be learned from this movie
","The movie that I am going to review is the blind side it is about a boy named Mike who lives on the streets and has a family take him in to live with them. Mike was going to school to play football and he had to learn how to play and he had to learn how to deal with people thinking that he was not the smartest kid to go to the school that he was attending. Mike was slow to learn and could not read well but if someone would read the material to him he was able to get a passing grade on the assignments. The person who took Mike in was trying to help him by getting him a tutor so that he would be able to play football in college. After having a bad family life Mike tried hard to accomplish his goals to better himself and make his adopted family proud of him. The major actors in the movie are Michael Oher who is played by Quinton Aaron, Leigh Anne Tuohy played by Sandra Bullock, S.J. Tuohy played by Jae Head, Sean Tuohy played by Tim McGraw. The theme of the movie is coming of age. The reason that I chose this theme is because Michael Oher had to learn what it was like to have a family that cared about him and helped him achieve his goals. Another movie where I feel that the theme is coming of age is in Coach Carter because the team had to learn how to play under the new coaches rules and follow a contract that they all signed in the beginning of the season. The first technique that I am choosing is dialog because of how Leigh Anne spoke to Michael and told him that he had to protect the family and keep them safe and he told her that she had nothing to worry about he would protect her. The next is color when Michael was on the street he wore dark and dirty clothes and when Leigh Anne bought him new clothes he got bright colors and he kept them clean. If you are able to get help from someone or from different people and they believe that you are doing your best you can make yourself and your life better."

","The Blind Side<br/><br/>Everyone is born in different circumstances in different places on different times. Circumstances that help us form who we are and set the goals for who we want to be even though some do not have the same opportunities. Since we dream of what we want to become and be when we grow up since we are children. But what makes you different form other people is when you are able to accomplish your dreams no matter what obstacles are on your way, just like Michael Oher demonstrates everyone that nothing is impossible in the movie ""The Blind Side"". <br/><br/>This movie has one of the most outstanding casts to represent every single actual person. With Sandra Bullock who plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, the adoptive mother of Michael Oher, Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy, as Micheal's adoptive father, Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher, Jae Head as S.J.Tuohy and Lily Collins as Collins Tuohy, the real children of the Tuohy's. Sandra Bullock received many accolades for her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy, a strong woman who changes her point of view about society and people from the first time she meets Michael. Where her character starts to develop into a more conscious and less superficial woman. We see a strong, hardheaded woman who shows no limitation for love and family. However, the role of Jae Head as S.J. Tuohy is one to remember as much as the one of Sandra Bullock. This child was able to represent the power of family and how much it actually means for Michael. They all become the only real family Michael will have and has had in his life and will help him become part of their family. As well as to fight to reach his dreams and goals.<br/><br/>Set in a high-class background we see Michael, a Afro-American teenage boy who has gone to many things in his life and who is lost in the world. Michael has no idea who his father is and his mother is a drug addict. He has nowhere to go and no one to take care of him and then the Tuohy family finds him. With no desire from Leigh Anne Tuohy for this boy with nothing at all she i convinced by her son and husband to take Michael home for a night. Which, turns out to be more than one night. <br/><br/>But one of the biggest surprises was Sandra Bullock playing Leigh Anne Tuohy. There are not many movie where we see a strong woman role that has such influence in there peoples lives or see a movie which shows there is no limit or difference when it comes down to love. This is a role that showed another aspect of Sandra Bullock, not longer like Ms. Congeniality but as a strong powerful mother and leading woman. Even with her blonde hair and playing a rich southern woman she exceeds expectations with the role. She comes to show true love and true interest in this young Afro-American boy who they found in the street. Then helps get up in his feet and up into real life succeeding by accomplishing his dream. <br/><br/>However, the development of the character of Collins Tuohy is not fully developed. We see some scenes where she interacts with Michael but they are not fully developed as for most of the other characters, which do seem to be more emotionally attached to ""Big Mike"", Michael Oher. The development of Collins is superficial, for her being a teenage girl growing up with a strange guy in her house must have been hard but still it is not showed to the audience. Or maybe it was the idea of the writer to never fully develop this characters relationship with the main character.<br/><br/>As well as the undeveloped relationships between the characters in the movie we also see a lot of stereotypes that are brought up in the movie. Texas and most Americans' love football and coaches love to win. However, what surprised me was how they over come these stereotypes throughout the movie and show how ""Big Mike"" made his own way in life. <br/><br/>The message of this film is very clear and heartwarming. Telling a story that inspires everyone to be better and to thrive to be the best. It's about helping others around us, that we would never think to talk to or know, and help them get up in their feet for them to walk and be able to become great. It's about helping the people that need to find the way and be able to give them a new chance to be able to accomplish what they always wanted. <br/><br/>This is an outstanding biographical movie that depicts the hard times and the struggle it took to get to where Michael is. The director and writer of the script for the movie John Lee Hancock did an amazing job with the shot selections and storyline. He was able to transfer the struggle and the raw emotions of the book, written by Michael Lewis, into real life. <br/><br/>This movie is rated PG-13, a movie that shows true struggles in life and real situations that many people face and is worth watching over and over again. Most movies nowadays only show violence, sex, and have no real message or moral. This is one of the movies that you will not be able to forget. Just as one of the most famous and classical movies of all time ""Forest Gump"", this movie shows that love has no limits and that everything you dream off you can do."

","OK i've been a huge fan of Sandra Bullock since I seen her in the likes of Speed, Practical Magic,Miss Congeniality and so many more so I had the absolute delight to see her here in this truly moving motion picture. Winner of Best Actress at the Oscars back in 2009 the movie is based on a true story about a man named Micheal Oar who was later brought off by Social Workers from his cracked addict mother along with his brother as it was unsafe for himself and his brother to stay their with her.Fast forward a few years later and Micheal has moved on with his troubled past and is living with a man who helped him get into some sort of Catholic school,but he later tragically died and Micheal has no where else to go as he always runs away from his foster family. Enter Leanne Tuohy played by the brilliant Sandra Bullock who's children Collins and her son Sean Jr attend the same school as Micheal goes to.Micheal of course is struggling with his homework and the teachers sorta give him a hard time as they think that's dumb but his actually not dumb at all. <br/><br/>Being such a headstrong housewife she stumbles across him walking in the rain and heading back to the Gym,she demands Micheal where his going and he says to the Gym,but she refuses a No from him and decides for him to stay with her and her doting husband Sean played by former Country Western Singer Tim Mcgraw who I must admit was barely recognizable without his hat and his beard.<br/><br/>With Leanne's help Micheal soon becomes an international American Football Player for his school and fights for winning.<br/><br/>SO why is this my all time favourite live action movie,well its because of the story I absolutely love the story to this as it moves you and you can sorta root for the charcthers. Sandra Bullock was brilliant as Leanne Tuohy even though she looked hardly noticeable because of her blonde hair which sorta looks alright on her,as for the rest of the cast there brilliant too including Quinton Aaron who is a newcomer as he plays the American Football Player Micheal Oar. The editing was great I see absolutely nothing wrong with this film its one of those movies where you can watch over and over again. <br/><br/>Tangled,and A Walk To Remember are also my all time favourite movies so its a privilege to add The Blind Side to my list of all time favourite movies. A lot of people love that film The Shawshank Redemption but for me nah its not my cup of tea but The Blind Side is a brilliant movie.<br/><br/>10/10"

"krutz-alec","9","0","2","19 February 2013"," The Blind Side is an amazing movie
","The Blind Side is a compelling movie about the coming together of two very different American experiences. John Lee Hancock wrote and directed this eye-opening biography film that was the fourth highest grossing film in 2009. The film revolves around two main characters: a teenage athlete from the projects and a wealthy suburban family who, in the end, change each other's lives. <br/><br/>Hancock took a step in the right direction when deciding on the location for the story. Set in Memphis Tennessee, moviegoers feel the experience of the two Americas. One with well manicured lawns, large houses and a beautiful private school. The other showing the rundown stores and the gritty housing projects complete with broken windows and eviction notices. The clothes of the various characters reflect the two different Americas: preppy and stylish on one side and worn out and drab colors on the other. <br/><br/>Quinton Aaron plays one of the two main characters, Michael Oher, also known as ""Big Mike"" to most. Aaron has the large physical stature to fit the role of Big Mike as a budding high school football star, but it is his portrayal of the quiet, but thoughtfulness in Big Mike which makes us root for him to succeed. With few words but realistic facial expressions and slow body-movement, Aaron conveys Big Mike's unease in his new surroundings, his sadness of never experiencing a real family life and ultimately his growing comfort. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock steps into the shoes of Leigh Anne Tuoghy. Bullock is best known for her flirtatious characters in movies like Miss. Congeniality and All about Steve, but in this film, she executes the role of Leigh Anne, not as smiling and flirty, but as a calm, confident wife and a mother of two, whose life is changed by Michael. At one point in the film Leigh Anne is in the projects looking for Big Mike, when a man calls her an expletive. Bullock shows the tension, not by screaming, but with eye contact. She also conveys Leigh Anne's thoughtfulness behind a materialistic appearance. She drives a Mercedes, but calmly yet sternly challenges her lunch friends who almost mock her when she says Michael is apart of the family.<br/><br/>Rather than merely walking through the story in chronological order, Hancock effectively uses flashbacks to show the difficulty of growing up with a drug-addicted mother. Learning about Big Mike's rough life was an emotional part of the film. Hancock uses a camera angle to make you feel you are in Big Mike's shoes as he watches his mother struggle. Having a wide camera angle when Big Mike was comes to his new private school helped show how different this setting was from the projects. How the camera moved was nice, creating the storyline to flow well and not having a chopping cut break up to story either. The soundtrack by Carter Burwell added to emotions that the audience and the two different cultures experienced. The football scenes are realistic but do not overwhelm the film. Rather, football is one way the two Americas can come together. <br/><br/>The Blind Side will stir a wide range of emotions: from holding back tears to jumping joy. It will also cause adults and school aged kids to have a greater appreciation about what someone from the other America can do or is thinking. That is a lesson, which will make this movie relevant for years to come."

"hutt-wiginton","10","0","2","16 November 2012"," Not Just Another Football Movie
","In 2009, The Blind Side was directed into a film after being published as a novel in 2006. After reading the spectacular biography of Michael Oher and watching the movie, the two were surprisingly very similar. In both the novel and the movie, the story begins with a football injury that ended a great player's career. This provides a smooth transition and a glimpse of how football affected the life of Michael Oher. Along with football, the loving Tuohy family completely turned Michael's life around. The film successfully created scenes and images into real life that were previously demonstrated in the novel. The anticipated movie emotionally affected many of those who watched it and exceeded all expectations. <br/><br/>While growing up, Michael was abandoned by his parents, leaving him to survive on his own. As each day passed, he struggled to find a place to sleep and literally was forced to sleep on the streets. On one rainy night, Michael was walking down a dark street with his belongings after leaving a local volleyball game. Fortunately, the Tuohy family, who happened to be extremely wealthy, suspiciously drove by him wondering where he was going. They soon realized his difficult situation, and offered to take care of him. Soon after, Michael became enrolled in one of the top private schools in the area thanks to the head football coach who sought after his athletic ability. S.J. Tuohy, the son, gives his best effort with transforming Michael into a football player, and seemed to have done a great job. Immediately into the football season, Michael began to receive scholarship offers from the top college football teams across the nation. The Tuohy's were alumni's of Ole Miss and contributed greatly to his decision in continuing his football career at this college.<br/><br/>The movie contains many excellent actors that performed absolutely brilliantly at each of their roles. Sandra Bullock plays the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy, the mother, and could not have done better at portraying a loving mom who wanted the best for her family and Michael. By showing true emotions and constant protection, she was able to excel at her role in one of the best pieces of acting I have ever witnessed. In comparison with the mom, S.J. Tuohy, played by Jae Head, perfectly suited their character, and acted as if the movie were real life. Jae Head does remarkably at showing his true passion for the sport of football and his enjoyment in actually helping Michael. His constant smile helped show his passion in filming and the bright character of the young man. Along with Bullock and Head, Tim McGraw fitted perfectly as the father and the football coach acted great as a typical southern football fanatic. Each of these actors played their roles tremendously and contributed greatly to the success of The Blind Side. Before watching the movie, most people thought that this movie would have been only about football. However, the cinematography actually focuses the move on the struggling life of Michael Oher, and how the Tuohy's changed his life around. I thought the most memorable portion of the movie was when Michael first got connected and comfortable with the family. In these scenes, the filming emphasizes the emotions of Michael Oher and the mother and son and the beautiful scenery in the background. This allows the movie to touch the emotional side of the audience and become closer to each of the characters. The movie shows Michael's journey through the point of views of both Michael Oher and the Tuohy family. The cinematography helped establish a closer connection with the characters in the movie, and contributes to the audience's love for The Blind Side. Personally, The Blind Side was absolutely one of the most outstanding movies in all aspects. The story line was heartwarming, the acting was nothing short of pure brilliance, and the cinematography portrayed the perfect image throughout the entire journey. In my opinion, this film fell nothing short of perfection, and received all ten stars."

","The 2009 "" The Blind Side,"" movie directed by John Lee Hancock is about a homeless teenage boy , by the name of Michael Oher ""Big Mike"" played by Quinton Aaron who does not know who his mother or his father is and has been pretty much getting by from being in the projects. Big Mike has no worries and cares, until he was shown affection from a caring family called the tuohy's. With the help of Leigh Anne Tuohy played by Sandra Bullock and Sean Tuohy played by Tim McGraw life started for Michael. Michael started actually showing his personality and expressing himself. I don't want to give too much of the movie away, however, from the moment I started to watch the movie I was glued to the television. This is a must see movie, If I had to rate it,I would give it 9 stars."
"dianadixon05","8","0","1","17 October 2012"," A must see movie that provides a good message!
","The ""Blind Side"" is a movie for the entire family. If a person is looking for a movie with a heartfelt message, but still involves a few laughs, this is it! The movie balances out the drama and comedy, which is great! The best thing about The Blind Side is that it is based on a true story of Baltimore Ravens football player Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw also have roles in this film as Leigh Anne Tuohy and Sean Tuohy. They played a married couple who discovers Michael Oher while at a restaurant one evening. They were told that he was a homeless teenager and both decided to bring him into their family. After viewing this movie, I feel that it was put together perfectly. I thought that it would be all about football, but I was wrong. It goes into more detail of Michael and how he becomes the person he is today. Michael Ohor was attending a predominately white private school, which was proved to be a task for him. He was an uneducated African American male and needed to seek help from others in order to succeed in high school. Michael was able to fulfill his dream of playing football in high school and the storyline takes on from there. One thing that stuck out the most from the movie to me is the love the Tuohy family showed Michael to make him feel like he was actually part of their family. Another thing is that once a person thinks that they figured out the plot of the movie, they will be thinking, ""Wow that definitely took an interesting turn."" Not many movies can keep a person thinking to what will exactly happen and this is one of them. Sandra Bullock is not one of my favorite actresses, but after this movie I look at her so different. She definitely played her role in this film and I was very impressed by the hard work she put into it. Please be sure to go out and support this movie! It's a must see!"

"kem1139","10","0","1","14 September 2012"," An amazing and Uplifting movie!
","The Blind Side is an uplifting movie based on a true story book by Michael Lewis called the Blind Side:Evolution of a Game. Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron, is a young black kid that grew up in the projects and was taken away from his drug addicted mother as a young boy. He has bounced around foster homes and, as we find him in the start of the movie, he is sleeping on a friends couch. When his friend gets him into a private school named Wingate because of his athletic ability he finds himself in strange surroundings. After his friend's girlfriend makes him kick Michael out he is taken in by Leigh Anne and Sean Touhy, an affluent white couple. With the help from the Tougy's, and a tutor Miss Sue, Michael starts to excel in his school work and on the field. <br/><br/>The movie does a wonderful job of not focusing just on the football action and puts more focus and effort into the background story of Michael Oher. We see the struggles that he must go through as a young black kid such as being taken away from his mother, not having a place to go home to, and basically being on his own with no resources. I also enjoyed the way Quinton Aaron portrayed Michael Oher. He was very quite which left some mysteriousness to his character. Without overplaying his role it keeps you wondering about him and what he's thinking. The scene where He and Leigh Anne are in the car and she ask him to tell her one thing about himself in which he tells her that he doesn't like being called big Mike. I think this is a breakthrough moment for the two of them and he starts feeling comfortable with her. This movie put me in mind of another great football movie, Remember the Titans where the black coach and players are cast into a predominantly white school and they have to find a way to coexist and get along with one another. <br/><br/>In the opening scenes we get an idea of what Michaels journey is going to be like as he rides in the back seat of a car and is watching the scenery go by. It starts out as they go through the projects with buildings being run down with roofs falling in and as they go along the neighborhoods slowly get nicer. When Michael and Steven walk up on the baskets of basket balls sitting open and not locked they are shocked that they are not locked up. Michael exclaims that white people are crazy. One aspect of the film that I found odd though was the fact that Steven and his father are in this opening scene's however after that they are dropped entirely from the film with no other mention of them. Another item of the movie I felt should have been visited more was showing how intelligent Michael really was. At one point he has a teacher exclaim to other teachers that he knows the material and he isn't stupid but we never see him show that side. <br/><br/>All together I throughly enjoyed the movie. I felt like it was a great feel good story that was told very well with out over doing the drama. Sandra Bullock does an amazing job and its her performance that really stands out to me. One of the greatest strengths of this movie is that you don't have to be a football fan to love it because its really not just a football movie it has a greater depth in its story than that."
"vue01","8","0","1","10 September 2012"," The Blind Side
","The Blind Side is about a young black man Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron who receives love from white family. Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy. Leigh Anne is married to husband is Sean Tuohy played by Tim McGraw. Leigh Anne and Sean have two children S.J. Tuohy and Collins Tuohy played by Jae Head and Lily Collins. Essentially, Michael is homeless, his mother is addicted to drugs, and he sleeps on the couch of a family friend. Michael enters a private school because a coach sees his enormous stature and pleads the board to let him in school. Leigh Anne is spots Michael and figures that he doesn't have a warm place to stay for the night. She makes Michael get in their car and sleeps with them for the night.<br/><br/>During the night Leigh Anne and Sean talk about Michael and if he will steal from them. In the morning Leigh Anne wakes up to find the blankets that Michael used are folded neatly and stacked. Michael had already left their home. Leigh Anne feels ashamed for thinking that Michael would steal just because he is black. The main theme for this film is prejudices. Michael faces them every day in an all most all white private school. The Tuohy's experiences it because their friends and family don't understand why they would care so much for a young black man.<br/><br/>Save the Last Dance could be compared to The Blind Side because in Save the Last Dance, Sara Johnson played by Julia Stiles, a young white dancer moves into an urban school with mostly black students. Sara meets the prejudices of being the only white girl and hated by the other students just because she isn't like them. In the Blind Side before Michael moves in with the Tuohy's Michael is always surrounded by darkness. For example the scene where Michael is at a laundry mat, Michael is there at night time. Another example is when Leigh Anne asks Michael if he has a place to go to it is night. The contrast of night and day in this movie represents Michael's life, mood, and hope. A dark night is gloomy and you can't see where you are going. Michael's future before the Tuohy's was the same. After Michael moves in with the Tuohy's his life changes and his future becomes brighter. <br/><br/>Another technique used is color. Before Michael moves in he has two shirts both gray. After he moves in Leigh Anne takes him shopping and he gets multicolored polo's. The next day Michael proudly walks into school wearing his new polo. The clothes and colors here represent Michael's confidence. Before he hung his head and rarely looked up but after the new clothes he smiled and was confident in himself. In the Blind Side, a young man transforms into his full potential. Michael and the Tuohy's face the prejudices and overcome them together as a family."
"fell01","8","0","1","4 August 2012"," Great movie
","The movie 'The Blind Side' is a movie that I looked forward to watching and it definitely didn't disappoint in my eyes. The movie is great because it's based on a true story of how a couple Leigh Ann and Sean Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw, took in a homeless kid and gave him some direction. The kid they took in was Michael ""Big Mike"" Oher who was played by Quinton Aaron. I would consider one of the major themes in this movie to be something along the lines of if you put your all into something no matter the obstacle you'll achieve your goals, and that's exactly what Michael Oher did. I think throughout the film you get many different themes whether it's race, family, or simply sports. I think the film did a great job at being inspirational and giving people hope to succeed. To me this film seems a lot like Gladiator, stay with me for a minute, my reasoning behind this is a person has a family loses them goes through some extremely rough times, but in the end they fight their way to the top and succeed. In Gladiator they had the same issues race, family, and sport, but obviously the movie plot is a touch different and I know this is a long stretch so please just use your imagination and think about it. Overall I think anyone who gives this movie the time will really appreciate it."
"crawfo64","9","0","1","28 July 2012"," Michael truly provides encouragement for many. (Spoiler)
","In the film The Blind Side, Leigh Anne Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock, takes in a young man who was out roaming the streets. Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron, was a young homeless boy who grew up in a family who used drugs. He was taken from his mother when he was a child. He did not do well in his school work so he just didn't go to school. When a man finally thought he saw potential in Michael, he convinced him to start going to school. Michael still wasn't doing well in his studies but he was excellent in sports. He became friends with Leigh Anne's son and eventually he becomes part of their family. Leigh Anne includes him in their family photos and takes him to buy new clothes for school. When she found out he wasn't doing well in his studies, she goes to the school to see what she can do to help. She learns that he understands a lot about how to protect someone so she tries to relate things to that in order to get him to get interested in learning new things. The Tuohy family convinces Michael to join a football team and encourage him to continue with it. Leigh Anne teaches him that he can make something good out of himself even if he had a rough childhood. Michael goes on to become a famous football player and loves what he does. <br/><br/>The theme for this movie is that anyone can become what they want to be in life if you are willing to work hard, it doesn't matter what your background is. It also teaches you to help people when they need it. Michael was taken from his mother when he was just a young child and he didn't know what to do after that happened, he was on his own. He just felt like he wasn't worth anything and he didn't believe anyone really cared about him. You could see this on his face when the cameras showed him from a specific angle. They would focus on his face up close so the viewers can see the hurt in his eyes. Lighting was also used to show Michael's feelings and emotions. Many times when Michael was down and out or feeling bad, the light of that particular scene seemed to be darker than normal. For example, when Michael was walking down the road on a cold night with shorts and a t- shirt on, he was feeling bad and lonely. The setting was on a bit of a dark street and it was late at night so there was not much light at all. After Leigh Anne asked him to come stay at their house, as soon as they walked in the lights got a little brighter. Michael was still not feeling very self-confident but he was happy to be able to stay in a warm place for the night. This helped to show Michael feeling sort of sorry for himself and not even trying to better himself because he knows what his background it. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, Michael must work hard to prove to himself and others that he could be something better. He had to work hard in school and was lucky to have help from Leigh Anne and her family. Just like Julie in Julie & Julia, Michael had many struggles to work through but both Julie and Michael eventually reach their dream goal of becoming what they wanted to be in life. In the end, the lights are shining bright on Michael as he is accepted to play for a professional football team. This had become Michael's dream in life. Once again, the cameras angle in on his face to show how happy he is. It also shows how proud he is of himself because he never thought he would become anything good during his lifetime. He had worked hard to become what he wanted to be, regardless of his horrible childhood. He is an encouragement to anyone who may find themselves in the same situation."

","You'll be blindsided if you're not at least able to discern basic football positions cited in its intro and used throughout The Blind Side. Narrated by Sandra Bullock in the voice of character Leigh Anne Tuohy, a professional upscale Caucasian wife and mother who opens her house—and heart to a then homeless African American teen referred to as 'Big Mike.' Bullock explains that the job of the left tackle "" is to protect the quarterback's blind side."" <br/><br/>Although Michael Oher is the focal figure of the heartwarming movie based on true events in his life documented in ""The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game,"" each Tuohy family member has a key role, which figures prominently in helping Oher to overcome the challenges of his impoverished childhood. At the time Oher's unaware of the whereabouts of his drug-abusing mother, who is displaced from their Project apartment. <br/><br/>Accused of having ulterior motives for taking in the genteel and peaceful-natured, promising athlete; the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) investigates the Tuohys on suspicion of being 'boosters' for their alma mater: University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), and imposing undue influence over Oher to play for the school's team. Passed through the educational system with a near zero IQ, below average reading level and no personal records; Oher succeeds despite the odds against him to make the Dean's List, and become a 2009 NFL first-round draft pick offensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens. <br/><br/>(Oher's high school assessment test reveals a 98% rating for protective instinct, a pivotal point that factors in the overall film and positive outcome). Youngest child and only son—before legal guardianship of Oher is obtained—adorable pint-sized, freckle-faced charmer Jae Head as SJ (replete with braces), steals the spotlight the moment he appears on screen and holds it to the very end. <br/><br/>Bullock's Oscar-winning portrayal of Leigh Anne's strong,domineering character is evident as she literally bounds into the scene. Not as aggressively but with more subtlety, country crooner Tim McGraw is surprisingly equally endearing as her mild mannered, docile husband Sean, who customarily gives in to his wife's overly willful personality. <br/><br/>The personal photos of Oher, the Tuohys and a video clip of the televised first round draft ceremony shown alongside the ending credits roll, appropriately demonstrate recent black history at its best."

"karbear_08","9","0","1","2 May 2012"," The Blind Side
","To me, The Blind Side is an amazing movie. It has a great meaning behind it. Michael was a kid from the projects and he didn't have the best childhood. His mom had gotten into trouble, so his brother and him were taken away from her. Michael was living with someone and the wife didn't want him living their anymore. Michael ended up moving out into the world all alone. He went to a very good school but he didn't have the best education background so he was doing poor at school. Leigh Anne Tuohy's son S.J. went to school with Michael. She saw that he wasn't in the best of place so she and her family took him in one night. Leigh Anne and Sean, her husband, asked Michael if he wanted to be apart of their family, so they adopted him. The Tuohy family was very kind to Michael. They helped him with his schooling and he even got to play football during his senior year. He was an amazing football player and got many scholarships for college. He picked to go to the college that all of the Tuohy's loved! This movie has a great meaning behind it. Michael Oher, Quinton Arron in real life, was from the projects. He didn't have a great childhood, but look at him now. He was drafted 23rd to the Baltimore Ravens. This is a great movie that I think everyone should take the time to watch!"
"vchimpanzee","Null","0","1","30 April 2012"," Great job, especially Bullock
","Even before this movie, Sandra Bullock was one of my favorite actresses. And not just because she is gorgeous. She looks good enough with dark hair, but being a blonde (as Leigh Anne is) doesn't make her prettier despite what most people say about blondes. She does look good enough for me to wonder if Faith got jealous, but there's much more to her here of course.<br/><br/>I have to disagree that Bullock was the obvious choice for best actress on all the awards shows, but she certainly deserved a nomination. Some of her best moments include teaching Michael how to play football and putting Alton from the 'hood in his place. Leigh Anne is a force to be reckoned with, and she has a sarcastic sense of humor. <br/><br/>Of course there was more to this movie than just Bullock's performance. It's an inspiring story overall, and Quinton Aaron is a wonderful gentle giant, easy to like, friendly and intelligent with a sense of humor. For someone who has been through all he has, Michael has such a good attitude.<br/><br/>Jae Head does a great job for such a young actor. Michael's ""little brother"" is quite a standout.<br/><br/>Tim McGraw doesn't remind me at all of the country singer. He holds his own against a strong, intelligent wife, and he's easy to like, but he knows his place.<br/><br/>Someone else who deserves a mention: Eric Benson, #66 on the first team Michael played against. He intends to make Michael's life miserable and found out Michael was a giant creampuff. The taunts never ended until Michael learned just how deal with him, and how he did it was memorable and humorous. <br/><br/>Michael's teachers are quite patient with him. He just needs to be taught in the way he could learn. There are lots of good performances among the Wingate faculty.<br/><br/>Kathy Bates does a good job as Michael's tutor, but except for her horror story about the Knoxville stadium, I have to say she did slightly better in the other movie I saw her in on the same day--a humorous version of the Jesse James story.<br/><br/>There are issues this movie hints at but doesn't deal with fully. Michael grew up in the 'hood and has an African-American heritage, and the issue of racism is touched on briefly, but there's not a lot of real conflict. Leigh Anne's friends make some insensitive comments, but they can easily be forgiven. They do have a lesson to learn.<br/><br/>I was surprised at the TV-14 rating ABC gave this. Only a couple of violent scenes in the 'hood would be worthy of this. This is actually a family movie. Though Michael's old friends have such dirty mouths, and one word generally edited out of movies before broadcast is not in this case. While Michael has such a calm attitude, he can only be pushed so far.<br/><br/>The obvious Oscar winner? I don't think so, but it was well worth seeing."

","A countless act of kindness can turn a life upside down and The Blind Side showed just that. This film was the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) who was a homeless teen who knew nothing about the joys of family or having a proper education. Growing up in the projects of Memphis he only knew the effects drugs and what the streets could offer him. Leigh Ann Tuody (Sandra Bullock) was a classy woman living the high life with not a care in the world. It wasn't until their paths crossed that they unknowingly impacted each other's lives forever.<br/><br/>Leigh Ann took Michael in for what she thought would be for just one night. She soon realized he had no family and nowhere to go. Michael continued to stay at the Tuody's home and was eventually adopted. When Leigh Ann asked Michael if he wanted to be a part of the family and be adopted his response was, ""I thought I already was."" The Tuody's contributed to Michael's success by giving him a stable environment. He was able to bring up his grades and joined the football team becoming their star athlete.<br/><br/>The film used a mixture of angles and music to portray emotion. Michael was a rather big boy and often times he seemed like a giant compared to the other children. But when Michael was feeling sad or intimidated the camera would draw back making him look rather small conveying that Michael was uncomfortable and not feeling like the big man on campus. The music played a big part in the film as well letting you know when something important was happening in Michael's life. <br/><br/>This film was filled with joy, laughter, tears and compassion. When a family takes in a complete stranger and turns their life around for the good it's not only a selfless act of kindness but shows that there are still good people out there. This reminds me of the film Seven Pounds where Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks out to change the lives of seven strangers. Ben is the one ultimately transformed in the end by one of his strangers Leigh Ann was changed by Michael. Random acts of kindness are not seen every day so when someone goes out of their way to help someone out the way the Truody's did Michael it's heartwarming.<br/><br/>Michael not only graduated from high school but went on to a Division I college Ole Miss. He was later drafted into the NFL.<br/><br/>This was a great and inspiring movie. I would recommend this movie for all ages. It teaches us life lessons that not everyone is the same yet there are still people out there willing to lend a helping hand to help you reach your destiny."

I believe if these actors weren't in the movie it would not have turned out as well as it did. The rating for this movie was PG-13, which I feel is appropriate.

The cast of this movie is superb from Quinton Aaron to Tim McGraw, but it's Sandra Bullock who stole the entire show, with her excellent charisma, charm, confidence, strictness, comedic timing, and perfect skill, and she totally deserves her Oscar win.

""The Blind Side"" is easily one of the best movies of the year, and it's a perfect choice to be nominated for Best Picture, because it's a feel-good heartwarming drama that tugs into the heartstrings.

"leftbanker-1","7","0","1","2 October 2011"," Sweet Without Being Maudlin
","I have always disliked Sandra Bullock with ""dislike"" being the most polite word I can come up with among the rather ample stable of pejoratives that come to mind when looking over her past work. Add to this the fact that I'm almost embarrassed to glow over this type of movie which is like a glorified after-school special. I read a few reviews on IMDb of the film before I watched it and something someone said sort of stuck and I had an altered approach to the viewing. The Blind Side is almost relentlessly upbeat and Pollyannaish. You could say the same thing about The Beatles ""All You Need is Love"" and not many people mock that song. They director manages to be unmercifully sweet without it every being corny or maudlin. It helps when whatever message you have decided to deliver is served with a heavy dose of humor. You can get away with a lot of sermonizing if you disguise it with a few jokes.<br/><br/>What struck me about the movie, and something I thoroughly appreciated, was that race wasn't anywhere near the biggest issue. I would also rate this film as more of a comedy than a sports movie or anything else. It was truly funny.<br/><br/>I'm sure that this movie has zero to do with the actual events of the lives of the people it claims to represent but it's a damn movie, people. If this movie wasn't political enough for you, or you thought that it condescended to the adopted black boy and that he served as basically a family pet then perhaps you should remember that this wasn't intended as a documentary. It's a movie, folks."

","Okay let me get this right! The Republicans are insulted, the African Americans are insulted and the do gooders are insulted and the raw nitty gritty tell us the truth are insulted! Why is this so? It is pretty easy to explain really .... you see the story was always going to divide people in itself but the producers tried to run this down the middle IE not too left or right and as we all know it's human nature that if it doesn't sit politically correct in your head you are not going to be happy. <br/><br/>Now here is my take on the story. Irrespective of the white folks intentions and would they do it if he wasn't a potentially going to be a football star this movie shows (even with its Walt Disney feel) that people can do good and that they should do good. Society is a difficult problem with no simple answers, for example here in Australia we don't do enough to help the indigenous people and yet they get upset if you do help them as they would like to do it on their own terms. I fully agree with them but this doesn't mean you should let a young children live on the streets or that we don't provide assistance. The reality is not every aboriginal is disadvantage but there is a high majority of them who are. This is where people need to think outside the square and not take offense to the stereo typing and appreciate the particular people's story. You see most white southern people are republicans and most Africans Southern Americans are living below the poverty line. I personally find it offensive that people who live in New York or Germany find it offensive when they do not take into account the particular person situation and they are in fact generalising their assumptions based on his/hers location and situations. It is also a fact that not every person has the chance to go to university of their choice without the right criteria. Do you think that every Harvard university student wants to be a lawyer or doctor because of their own goals or ideas? Many of these students are driving by parent's goals and dreams and if they have the resources then so be it. Michael had a chance to do something in his life that would give him future. I sure as hell don't want to work at my job every week but i do it and i am sure that I am not the only person who feels like that..... but life gives us all choices and Michael took his .... right or wrong Michael is a lucky man.<br/><br/>Good story but could have been better, however it has good acting and it is well worth a look."

","I have watched this film four times now and it still moves me in all the right ways in all the right places. I am not a great fan of American Football and yet it doesn't matter one jot because this movie is so much deeper and profound than any sport could be.<br/><br/>It is real life peeled away, layer by layer, just as the screenplay says it should. It doesn't attack anything by exaggeration, dramatic effect, or overstatement, it simply plays it out richly and simply through good, honest acting from a good, honest cast and a good, honest story.<br/><br/>The film is brave enough to lay bear the counter arguments about ""agendas"" hidden within its own story and expose our own doubts, fears, presumptions and prejudices.<br/><br/>I adore Sandra Bullock and I am pleased for her she found such a wonderful part to truly demonstrate her capacity for her art: an Oscar seems scant reward for such a wonderfully inspiring piece of drama. And the support is truly wonderful too.<br/><br/>Go see this movie if you want to leave a theatre with a good feeling in your gut despite ""the warts and all"" you go through in its two hours or so.<br/><br/>We can all change something even if it is only ourselves."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","1","7 April 2011"," A very American (and inspirational) story
","This is not a film which is going to play well outside of the United States. It is the true story of how a tough Memphis mother in a wealthy family (Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy) befriends a huge, homeless and ill-educated black man (Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher), enabling him ultimately to become a highly successfully professional American football player. Of course, outside the USA, few people will have heard of Oher or have much interest in American football. Even the title - a footballing term - is unhelpful. Furthermore, as a narrative, it has the additional problems of being slow and lacking dramatic tension.<br/><br/>Having said all this, it is a fine performance by Bullock who has to adopt a Southern accent for a role which sees her playing a much more assertive and less cute character than is usually her wont. It won her the Academy Award for Best Actress. And, in its own way, the tale is inspirational, showing that with some tender loving care (and in this case a lot of money) the most unlikely and ill-equipped can be enabled to succeed."
"haris_manda","10","0","2","2 April 2011"," Something refreshing
","As to young minds, this movie wasn't anything special; there was no action, no killing, actually, nothing worth watching. However, I'm not as most of the young minds, so I found something worth watching and giving 10 this movie.<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of a long movies, but this movie made me think of that. Through whole movie, I haven't even notice how much passed; I was so focused on what's going on on screen rather than when the movie will finish. It takes a lot to impress me; I do not dwell in the corner where a little thing is most satisfying, rather where only things worth smiling to are smiled to. I must also say that I wasn't much of a fan of Sandra so far, but her acting in this movie was really amazing. What I like most is a plot. Plot was written almost perfectly, as plot should always be written, no matter what. It's a life drama, uncommon to the world because of the people's grief; however, it's refreshing to see that there are, out there, still people who fight for justice and who want to change the world.<br/><br/>But, the best of all was Quinton Aaron. As an actor I've never heard of before, he really amazed me with his performance. Not just that it was stunning, but it was true; it was like he IS living the story - it was the way all actors should act. I've liked mix of comedy and drama, some scenes that shows us what life really is and yet some to show us that what we saw isn't totally true. Of course, all actors did their roles, but Sandra and Quinton as Anne and Michael did stunning job. I've never seen such a chemistry between two people that aren't in love, that aren't actually related to each other in any other way that just knowing each other, I like the moment when Michael says ""I don't like to be called Big Mike"" - it really shows how is he closed within himself - that nobody actually knew that he does not like to be called Big Mike. Or the moment he says ""I thought I'm already part of this family""<br/><br/>It is really hard to put some scenes before others because I think that movie wouldn't be what is without every scene in it. <br/><br/>Hopefully I did not spoil anything. And, I actually don't understand why does this movie have such a low rating - yes, 7.6 is low. It is much better than Dark Knight, Ineception or whatever. Looks like people prefer fantasy and crime above truth and reality. And we wonder why are we at place we are."
"MartinHafer","8","0","1","29 March 2011"," Inspiring and sweet
","This is a can't-miss family movie. After all, EVERYONE seems to like inspiring family films--especially when it's based on real people. And, not surprisingly, I had a thoroughly good time watching it--though I do recommend you see it with a box of Kleenex nearby.<br/><br/>The film is about a young man named Michael Oher--an extremely large black teenager who has bounced from home to home in the foster care system. Currently, he's in a new school and no one realizes that he has no place to live. Yet in spite of having a crack-addicted mother, a father who was killed in prison and every other reason to be an angry powder keg, he's a very gentle and sad soul---who is also enormous and has amazing potential to play football.<br/><br/>A nosy but very nice lady (Sandra Bullock) convinces her husband (Tim McGraw) to bring Michael home...at least for the night. But this one night turns into a permanent living situation and he becomes an important part of the family. However, despite this new living arrangement working out well, Michael is so far behind in school and his GPA so low that he hasn't a prayer to play football in college. That's because although many schools are now offering him athletic scholarships, his GPA is too low to allow him to accept these offers. So, with his new family's help, perhaps he can pull up those grades and have a future.<br/><br/>This film is super-inspirational and sweet--mostly because it's true. I am sure that some poetic license was taken when making the film (I especially wonder if the little brother could be THIS precocious and adorable), but overall they did a good job of sticking reasonably close the facts. While I loved Sandra Bullock's performance (she's great as usual), I was a bit surprised that she received Oscar for it--I did see a few performances in other films that year that I thought were a bit better (such as the leading young lady in ""Precious""). Also, Tim McGraw, while a lesser role in the film, did a surprisingly good job--especially as he's really known as a country singer, not an actor. All around, a very good film and one that is meant to inspire."

","The movie The Blind Side is a true story about a homeless teenager named Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) who is taken in by the Tuohy family. The Tuohy family consists of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw), Collins Tuohy (Lily Collins), and S.J. Tuohy (Jae Head). Michael Oher goes by the name of ""Big Mike"" and is from the ""projects"". He is the son of a drug addicted mother and a father in which he does not remember. Michael Oher is a homeless teenager with very little clothes so he has to spend his nights trying to find a place to sleep.<br/><br/>Towards the beginning he is walking to a gym in which it is warm so he will be able to sleep. While going to the gym Leigh Anne Tuohy and her family are leaving from a play and she sees him walking without adequate clothing and in turn stops to ask what he is doing. He tells her what his plans are about staying in the gym and then she tells him to get in the car as he is able to go and stay with them for the night. That night then turns into days and eventually into him being adopted by the Tuohys. Michael Oher has no records available and has never really done too good in school.<br/><br/>The Tuohy family is portrayed as high class republicans and a very Christian family and they also put on a persona as they might be better than everyone else. That is what I thought in the beginning because of their BMW's and their huge house but it turns out that they are a nice and loving family that only wants what is best for their kids.<br/><br/>Big Mike is enrolled in a private school in which he then begins to get a great education and is later introduced to football. Through football he is able to keep his mind right and figure out what he is wanting out of his life. He is so good at football that every college in the nation wants him to come and play for them, but he is hindered by one thing and that is his grades. Over time he gets his grades up way beyond what was needed for him to be eligible for scholarships. Acquiring the grades needed was the first hurdle as the NCAA was doing an investigation because he had decided on a school to attend that the Tuohys were affiliated with. The NCAA just wanted to make sure that he was not forced and or paid to choose that school.<br/><br/>With the Tuohys allowing Michael to stay at their house for that one night changed not only his life but theirs as well as they had seen that they were able to help him to basically get off of the street. The hard work that Michael and the Tuohy family put into him allowed him to excel in the classroom as well as on the football field eventually leading him to being drafted in the 1st Round of the NFL Draft by the Baltimore Ravens.<br/><br/>Two techniques used in The Blind Side are angle and sound. When I mention angle I am talking about how the camera would be angled during football practice as well as the football games themselves. As a viewer of the film it made it seem like I was right on the football field for every hit and play. The sound inside of The Blind Side quietly helped in the film especially the background voices of the other students that were making fun of ""Big Mike"" as well as on the football field with the grunts and the sheer groans of pain.<br/><br/>The acting in The Blind Side was very good. I thought that the cast was a great fit for this film as they all played their intricate roles in developing the story and the theme of the movie. The Blind Side is not only a sports movie but it's an inspirational movie for everyone showing that anything is possible just as long as you believe in yourself and others."

","The Blindside is a true story based on the life of a once homeless teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) affectionately known as ""Big Mike"" who was an all-American high an all-American high school football player who in 2009 was the first round pick for the Baltimore Ravens. Michael grew up in the inner city projects of Memphis, Tennessee to a drug addicted mother and a father that he never knew. Having being removed from his mother's home by Children's services and bounced around from foster home to foster home Michael opts to sleep on a friend's couch every night. On the opposite side of town Leigh Ann Touhy(Sandra Bullock) and husband Sean Touhy(Tim McGraw) seem to have the perfect life and the children everyone adores (Lily Collins and Jae Head). One cold winter night the Touhy's are on their way home and see ""Big Mike "" walking in the brutal cold to the school gym where he sleeps at night , Leigh Ann demands her husband to pull over so she can assist the young man. The Toughy's provide ""Big Mike"" with room and board, which makes uncomfortable because he is not use to the reality of a functional, loving family since he came from a broken home. Eventually ""Big Mike ""becomes a part of the Touhy family and begins to open up more and express his feelings, where he was once shy and introverted. Leigh Ann introduces Michael to the game of football, in which he has no interests because he was unable to follow the game or its rules until Leigh Ann explains the game to him and what his role on the football field is. From this point, Michael becomes a valuable player to his team and a n opportunity presents itself for Michael to play at the university level, however his grades were not up to par so the Touhy's hire Michael a tutor Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) who helps him excel tremendously in his academics. In the mean time, Michael's has soared academically and three major universities want him to play football for their school so he must make a very challenging decision and he does. He chooses to attend the college where Sean was a football player and Leigh Ann was a cheerleader, this causes a tad bit of controversy being that many people thought he was forced by the Touhy's to attend their Alma Mater for their personal gain. After questioning, Leigh Ann about his decision to attend her former university Michael now realizes that he is a part of the Touhy family and that they love him unconditionally. The Blindside is a definite family must see and proves that we can all succeed in life no matter what the circumstances if we put our mind to it, stay committed and focused."

","I just saw this for the first time last night (yes, we are WAY behind) and I really liked it. I think it is one of those movies that makes you examine your own life and makes you feel so incredibly lucky. I have to say that I cried A LOT. I just kept thinking about how many other kids are out there living through similar situations and how many people COULD be helping, but aren't and it all culminated into a very emotional evening for me. My only real complaint was the music. During the first football game scene I felt like the music could have been a little more upbeat and it would have been nice if it had been a song that's well-known or something. It just didn't really get me excited for the game, the way MOST football movies do. Come to think of it, the music through-out the whole movie was like that... Other than that, the movie was really great and I think everyone should see it...then go out and do something nice for someone! lol"

","I guess you just can't win with some movie goers. I'm reading the negative comments on this film, and it appears that many reviewers find the story just too completely unbelievable, to the point of being racist. Some even decry the story as being totally unrealistic, even a fictional piece of work. I guess it never occurred to some of these folks that this was a true story, and one that occurred not that long ago. Michael Oher is a real person now playing pro football, and it's his story that's generally well documented in ""The Blind Side"". I'm not saying that the picture is a cinematic masterpiece, but when it comes to chronicling good Christian values, no, make that good HUMAN values, how is the story to be considered a piece of crap, which is what some of the milder flame throwers are calling it. You know, I want to be as positive as I can be about where this country and this world is headed down the road, but when something as All-American as extending a helping hand to a fellow human being is derided in popular culture, I have to rethink my premises. You want the world to be a better place, try living your life like the Touhy's. If you prefer seeing it as an arena for deriding your fellow man and questioning the motive behind every good deed, then be a movie critic."

","I have seen this film 2 times now and each time it managed to put a smile on my face, i have only just got up from watching this with my entire family, ages ranging from 14-76. I can honestly tell you that not one person in that room would have rated it other than 10. Heres a few reasons why: Sandra Bullock did play her part amazingly well but in truth all of the actors seemed to fit and everything just feels quite natural and they support each other fantastically.<br/><br/>The story flows quite quickly but at a pace which i think fits ( you would have to watch the film to truly understand this comment) The occasional one liners that help to disperse the drama and keep a smile on everyones face without making the film seem to corny.<br/><br/>The actual plot is truly inspiring but i don't want to ruin it for you, i can say that only the most steel hearted of people would struggle to feel something.<br/><br/>The so called ""negatives"" I have noticed many people talking about stereotyping and the poor portrayal of ethnic groups etc. However this is a True story, so how can the story be unrealistic? As for the stereotyping well some of that surely must have come from Michael Oher in which case its not stereotyping but in fact what he saw through his eyes. Some say he is portrayed as a dumb child in need of white Christian aid, when in fact it is quite clearly stated by one of the teachers that he is actually intelligent but just shy. Surely he must have signed off on this book and how he must have seen himself? I would strongly recommend you to watch this film yourself and see your own reaction to it whether it be a simple smile or a sense of inspiration."

","The Blind Side is a movie about a boy who has nothing and a Christian family who helps him gain more than just material. Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron was a boy headed down all the wrong roads, and not because he chose to but because he had no other option. He was going to school every day and then pretty much living out of the school for the most part. One night the Tuohy family noticed Michael walking down the street and had at this time figured out that Michael was homeless. Leigh Ann Touhy the mother played by Sandra Bullock insists on giving him a place to stay. From that moment on the family had grown to love Michael, and his ways. They learned that he was traumatized as a child and has a keen sense of security when it comes to people that he loves.<br/><br/>In my opinion the theme of this movie is that you should never ever judge a book by its cover. This may sound so clichÃ© in many ways, but if it wasn't for the Tuohy family who would have known what would have came from Michael, they had compassion for others and they seen something in him that many other hadn't even thought to stop and analyze. They kept faith in Michael and because of that he became a big star athlete down the road.<br/><br/>Another theme I caught was never under estimate the silent ones. They are silent but deadly. And this deadly isn't the deadly as in harmful, but he can ""hold his own"". Michael was a traumatized boy and obviously grown a sense of how to protect his self. As he began to play football the guys on other teams looked at him as he was a joke, they later found out that the names they called him soon ticked him off and he used that to climb his way to the top and become one of the best football players out there.<br/><br/>As mentioned above it said that Michael Oher was a traumatized boy, I feel like this was a thematic idea for the fact that it reoccurs throughout the movie, sometimes in good ways and in bad ways. There was one scene when Michael went back to his old house and all these bad men where there, they obviously knew him through his mom, but they kept saying these vulgar things of his mom and then turned on him, something clicked in him and he just went off and used his protective instincts from being traumatized. Also another time was when he was in the football game which was mentioned above. That was mainly for the good.<br/><br/>Well, initially I feel like this movie gives people hope and faith that they can do what they want with their lives. Within the theme it also shows that inner strength comes from courage. I would also like to say that not everyone is selfish. There are some good people out there, and when you find these people don't take advantage of them, respect the fact that they are helping you."

","I like this movie because it was about a football player, Big Mike, who was really good. I used to play football, and I like how realistic the football scenes where depicted. The movie is about a young kid who lived in a bad neighborhood where gangs were. There were also a lot of people selling drugs. The neighborhood influenced Big Mike by teaching him the bad way to live. He really didn't have a family and a woman saw him walking down the street so she wanted to help him by taking Big Mike into their family. She taught him the right way to live and got him interested in football. Big Mike started a new life and became a professional football player. The best thing about this movie I liked was how good the acting was. The characters were really believable and the plot was really well crafted.<br/><br/>Robert Dickson<br/><br/>The movie ""Blind Side"" is a sad story with a happy ending, a life- changing and inspiring movie. This movie can make you laugh and cry at the same time. This is also a movie that you'll watch more than once.<br/><br/>Micheal is a homeless boy with no family to support him, maybe only one outfit and never has had any education. Micheal sleeps on the couch of a friend's when he gets the chance to. Micheal's friend who lets him sleep on the couch takes him to a Christian college to enroll Micheal. The guy also mentions that Micheal is very good at sports, so that's another reason to enroll him. Micheal gets accepted in the school and meets a little boy that he becomes friends with. Micheal struggles with the school work the teachers give him. The little boy's mother gave Micheal a home and adopted him.<br/><br/>In the movie the antagonist would be the people and family around Micheal's old neighbor hood where he was raised. These people tried to get him in the drug business and to drink beer. Micheal did the right thing in the end though.<br/><br/>The protagonist in the movie is Micheal because after he gets helped he really try's hard and keeps it up. Micheal never does anything bad or anything to hurt anyone. He also watches out for his new family and takes care of them, like they take care of him.<br/><br/>This movie is very heart-warming and would inspire you every time you watched it.

","The Blind Side is a true life film about a young black man, wonderfully played by Quinton Aaron. This man, Michael Oher was born into a difficult family situation but today, lives a life polar opposite of the one he could have ended up living. This is all due to the love and compassion of one woman; Leigh Ann Tuohy brilliantly played by Sandra Bullock. Sean Tuohy is played by Tim McGraw and Miss Sue, Michaels tutor, is played by Kathy Bates. Considering that Michael Oher was born in a rough part of Memphis Tn., his mother is a drug addict and his father is absent it seems that Michael has all opportunities to become like so many of his neighborhood friends. Michael could do drugs, steal, and/or become a gang member. There is something in Michael that pulls him away from that sort of lifestyle. Michael has perseverance and honor. He keeps trying to ""do life"" on his own; sleeping where he can, and doing laundry on someone else's dime, until someone comes along and gives him a better opportunity to do something with his life. Michael has honor and protective instincts he honors his mother no matter how bad her choice of lifestyle is. She is still his mother and he wants to be with her. He wants to protect her. Leigh Ann is very compassionate when she meets Michael's biological mother. She feels her pain as well as she can considering their opposite lifestyles. Michael continued his education in the home of the Tuohy's. When he got there, his GPA was barely on the scale; when he left the Tuohy's home, it was because he had worked so hard (with the help of Miss Sue) and received a scholarship to Ole Miss. Kathy Bates is wonderful as his tutor. The Blind Side is similar to ""Remember the Titans"" starring Denzel Washington, in the fact that they are both based on true stories about young men, football and racism. When you watch The Blind Side, you will feel like you are right there in Michael's head when he has flashbacks regarding the day he was taken from his mother. Even though the scene around him is total chaos like when he goes back to his old neighborhood and gets in a scuffle with one of his acquaintances. They pull back in the scene so that you can see Michael among all of the chaos just after the scuffle and then see his memories of being ripped from his mothers grasp. In the present scene, the screams of the women and children enhance his despair and the sounds of their cries demonstrate what he is going through in his flashback. This movie is proof positive that even if you are born into diverse conditions that if you have perseverance, honor and courage that you can change your destiny."

Michael meets the Tuohy's and his life takes a change for the good. Leigh Ann Tuohy, has a heart of gold, and decides to take Michael in as one of her own. This movie shows us that even when the odds are against us, we can overcome the adversities of our lives. This movie was well written and shows one man's struggles and the triumph he received because of one families love for him. This is not your ordinary football movie. This movie is one man's story from poverty and despair to a life of greatness on the field. Michael Oher started out with a less than average education level to becoming a great wide receiver. Leigh Ann Tuohy, a mother of two decides to take in a strange boy who had no one else in his corner. She shows him love and provides him the same benefits she gives her children. Michael for so many years had been passed along in school with no one really caring or showing an interest in him. From the lighting in this movie to the sounds, you get the feel for being at the game. This movie reminds you much of Remember the Titans, where a team faces all types of adversities only to triumph in the end."

The story features a group of football coaches playing themselves during the recruiting segment. It is based upon Michael Lewis 2006 novel. <br/><br/>It is interesting that this story uses politics to base most of its humor. The humor stereotypes the no-no topic of black men with white women & then adds a social comment about the kids at school making fun of the white Republican family with the adopted black son. It is necessary to do this because of the way the true story happened though it is treated like this is still a social taboo? That might be true in the area this movie takes place, but that taboo has been shattered in many areas of this country many years ago now. <br/><br/>Still, I guess it enhances the story because it helps provide a more vivid image to the background Michael Oher grew up in. It makes it easier for Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) to look like someone above the fray, willing to bring a disadvantaged young black man into her family & come off looking better than others. Since it appears the real Tuohy family is Republican, this is a great way to attempt too poke fun at both parties on this issue. One thing it does do real well, it shows how Football Coaches are sometimes out of touch with their players.<br/><br/>The movie comes off though I think the viewer might be better off taking time too read the Michael Lewis book in order to get a better perspective on what the reality of the story is. This one is obviously cleaned up from the reality in order to keep a moderate PG-13 rating. This reflects Hancocks Disney roots. This keeps it close to a warm fuzzy family film.<br/><br/>Still, the movie preserves the message of creating hope for those with out it. Bullock's character dominates the film, hence the academy award. Everyone in the cast does well with the script they are given & Quinton Aaron deserves a lot of credit in how he plays Oher. He portrays a troubled & despaired young man very well. You can almost see his inner struggles in the performance."

","The standout of the film was defiantly Sandra Bullock and she rightly so deserved an Oscar award. I think that she really became her character and its amazing to see a comedic actress playing such an intense role and i think thats why her performance was so highly praised. The film itself is a very wholesome and clean film. There is nothing offencive in this film which is also why i highly rated this film. The characters were substantial: like Michael (Big Mike)who played a young broken man being mended by Sandra Bullocks family (especially her son S.J) I think this film really shows the good there is in the world and especially because Bullocks character was a Christian so it shows Christians in a positive light which is a great bonus. You really connected and cared for the characters which is what i loved about the film and it kept you engaged in what was taking place. Worth the watch and enjoy!"

This is not a fancy fairytale its a true fairytale story which happens because someone gives another person a chance to realize their true potential.A definite must-watch movie which you can go back to from time to time to realize what human potential is all about disregarding social status, race or any other social hurdles in life.<br/><br/>All actors deserve praise for their acting.

You will love the transformation ""Big Mike"" undergoes as he goes from lost both in the streets and in life, found by the Tuohys, taken in, enrolled at the Christian school, educated there (where he learns the game of football), tutored by Kathy Bates, and taught about life. We also learn about his old life, with his old neighborhood friends and mother. I loved his Friday night game debut scene. Controversy ensues as he makes his choice of colleges.

","What a fantastic and heart warming story The Blind Side is! It's based on the true story of Michael Oher. Michael had no advantages as he grew up with his drug addicted mother. When the story begins he's homeless and is taken in by the very kind and giving Tuohy's. Michael has few skills and appeared to have a bleak future before meeting the Tuohys. The Tuohys support Michael in every way as Leigh Anne, played by Sandra Bullock, spends caring time with Michael and helps him grow and expresses his interests. They even hire a tutor for Michael.<br/><br/>I've always loved watching Sandra Bullock act and she didn't disappoint as she earned the Best Actress Oscar in this very convincing performance. She plays the incredibly charitable, nice and yet strong willed Leigh Anne. And in the movie Leigh Anne is definitely a handful. This was a standout performance you'll love to see."

SJ was the cutest kid and added some humor. The story is based on a real person, Michael Oher, whom was helped out by a rich white family when he didn't have anyone. They helped him get a college scholarship and he just happened to turn out to be a really good football player. He also became part of their family.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Watch it.

"MBunge","9","0","3","7 September 2010"," It will reaffirm your faith in humanity. Seriously.
","The Blind Side is fairly unusual for an entertaining film in that it succeeds as much for what it doesn't do as for what it does. This movie could have become something truly, insultingly, patronizingly offensive. Instead, it became a wonderful tale of love and human decency.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, it's about Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a gigantic and homeless black teenager who gets taken in by a rich white family, the Tuohy's, who turn his life around and help him become a great football player. Imagine what the old sitcom Different Strokes would have been like if little Arnold (Gary Coleman) had been 6'5'', 300 pounds and stoic and that's the basic idea of The Blind Side. Michael Oher is a good young man who is lifted out of a world of abandonment, poverty and crime. First because a football coach at a expensive private school wants Oher for the team and then because the wealthy Tuohy family opens their home and hearts to him.<br/><br/>The primary angel in Oher's life is steely Southern belle Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), who brings him into her family. In the beginning, it's almost like Oher is a stray dog that Leigh Anne is taking pity on. She doesn't think through any of the consequences of what she's doing or where it's going to lead. Leigh Anne just sees someone in need and tries to help, never expecting it to result in her gaining a new, black and enormous son. Bullock is great here. It might be the best performance she's ever given or ever will give.<br/><br/>Tim McGraw is also very good as Leigh Anne's husband. He's a little more practical about letting Oher into their lives, but knows he can't dissuade his fierce wife when she sets her mind on something. Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher also shines in a deceptively difficult role. Stumbling out of a world of emotional trauma, Oher is not at all an expressive or dynamic character. Quite realistically, he's impassive and somewhat willfully blank to the terrible things that have happened to him. Aaron manages to make him a genuine person and not a bad knock off of Lennie from ""Of Mice and Men"".<br/><br/>The plot is very predictable but just manages to not insult the audience's intelligence. There's both some funny and poignant dialog and the direction has a very nice pace that neither hurries nor drags. Writer/director John Lee Hancock has taken a touching true story and made a touching motion picture out of it.<br/><br/>However, whether it's based on real life or not, having a young black man essentially rescued from the horrors of the black underclass by some rich white folks raises a lot of uncomfortable questions. Questions about race. Questions about economics. Questions about education, opportunity, white guilt, black cultural dysfunction and the list goes on and on and on. It would have been extraordinarily easy for The Blind Side to be unwatchably smarmy, condescending, preachy, manipulative and squirmingly fake. It avoids any of that by avoiding asking any of those uncomfortable questions. Viewing this film will remind you such questions exist, but it neither offers any answers nor asks the audience to come up with any. This movie isn't trying to make any broader social point. It's just tells us about a time when some good people did the right thing because it was the right thing to do and it all worked out incredibly well.<br/><br/>I liked The Blind Side a great deal and my mom liked it even more than I did. It'll make you glad you're a member of the human race, which is a pretty amazing thing."

","The Blind Side is without a doubt the best movie produced. When i watched this movie for the first time it automatically became my favorite movie. Seeing Sandra bullock, playing the role of Leigh Anne Touhy was amazing! Sandra Bullock is such an outstanding actor and she fit the role perfectly. This film was fantastic, to see such a headstrong lady along with her family adopt a neglected and out of place teenager was very inspiring. I feel that the acting was phenomenal and that the actors deserve some major credit. There wasn't a slow part in the entire movie and it really made a lot of good points. The point that really came across to me was that if you see someone struggling, you can be that persons hero all by helping them out and believing in them. This can make a huge difference on that one person, knowing that somebody actually cares about them and will take the time to support them. You won't believe the impact it will have on you after seeing this movie. I think this movie had solid points and it had a very inspirational message behind it."
"honorhorror","9","0","2","30 August 2010"," Reminds me of lyrics of Amazing Grace.
","The Blind Side has been marketed as an Encouragement movie in Asia, and many Oriental audiences clearly have this message received that the movie is praising USA for having the best education system that inspired equality, humanity, etc..<br/><br/>While in my opinion, this movie very much reminded me of the lyrics of Amazing Grace, that ""through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come"". Just like the beginning of the movie, this story is not about encouragement of success, but about the predicaments. Compared to his friends in the same block, Michael Oher is a rare case that he didn't bounce into others' surviving logics of violence and pride, though he's totally homeless and hopeless. Yet, I can't imagine if I were him when the Tuohy family accepted him into the house, how hard would I work and behave to win their approval. Very luckily, Michael Oher wasn't me. Out of some stubbornness of holding true to his own feelings, his heart leads him to choose otherwise again and again, thus unfolded this story beautifully.<br/><br/>Note that the Tuohy family wasn't the first family to shelter Oher. The P.E. teacher's beautiful reasoning got him into the school in the first place, and the warm-hearted Big Tony also gave him a place to stay. But, as the movie showed us, you can love but you can't enforce it. Both the decision of the school and the decision of Big Tony were pushed decisions. It can all end up ""let somebody else be Christian about him"". In 2 Corinthians 9:7, it says ""each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."" Guess it applies here. Our actions, especially those in the name of charity, usually starts as a delightful little touch of love and mercy, and dies in the name of responsibility. Oher wrote a sad essay ""White Walls"", indicating that the stakeholders around him all did their parts pretty hard though their ""hard"" and ""best"" is not enough. Yet, God didn't knock on each of their foreheads saying ""you are not treating Oher well enough!"" Instead, God inspired a family that actually can do better and really have a vision for a life with Michael Oher. With 3 sentences, Leigh Anne Tuohy invited this unknown and possibly dangerous factor into their house. These 3 sentences are, ""Why are you going to the gym?"" ""Do you have any place to stay?""""Don't you dare lie to me!"" They don't even sound kind enough as invitation, yet they are out of a woman's love, so personally, so honest and powerful.<br/><br/>And that started this marathon test for this woman's love. The first time, it was because the 10000$ coach has been ruined by Oher's massive body. But, Leigh Anne just said, ""Do you want to stay here?"" The second time, it was gossips from Leigh Anne's reference group, who are at least as rich as her. They questioned her generosity was out of some ""white guilty thing"" and pointing out Collins (the daughter of Leigh Anne) might become a sex victim of the massive Michael Oher. Mrs. Tuohy only said ""shame on you"" to those gossipers, but she didn't hesitate to ask about her daughter's feeling either. The third time was the car accident which Michael was mainly responsible. Again the pressure was on Leigh Anne as the public doubted her love for this boy, but she bravely ignored the public and comforted her boy. The fourth timeÂ…... It never ended, and it never will. That makes me envy the USA system and USA culture, but oops, if their system and culture are so perfect that love grows out of ground just by itself, why do Michael and Leigh Anne have to overcome so many prejudices and bitterness? I think, questioned to the end, system can't love, and despite many schools made biblical quotes their motto, system surely can't do anything in Jesus name. If a system can admit Oher into the school out of Christian duty, then this system can also dismiss Oher from the school logically, fairly, systematically in Jesus name. And anyone not completely ignorant would see the fact that nothing would be achieved in this way.<br/><br/>We are creatures living in a machine, but I believe we are not machines. ""Don't you dare lie to me"" again was heard near the end of the movie. In the name of fair and righteousness the system questioned all that Tuohys had done for Michael. This is a reasonable doubt that the Tuohys loved Michael so much only because they are boosters of their university. It's the toughest test for Leigh Anne so far, and for the first time in the movie she couldn't find a way to instantly cope with it. She feared that Michael can run away and never come back. Finally, it's Leigh Anne's leap of faith to tell Michael that ""it's your decision, you life"", that again allowed their love to triumph over doubts. See? The system has to stay neutral to be fair and functional. And, if the system has to assume we humans are also only machines, I guess it's our duty to prove otherwise. That would require a continuous dedication and courage to come through many dangers, toils and snares. And the only way to do that as I have come to know is to believe. I surely hope that my fellow audiences don't only draw their conclusions of this movie on Dale Carnegie's books and theories, but also listen to Amazing Grace, that ""It is grace that brought me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home."""

","Leigh Anne Tuohy (Bullock) was a force of nature in this film. Her husband and family tread very warily in her presence. You could see her husband, Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw), carefully considering what supportive position would earn the most favor before he dared give it utterance. Only her son S J was able to bend her will to his by the most artful of manipulation. That boy had her down cold, after mastering his mother, college football coaches were putty in his hands.<br/><br/>Michael Oher was a homeless black teenager barely coping with survival. He was a very sensitive young man despite his enormous size and strength. He only kept his sanity by blocking out almost all the horrid things in his past. This withdrawal made him very difficult to read by everyone he encountered. Strangers seeing his great physical prowess and knowing something of his past assumed the worst about his character.<br/><br/>Leigh Anne had no clue about the nature of the strange young man she gave shelter one night. Since he was so different, she decided to let him reveal his character by asking him how he felt about his situation and how he wanted to be treated. Michael slowly started coming out of his shell under Leigh Anne's relentless questioning.<br/><br/>S J was the first family member to bond with Michael. That was enough to encourage Leigh Anne to make the effort for the rest of the family. Once Leigh Anne had accepted Michael, no force on Earth was going to prevent her success in turning his life around. Michael really would have been destroyed by his awful situation if not for the intervention of Leigh Anne!<br/><br/>I have not felt so uplifted by a film in ages. There really are some very wonderful people in this world. Once in a while the forces of darkness are cheated of a victim. I know, I know, the film glosses over or ignores a great deal to fit its time frame. Still, the effort is superb and well worth watching again and again."

"hall895","7","0","1","10 August 2010"," Not great but good enough
","The Blind Side is another one of those inspirational sports movies we've seen time and again. Football is the sport of choice this time as we follow the more or less true story of Michael Oher. His story is a remarkable one, a thoroughly compelling life's journey. And this movie, while nothing spectacular, does an adequate job of telling that story. What we ultimately end up with is a movie that's just entertaining enough to get by. The best sports movies have a crackling energy to them which drives the story forward. This movie, with its leisurely pace, lacks that element. Some might say that is because it's really not a sports movie at all. It's a movie about life that just happens to have some football in it. Maybe so but the movie still cries out for some excitement along the way. You may like this movie. But it's not one of those movies that makes you want to jump out of your chair and cheer. It's inspiring but in a more subtle fashion than one might expect. The movie works but it probably could have worked better.<br/><br/>The movie tells the by now familiar story of Michael Oher's rise from a life of poverty, neglect and misery to football stardom. The story's obvious hook is that of the troubled black teen being taken in, and ultimately adopted, by a wealthy white family. A fascinating true story, one recounted pretty faithfully here by the filmmakers. A few things from the real life story have been tweaked to give the movie a little added drama but that's the way the movie business works. And the movie could use the extra drama because if there is any one failing here it is that this great story at times comes across as being a little mundane. It's that troubling lack of energy, the movie really could use a little more pep in its step.<br/><br/>This is the Michael Oher story but the movie's star is of course Sandra Bullock playing Michael's adopted mother Leigh Anne Tuohy. It's a very good, strong-willed performance by Bullock. Nothing about the performance which absolutely screams out Oscar but there's certainly no reason to begrudge her the award. Like the movie itself you may hesitate to label her performance great but it's more than good enough. Quinton Aaron plays Michael and you kind of wish he was given more to do. He does well with what he's given to work with but there are long stretches of the movie where his character is essentially mute and appears rather bewildered. Michael Oher is often shunted to the background in the movie which purports to tell his life story. It's Bullock as Leigh Anne who's really at the heart of everything going on.<br/><br/>While Bullock is definitely pushed front and center there is room for some other performers to make an impression. Lily Collins and Jae Head are very good in portraying the Tuohy children, with Head in particular having some memorable moments. Tim McGraw is solid if unspectacular as Leigh Anne's husband Sean, spending most of his time reacting to or getting out of the way of Bullock. Kathy Bates, Kim Dickens and Ray McKinnon do well with their respective supporting roles. And of course there's Big Mike himself. On the rare occasions Aaron is allowed to come out of his shell he's a revelation. And he does a great job in making his character utterly sympathetic, so easy to root for. But in the end, for better or worse, it's Bullock's movie. She carries it well enough to make the movie work. But you're left with the nagging sense the movie probably should have been a little better. Ultimately you're satisfied but not thrilled. It's a sports movie which comes out a winner by the slimmest of margins."

","The Blind Side stars Sandra Bullock as mum Leigh Anne Tuohy and her husband Sean Tuohy played by Tim McGraw who take in a young black lad Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron who lives in a rundown neighbourhood with his mum whose is on drugs and he himself who struggles at school but is great at sports. Leigh and Sean spot Quinton out at night in the rain and take him in. Here he gets a better life as the Tuohy's live in a large house and end up treating him like their own son with the mother of Michael who lets her son go. From here the Tuohy's encourage Micheal to be more confident in himself and help him improve his grades at school and encourage him to pursue American football as he wants to enter the NFL professionally.<br/><br/>This is similar to Clint Eastwood's Invictus of telling a true story and being inspirational, the difference is there wasn't enough for me with Invictus, but The Blind Side is a different story. My dad took me to see this at the cinema and I wasn't expecting to like it much, but I kept an open mind and settled in my seat with my popcorn and drink and within fifteen minutes I was engrossed so much I forgot I had popcorn or that I was even at the cinema! This is the movie Invictus should have been. The viewer is taken on a fascinating journey of love, sadness and inspiration. Sandra Bullock for me has always been a good actress but one that never really stood out from the crowd, but she deserved her Oscar for this. Her acting was absolutely outstanding, it was nothing short of sensational, other actors like Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates as Michael's home tutor give good support and Quinton Aaron, though he dosen't speak much, he had a child-like innocence and charm that won me over.<br/><br/>I was kept gripped by the whole 130 minutes of this movie and at the end it was one of those rare movies that I hated to see end.

"nedal_08","Null","0","1","31 July 2010"," Blind Side theme
","When I first sat down to watch this movie I thought not another sports movie. But this movie was more than sports. It's theme is basically that we must help the people in need and that need guidance. This movie showed me how much a few actions by a good person can change another person's life dramatically. An example of the theme being portrayed in this film was when Leigh Ann saw Michael walking alone in the cold she picked him up and offered him a place to stay. This showed that Leigh Ann is the type of person to help those in need. Another example of the theme is the scene at the end of the movie when Michael is drafted to play for the Baltimore Ravens. This shows that because of the positive influences of the Tuoy's Michael's life has changed. He went from being a homeless teenager to being a soon to be profession football player and millionaire.<br/><br/>There were a few main actors in this movie. The actors and characters they played were: Quinton Aaron-Michael Oher, Sandra Bullock- Leigh Anne Tuohy, Tim McGraw- Sean Tuohy, Jae Head-SJ Tuohy, Lily Collins-Collins Tuohy, and Ray McKinnon-Coach Burt Cotton. This movie was about a homeless teenager named Michael Oher. He father ran off when he was a baby and his mother was a crack head. He keeps moving from foster home to foster home and always ends up running away. He ends up going to a private school where he meets SJ. One day after a holiday festival while on the way home SJ's mother notices Michael walking alone in the cold. SJ's mother Leigh Anne offers him a place to stay. After that she offers him a room in the house. Being do good people the Touy's help change Michael's life. The Touhy's help Michael achieve academic strength and strength on the field ultimately giving him a chance to play college football and gain an education an opportunity that was once in a lifetime. There were a few techniques that the director used to get the theme across. One technique was motifs. One idea that the director wanted to get across is that you should help one in need, and all throughout the movie the Touhy's help Michael many time when he is in need. Another technique used in this movie was lighting. Usually when it was a scene that had a lot to do with the theme the lighting would change during that scene to sow the intensity. Overall this movie turned out to be a very interesting movie. I liked that Michael came out on top at the end. Overall I think the theme was expressed all throughout the movie. The movie did a good job of portraying the theme in a easy to understand way. So overall this was a very good film."

","Well what can I say? Surprised me in all levels. To start with, technically this movie is great. Perfectly transparent cinematographic style that does not distract. I watched it in 1080p HD and that was great too. Then there is the story telling. I believe all good movie whether it is Batman or the Godfather is all about story telling. This movie tells a very true story and an unexaggerated story too. Never does it seem overly Hollywood. Being from UK and knowing nothing about ""Football"" as Americans wrongly like to call it, I still throughly enjoyed it. For that reason I recommend this movie to anyone and it is well worth the time. Reminded me of the movie In Pursuit of Happiness. In some ways this movie is much better. One thing I noticed as I was about to write this review is no one mentioned the sister's role (Collins) in this movie. I thought she was fantastic. Hardly did she have any thing much to say, but she communicated volumes though her expressions, body language etc. I am sure she has been spotted by other film makers. Sandra Bullock is a blond Republican. Exciting as that may be for some, I really was warmed by her role. Judging from the photos of the real Mrs Tuohy I think Sandra Bullock needed to bring her best screen presence forward to portray an overtly strong real-life character. The kid is another great performer. The main character Mike played by Aaron carries the story perfectly well resulting in a memorable movie experience. Even the role played by Kathy Bates blends in well. Good to watch with family."

","I like movies and my favorite genre is drama and documentary. I watched the movie 'Blind side' without hesitation because it is human drama which is based on a true story.<br/><br/>For me, Blind side was like a hot chocolate in cold winter day. This movie is filled with warmhearted humanity, courage and love. I laughed, contemplated and was moved to tears.<br/><br/>The director is John Lee Hancock who directed the movie Rookie, in 2002. Rookie is also a sports drama, especially baseball. Blind side is a story of young promising American football player Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). <br/><br/>The plot sees a white family in Memphis, Tennessee. Sean (Tim McGraw) and Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) are couple and they have two children, Collins (Lily Collins) and S.J. (Jae Head). Sean is a CEO of big restaurant and Leigh Anne is a successful furniture designer so this family is quite rich. One day, Leigh Anne brings a poor homeless black teenager boy Mike(Quinton Aaron) to her home and she and her family accept and support him. Leigh Anne helps him to show and improve his ability as a football player, especially a left tackle who should protect other players in the area, the blind side.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, this movie is based on a true story so it is absolutely predictable. Acting and compacted storyline made up for this weakness instead. <br/><br/>All the actors did a good job. Tim McGraw was a tolerant and well-mannered father. The daughter Lily Collins was normal teenage girl who is looked chilly but warmhearted. The son Jae Head took a role of humor in this movie. Even the freckles on his face were so cute with his chatter. Quinton Aaron's appearance was suitable for the left tackle football player and also his job was not bad. There was one other famous actress, Kathy Bates, and her acting was great, too. <br/><br/>Most of all, Sandra Bullock did an amazing job. There are many critics about her acting and her Oscar, and even I think she is little bit lucky. This movie contains many typical 'Academy style' elements like family, American dream, human drama etc and there were no striking candidates. With these advantages, Sandra Bullock acted well. She looked like a real mother who loved her children and her smile, worry, anger and tears are understated. <br/><br/>The scenes and music was not noticeable but not bad. The scenes of football play were not exaggerated such as pausing too much. The music also takes its role honestly as a background setting. All other elements redounded to the plot, I think. <br/><br/>Some people criticize this movie and say that it looks like a folk tale or Disney, but all humans want to live with happiness. 'Happily ever after' looks old-fashioned, but nobody wants an unhappy future. Dreams come true if you really want and try. It's very common and usual saying.<br/><br/>'With us, this is possible. With god, all is possible.' This impressive sentence was the motto of the school of Mike and other two kids. Despite the religious mood, I was touched so much. I want to remember and keep it. Go and see the movie and dream of your 'Happily ever after' with Blind side."

How a nice family takes in a poor, homeless kid who is nearly starving. And how a homeless boy's life is now an inspiring football player in the NFL.<br/><br/>I'm not into football too much. I'm a Bears fan seeing as I settle in Illinois. I occasionally watch their games, though with disappointing years occurring frequently I found myself skipping most of this season.<br/><br/>In The Blind Side, Sandra Bullock is a typical mother living in Tennessee with a husband, a teenage daughter named Collins, a younger son named SJ, and soon to be, adopted eighteen-year-old Michael Oher. Oher was taken from his mother at a young age after she was on a drug arrest and his dad was killed and thrown off of a bridge. Michael Oher goes to live with the family, showing beautiful manners (like eating at the table when everyone eats in the living room) and other acts.<br/><br/>Oher often flashes back to when he was evicted from his home. When that happens, he closes his eyes because when his mom would do drugs that is what she would tell him to do. Bullock tries to help him get his life back on track, when she learns that Michael has a talent in protection. Seeing that, Bullock persuades him to go out for football as a defense player.<br/><br/>Lots of sad moments and reflections take place in this movie. The dark satire for the film works well and flows along with the movie. Sandra Bullock deserves an Academy Award for Best Dama (which I believe she is nominated for anyway). I didn't know what to expect with this. Bullock has done good things and bad things. But this will go down has one of her best.<br/><br/>Starring: Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, Quinton Aaron, and Kathy Bates. Directed by: John Lee Hancock."

","A homeless black teenager, Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) has drifted in and out of the school system for years. Then Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her husband, Sean (Tim McGraw), take him in, transforming Michael's life and theirs. With help from his new-found family, tutors and coaches, he realizes his potential as a student and football player<br/><br/>These movies are rare and beautiful. This is one of the best examples of what the kindness of the human spirit can do when it helps another person. What makes this movie that much more special is that it is a true story. This story will make you appreciate the things that really matter in life, people who love you, health and simple necessities. This movie has Oscar potential written all over it. Screenplay and directing are top notch. The casting is outstanding, down to the small characters. Sandra Bullock is at her prime and Quinton Aaron did a brilliant job delivering a struggling young man. If this movie does not win multiple Oscars I will never watch the Oscars again.<br/><br/>This is a movie to take the whole family. It is entertaining and makes you feel good. Worth watching, and tell your friends"

","Well,I expected the film would be good because i love Bullock's acting.But the film exceeded my expectations.The movie is totally awesome.Not only was Sandra Bullock's acting good but each and everyone in the film including the coach and the tutor did their performances naturally.The movie is just wonderful and makes you shed a few tear drops which actually comes out of happiness.This movie is a true story about Michael Oher.He is raised by his family with a lot of love and affection.Quinton Aaron has done an excellent job in expressing his emotions in just the exact way.His acting is brilliant in the film.But this film might be a disappointment to people who expect to see only sports in the film.There is only 1 match in the film and 1 scene goes for the training where Big Mike's younger bro trains him.Other than that the movie is plain drama along with some mystery about Mike's background where his mother(Sandra) tries to unravel his past.The movie is an emotional outburst which makes you to smile,laugh and shed a few drops of tears of happiness which I had mentioned earlier.For all those who love to see films of the drama genre ""The Blind Side"" is one of the best films to watch."

","In the movie The Blind Side, Sandra Bullock does a great job portraying Leigh Anne Tuohy, the wife of a successful fast-food entrepreneur and the mother of two children who ends up taking in a homeless teenager who also happens to be African American.<br/><br/>Although this movie has a numerous areas that are serious, Sandra doesn't disappoint in getting the audience to laugh in this movie written and directed by John Lee Hancock. <br/><br/>Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron, has a long way to go to become the football star he is today. In fact, he never even played football before meeting the Tuohy family. The Tuohy family takes him in on the first night they meet him and they end up raising Oher to become an integral part of a team as their left tackle.<br/><br/>Although this movie has a few misses in a few scenes, Hancock does a good job of getting the performances he needs out of the actors in this movie.<br/><br/>Tim McGraw plays the husband who can't tell his wife no and because of that often finds himself in Leigh Anne's shadow however there are times in the film where he makes her character seem warmer. During the first part of the film, Leigh Anne comes across as being a tough parent but finds herself going through changes and learning more about herself. The Blind Side is a movie about how a family transforms itself and not just about how Leigh Ann made Michael Oher into a football star. <br/><br/>The truly inspiring part of the movie comes after the credits start to roll as we are given a view into the life of the real Michael Oher and Tuohy family. The Blind Side is a sentimental movie that will pull on your heart strings."

","I'm not a movie buff but this one tops all the movies I've seen in a while. It stars Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy, Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy, Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher, the main character, and the son of Leigh Anne and Sean and Jae Head as SJ. The movie has a great plot filled with caring individuals who although come from different cultures, showed lots of care for each other. Leigh Anne during many moments of disappointment never stopped caring nor expressed any negative judgment for Michael and neither did her family. Throughout the movie many social issues were touched making the viewers uncomfortable at times but handled very well by all the actors. There were scenes of anger, happiness, sadness,compassion, and greed. Surprise visits of famous sports figureheads were enjoyable throughout the film as well. It's nice to see a movie once in a while that touches the heart by showing that people in today's society still care. I would put this movie in the category with the ""The Green Mile"". A story about the lives of guards on death row leading up to the execution of black man accused of child murder & rape, who has the power of faith healing and a gentle giant,played by Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey. It is obvious that Bullock, McGraw and Aaron are the leading roles in this movie but Jae Head, SJ, the son hits a home run on this one. His role was quite entertaining as he takes in Michael ""Big Mike"" as his brother, trainee,and best friend and never gives up on him. I felt this movie was good for the entire family to enjoy with great acting and a good plot from the beginning to end. This was my second time seeing the movie and just like the first time I enjoyed it and was not bored. Each segment of the movie played a significant role in the plot and if altered would have had a profound effect on the movie as a whole. The Cinematographers,Directors and Producers set the lighting just right from scene to scene to capture your attention during the moment. A great example is during the football game scene where things were not looking so good for ""Big Mike"", the producers lowered the lights to give the viewer a since of feeling alone with Mike as he filled the screen with his massive size. Most of the scenes were shot from a wide angle to capture Big Mike as well because of his size.<br/><br/>This was an absolutely delightful, heart-warming, ""happy-ending"" story. It reminded me of the good-side of humankind for a change. A great feel good movie."

","Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy, who took the destitute Michael Oher under her wing. I certainly found ""The Blind Side"" to be worth seeing. Maybe not the ultimate masterpiece, but it is one that I would recommend. Criticism that I read about the movie is that it depicts a white family heroically helping an African-American. Well, even if that is the case, it's still an important story.<br/><br/>Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) grew up in foster homes in Memphis, always running away. When he got sent to a Christian school, he met Sean, whose mother Leigh Anne allowed him to stay in the house. On the tests, Michael scores in the 98th percentile in protective instincts, and it's clear that football is his talent. But both Michael and Leigh Anne still have issues to deal with on both their sides of the tracks.<br/><br/>While the film does have its weaknesses, I still wish to assert that everyone should see this. Not just because it's a true story. Hell, I'm not even going for the whole ""triumph of the human spirit"" routine. I think that the most important thing portrayed in ""The Blind Side"" is the current state of race relations in the United States, and how each side has to deal with its own stereotypes. So definitely see it.<br/><br/>Also starring Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates."
"freemantle_uk","7","0","3","26 May 2010"," The Christian blockbuster
","With a gross of over $290 Million, The Blind Side made 10 times it profit from it's budget $29 Million. It became one of the most successful sports films ever and appealed to new cinema crowd, the Bible-belt, middle America crowd.<br/><br/>The Blind Side tells the story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a poor African-American teenager from Memphis whom mum was drug-addict and he slept on the sofa of a family friend. He was enrolled into a private Christian School, with the promise that he could make a good American football player, but lacks the academic ability. After being kicked out from the projects, Michael is taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her family. They give him a home and adopt the man out of Christian charity. When Michael's grades pick up and he shows his skills as a player some top universities show interest in giving him a scholarship: but he still needs to raises his grades to ensure he can get into university.<br/><br/>The main reason why The Blind Side succeeded with the Christian crowd was because it shows a Republican, Christian family in a positive light. They were shown as a family who took in Michael because it was they Christian ideal of charity (the better aspects of Christianity). Bullock plays Leigh Anne as a hard-as-nails, tough mother, protecting her family and is shown as a more liberal minded Republican. This was a film that also shows how rich white suburban community are completely segregated from the poor inner-city, predominately black areas, with two different cultures. The acting in the film was decent, with Bullock being the stand out performers, winning herself her first Oscar. Whilst her performance is good showing herself to feisty, yet funny, it was not the best of the year: I think Saoirse Ronan was the best performer in her role in The Lovely Bones. Aaron was decent as the gently giant, a person who is shy but has an inter-depth: but his character is a cliché.<br/><br/>John Lee Hancock writes and directs this film. Whilst the direction is decent, pretty standard with this type of film, The Blind Side follows a typical formula, with Michael improving his grades, starting out in American Football, improving at American Football, attempting to get into university and a final ordeal. There are montage scenes and some elements of the film felt similar to previous American Football films like We Are Marshall and Friday Night Lights, where the team starts out poorly but quickly improve. But Hancock knows what he is doing, he does not try to be too adventurous with his direction and works well with the standard formula.<br/><br/>The film has been met with criticism that it took the charity of a white family to allow a black person to succeed: but that was the nature of the story, there was not a lot Hancock could have done. It should be more a commentary on the situation. There was of course the theme of Christian charity in the film, but this was done one a individual level. But a problem with the film was that Michael Oher was basically a secondary character in his own film, playing second fiddle to Sandra Bullock. Whilst the film could be seen as a criticism of the state education system, where there is a lack of funding and teachers did not care. This is of course a problem with schools that are in poor inner-city areas that affect schools in many country. And that a student could improve in a private system. The message is dodgy, but there is a valid point. But a more worrying aspect of the film is the treatment of black characters. In the film there are either gang members, drug addicts or militant activists. There is no character that would be more grounded and realistic. Even Michael was shown to be stereotypical as the gentle giant who was not very academic.<br/><br/>Overall it is what it is and a decent film for it. But it was not worthy of a best picture nod."

Then, I saw it. Did it blow my mind? No.But I still liked it.<br/><br/>The Blind side is a cute movie. But it didn't deserve the two Oscar nominations it received. Sandra Bullock maybe but not best picture. Brothers is a movie that deserved some credit. Everyone saw this movie,nobody saw that movie. Trust me, it was better.<br/><br/>The Blind side is the true story of a guy named Michael Oher(played by Quentin Aaron),a homeless African American. One night,he is taken in by Leigh Anne Touhy(played by Oscar winner Sandra Bullock). They don't know much about him.But they eventually make him a member of the family.<br/><br/>The Blind side, for me, mainly worked do to Sandra Bullock's performance. I know she didn't deserve it and so did she.I mean i love her but Gabourey Sidebe was so much better.And so was that movie.I believe that she deserved the Oscar for Crash. Though she did a great job.<br/><br/>My problems with it: I think the other actors(or some of them) don't do a very good job.Since when did Tim Mcgraw become an actor? Really? I mean I know they are supposed to rednecks. Another problem is that it felt too long for me and it was occasionally kind of cheesy. But what can you do? It's an inspirational sports drama.

","The Blind Side (2010), Alcon Entertainment Cert:12<br/><br/>Dir: John Lee Hancock Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, Kathy Bates, Quinton Aaron<br/><br/>The film depicts the true story of now NFL super star Michael ""Big Mike"" Oher, and his turbulent path to becoming the success he is today. Leigh Ann (Bullock) and Shaun (McGraw) Tuohy take a young Michael (Aaron) under their wing, helping him to leave the demons of crack addict mother and poor upbringing behind him. Having no real education and chances few and far between for a ""Ghetto"" kid Leigh Ann, having a soft spot for Michael, takes control and ensures that he gets all the opportunities her own children have. Leigh Ann despite facing criticisms from her circle of friends for having taking in a ""black kid"", battles and when Michael express an interest in American football Leigh Ann ensures he gets the best coaching to make it. With a football coach and a tutor to help improve Michael's grades the offers for athletic scholarships pour in. Problems arise however as Michael must make his choice, and in doing so chooses a university to which the Tuohys have long been affiliated. People find the choice suspicious and so question the Tuohy's influence on young vulnerable Michael. <br/><br/>This is a moving and emotional true story of a boy that with help from strangers became something spectacular. The greatness in what the Tuohy's did for Michael is captured in a brilliant performance from the whole cast. Sandra Bullock takes on the role of a strong Southern woman, but Bullock adds an element of humour which makes it all the more real. The role saw Bullock earn herself an Oscar and quite rightly so, her performance sees her step up a level; proving she can't only flex her funny muscles but can make you laugh and cry simultaneously. Bullock isn't the only star however, newcomer Quinton Aaron steps up to the mark in the lead role. Aaron brought the vulnerability and believability that makes you sit up and watch, and gives a performance that is well beyond his years. Country crooner Tim McGraw also gives a solid performance that doesn't look out of place against the heavy-weight of Bullock, and their on screen marriage is believable and enjoyable to watch. Hancock cast greatly and directed even greater a story which had to be approached without the attitude of a ""rag to riches biopic"", but instead a strong narrative of how one family changed the life of a young man in need. It's sad, compelling, and funny but above all true to the story of which is based on. Worthy of its rave reviews, The Blind Side is without doubt a fantastic example of simple film-making at its best.<br/><br/>If you liked this please have a look at my blog:<br/><br/>http://courtneywelsh1.blogspot.com/"

","Saw it at the theater, and when it hit DVD release, thought ""why not?"" And I'm glad I saw it again.

You can almost feel Micnael's disbelief when he is asked to spend the night with the Touhey family. And you can definitely feel the bonds of the family coming together around him.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best scene, and probably what pushed Sandra to the Oscar, is the speech she gives to Michael on the football field, helping him to see his key role on the team. And the scene, towards the end in which she 'confronts the thugs' where Michael used to live. Her delivery of 'yeah, and it shoots well the other days of the week, too'. You don't see it coming and it has a little extra impact because of it.<br/><br/>The comparison of the family members football players' slots was so moving and well-scripted.

","I've always seemed to have a soft spot for feel good movies, and The Blind Side has definitely turned into one of my favorites. Both Bullock and Aaron portrayed their characters beautifully, while making it seem as second nature. The director resisted the temptation of dwelling on the many issues addressed in the movie (racial, adoption, football, and family life). Focusing on the basic story line of a women with a vision and a pure heart with the support of her family and a young man with great will power and potential. Simple, moving and straight to the point.

"fwomp","8","0","1","16 May 2010"," Sandra Bullock Finally Makes It To The Top
","Making schmaltzy movies is a thing Hollywood is overly good at. Music rises telling us when to get that lump in our throat. Actors talk softly with a glistening eye. And the love-fest ensues.<br/><br/>If you abhor these types of films, then you might want to avoid THE BLINDSIDE. Not because all of that is in here, but because some of it is ...but only mildly. If you despise the ""great white person saving the {insert minority here} other person from certain doom"" theme, you might want to avoid this flick, too. Yes, some of that is in here, too. So why, oh why, did I rate this film so highly. Well, it's not overly schmaltzy nor overly great-white-hope-ish either. It is a (relatively) true telling of NFL star Michael Oher's early, troubled life in Memphis, Tennessee.<br/><br/>Homeless at 16 (and without parental guidance), ""Big Mike"" is seen wandering the streets by the affluent Leigh Tuohy (Sandra Bullock, THE LAKE HOUSE) and her family. They do ""the good Christian thing"" and offer the big guy a place to sleep for the night. But as the strong, silent Michael attempts to leave the next day, Leigh decides to have him stay another night. And so goes his induction into the Tuohy family.<br/><br/>But before he gets into the NFL, Michael (Quinton Aaron) must first pass high school and then get into college. He must overcome the whitewashed system of academia in upscale Memphis to do it, too. He soon receives help with the arrival of a tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates, CHARLOTTE'S WEB) who toughens up Michael's mental muscle and prepares him for his college days.<br/><br/>Most of this is just backstory, however, for the main event, which is Michael's immediate rise onto the football circuit. His size and speed shock all those who watch his games, making him a prime candidate for college scouts.<br/><br/>The film isn't without its funny moments, though, most of which are thanks to S.J. (Jae Head, HANCOCK), the Tuohy's youngest – and very small – son who helps Michael navigate through all of the college offers that come his way. There are also some combo touchy-feely and comical moments. The one that comes to mind is when the Tuohy's ask Michael to become a member of their family and he says, ""I thought I already was."" The main draw here is, finally, Sandra Bullock. Not known as a powerhouse actress and more as one who goes after the money, Bullock may have gotten lucky and found the part she could play so well that it grabbed her an Oscar. Her Leigh portrayal was truly excellent. But was it as good as, say, Gabourey Sidibe's PRECIOUS? Or Meryl Streep's Julia Child in JULIE AND JULIA? Some think not (Does Meryl need another Oscar? I mean, really!) Regardless, I think sports movie fans will gobble up this one just as much as HOOSIERS and ROCKY."
"rmlattimore","Null","0","2","12 May 2010"," Thre's a lot to this movie
","The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Goodfellas, were transcendent movies. The Blind Side (TBS) is not, which is why it is not a great movie. But in terms of its themes, it is a serious, well-made movie.<br/><br/>The main point, IMO, is that there is a disconnect between the Christianity Americans profess and the Christianity that they practice. Michael Oher went to a Christian Academy. But he wasn't admitted because he was a child in need, he was admitted because they thought he might be a good football player. He was consistently viewed as an outsider, befriended by no one. Were the Touhys the only people who saw that he was in need, or were they the only ones to act on their Christian faith? And if the faith of others is so shallow, what does that say about the state of Christianity today? TBS doesn't beat you over the head with this, but it is there. You often see statements of Christian faith (""in God, all things are possible"") juxtaposed with examples of how people fall short of those ideals. Bullock's character is a right-wing, gun-toting, fundamentalist Christian. That such a person would take a 300-pound black kid into her home only shows how deep HER Christian faith is.<br/><br/>Another theme in TBS is how much of the plight of the black underclass is a result of their own behavior as opposed to the plight they find themselves in. TBS told you _a lot_ about Oher, but it did it through exposition, not dialogue. You saw his mother, you saw his background. You saw the thugs in the 'hood and you saw how utterly different he was from them and you knew, somehow, that that difference in character was why he was where he was, and why they were where they were.<br/><br/>Race, class, faith – all in a Hollywood movie about a football player. And the script makes sense and the performances ring true. I was glad I saw TBS and I wholeheartedly recommend it."

","I honestly don't know why people are dissing this movie. I finally got around to watching it and I was amazed, inspired, touched and hopeful. It's an inspiring story of a wealthy, Christian Memphis family who takes in a neglected teenager named Michael who has fallen through the cracks. He is shown unconditional love, support and faith and learns to be a part of a family and a community. This is a great family movie that I am proud to show my kids. It shows the unfortunate reality of racism, rednecks and assumptions. But it also shows the importance of acceptance (especially of those democrats...har har), family and dedication. People need to chill out and just enjoy this movie. So it doesn't have blood, boobs, car chases, explosions, or CGI. But this is a touching movie that I wish were the rule than the exception."

Characters were likable, admirable, and a reminder that there are heroes in real life. Totally safe to watch with children. I recommend that children on up watch it. But it isn't childish. So much humor, too. That's part of the storytelling. It could have been made pitiful. Instead, there was something joyful from the beginning. Yes, there was the sadness, the misery, the heartbreak. Somehow, that did not dominate. There was no psych delving into the all the badness, stirring up crushing emotions. There were decent people driven by a natural goodness and conscience that triumphed. Sandra Bullock deserved her Oscar for her performance. I bet her character lives in legend. Her husband, Tim McGraw was just fun. Don't miss it."

","""The Blind Side"" is a decent movie about some decent people who gave a decent young man a chance at life. Unfortunately, that's about as exciting as it gets. As a feel-good movie, it pales in comparison to many other films I would place in the same category. Take ""October Sky"" as an example. It has many similarities to ""The Blind Side."" Both are about a teen-ager who has had little encouragement in his life and an adult who sees potential and nurtures it. Both have positive outcomes. And both are based on true stories. But ""October Sky"" gave us a much more compelling story and kept us more emotionally involved. The fault may lie partly on the subject matter, but I believe there it more to it than that. I, for one, believe Sandra Bullock's Oscar was one of the least deserved in recent history. I may be no drama expert, like some who are on the message board claim to be, but to me her performance was uninspired. All in all, much of the time while I was watching the movie it seemed like something I'd seen a million times on the Hallmark Hall of Fame channel or a Lifetime movie of the week."

"michael_the_nermal","7","0","1","22 March 2010"," You Must Take this Movie Literally to Get It
","The problem with this film's detractors is that they see this as more than the literal story of a rich Southern woman who helped a black youth with no hope for a bright future rise up and become an NCAA football star, and later a player with the Baltimore Ravens. I suppose this movie does fictionalize the true story a great deal and punch it up so that it is a quintessential ""Feel-Good Hallmark Movie of the Year"" (TM). Still, do not forget that it is based on a true story... it really happened. I think it is supposed to be an inspirational story for those with little hope of achieving big things with their lives; by the same token, it is also possible that ""The Blind Side"" became a book and movie because it was a rare occurrence, something that does not usually happen in this world (Sandra Bullock's character says something to this effect towards the end of the film). If you take this movie at face value as an anomalous yet heart-warming true story, you won't read any ""sinister"" message into it and enjoy it a lot more as a story.<br/><br/>Some detractors see this as movie as an example of insidious Southern paternalism by wealthy whites towards black people. It has been a subject of historical study by luminary historian as C. Vann Woodward in his book ""The Strange Case of Jim Crow"" (where paternal racism was replaced with the less subtle and toxic version of Jim Crow that was to grab hold of the Deep South in the twentieth century). I suppose it is possible, but the problem with this argument is that ""The Blind Side"" is but one example of the benevolence of a wealthy white Tennessee woman towards a poor black Tennessee boy. Is paternalism a common attitude, or even a common theme of films set in the contemporary South? Is this a trend we see often in movies and literature set within the last forty years, and is it a problem sociologists have noted recently? Unless this film's detractors can use other examples and fit ""The Blind Side"" into this, I can't help but to see their cases as weak and ""The Blind Side"" as nothing more than a slightly better-than-average heartwarming feel-good movie that is pining for Oscar gold, and was released towards the end of the year to get the notice of any Oscar judges who might wish to nominate it for honors.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty decent, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it was excellent. Sandra Bullock was pretty good as the wealthy protagonist of this story. Her one annoying scene is at the beginning, where she narrates the football position Michael Oher would take (""one Mississippi...two Mississippi""). The boy actor who played her son does seem domineering and annoying, but he at least showed a genuine desire for love and compassion for his adopted brother. Some have criticised the actor who played Michael Oher for being taciturn, but I think he did a good job conveying his character's personality without needing to say much.<br/><br/>A nice story and a fairly-good film, if you take it as a literal tale and not anything with a moral or transcendent theme. Real life does not work like literature. In spite of the efforts of the filmmakers of ""The Blind Side"" to force a true story to take the conventions of fiction, it shows the vagueness of real life, which often time has no discernible theme to convey, other than that sometimes some people are pretty damned lucky to have a rich good Samaritan help them achieve great things."

","In football, the quarterback's blind side gets protected by the left tackle. Put into everyday's terms that means protect your friends, your family, your loved ones. Meet the Tuohys, a wealthy Tennessee family, who offer their living room couch to Michael Oher, a homeless African American teen, because it's the right thing to do. The results of this pure act of kindness are inspirational, uplifting and thoroughly satisfying. Sandra Bullock's Academy Award winning, knock out performance is the heart and soul of this film, but she couldn't have been this good without anyone to play off: Tim McGraw as her adoring sweetheart of a husband; Lily Collins as the teenage daughter who refreshingly plays against type and expectations; young Jae Head who declares every scene he's in his own; and the inimitable Kathy Bates in a minor but pivotal role. Relative newcomer Quinton Aaron is a marvel to watch as Michael. Kudos to director Hancock for keeping it grounded and believable. A feel good movie if ever there was one. For those who doubt that life sometimes provides the best stories, keep your hankies ready."

","The Blind Side tells us an inspiring story in the kindest way, which endorsed by competent performances and good intentions, ends up bringing us a nice, conciliator and very entertaining time.<br/><br/>The first thing I appreciated on The Blind Side is the absence of sermons and cheap sentimentality, something which avoids the movie to become into a lachrymose melodrama.Besides, the message from the movie is shown on a natural way, because it is filtered into the sober narrative.The Blind Side does not pretend to plunge us into the sordid reality of the North American social system, and it even finds moments of humor into the racist comments from some hateful characters.The main attraction for many people before watching the movie will undoubtedly be the acclaimed performance from Sandra Bullock, which made her win an Oscar.Did she really deserve it? I tend to think she did not, but I definitely enjoyed her work.<br/><br/>In a big degree, Bullock repeats her classic routine of adorable mischievous, but on this occasion, she seasons it with a subtle intensity which brings weight and honesty to her character.I truly think this is one of the best performances from her career, and not only for the emotions she generates with her development, but also because she feels much more credible than the uncountable harebrained women she usually embodies in romantic comedies.<br/><br/>The fails I found on this movie is that some funny moments feel a bit forced, and that it turns a bit artificial near the end.<br/><br/>In summary, I think I can recommend The Blind Side with confidence, because it is a movie which fulfills with its intentions of inspiring, entertaining and even bringing us a slight lesson of humanity in order to appreciate everything we have a little more."

This is a film that I would pay any amount of money to see again & again as it pulls at your heartstrings. <br/><br/>One event that happened last night made me realize this film's staying power in Hollywood. As we came out from another film we had seen , a lineup had formed outside a theatre, we figured it was for Avatar or something. Now this theatre has kept showing The Blindside even though this is a theatre that keeps films on there screens for a max of 3 weeks.

The lady Leigh Anne Tuohy played by Sandra Bullock takes complete care of him, notices the morality inhibited in the boy and even encourages the other members of her family to inculcate the small but important good habits. He becomes a part of their family. She even helps him out for a better life at school through education and Sports. <br/><br/>The movie is a biography and in my opinion this movie completely belongs to Sandra Bullock.

"ruby_fff","8","0","2","7 March 2010"," Easily the best family movie of 2009, aspiring, inspiring, assuredly transpires hopeful human connections against all odds and social cynicism
","Sandra Bullock is ever so enjoyable to watch in her movies, and I've been attracted to her star power since ""While You Were Sleeping""1995 director Jon Turteltaub's heartwarming tale with Bill Pullman & the ensemble family, and ""Speed"" 1994 director Jan De Bont's action ace with Keanu Reeves. Her movies, mostly more 'commercial' and Hollywood, do have their mass appeal. Once in awhile, she gets to play more 'in-depth' roles, like part of the ensemble cast in w-d Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" 2004. In 2009, ""The Proposal"" is an amusingly fun 'rom-com' outing set in Sitka, Alaska, with Ryan Reynolds as the opposite force. But as Leigh Anne Tuohy, based on true (and current) story-events, in ""The Blind Side"" - she absolutely shines as she does, integrated and permeating with her own Sandra Bullock air (energy, oxygen) about her, without losing the essential characteristic qualities of Mrs. Tuohy.<br/><br/>Whether she wins the 82nd Academy Awards Best Actress category is beside the point, ""The Blind Side"" is a well-produced movie directed by John Lee Hancock, who also wrote the script based on the story of Michael Oher in author Michael Lewis' best-selling book, ""The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game"". The production notes 'downloadable' from the film's official site ""theblindsidemovie.com/dvd/pdf/prodNotes.pdf"" is in itself an interesting read. We get to know how Lewis (who was high school pal with Sean Tuohy - Leigh Anne's husband) came to write the story about Oher, and he explained about 'left tackle'. Writer-director Hancock (whose family is very much connected with the game - his father and two brothers all played university football) talks about his perspectives, what he sees as the decisive factors in approaching the film. The fascinating casting process in filling the key roles: the Tuohy family of Leigh Anne the amazing Mom and assertive woman by Sandra Bullock, of Sean the supportive husband and Dad by Tim McGraw, of the caring & fun sister and brother team of Collins and S.J. by Lily Collins and Jae Head, and the surprising turn of finding Quinton Aaron to convincingly play Michael Oher. There's also the real life tutor role of Miss Sue neatly played by Kathy Bates. The producers' illuminating accounts about how the film project came to be and the fruition of the production sure complement the experience of the film. (They've also included some Leigh Anne Tuohy quotes from ""The Blind Side"".) Hancock, who gave us 'The Rookie' 2002 with Dennis Quaid, once again delivered a winning movie, full of human warmth and inspiring elements without being overly sentimental. See ""The Blind Side"" and you will hearken to the thankful feeling for what we so fortunately already have - miracle or blessings in disguise. Contentment is a nice place to be.<br/><br/>Note: This film somehow reminds me of a (sports) documentary by filmmaker, writer-director Ward Serrill's ""The Heart of the Game"" 2005. It was seven years in the making, following a high school basketball team, one stellar central player especially - her trials and tribulations, along with the tenaciously talented coach through the course of the film. The real-life true story is quite 'melo-dramatic' (and tear-jerker sentimental) in spite of it being a documentary. Highly recommended."
"alexcuetodo","8","0","1","7 March 2010"," Nice Movie with Memorable Performance

Michael's life details are revealed in accordance to the scenes' relations bringing out the drama of his childhood and frustrations from his mother's behavior.<br/><br/>You could dispute the archetypal approach about the afroamerican's way of living but it serves to the story's purpose, which is based on actual facts wherein a white family supported this child's overcome from poverty and hopelessness -it really impressed me Michael's answer to Leigh Ann's comment when setting up his bedroom-.<br/><br/>I watched Meryl Streep's performance which competes against Bullock's at the Oscars and I definitely have to lean toward the latter because of her deliverance showing a human and Cristian approach which enhances a wonderful message regardless the political or classist status./"
"Likes_Ninjas90","6","0","1","6 March 2010"," Perhaps this is a film that just does not hold to close-scrutiny and that for all its self-congratulatory Christian goodness, it is simply a parable about human decency
","This is based on the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), an enormous African American boy who was taken in by the kindness of strangers, given an education and eventually became a professional NFL player. Although he has great learning difficulties, Michael is allowed at the start of the film to enrol in a Christian school. In spite of his weaknesses, one of his teachers recognises his potential and ability to listen and she vouches for him to be able to stay. Yet when he is evicted from his home and unable to live with his crack addicted mother, he tries staying in the school gym. When that closes of a night he is spotted on the street by a wealthy white woman named Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), whose children attend the same school as Michael. Leigh Anne is a strict and forceful woman but also a deeply compassionate one who believes in giving Michael a chance at life, as much as just a bed.<br/><br/>Despite being based on a true story, there is little doubt that director John Lee Hancock's film has been simplified for mass audiences. Rather fittingly, this is a film that could be called black and white given the simplistic nature in which a number of the characters in Hancock's screenplay have been drawn. The Tuohy family in particular is one without deep flaws or conflicts. They are effortlessly clean and unproblematic, as though they are meant to represent the most ideal Christian family. Leigh's son SJ is most obviously a work of Hollywood fiction, given the way that he talks like a fully confident adult, the equivalent of something from a Disney movie, or more recently and annoyingly, the kid sister from (500) Days of Summer. If one can accept these contrivances then they may also believe in Michael's superhero-like skills as a sportsman, capable of carrying an opposing football player across the back fence. It is with this lack of realism and grittiness in favour of a cute family-friendly vibe that ensures that any sense of conflict or tension is absent throughout the film. Even the most aggressive scenes, including a car crash and the smash-up of a slum, run without consequence. It makes The Blind Side extremely easy viewing but simultaneously it also diminishes the reality and power of the story and its subtext.<br/><br/>Given the appraisal for Christian values in this film there is surprising amount of racism to be found in Hancock's screenplay. Some will find it particularly difficult to swallow the notion of a perfect white Christian family saving an African American from all the troubles in his life. More significantly though, there are some lines of dialogue that come across as blatantly chauvinistic and not in a self-critical or satirical way, like in films such as Crash and Gran Torino. The first night that Michael stays in the house Leigh Anne asks her husband whether he thinks that Michael will steal anything. Similarly, one of the women in the film suggests that Leigh Anne's daughter might be vulnerable because there is a black boy staying in the house. The scenes in the ghetto slum are also cringing because one can almost see the gold teeth of the African American gangsters, given that the poor blacks are represented like caricatures. At its worst, the film is almost anachronistic in its own view of racism, especially when a redneck at a sporting event begins jeering when he sees Michael on the field. It might have happened in the real story years ago, but for a film supposedly set in the present, it's simply dated.<br/><br/>There has been no shortage of praise for Sandra Bullock's performance in recent months and like in Crash she shows here what a talented actress she can be, absent from idiotic comedies. The strength of her performance as Leigh Anne is that she believes in her character and what she says and forces the audience to do the same. Bullock is talented enough to add precisely the right amount of sincerity to the corniest of lines. When she is told that Michael is changing her life she replies with the slightest smile: ""No. He's changing mine"". Contrasting her kindness though is her toughness and the power with which she organises her family. Given she is a rich, powerful white woman it is a believable trait that Bullock inspires with a great deal of conviction. Some of the situations that demonstrate this are less credible, especially when Leigh Anne stands in front of the entire football team to tell Michael how to play the game but on a surface level she at least makes the film mostly watchable. Quinton Aaron does not have a lot of dialogue in the film, which frustratingly disempowers his character, reducing him to facial expressions. This is meant to be about an African American finding his place in the world but because he is never given the time to verbally display his growth in intelligence; he loses his voice literally and metaphorically.<br/><br/>It is difficult to except The Blind Side as a Best Picture nominee this year because it is such a light and unchallenging film, mildly entertaining but ultimately lacking the dramatic impact to make it both thoughtful and emotionally involving. There are a number of outdated elements in the story and some jarring changes in its tone as well. Perhaps this is a film that just does not hold to close-scrutiny and that for all its self-congratulatory Christian goodness, it is simply a parable about human decency. There is less doubt about Bullock's solid performance though, a display of strength and compassion, suggesting that she may well become one of the few actresses ever to win both an Oscar and a Razzie Award in the same year."

","First off, Sandra Bullock is just mind-blowing. There simply could not have been a better actress to play this role, so the casting was spot on. But she's not just right for the part, the acting itself was simply amazing. She was genuine, funny, gentle yet brave and strict. Simply amazing. Ms Bullock, if you are reading this: thank you. You are truly inspiring! You are talented and all your feel-good movies really do make us all feel good, no matter what the nay-sayers say! Now, back on the movie. It was simply wonderful! The story is truly inspiring. I've read quite a few comments which called this movies things like awful. Nosir, this movie is a must-see. It's kind, original, funny, family-like and inspiring. It preaches all the things that a real person should appreciate: family, kindness to others, hard work and education, sports, understanding and, well, color-blindness. I simply loved it. I watched it once myself and once more with me wife, who was WOWed by it as well. I can not recommended it more!<br/><br/>P.S. It's funny how nowadays people can rate some zombie-movie 10, but they rate a movie like this low. Why? Because it's not cool to be kind to others? Because it's not cool to see a movie about family and school? I mean, I honestly don't understand what is wrong with the world today :/ P.P.S. And I love and respect Sandra Bullock for all her comedy movies. They help a lot of people feel good, especially at this economic times. There is NOTHING wrong with silly movies and comedies. Go Ms Bullock!"
"seaview1","8","0","1","5 March 2010"," THE BLIND SIDE Shines Brightly
","In the tradition of feel good sports movies like The Rookie and Hoosiers comes The Blind Side, and what sets this apart from the genre is a commanding performance by Sandra Bullock. In her best role to date, Bullock's character lifts this story, one that is a perfect example of popular film-making and its themes of love, hope, and redemption.<br/><br/>Opening with the infamous injury of NFL quarterback Joe Theisman by Lawrence Taylor, the film centers on the importance of protecting the quarterback's 'blind side', and hence the position of left tackle has become vital to a football team's success. This true story recounts the beginnings of tackle Michael Oher who was eventually drafted by the Baltimore Ravens.<br/><br/>Coming from a broken family, Oher enters a predominantly white high school. Quiet and introverted, he does poorly in his classes and performs marginally in athletic sports. Befriended by a younger boy, S. J. Tuohy, Michael (Quinton Aaron), by circumstance, endears himself to the wealthy Tuohy family, led by strong-willed mom, Leigh Anne (Bullock). She offers the homeless boy a place to sleep for the night which turns out to be a mansion of a home, and in time, a trust and bond develops as he is adopted by this surrogate family. Leigh Anne makes the young man her project so to speak and grows to love him as her own despite his abusive childhood which includes his biological mother who can barely survive on her own and his friends from the 'hood who border on criminals.<br/><br/>Encouraged by his 'family' and the school faculty, Michael improves his grades and play on the football field. He opens up and is befriended by more schoolmates. Because his sense of family is so important to him, he takes his protective instincts to a new level, and it carries over to football with spectacular results. Before long, marquee college coaches descend on Memphis and attempt to recruit the gentle giant. To help get his grades get up to par, the family hires a tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates in an all too brief role). When an official from the NCAA interviews Michael about any conflict of interest (since the Tuohys are avid Ole Miss Alumni) with the University of Mississippi, Michael is at a crossroads in his career and relationship with the Tuohy family.<br/><br/>There are moments to savor such as Thanksgiving in the Tuohy household and how the family rallies around Michael. And of course, the famous scene where Leigh Anne coaches Michael to protect his quarterback as if he were family is amusing. When she delves into his neighborhood, she gets a heavy dose of living on the other side of the tracks, and a scene where a local gang confronts her and gets more than they expected is a standout. It is a stark contrast to her comfortable lifestyle and her judgmental friends. The college recruitment scenes are amusing and lend an air of authenticity by showing real life coaching legends like Nick Saban and Lou Holtz. What is refreshing is how Michael is befriended by S. J. and later, his sister, Collins. Having children making positive, life affirming choices for the welfare of others is a rare depiction in film.<br/><br/>Director John Lee Hancock (The Rookie) deserves credit for weaving a good script based on Michael Lewis' book into a pretty good film with a strong cast. The Tuohy kids are well played by Jae Head and Lily Collins, and singer Tim McGraw is quite good as Leigh Anne's supportive husband Sean. But this is most definitely Bullock's show, and her energy is infectious and carries the film through sheer will. It's the kind of performance that gets awards. Think of Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich.<br/><br/>This film is a real crowd pleaser and easily watchable for most family members, not an easy trick. (Do stay for the end credits to see snapshots of the real life Tuohy family.) Yes, the narrative is very straightforward and plays with facts in places, but the spirit of a family and its matriarch who would not let one of her own fail cannot help but touch and inspire."

"Robert_duder","9","0","1","1 March 2010"," A lot over hyped but still delightfully sweet and a touchdown for Bullock
","No one seems to make mention of the fact that Ms. Sandra Bullock, former America's sweetheart has been in a slump...a major slump going back as far as 2000 when Miss Congeniality tore up the screen. 2009 was absolutely her glorious comeback with the clever and fun ""The Proposal"" and this, which will likely be considered her greatest role of her career. This film is her Eric Brockovich. Is that an overstatement? Yes. Is the film brilliant? No. Its not even particularly unique but what it is is fun, heart warming, touching, fun, entertaining, sad and based on a truth...all making it incredibly popular and it would seem as though it has caught on like wildfire. I think the true charm of The Blind Side is that it can appeal to absolutely everyone. Male and female, young and old, children, families and adults. Everyone will find something to relate to in this film. It touches all the right chords and has a really great and charismatic cast that all work wonderful together. If you walk out of this film with dry eyes I doubt you have a heart. Its a rarity for critics and the film viewing public to both see eye to eye when it comes to an emotional sweet film so all power goes to The Blind Side.<br/><br/>As mentioned Sandra Bullock leads the cast as headstrong southern woman Leigh Anne Tuohy. Having seen the real Leigh Anne in interviews I can say that Bullock nails the character. She is an outspoken and strong and you just can't take your eyes off this performance, precisely why she is now looking at an Oscar nomination. Honestly I think that the Academy felt nominating a people's favorite would make the awards popular again but either way Bullock deserves praise for a solid role. If I hadn't seen Tim McGraw in an interview I would condemn him slightly for taking a back seat compared to everyone else in the cast. McGraw is a good actor and could easily hold his own in the film and he's a pleasure to watch but he just isn't front and center but as he said that was exactly the intention because the forefront characters need to be Bullock and Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher. Aaron gives a powerful performance. He's quiet and somber and his entire character is just incredibly touching. If anyone could bring this story to life with emotion Aaron has done it. Jae Head and Lily Collins are terrific supporting members of the cast as the Tuohy children. I think this will do some amazing things for both of their young careers.<br/><br/>Director and writer John Lee Hancock hasn't really had enormous success but having seen a couple of his previous films he has a passion and perhaps this is finally reflective of that passion. He clearly got an incredible cast to work with. On the surface the film really isn't anything groundbreaking. An inspirational sports story? A story about a loving family that takes in a troubled youth? A strong woman fighting for what she believes in? You could likely name a few dozen films easily that encompass this plot. But the heart within the film shines through. The true story will melt your heart and if you get the opportunity to see any of the real people from this story you'll understand just where all that heart comes from. Some critics and reviewers and things you will hear will make The Blind Side sound like the most brilliant film of the year and I would never go that far but it is incredibly entertaining and just very lovely. Definitely worthwhile and sure to please millions and millions of fans as it has already done. A must see!! The perfect family film or for anyone and everyone who likes to be moved by a movie. 9/10"
"drh-8","10","0","2","1 March 2010"," Awesomely Beautiful!!!
","For years I have adored Sandra Bullock. For me, she pales all those screen sirens through the ages into insignificance and ""The Blind Side"" expresses her unequaled talent and natural beauty superbly! As an Aussie, I know nothing at all about American Football (and, from what I have seen on movies and TV, I don't particularly want to!). That's not to knock it though - I just don't understand it and, since it is pretty well exclusive to the USA, I have no real need to. However, that's not the point of this review. In actual fact, the game doesn't matter. The point is that the Tuohy family - and Leigh-Anne (Bullock) in particular see the potential and the need in a young man who couldn't be much more different from their own lifestyle and they give helping him their everything (and MORE).<br/><br/>Bearing in mind that ""The Blind Side"" is based on a true story, all I can say is that I would have loved to have known the Tuohy family. What awesome Christians from Dad to the young son. Actually, all the time I watched this film, I couldn't help seeing a family that attends my own church here in Queensland. The total absence of any sort of jealousy and the genuine love that emanated from every member of that family was just SO like my friends. (Actually, my friends here would make great subjects for a similar biographical drama - but I know their modesty would never let that happen! Pity really!) <br/><br/>When the pictures came on with the credits at the end I was amazed at how well all five actors portrayed the real Tuohys and Michael. (Didn't Sandra look gorgeous as a blonde too! - I'm not biased!!) So this is the second time in as many weeks that I have sat through a movie centred around American Football and loved every minute of them (the other one was ""The Grid Iron Gang""). I don't mind admitting that I had to wipe the occasional tear from my eye during this one too. How refreshingly pleasant to watch a movie where the predominance is on decent, loving and caring people rather than an over-abundance of violence, profanity and unpleasantness - especially when it's a true story. If I could, I'd give this 11 out of 10 and, if it doesn't win some major awards, the judges are all dormant!"
"learningthelingo","7","0","1","1 March 2010"," Vehicle film? Football film? Or Stevie Wonder biopic? What is The Blind Side?
","There's a certain time of year when I attend the cinema's on a very frequent basis. This time in Australia is usually the summer period. However, I am not usually frequenting to the cinema to see the summer blockbuster releases, like the good majority of cinema patrons. Summer cinema release does not mean summer blockbuster to me, but instead equates to the Academy Award contenders.<br/><br/>In this time, I see pretty much any film that is a sure fire flick to be nominated for an Academy Award. This surge in cinema viewing that occurs across the world can be seen as one of the huge upsides to the very controversial award giving group that is synonymous with shaky and questionable choices.<br/><br/>In this time leading up to the Academy Awards, I became aware of an advance screening of John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side, a football family drama about a Southern family who takes in a disadvantaged black youth and aid him along with love, support and encouragement all the way to the NFL.<br/><br/>This is not my usual type of film that I attend. The family friendly feel good, ""you can do anything if you have love"" story does not usually fly on my radar for too long before I wipe it off, let alone a sports film. However, The Blind Side had a leg up being nominated for Best Picture Oscar, and having its star, Sandra Bullock, as the frontrunner to win the Best Actress prize. So with this reason in toe, I speed off to see it in it's advanced release. And boy did it surprise me.<br/><br/>Set in Memphis, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy (played by Tim McGraw and Bullock) discover Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) walking in the rain one night, with a dirty shirt in his plastic bag as his only possession and nowhere to stay. You can pretty much guess what happens from here on end. The usual conflicts and resolutions follow in a very neat order, which is to be expected of a Hollywood produced film with a Hollywood superstar as it's leading attraction. And yet, somehow, I found myself continually smiling and wanting to bursts out into applause for many different reasons. Most importantly, there is the issue of representation of race.<br/><br/>The last year in cinema has seen two different and interesting portrayals of disadvantages black youths. In Lee Daniel's Precious, we see an physically and sexually abused and overweight 16 year old girl, who is pregnant with her second baby from her father, and who cannot read. With the aid of a teacher, she manages to breakthrough and discover above all else, the power of love.<br/><br/>The similarities are seen within The Blind Side in this regard, which A. O. Scott sees in an article he wrote a few months ago in the New York Times (click here to read it). Scott notes that both films portray the disadvantaged youths as overcoming their obstacles with the help of teachers (in Precious) and a rich Southern white skinned family (in The Blind Side). The message that seems to be reiterated in the final moments of The Blind Side, is that without this aid, these kids would just be another causality in a poor, disadvantaged, ghetto life.<br/><br/>There have also been critiques, which Scott among others acknowledge, that see Precious as further perpetuating a negative stereotype, whereas The Blind Side is being more delicate about the issue of race, yet at the same time propelling an idea of a fairytale saviour through the guise of a wealthy white family.<br/><br/>After seeing these two films in a period of a week, I would have to strongly disagree that either one perpetuates any negative stereotype regarding race. While these issues are questioned, both films instead swim in the notion of overcoming adversity through the support of well wishing and benevolent forces.<br/><br/>To this matter, both of these films are based on true stories, with The Blind Side being explicitly based on the story of Michael Oher, and Precious being based upon an amalgamation of many girls like the main character, written by ""Sapphire"" (a pseudonym for Romona Lofton, teaching in the projects of Harlem).<br/><br/>Being made for a fairly modest Hollywood budget of $27 million dollars, The Blind Side has received extremely successful critical reception as well as impressive box office takings. In it's opening weekend, it came second only to New Moon raking in $34 million. However, in it's second weekend, the film took in $40 million, a large step up, which is so rarely heard of. The Blind Side has also been the first film to make over $200 million with having a female name receiving sole top billing over the film.<br/><br/>The film has been Bullock's most successful box office draw and has drowned her in awards from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (the Golden Globes), Critics Choice, Screen Actor's Guild and what I predict (although an easy prediction to make) an Academy Award.<br/><br/>The Blind Side is rounded off with very good performances by Aaron, McGraw, Kathy Bates and Ariane Lenox (who plays Michael's drug addicted mother, and who in real life won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Mrs Muller in the Original Broadway production of John Patrick Shanley's Doubt).<br/><br/>While it is a cliché filled film, it still succeeds in presenting all the necessarily elements of a successful family sports drama. Great story, great performances, and leaves you with a great warm feeling."

","(Synopsis) ""The Blind Side"" is based on the remarkable true story of Baltimore Ravens offensive left tackle Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron. Michael grew up in the inner city housing projects with his mother in Memphis, Tennessee aptly named ""Hurt Village"". Michael's story begins with him being homeless and coming from a broken home with a drug-addicted mother, and an absentee father. Because of his family circumstances, Family Services took control of his life as he was growing up. Unfortunately, he was being bounced around in and out of foster homes, and now as a teenager he has taken it upon himself that he would rather be homeless. By a stroke of luck, and the coach's wish for a player the size of Michael, he ends up enrolling in a private Christian school where the Tuohy kids go. Michael is a quiet person who is befriended by S.J. Tuohy (Jae Head), the youngest Tuohy who's connection to Michael starts the ball rolling. One icy winter night, as Michael is walking down the road to the school gym, where he is sleeping, Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) with her husband and kids pick Michael up and take him home. Michael is taken in and is accepted by the Tuohy family who wants to help him fulfill his great potential. The teenager faces a new set of challenges that he and his newly adopted family must overcome.<br/><br/>(My Comment) Overall, this is one very good inspirational movie that is a must see. You will learn why the left tackle is so important in preventing quarterbacks from getting hit from their blindside. You will also know that this is a success story going into the movie, but it will still be satisfying to you to see the successes that Michael discovers along the way. The movie is so incredible and charming that everyone will be able to relate and feel connected to the characters. The film has humor, heart, compassion, and reality all rolled into one. It is simply amazing how life is an unknown. Leigh Ann takes Michael home to sleep on their sofa for one night, which turns into a week, and eventually becomes a legal adoption. Sandra Bullock, Quinton Aaron, and the entire cast did a wonderful job of delivering a believable performance. The movie shows a touching illustration of what can happen when someone is given a chance in life by others. This movie will be recognized at Oscar time.

"maxpaz","7","0","1","1 March 2010"," Worked for me
","I saw ""The blind side"" last Saturday. I guess you already know the plot: black boy with problems and no home is hosted in a white rich family house, where is going to stay and change his life forever. It's the typical story of ""fall and redemption"". If we talk about cinematographic features, it's cheesy. The movie is full of clichés: Michale Oher (the black boy) is extremely, extremely nice, even having had a terrible life. He has no sequels. The Tuohyes are all mature and grown up people, even the teenage daughter Collins has no problems with the fact of living with a big black boy in the same house without having any complain about what her friends would say. The son S.J., starts starts referring to Oher as his ""brother"" whit no spark of jealous. Mamma is always armed, and has no fear of getting in the ghetto to look for his boy. So, we are in presence of the celebration of perfect life but we do know, that life is far away from being perfect. Seems too much, even for Hollywood. But...there is always a but. For some reasons, the movie worked for me. Maybe because when I saw Quinton Aaron's smiling I believed him. Made me believe that was a guardian of his family, I found him refreshing and credible. And when he was frowning, he was showing the world the pain in his heart. Aaron composed a character that you can love and embrace as a son or as a brother. And then there is Sandra Bullock. I must say that in my opinion, his career is comprised of both good and bad performances. But she knows what she has. Bullock, who portrays Leigh Anne Tuohy, is shown in the film extremely stylish. But she also composes a character with strong determination to make difficult decisions. She may make those decisions too easily, but the director balanced that simplification with great close-up shots of Bullock's beautiful expressions. She knows how to do it. And then finally, there is the dedication of Leigh Anne Tuohy as a mother. You can not help but stifle a sob when Oher call ""mama"" for the first time to Bullock in the movie. It's the universal theme: the call of motherhood, the relation between a son and his mother, even when one is black, and the other is white. <br/><br/>The whole thing is around Leigh Anne and Oher. And that's it. The other actors are only good details in the drama. And worked for me. For no reasons, and for all reasons. Maybe because we love thinking that, at least in the movies, life is perfect."
"raiderhayseed","7","0","1","27 February 2010"," poses more questions than it answers
","I started thinking about seeing Blind Side on the basis of that grab in the preview in which Leigh Anne bullocks her way to the head of a government shopfront queue, and both the front-of-the line, queue jumpee and the government flack-catcher are genuinely interested in seeing and hearing what she will do next. That summed up the cleverness of the approach Sandra Bullock took to depicting the character – sassy, unsentimental and an unblinking belief in the God ordained rectitude of her actions. But what really got me into the cinema was the controversy about the relative merits for Oscar glory of Avatar versus Hurt Locker. That whole fatuous debate arises from the kind of misguided insistence that Leigh Anne would probably display in comparing apples with oranges. The Hurt Locker is a fine film, even if it has to tack on an apparently much criticized epilogue to deliver on its opening statement that War is a Motivating Force that gives meaning the existence of those who are caught up in its rancour. That quote comes from the book of the same name by Christopher Hedges. In the book he argues that the real challenge to humanity is to find meaning in the simple events of every- day life – in faith, hope and charity rather than anger, hatred and destruction. Judged on that basis, the film fails to deliver on the theme it has set itself, even though it is a tense and riveting commendation of the American fighting (and bomb defusing) man. Avator is something much more momentous. It is to the first decade of the twenty-first century what Star Wars was to the last three decades of the twentieth century. Like Star Wars, the film Avatar is a story that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. Its theme is somewhat more condensed but none the less compelling. It amounts to an articulate and compelling condemnation of the kind of post World War II foreign policy that resulted in the boys in Hurt Locker having to risk their lives in Iraq, to say nothing of the citizens of that country. Leigh Anne's kids would probably enjoy it as spectacle, then learn the message it seeks to impart from their teachers and peers when they go to university. Leigh Anne may well be voting for Sara Palin by then. Faith, hope and charity. That's what has me ruminating on the film long after the corn syrup sweetness that lingers in the mouth has dissipated. Long after the film's refusal to come to terms with the big picture causes of the ugliness and violence that can be kept largely at bay in suburbs full of palatial mansions has left the viewer feeling that something essential is missing. Did I feel a certain guilty pleasure in watching Bullock's performance? Yes! Am I inclined to think it was a cynical and exploitative exercise in the kind of self delusion that bolsters the Republicans in their quest to frustrate Obama's health care reform legislation? Now there's a question! Did it reflect the kind of sentiments that would lead to the more cinematically literate fringe of the Evangelical Right embracing Hurt Locker as uplifting, patriotic, sound doctrine and dismissing Avatar as mindless entertainment? So many questions...so few answers! But the more you think about it, the more it resonates with the all too- familiar right wing themes. The institutional advocates for African American self empowerment just get in the way of decent, right thinking white folks in their efforts to assist the coloured people. If you can do a reasonably good impression of someone packing a gun, you can face down the more dissolute members of the African American community. All you need is a bit of kindness and tolerance to take members of that (self)-disenfranchised community into your home and turn them into model citizens, ready to go out and put their bodies on the line to protect what you perceive to be your own interests. Leigh Anne's husband inspires his amazingly self disciplined African American foster child by quoting from the Charge of the Light Brigade. Subtext – do as you are told, even if the folks who are ordering you to lay down your life are foolish and evil. But then, it has to be admitted that the Leigh Anne character accomplishes more than all the cynical critics of the film will ever achieve. You never see her reading the bible. You never see her meditating on its precepts. She seems to be that kind of genuinely happy individual who revels in leading the unexamined life. But then... and I am going to hate myself for suggesting this... but then if you think about what Paul is saying in the first two chapters of his biblical letter to the Roman Church, about those persons who have never read the Law of Moses but show by their actions that what that Law says in written upon their hearts... then you find yourself ruminating on Blind Side. Has the Leigh Anne character intuitively divined the invisible qualities, the eternal power, the essential nature of God? (Romans 1:20). Can her actions that seem to bear all the hallmarks of God's Law written on her heart bear witness to the unfair accusations of Black civil rights guardians? (Romans 2:14-15) But ultimately, it is the very glibness of the film that robs the viewer of the opportunity to form a judgement on these matters. How would the Leigh Anne character react if, like the biblical character Job, she lost her health, wealth and loved ones? Would she emerge from such experiences a better person, like Job? <br/><br/>The screamingly funny but very dark 1988 film La vie est un long fleuve tranquille ( ""Life Is a Long Quiet River"") by Etienne Chatiliez posed just such a dilemma. Would her spirit have been embittered? That is something that neither the film's script (based upon actual events) nor Bullock's performance can hide."

","Diane and I have just returned from this lovely film. Please, fellow commentators do not rag me about this film's lack of characterization, trite plot moves or done-to-death script lines and situations, I really understand all that high school English class criticism but I believe that we must move beyond puerile critiques of fundamentally good films that are enjoyable to watch. The Blind Side (and I have yet to read the negative comments) is heart-warming, gentle and very well acted by all concerned. There is room for movies like this one; movies that allow the audience a look into two hugely different lifestyles but interestingly seemed not to dwell on these variations. To me these massive differences formed a strange canvas upon which the film was painted but the substance of the film was elsewhere. I expected, after reading the movie fliers that Sandra Bullock's character, although telegraphed to do so, would not play her role in that way, that she would pass over these massive differences and not be at all troubled by them. She was from the Old South, she was a conservative (a Republican) and she was very well off. However, that is exactly what happened; she grew as a person during the film and she did genuinely, through meeting Michael Oher, saw parts of life that were unknown to her. Leigh Anne Tuohy's natural son, by Diane's judgment, stole every scene that he was in and I must agree. Everybody played their roles excellently well and we enjoyed their work to the max. I hope Sandra Bullock receives her much deserved Oscar for this role."
"Red_Identity","Null","0","1","26 February 2010"," Entertaining and touching film that is sure to be seen as Sandra Bullock's finest
","I am not a big fan of big, 'hollywoodized' sports films, because, unlike the really great ones like Raging Bull and The Wrestler, they are always over-the-top and just want to pull at our heartstrings in a cheap manner. While it is true that The Blind Side does exactly that at times, it was still a film that did not need to be as good as it was. The writing and directing for the most part was bearable, and actually some lines were very well written, as well as some scenes. I though the film was actually not as melodramatic as others of this type are, and actually funnier and more entertaining than I would have thought. This is not an incredible film, but it does tell the incredible journey of Michael Oher very well. It was actually very moving at times, and for that, props since that is it's job. I actually thought the film had a lot in common with another Oscar-nominated film, Precious. The performances in this film are good, and this IS Sandra Bullock's film. I doubt she thought she would get any awards or an Oscar nomination for her role when she did it, and that is a good thing because sometimes some performances are just screaming 'OSCAR'!. While I would like it if Meryl Streep won her 3rd Oscar already, and while I do think she is the best of the nominees, Sandra Bullock would actually be a close second because she brings to life the incredible presence and personality of Leigh Anne Tuohy. I really did think she was remarkable, and I would not be angry at all if she won the Oscar for this. Overall, this is a moving, very entertaining and very likable film, and better and not as over-the-top or melodramatic as you would expect."

"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","2","30 January 2010"," The Power Of Kindness
","'The Blind Side' is a wonderful portrayal of a heartwarming true story about football player Michael Oher and his family, especially his mother. At first glance it might look like one of those underdog makes it big type stories but this movie is just so much more. We are shown step by step the difference that the kindness Leigh Ann and her family contribute to Mike's growth and success. This is a family who selflessly took a child into their home to provide him shelter for one night. That night stretched into two and then three and then he was living with them.<br/><br/>What Leigh Anne Touhy and her family did was admirable to say the least and Sandra Bullock does a phenomenal job portraying her. I've often thought that Hollywood wasn't giving her enough roles to prove that she's a versatile actress. With films like 'Crash', 'Infamous' and 'The Blind Side' she has shown that she can do both comedic and intense roles excellently. Quinton Aaron is impressive as Oher while Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates are superb. I also liked child actor Jae Head's acting as the slightly mischievous, funny and friendly S.J. Lily Collins's Collins is far from the clichéd jealous daughter.<br/><br/>John Lee Hancock cleverly downplays many elements such as using dialogues with less words and yet they speak volumes. He avoids syrupy moments and clichés. He does bring up issues like racial and class differences but the film doesn't dwell on those nor does it attempt to makes a social commentary.<br/><br/>This inspirational film is first and foremost about kindness. 'The Blind Side' shows how an act of kindness can change someone's life and even turn it upside down. If others followed Leigh Ann's footsteps this world would become a much better place."
