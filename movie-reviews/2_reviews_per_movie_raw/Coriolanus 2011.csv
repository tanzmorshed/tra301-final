"dbaggett1","9","155","191","14 November 2011"," AMAZINGLY relevant - even in 2011
","I had the pleasure of seeing Ralph Fiennes's ""Coriolanus"" at the St. Louis International Film Festival, on Nov 11th, 2011. I was on the edge of my seat through the entire film. Needless to say, the filming, production values, etc., were fantastic; but it was the relevance of the film that kept me glued to the screen. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes captured the timeless concepts that Shakespeare expressed in his play brilliantly - so much so that I feel there will be strong/visceral audience reaction to the film's depiction of themes that reflect in today's front page stories. <br/><br/>The theme of a military officer's political role resonated with me as a retired Navy Officer. The theme of the contrast between ""high society"" and the proletariat resonates in the ""Occupy XXX"" protests occurring today. The conflict between liberal and conservative (dare I say Democrat vs. Republican) ideals played very loudly in this film. Even the issues in European politics reflected themes we see in today's news. <br/><br/>The acting by Ralph Fiennes, Vanessa Redgrave & Gerard Butler propelled the story and kept it moving swiftly. Some have panned the use of Shakespeare's original language. I, for one, had no trouble following the language. This film ranks with Kenneth Brannagh's ""Henry V"" and Baz Luhrmann's ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" for making a film in Shakespearean English accessible by 21st Century Man. <br/><br/>I've always believed that some folks in the U.S. malign William Shakespeare's writings today, because they were forced to read his plays in a cold classroom setting in their youth. Shakespeare didn't intend his works to be read. He meant them to be performed and watched. This film proves the power of a good telling of a Shakespeare tale."
"laurenchide","9","100","123","20 January 2012"," Spectacular
","A jaw-dropping interpretation of Shakespeare's Coriolanus. I was literally in awe when I left. Admittedly, I know my way around the story, I've read Coriolanus a few times. But I have to say that this adaptation is so well executed that I caught myself discovering incredible lines and themes and ideas to which I had never paid attention before. Ralph Fiennes' interpretation of Coriolanus is solid. The pride, the wrath, the one-track-mindedness are all very palpable. And one couldn't wish for a better Volumnia. Terrifying. Fascinating. I've always been reluctant to modern settings, but this time, I loved it. It just worked. Go and see for yourself. As for me, I'm definitely going to watch it again."
"gervasiustvinkleminkleso","8","176","234","27 February 2011"," Look out Kenneth Branagh
","This is my first review on IMDb so bare with me. Coriolanus has the right ingredients for a good movie, great story(can you top Shakespeare?) and a strong cast.Only thing that was unknown so far is the director.IMO Mr. Fiennes did very well in his debut, his camera moves around at eyes height and often lingers close up to actors faces(it keeps the film from being stagy and lets you see all the nuances they convey).Locations are interesting and there are couple of nice fight scenes.The language is Shakespirian but i had no problems understanding it( not my native lang.), musical score is kinda tribal and quite appropriate for the theme of the film. It's a very dark movie and it gets a bit bloody sometime so if you're not into that be warned. My vote is 8/10 i recommend it to everyone and hope to see more of Mr. Fiennes work behind the camera. P.S. Look out Ken Branagh you've got some competition now :)"
"kmckeogh2","8","118","160","1 February 2012"," The language makes the play.
","I couldn't disagree more with the review that slates Shakespeare's text as 'too wordy for modern audiences'. Viewers may find it challenging, but even those who haven't read his work should appreciate his superb capacity for character, metaphor and sheer innovation. To reduce the play to just the plot with some poor, clichéd and genuinely meaningless Hollywood script is to deprive it of its value, and to do a great disservice to its literary status. The responsibility for understanding the language (which I staunchly believe has a timeless relevance), lies with those who struggle to do so, not with the text itself. I cannot disagree strongly enough with the implication that we should dumb-down Shakespeare."
"Greigx3","9","71","94","23 January 2012"," Fiennes has made Shakespeare not only accessible but utterly thrilling
","Shakespeare isn't Shakespeare without Shakespearean language. It might be difficult to understand exactly what the dialogue is during parts of Coriolanus, but there's no difficulty following the meaning. The action, the direction and some powerful performances – most notably from Ralph Fiennes and Vanessa Redgrave – carry the film and more than compensate for the language barriers. Some people walked out about halfway through but the climactic third act made it well worth the perseverance – especially Redgrave's moving monologue as the formidable matriarch Volumnia.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler was pretty forgettable in this. Whether that's because he isn't exactly of thespian discipline or because his character isn't particularly pronounced in this play, is up to you to decide. Perhaps he and Jessica Chastain are nothing more than a bit of totty to sell the film? Perhaps that's just a bit cynical.<br/><br/>James Nesbitt added an interesting, somewhat unexpected dynamic to the play with his enigmatic nuances of jest and malice. Also worth a mention was the little-known Dragan Micanovic who played a minor character, Titus, but delivered a couple of pivotal lines with engrossing presence.<br/><br/>The real star of the show is obviously Shakespeare. His poetic prose courses through your mind and adds fuel to the fires of his drama. His characters are bold and consistent, truly agents of their own destinies. The subject matter resonates with political allegory and the film's release is timely and relevant. The play set in a present day context highlights the tribal social system which still dominates our affairs. The story also works to express the futility of war.<br/><br/>Fiennes has done well to translate Coriolanus from the stage to the screen and he hasn't stretched it too far so as to alienate it from the original text. Stylistically, the film is quite gritty. The focus is mostly on the actors, their eyes, their expressions and their delivering of lines, but there are a few purely cinematic moments (fight scenes in particular) which justify the adaptation to the screen. There are a couple of truly violent moments in the film which blast the cobwebs off the old play and hook the modern, desensitized audience into the story.<br/><br/>Coriolanus is a tense and violent political wartime thriller which makes Shakespeare not only accessible but utterly captivating. A credible directorial debut from one of the industry's finest working actors.<br/><br/>http://ionlyaskedwhatyouthought.blogspot.com/"
"Shakespeareances","9","53","70","29 February 2012"," Shakespeare's Ancient Tragedy Brilliantly Told
","Shakespeare's most complicated tragedy set in the early days of the Rome Republic gets an updated setting in Fiennes' movie. Using story-telling techniques combining CNN, CSI, and YouTube along with images of street demonstrations, riots, and urban warfare, Fiennes gives us a Coriolanus befitting our times, clarifying how the titular hero can fall from national hero to banishment in a matter of minutes on the whims of a fickle populous easily swayed by political spin-masters. Still, the mamma's boy element of Coriolanus' tragedy remains intact.<br/><br/>Though significantly cut, the text is pure Shakespeare, even in the mouths of TV talking-head pundits. Spoken by the likes of Fiennes and Brian Cox, the verse lifts what could have been a gimmickry telling of Coriolanus into a five-star Shakespearean movie."
"DoctorRabbit","8","21","26","26 June 2012"," You Don't Have To Be A Shakespeare Fan To Enjoy This Film
","Going into the film, I really didn't know anything about it. Which is why i'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film.For a first time director Ralph Fiennes really did a great job making a modern adaptation of one of the lesser known Shakespeare works. I'm not a huge Shakespeare fan, but I have to say that the use of the his dialogue here actually worked in the context in the film even with the modern setting. Fiennes and Butler both do an amazing job and really carry the film as does the rest of the cast. The action sequences are also shot very well and realistically. I hope Fiennes continues to direct because he shows a lot of talent here. Don't let Shakespeare's name drive you away from this film! You don't have to be a fan of his work to enjoy it!"
"samlapidus","8","82","117","12 September 2011"," Gripping and Powerful
","I just got out of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) North American Premier Gala event of Coriolanus. The movie was both gripping and powerful. Yes it is always nice to see a film with cast and director in hand to introduce the film and take credit at is completion, but this movie definitely earned the audiences standing ovation. Some may fear a presentation in Iambic Pentameter though the script and delivery made every line understandable. Setting Shakespeare in a modern day Roman city state was smart. I enjoyed ever minute of this film and if you are a fan of good story telling, Shakespeare or war movies, you will enjoy Coriolanus."
"jackharding89-1","7","36","50","9 April 2012"," Coriolanus will have Shakespeare enthusiasts chomping-at-the-bit, students scrambling for the exits.
","A modern-day spin on one of Shakespeare's lesser known plays, Coriolanus is an ambitious and lyrical Greek tragedy that has everything you'd expect from the mind of the Bard; betrayal, revenge, pride, conflict, monologues, dilemmas, death- it's all in there. The only thing missing is a star-crossed lover or two.<br/><br/>Both its star and director, Ralph Fiennes follows past masters Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh onto the breach in this doomy and demanding directorial debut that may signal a new and exciting direction for the steely-eyed actor. <br/><br/>Set in a city on the verge of collapse that resembles Tripoli but calls itself Rome, the film charts the rise and fall of general Coriolanus (Fiennes); a fiery soldier of war-torn Rome who earns his stripes in a bloody battle against an insurgent army lead by Turrus (Gerard Butler). In the aftermath of a brutal bullet storm and knife fight, Coriolanus emerges victorious and is branded the symbol of a new and prosperous empire. It doesn't work out. The decorated vet is more brawn than brains; his strong sense of pride coupled with the dirty work of corrupt bureaucrats and advisors lead to civil unrest and, in turn, a verbal attack by Coriolanus' on the people of Rome which results in his banishment from the city. Bitter, betrayed and hell- bent on revenge, the spitting outlaw seeks refuge and redemption in who else but his sworn enemy, Turrus. <br/><br/>Swapping the frantic razzmatazz of Baz Lurhmann's Romeo and Juliet retool for a far more gritty and paced approach, Fiennes has crafted a brave and bombastic drama that'll probably find its way onto a school curriculum or two before the year is out. And why not. His contemporary vision of a 300+ year old morality play is one awash with thought, feeling, values, complexities, politics and emotion- pure, unadulterated Shakespeare.<br/><br/>Coriolanus is far from the vision of just one man, though. Gladiator screenwriter Josh Lucas lays the necessary footing for Fiennes and Hurt Locker cinematographer Barry Ackroyd to bring the tale to life. Stirling support also comes in the shape of seasoned thesps Brian cox, Vanessa Redgrave, James Nesbitt and....Gerard Butler; all of which are new to big-screen Shakespeare yet convincing nonetheless. Even Butler.<br/><br/>The screen belongs to a raw and rampant Ralph Fiennes, though. More than just a noseless sorcerer, Fiennes is an exceptional actor and, now, promising director whose verbose and gung-ho approach from both behind and in front of the lens makes for a fascinating commitment. ""Such is the work of a man"". Olivier and Branagh would be proud. Coriolanus will have Shakespeare enthusiasts chomping-at-the-bit, students scrambling for the exits."

","Coriolanus (Ralph Fiennes) uses military force against people's uprising when they demonstrate against oppression and starving in Rome. Coriolanus is first declared as a hero but later relegated from the city by the Senate for his brutality. He then allied himself with its former enemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) and they march together to Rome to destroy the city. Coriolanus's mother, wife and son plead for peace and reconciliation and when he gives up he is murdered by Tullus Aufidius.<br/><br/>Shakespeare's dramas may well be set up in a contemporary set, because the content is timeless. Here the screenplay drama is performed in its original text. The old lines sometimes are in conflict with the modern outfit, but you are quickly caught back to the drama by the violent intrigues and you become strongly affected by the deep conflicts between power and love. The war scenes are realistic and bloody. It is exciting and the outcome uncertain for the uninitiated.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes both directs and plays the title role and succeeds well. He has got a star team both in front and behind the camera. The film photo by Barry Ackroyd is brilliant. The set and costumes are next to perfection. The 74-year-old Vanessa Redgrave portrays Coriolanus' mother, Volumnia, powerful and convincing. Gerard Butler as the rebel leader acts with strong charisma and realism. Additional casting is also very good.<br/><br/>The staging reminds strongly of the NATO's efforts in the Balkan War. Military leaders are wearing American uniforms and the recordings are made in the environments of Belgrade and in Serbia.<br/><br/>Eight of ten for a masterful direction, brilliant acting and a clever staging."
"billygoat1071","8","49","76","23 January 2012"," The Modern Shakespeare
","Coriolanus is not quite one of William Shakespeare's famous plays but this adaptation is pretty great. It starts with a bang. Slow burn of loud noises. It's a decent opening. And it gets better when Caius Martius was introduced. Even though the setting is modern, the language stays to the film. But in some parts, the language doesn't fit to the scene. Ralph Fiennes' performance was fantastic. All the performances were fantastic. Well directed. Beautiful cinematography. Slick music score. Coriolanus is a solid Shakespeare adaptation.<br/><br/>The film introduces with loud noises and explosions. These elements usually overwhelm us in movies. Never forget, this is a Shakespeare film. The dialogue beats the loud noises from its greatness. Everything in this film is modern. The only thing remains here is the language. Of course, it's not Shakespeare without the language.The scenes in television are probably the ones that doesn't fit to the language but somewhat it doesn't matter. It still makes a great Shakespearean scenario.<br/><br/>These dialogues were amazingly delivered by the actors. Ralph Fiennes is fantastic. Even from the very start of the film, he already made the show fascinating. He's born to play these kinds of roles. His rage is the core of his talent. Vanessa Redgrave also compels to the picture. Gives a powerful delivery to her dialogue. In other filmmaking, the cinematography is beautiful but the shaky camera might messes some of the shot. The music score is simply slick with drums. Giving extra thrills to the scenes. Lastly is the action scenes, these scenes doesn't quite matter if it's good or bad but it feels like The Hurt Locker.<br/><br/>It's satisfying enough to see this by the actors and the language. Its context is more mind blowing than the explosions. The filmmaking is very decent. It's a clever modernization and great familiarization to this not so famous play of William Shakespeare. Ralph Fiennes keeps the interest and shines throughout the show. Coriolanus never disappoints. It's a truly Shakespeare picture even if everything but the language is modern. It's just fascinating."
"ligonlaw","9","16","24","1 January 2012"," Timeless Story of Political Intrigue
","Filmed partly in Serbia, ""Coriolanus"" has the dingy, fog-shrouded feel of the mists of time. Coriolanus is a roman military hero, played by Ralph Fiennes, and portrayed as a violent, blood-thirsty animal in battle scenes. Off the battlefield, he is a rage-filled misanthrope.<br/><br/>Blood-smeared and courageous, he charges forward against all odds when in combat, taking his injuries in stride. Each of his scars (all 27) represents a dead enemy, Menenius (played excellently by Brian Cox) whispers to Coriolanus's young son. <br/><br/>Coriolanus has anger management issues, to say the least. Incapable of containing his contempt for the people, he wins no friends off the battlefield when some Senators wish to elevate the soldier to political office. <br/><br/>With seething contempt for false speech and his inability to curb a brutal tongue, he is doomed as enters the arena of politics. His political enemies set a trap for him at a televised political event. When a live audience chants for Coriolanus to be banished, Menenius tries to reason with the mob. He asks the mob to remember that the general devoted his life to protecting Rome from invasion by her enemies.<br/><br/>The rejection so embitters Coriolanus that he leaves Rome and joins the enemy forces. These were the forces he fought in the beginning of the story. The rebels are led by Tullus Afidious, played by Gerard Butler. Butler is perfectly cast as the rebel leader. Coriolanus and Tullus had so much hatred for each other that their men had laid down their arms to watch the two generals engage in what would have been a knife fight to the death, except that an explosion interrupted the brawl.<br/><br/>The driving relationship in this killer's life is a devout worship of his mother, played by Vanessa Redgrave. She controls his opinions and fires his ambitions. This bloody general, so feared by his enemies, is a mama's boy. Her wrath brings him to tears and to his knees. <br/><br/>As with so much of Shakespeare, the language is timeless, and these speeches resonate with relevance. One can apply these conversations to public events in the current era.<br/><br/>Excellent acting, directing, and camera work."

","Widespread civil unrest. Riots over food prices. Politicians banished. Who says Shakespeare isn't relevant?<br/><br/>Set in Rome (though the film was shot in Belgrade with a distinctly Eastern European look to it) Ralph Fiennes' directorial debut tells the story of Caius Martius Coriolanus (Ralph Fiennes), Rome's most prominent general, whose army is fighting fiercely in a war with neighboring state Volsces. With a passion spurred on by his burning hatred for the Volscian military leader, Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler), Caius Martius is a great warrior for his country, but he has nothing but disdain for the poor of Rome who are suffering through famine and hardship. Following an important military victory, his ambitious mother Volumnnia (Vanessa Redgrave) sees an opportunity for her son to stand for Senator, though in order to do so he must act a little more diplomatically towards his own people. He tries, but not being a natural politician he is unable to hold his tongue and explodes into a contemptuous public rant, leading to a popular uprising and his banishment from Rome. Leaving his family behind, Coriolanus teams up with former rival Tullus Aufidius and returns to Rome, but this time as the leader of an invading army.<br/><br/>The decision to retain the original Shakespearean verse provides Fiennes with obstacles that would have challenged an experienced filmmaker, never mind a first time director. As Baz Lurhmann's ""Romeo + Juliet"" (against which all modern Shakespeare adaptations will be judged, seemingly forever) showed, 17th century dialogue can be extremely effective in a contemporary setting. But Coriolanus is not ""Romeo + Juliet"": the story is not known by almost everyone the world over, and the dialogue is nowhere near as accessible.<br/><br/>Fiennes' film more than rises to the challenge, and no doubt he has made a better film for keeping the dialogue unchanged. The cast's delivery of the script is, on the whole, superb: Butler has never been better as the fearless Gladiator-esque Aufidius, Ralph Fiennes impresses both behind the camera as well as in front as the hot-tempered, maniacal Coriolanus (a role he has played previously on the stage), and both Jessica Chastain, as the ever concerned wife Virgila, and Brian Cox as the effusive political adviser Menenius, make an impact in smaller roles. Only James Nesbitt, as the manipulative and underhand Sicinius, gives a slightly underwhelming performance.<br/><br/>But there are a few moments in the script where Fiennes simply can't rely on his actors' delivery of the dialogue to clearly convey the plot ('I converse more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning' is just one of the less intelligible lines). In these instances he lets the filmmaking do the storytelling: from grandiose speeches to intimate family scenes the bombastic score, dramatic cinematography, and bold camera-work make that the meaning and direction of every scene clear. This is a director who definitely knows his craft: I was in a cinema full of critics, for most of whom English is not their first language, and heard absolutely no complaints about not understanding the plot.<br/><br/>The final word, however, simply has to go to Vanessa Redgrave. Her portrayal of Volumnia is staggering. As a mother who risks seeing her own son bring down the city that her family has spent hundreds of years building, she brings out her character's pride, conflict and vulnerability with a subtlety and power that has to be seen to be believed. Truly breathtaking.<br/><br/>Find the rest of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education, at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com. Follow us on Twitter @DohaFilm."
"evan_harvey","9","8","11","24 March 2012"," An excellent film
","These days Shakespeare is either dreary endless remakes of Hamlet and Kenneth Branagh films, or it's the glitzy Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet. Corioloanus is neither of those.<br/><br/>The language is the original Shakespeare (which most people despair of), so lot's of thous and wherefores etc, but it's never dull. Rather, apart from one or two scenes, the dialogue is fleet and sharp. Some of it puts even the best scriptwriter to absolute shame for it's cutting, razor edge delivery.<br/><br/>The setting is modernised, but not glam like Luhrman's efforts. You can see the original play behind the film, yet it works surprisingly well. By that I mean that you can tell that some scenes were originally set in a Roman-style forum, for instance. However, it translates very well, and has a dignified and serious tone.<br/><br/>There's even a modern-day battle scene (with Marine-like soldiers) and a desperate fight to the death between the two main characters.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is superb in the titular role. Usually Hollywood actors do Shakespeare in order to get some respect, but Fiennes (also as director) has crafted a great film. Gerard Butler does equally as well, although his role is limited due to the nature of the script and story. This is Caius Martius Coriolanus' story, and he is the focus of it.<br/><br/>What really appealed for me here was the characters. I know, I know. ""Characters"" are what people speak of when describing boring films. Most kiddies these days just want giant robots and explosions, but it's interesting to watch this film after seeing ""John Carter"" (which I also didn't mind). Whereas the lead in ""John Carter"" had no facial expressions to speak of, Fiennes and Butler positively reek of emotion and depth. Gerard Butler is really only a supporting role, but he does it well.<br/><br/>Shakespeare has survived 400 years precisely because he wrote about people well. Most of the crud Hollywood dishes out will be forgotten in the space of a year.<br/><br/>9 our of 10 is pretty high for me, but I really enjoyed this film. See Coriolanus for something different and refreshing in between the expressionless 'A' list actors of today and the mindless explosions of the next Michael Bay extravaganza."
"kosmasp","7","39","76","27 September 2011"," Tough
","And it is tough, not because it brutal and/or violent (it is that too). But because it uses Shakespearean English in modern times. While it has been done before, it is definitely not something for everyone. It won't appeal to people who are looking for a quick snack. A movie they can just pop in (their player), watch and get out of the player/local cinema, after watching it.<br/><br/>You really have to follow what people are saying. This of course means, while it does appall some, it also appeals to others. Myself I wouldn't count me in either of those leagues. I did find the premise interesting and I though Fiennes did a fine job directing (it looks really good). I still didn't feel a great impact. The actors were phenomenal too btw.<br/><br/>Modern Shakespeare war ... is that your cup of tea?"
"snowman418","1","63","130","11 May 2012"," Where Art Thou Translation?
","The entire movie is word for word Shakespeare, sans about 20% of the lines. It completely misses the point of why William was as brilliant as he was. Shakespeare is rolling in his grave on this one. I can completely understand the intentions of the movie; to stay true to the exquisite language and brilliant wordplay. The only problem is that it completely misses the point. The brilliance of Shakespeare is that he wrote language for the common people that they could understand. Modern day people don't speak like this and they don't understand language like this. Not because they're stupid but because they're not used to it. If the director and script writers truly wanted to pay homage to Shakespeare, they would've adapted the script to modern, powerful dialogue befitting the contemporary environment.<br/><br/>Thou shalt not watch this movie without subtitles. And even then you might need to rewind a few times. If English is not your primary language, you will most likely not understand this movie. Roll credits early on this one."

","By far the best Shakespearean movie...no, I correct myself....the best movie of a Shakespearean play....no, that's not right either...the best film based on a Shakespearean play....not quite right yet....the best cinematic adaptation of a Shakespearean play I've ever seen. The use of cinematic techniques (close-ups, hand held cameras, slick editing) enhances the already pungent dramatic elements of the play as well as making the language more easily understood while the parallelism to contemporary political and diplomatic events (it is set in modern dress) is both uncanny and apt. And the acting is simply superb; you will never hear the word ""boy"" in a Shakespearean play again without thinking of Fiennes's face."

","Shakespeare's play concerns a victorious Roman general, betrayed and banished from Rome, who joins the Volscians, his former opponents, until he is prevailed upon (by his mother and wife) to make peace between the two sides, following which he is killed by the Volscians.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes directs and stars as Coriolanus in this film of the play, where Shakespeare's dialogue is delivered in a modern setting wherein the Roman/Volscian war has been transposed to the Balkans. A bleak piece, and less well known than Shakespeare's other darker plays, the modern setting suits it: if anything, it makes the archaisms in the dialogue more accessible.<br/><br/>Fiennes' direction is gritty, and all the performances are excellent, though Fiennes himself and Vanessa Redgrave stand out.<br/><br/>This film works well as both a contemporary action drama, and also culture!"
"kaaber-2","7","5","7","4 July 2012"," Low budget, but good
","If one can't have Hollywood epic AND Shakespeare (as it seems one can't, barring Branagh's Henry V) this is probably ideal. A play like ""Coriolanus"" cries out for bigger battle scenes when filmed, but all the scenes in the field seem rather cramped. Apart from that, it's brilliant. The cast is excellent, and the handling of the blank verse expertly. Missing out on the credits, I had a feeling that it was directed by Julie Taymor who did that brilliant ""Titus"" some years ago, and was surprised that Fiennes himself did the thing. But good show of a rarely staged and even more rarely filmed play from Shakespeare's dark streak in the first decade of the 1600s, and as in ""Julius Caesar"" Shakespeare really has it in for the common people in this number - feckless and fawning to a man. I can't put a finger on Fiennes' Coriolanus or Redgrave's Volumnia, but Gerard Butler stands out as Aufidius. I've always felt that ""Coriolanus"" is really his tragedy; I believe this character makes the longest journey in the play, emotionally. Hard at his heels is Brian Cox's Menenius. Capital bit of acting that squeezes every bit of tragedy out of the part."
"kayaker36","9","5","7","5 June 2012"," Superb in Every Way
","When bringing before the public a play that is exactly 400 years old, originality is an important aspect to success. Moving the setting from the Roman Republic of 500 B.C. to present-day England-- though it still is called ""Rome""--and depicting infantry combat in a built-up area using contemporary weapons and battle dress with frightening realism, this picture presents a little-known Shakespeare play in a novel way. <br/><br/>The producers had the good sense not to alter the language. Though drastically pared down--a twelve line speech often reduced to one--it is Shakespeare as the Bard wrote it.<br/><br/>The themes of the play are universal, transcending time: the fickleness of the mob, the jealousy and treachery of politicians, the mutual respect of men in the profession of arms even when they are adversaries, the conflicting pull of family loyalty.<br/><br/>There isn't a bad performance anywhere. Vanessa Redgrave in a series of masculine outfits has aged superbly and gives a bravura performance as the protagonist's mother. Ralph Fiennes, head shaved and scars on his face, makes a convincingly patrician Caius Martius, brave in war but unable to navigate the tricky currents of politics or win the love of the common people. He's also got that Shakespearian essential: a great voice. <br/><br/>Tall, rugged Scotsman Gerard Butler is completely convincing as his formidable enemy-- and some time comrade--the ruthless Aufidius. The supporting roles are also very competently acted with some unusual casting of a black South African as Martius' military superior and a woman as First Citizen, the voice of the plebeian class in the early Roman Republic.<br/><br/>But the highest tribute must go to Fiennes' astonishing competence as director. Battle scenes, interior scenes, crowd scenes, all are handled with the skill of a veteran cineaste such that the movie never drags, never slackens in pace from the opening food riot by the plebs which seems ripped from the headlines to the tragic and inevitable end."
"bdfphil","10","6","9","13 June 2012"," Excellent contemporary ""Coriolanus""
","For a long the and in published articles, I have maintained that ""Coriolanus"" is the most underrated of Shakespeare's tragedies, and perhaps his best. Ralph Fienne's contemporary version is ""based on"" the original text, but preserves the complex character of its eponymous hero. Though I feared a ""Coriolanus"" with machine guns and television, this updating liberates Fiennes to present Caius Martius in a much more nuanced manner than traditional portrayals would allow. Are there aspects with which I disagree? Of course--every Shakespeare lover has an ideal version in his or her mind. But this is more than a worthy one. It is a revelation. Add Vanessa Redgrave as Volumnia and Jessica Chastain as Virgilia and you have a sharp and well-drawn contrast between the public man of war and his private realm where he is well- loved by his wife and driven on by his mother. I do not understand any of the relatively negative reviews."

Save the money. Go watch something else. Grab a drink. You are going to need one after watching this. Make that two and avoid this movie and you will be alright. Whatever made the people make this kind of movie I'm sure it wasn't in any remotely good intentions. I mean, why suit people up and give them automatic weapons and make them speak Shakespearean? Whats the big idea? Confuse the living daylights out of the audience? Because the language has nothing to do with how the characters look on screen? The arrogance of Hollywood to experiment with the patience of movie goers is appalling. No wonder piracy is rampant and they need lousy laws like SOPA and ACTA to force garbage like this down our throat."

","""If Greece has taught us that marble bleeds, Rome shows us that dust flowers."" Cecil Roberts.<br/><br/>Shakespeare's tragedy, Coriolanus, directed by Ralph Fiennes, has been successfully translated to the screen, just as Richard III (1995) was by Richard Loncraine. Both productions shift the scene to modern times, and despite my prejudice about tinkering with the Bard, I liked both, in part because Fiennes is a fine Coriolanus and Ian McKellen a better than fine Richard.<br/><br/>It's modern Rome, besieged by angry citizens whose leader is Gerard Butler's Aufidius, longtime enemy of Coriolanus. When the haughty, anti-commoner Coriolanus is banished from Rome, he joins up with his old enemy to turn on Rome.<br/><br/>It seems like a perfect alliance until Coriolanus's formidable mother, Volumnia, played by Vanessa Redgrave, and his wife, VIrgilia, played by Jessica Chastain, confront him. To see the four leads on the screen, along with the reliable Brian Cox as Menenius, is to witness the best of cinema acting, although Redgrave dominates as she pleads, cajoles, and finesses her son to speak gently to the commoners and to compromise the siege.<br/><br/>There is something static about the filming, perhaps because Fiennes sees it in its Shakespearean form and himself as a theatrical performer. ""Static"" even though Fiennes relies on MTV-like quick cuts to enhance the action and perhaps mitigate the elegant prose for regular film goers.<br/><br/>The contemporary thematic parallels with the play are obvious: the puzzle that still is the Balkans, or Iraq and Iran for that matter, with families pitted against each other, the citizenry versus the military, and power another deal away.<br/><br/>But the play's the thing, and no matter how much gifted director and adapter play with the original, Shakespeare is always there with stunning dialogue, deep characterization, and humanity still crazy after all these years."

","The people of Rome are starting to revolt, they're poor, starving and desperate for grain. The police force is merciless. The guy in charge is Martius. When the Volscians threaten to invade, it's again Martius who is in charge of the military unit that meets them at the city of Corolia where he near single-handedly defeats them, not before engaging in a knife duel that ends up in a wrestling match with his sworn enemy Aufidius.<br/><br/>On his return to Rome Martius he's seen as a hero and made a senate consul with the approval of the senate. Next he has to reluctantly ask for the people's permission of sorts. They grant it only to take it back minutes later when two of their representatives who are anti-Martius convince them. These two are constantly scheming to get rid of Martius. In a meeting with these two and with the people, he flips out and starts cursing at the people. When he has to apologize to a live audience on TV again he loses it. That gets him banished from Rome much to the delight of the two schemers.<br/><br/>He does what any reasonable person would do...join forces with the person he hates the most, Aufidius, to take over Rome by force. The Romans send some politician/family friend to convince Martius, who now is a leader among the Volscians, to reconsider, but he won't have any of it. Next they send his mother, wife, and son, to beg for mercy for Rome. He agrees to sign a peace treaty, but that doesn't win him any friends anywhere.<br/><br/>Coriolanus starts out as a modern war/conflict movie with a social message. What initially looks like foreign actors speaking in broken English actually turns out to be Shakesperan English and the entire movie is spoken that way. I've never heard it, but it definitely takes some getting used to, perhaps an hour or so into the movie one gets the hang of it. Unfortunately, that is the biggest drawback of this movie. I guess those with literary inclination feel right at home. I didn't. I didn't find this English beautiful at all. To my ears it sounds like English spoken in Latin grammar. And it's not so much that it's sophisticated and we the viewers are a bunch of dummies. It's just old English, with words forms that are out of usage and with a very cumbersome sentence structure. This forces also the characters to stand there and give speeches to no one in particular making the movie more like a theater piece.<br/><br/>But there are more problems. Martius is very dislikable. He thinks of himself as noble and vastly superior to the common folk. He's a war hawk, childishly uncompromising even when his life is at stake, and holds on to his beliefs like they're religious dogma. So how are we to root for this guy or care about his fate? Especially when his enemy is so much more likable. The story itself is nothing special either. At every step of the way he gets what he deserves. What is interesting though is the political structure, which I assume is based on how Rome worked. Political intrigue is also always entertaining.<br/><br/>Coriolanus is an ambitious and audacious project. It wouldn't surprise me if the intended audience loved it. But I suspect its aim is to go beyond that group and introduce others to Shakespeare, tragedy, and so on. In that regard it failed. It's too long a movie, and I take it too faithful to the original text. Had they settled for a more updated English it could have been a bit better. For instance the English spoken in Spartacus is truly beautiful and would have been ideal for Coriolanus. Tightening the script would also have helped as so much is said that doesn't say anything and doesn't advance the story in any way."

","I enjoyed this version a lot. I wasn't that familiar with the Coriolanus plot so it was interesting to see the story develop about a very good general who becomes a very bad politician.<br/><br/>The film uses Shakespeare's dialogue but it is set in modern times. However it still resonated for me as we see the influence of populist politics and politicians in the affairs of state.<br/><br/>The plot is about a general who wins a great victory and is selected to be the next consul of Rome. However he regards the ordinary people with little more than contempt and his obvious discomfort in even pretending to compromise in this belief results in his banishment. There is a great scene set in a TV studio where Coriolans confronts those opposed to him in something not far removed from the Jerry Springer show. He then unites with a former enemy of Rome in order to gain his revenge.<br/><br/>I'm not Fiennes' biggest fan and I thought he over egged the pudding in a few of his speeches. Too much spittle and not enough subtlety perhaps, though the character of Coriolanus is not a very subtle man, either as a soldier or as a politician.<br/><br/>I loved Vanessa Redgrave as his powerful and influential mother. Brian Cox is also excellent as the decent Senator. Gerard Butler is also good as Coriolanus' sworn enemy turned ally, Aufidius.<br/><br/>The movie uses the familiar setting (from TV news) of modern war zones to demonstrate Coriolanus' best characteristics as a fearless soldier.<br/><br/>An excellent version of one of Shakepeare's lesser known plays"

To continue with that interpretive path was smart and I held my breath in anticipation as the opening credits unfolded, mimicking news coverage. Very savvy, very current. I truly love Shakespeare's work but I can't stand when it's butchered and completely misunderstood by the likes of this ridiculous actor. He had no grace of nuance, none in his delivery and certainly none in his movement. The emotion had no context and that was really distracting. There was a moment when I thought the movie would be saved because there are some scenes where the actors seem to get it like in the first News Talk Show scene. But alas... And there were so many missed opportunities. No continuity at all. It's like the Actor MGR. just yelled over the P.A. ""Think of an accent, any accent! Now use that one!"" It's really confusing when Australian actors have a Scottish accent and American actors speak with Monty Python accents. No context. It's distracting. They're supposed to be in Rome, why not Italian accents? It's Shakespeare; why not English accents? It's a modern day interpretation, why not every one speak they're own voice? They obviously needed a dialect coach. LA Times says they kept the syntax while upgrading the rest. Yeah but see, not everyone did that. There were some actors that really delivered their lines but Ralphie boy didn't even play to his strengths. It's obvious he's not very self-aware. This is a story of duplicity so when the words do not match the emotion you can never tell where this guy was coming from because Fiennes is all over the place trying to topple William Shatner for the most over-acting-est actor there ever was.

","Some stories don't translate to modernity completely, and Coriolanus is a sad example. This is not a movie for the common person, and would really only appeal to die hard Shakespeare fans. Director Ralph Finnes attempts to place the story of Coriolanus in the modern setting of contemporary Rome. So instead of chivalrous sword play, the actors duke it out with tanks and AK-47's. This is intercut with quiet segments bogged down by copious stilted dialogue in a thick Elizabethan voice. What results is a loud, incomprehensible mess that is physically and intellectually difficult to digest, and wholly unbelievable, given its modern setting.<br/><br/>Other filmmakers attempt to snap audiences out of a passive receptive mode of viewing by using unusual visual devices or atypical storytelling. A voice de-synched from the speaker, surrealist imagery, non-linear story lines; these distance the audience while simultaneously encouraging them to actively analyze the film. Coriolanus' is a one trick pony that relies on Shakespeare's eloquence to get it through.<br/><br/>Doesn't work, sorry. Because of the language, none of the characters has any distinct voice or characterization. If everyone wore a mask, you wouldn't be able to tell one character from another. It's unclear why the central event happens, and characters, lacking a rational modern motivation, end up as caricatures.<br/><br/>Performances by Vanessa Redgrave and Brian Cox stand out convincingly. You can't tell what they're saying, but conviction reads intelligibly enough on their faces.<br/><br/>It's freaking war - why don't they just shoot each other, instead of fighting with knives?? Sexual tension, intended or not, comes through quite thick; not that I complain. Enemies suddenly become friends for no apparent reason and vice versa.

Quite to the contrary. This is the often astounding product of a man who has thought through Shakespeare's play, seen in it what is powerful and very relevant to our own times, and brought that power out with at times almost overwhelming force. I don't know that I have ever seen a movie that boiled over with more testosterone than this one; it puts Schwarzenegger's movies to shame in that respect. Over and over I marveled at how Fienes found modern-day moments that were, in fact, modern equivalents of the scenes Shakespeare set in Classical Rome.<br/><br/>And yet, there is the greatest respect for Shakespeare's words. They are delivered with astounding clarity, yet in such a way that they sound like almost modern speech, rather than poetry that is 400 years old. There Fienes and Vanessa Redgrave are the true stars. Their every word seems natural, yet delivered in a way that gives all the power and beauty to Shakespeare's verse.<br/><br/>If you hated Shakespeare in high school, you need to see this movie. Trust me, this is not the Shakespeare you had foisted off on you then. This is a masterful interpretation of what has always been treated as a minor Shakespeare play, so masterful that it must make us wonder if we have been misjudging it for four centuries."

","I'm happy to admire any adaptation of classic literature for the screen that has the best intentions; Romeo and Juliet, for example. However, what the writers and crew must learn is that they are making a film for a 21st century audience, and while many adaptations are made successfully - such as the simple things like era, politics, etc - the adherence to Ye Olde English was a disastrous and terrible choice. The actors are well motivated and there are stars galore, but what good is this when nothing can be made sense of in any conversation throughout the film? I feel awful for the non-English speaking viewers, even a European who has learnt English as a second language will be left for dead trying to figure out what's being said. Of course, you'll pick up key words in among the dozens of ""thous"" and ""thees"" and discern an idea of what's going on, but for the most part you'll be left watching Ralph Fiennes and his Scottish nemesis utter poetry with their best grimaces for two hours relying only on visual cues to understand the plot. This adaptation also loses touch with reality in trying to take Renaissance violence and apply the same scenes to 21st Century conflict. Scenes such as the early bare-knuckle showdown in which the two sworn enemies peel away their armour and throw down in the middle of a ongoing urban battle, Queensbury Rules style, had me cringing in embarrassment for the screenwriter. I gave up after an hour. I usually watch any film - no matter how bad - to the end, to give it a fair opportunity to overcome early shortcomings. However, when presented with a film full of dialogue that only a Yale English professor can understand, what point is there waiting for the end to a story that you can't follow to begin with? Coriolanus' problem is not its actors, its production, its director or its story - it was the unwillingness for the writer to swallow his pride and make a true remodelling of a classic story for contemporary audiences. Hopefully it is a lesson learnt."

","Finally, after over 50 film versions of Hamlet, someone ventures into new Shakespearean territory, bringing the Bard's last tragedy, Coriolanus, to the big screen for the first time. Some may complain it's a lesser work- as if they want more of the same, and showing the audacity to pan Shakespeare- and specifically the play TS Eliot considered the Man from Stratford's greatest! In truth, Coriolanus is a perfect play for times of political turmoil, probably simpler than Hamlet but rich in its conflict, with international war tied up in domestic politics. We have a protagonist who heroically serves his country, but his tragic flaw is his anti-social nature and smugness that makes him unpopular at home.<br/><br/>We can see the decision was made to recast the play, based in ancient Rome, to the modern era. It's a device we've seen before with Romeo and Juliet (1996) and Hamlet (2000), and while it would seem appropriate to place the first Coriolanus film in its own time, the story translates to an age of media and modern warfare relatively well. Slate magazine considered the argument that placing Coriolanus in a new setting and making it work proves it is Shakespeare's greatest play. However, the magazine rejected that argument, noting Hamlet has been placed in every setting imaginable. Certainly, Macbeth as well has been adaptable- Orson Welles transported it to the 19th century Caribbean, while Akira Kurosawa brought it to feudal Japan. While this film may not prove Coriolanus is the best of Shakespeare's plays, it nevertheless reflects that the neglected play is brilliant.<br/><br/>Fiennes' film has a strong look and helps the viewer feel some of the intense conflict, though it's not a great film. Reading the play for the first time this week, I felt the politics were a lot more gripping than what was brought to the film. Ideally, Fiennes' film might encourage other filmmakers to make their attempts at more successfully adapting Coriolanus, or bring it back to its original setting. Alas, the poor box office performance of this film will likely discourage that- but I still salute Fiennes for his effort."
"The-Sarkologist","10","3","5","1 September 2012"," Another fine adaptation of one of the master's works
","I really do like the Shakespeare plays that have been moved into a more modern setting, and it is even better when the play that is selected, such as this play, is one that is not well known. The reason I say this is because plays are designed to be performed rather than read and as such they are much easier to follow when they are performed. This is something that I have found time and again when I have had the pleasure of seeing a play performed that I have previously read. One such play was Marlow's Dr Faust, and then I had the pleasure of discovering that Fiennes had decided to make a movie adaptation of this play.<br/><br/>Coriolanus is one of Shakespeare's Roman plays and it was originally based on the Plutarch biography of the same name. The play is set during the Roman Republican period at a time before it had spread out much beyond the Italian peninsula. At the time the Republic was facing a number of crises, including a food shortage and border wars with the Volscians. Coriolanus (not his original name, but a name that was given to him in honour of his service to the Republic) is a general in the army, and begins performing civil duties in quelling food riots that are erupting throughout the city. When another border war with the Volscians flares up, he takes his legions and invades the city of Coriolus and captures it for Rome.<br/><br/>As is typical of the Romans, his victory is honoured with a triumph, and he is then elected counsel (the Roman equivalent of President). However being elected consul is not easy thing, because while the Senate may nominate the consul, the people must ratify it. The problem for Coriolanus is that he does not love the people, he is a patrician through and through, and does not hide it. While at first the people do accept him, his enemies the Tribunes (representatives of the people) sway them back to rejecting him. In response, Coriolanus rejects his home and flees to the Volscians and joins forces with them to have his revenge upon the Republic.<br/><br/>This play deals with the age old conflict that exists between the plebeians (common folk) and the patricians (wealthy folk) and we see this conflict played out every day on the streets of our modern cities. One of the reasons that many of these plays are brought into the modern world is that not only do they make Shakespeare more accessible to modern audiences, they also highlight the timelessness of these plays. As was suggested by one commentary, the modern images of this play, and the news footages (which were done really well) show how the problems that faced ancient Rome can and still face our cities and our people today.<br/><br/>The other theme of this play is the tragedy of the hero turned traitor. Once again I dispute that Coriolanus had a fatal flaw, but rather it was the decisions that he made that brought about his downfall. The purpose of joining the enemy was purely one of vengeance, and unless he managed to destroy Rome, this alliance was never going to work. It is made clear, time and time again, that Aufidius and Coriolanus were bitter enemies: they hated each other, so for Coriolanus to think that he could then easily join Aufidius in an assault upon Rome and not meet a bad ending is the epitome of foolishness.<br/><br/>Finally, this film further shows that Shakespeare can and is incredibly violent, however in being brought to the screen, the violence is intensified so much more. One can do a lot more on the screen than can ever be done on the stage, and while it takes an awful lot of talent to be able to successfully translate a Shakespearian play from the stage to the screen, I believe that Fiennes has been very successful in doing so."

","People who complain about this play being set in modern times are missing a vital fact about Shakespeare himself: he set Julius Cesar in Roman times, but yet his soldiers yell ""fire"" in battle, the actors often wore Elisabethan battledress, not togas, and they speak of the ""clock striking""...long before Rome had striking clocks. If William were alive today, his actors would wear modern dress. There's nothing sacred about chainmail and doublets.<br/><br/>Now for the film. It's a pared-down streamlined version of the play, which as Fiennes himself says was done to get to the story and circumvent somewhat what he called ""the density of the language."" I found some of the camera work jittery and annoying, particularly when the jumpy scenes occur outside the context of media reporting. However, within the context of the production, it worked. I found it gripping, in that it made the brutality of war and rebellion a reality for the viewer. <br/><br/>I have studied Coriolanus at university and it was never one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, nor even my favourite of the tragedies. However in this production it's plain that Coriolanus' arrogance and self-righteousness is his downfall; as someone once said: God deliver us from men who ""know"" they're right! There's a definite resonance Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"" in several scenes.<br/><br/>Vanessa Redgrave gives a sterling performance as Volumnia, the she-wolf who whelped the dragon. You can definitely see where Sonny Boy got his pride. Their face-off is a wonderful piece of staging."

The acting is excellent from everyone in the film as well.<br/><br/>A word of caution: this is not an action film. There are action sequences, which are very well done, but if you are looking for an action packed war-film, this is not it. This is a drama about a the idealism of a soldier and his revenge against the city that he felt betrayed his service."
"Paranoyia","3","11","29","28 February 2012"," Shakespeare can do no wrong... WRONG!
","The assumption that William Shakespeare is a god amongst men is just about as absurd as it sounds. Yes, he is an exceptional writer. Yes, he did make some amazing plays, ""Hamlet"" being the pinnacle of his writing career. And yes, he is just about as fallible as everybody else.<br/><br/>Shakespeare's greatest asset is, without a doubt, his ability to utilize the English language to nearly its absolute maximum. However, he often falls into a trap of ""lazy writing"" in his stories. ""Coriolanus"" is a perfect example of that. William just didn't think it through well enough with all the consequences as a result.<br/><br/>There are two major plot holes in the play. Aufidius declares eternal vengeance against Martius (but not Rome, for some reason), but then embraces him as a brother once Martius decides to defect. Really? Eternal vengeance is something one doesn't declare lightly. Not only that, but Aufidius gives Martius half his army to do as he pleases. In my opinion, it would have made a lot more sense if Aufidius swore vengeance against Rome, whilst respecting Martius as a worthy adversary.<br/><br/>The second plot hole is basically the same as the first. After being exiled, Martius then Coriolanus, swears bloody vendetta against the citizens of Rome. Nearing the end of the campaign his mother comes to him in order to plead for mercy. He submits... Really? Bloody vendetta is not something one declares lightly... Again.<br/><br/>Coriolanus as a character is probably the worst. He's a whining mommy's boy, despite looking tough. Not once, but twice had he been screwed over by his mother's wishes. The first time being her attempt at making a politician out of a soldier. Oedipus complex, anybody?<br/><br/>Other than that, the story could have been really good. Just change the antagonist's motivations and mutate the ending by, you know, locking your family in a cell whilst you burn all the Rome in your quest for revenge. Problem?<br/><br/>As for the film itself. The idea of Shakespearian plays being integrated into the modern world works just about as well as ""Warhammer 40k"" with orcs and ""elves"" running around, wielding swords and plasma guns. What's the word for it again? Ah, I remember: ""stupid"". Not to mention that it is really, really overdone. Ralph Fiennes didn't bring anything new to the table. Even ""Romeo + Juliet"" was better, at least it was executed a lot more competently in its cinematography.<br/><br/>Acting is good though, but both Fiennes and Butler are decent actors, so no surprises there.<br/><br/>In the end nor the movie, nor the play it was based upon are that good. A grave Shakespearian stamp on this work should not make it immune to criticism. And it won't make it so, not as long as you and I dare to think for ourselves."

"Lloyd-23","7","6","14","28 January 2012"," See it on the small screen. Great play, good script, decent acting, dreadful camera-work.
","Coriolanus is arguably Shakespeare's greatest play. I recall seeing it for the first time and being blown away by it. I thought that perhaps the Royal Shakespeare Company had altered it to make it seem more modern, but the words were the original bard's. This film sets the action in the modern world, and it does so successfully. Many of the words explaining events come in the form of televised newscasts, soldiers ride around on tanks and wear camouflage clothing, characters talk to each other on telephones, politicians wear suits, and public debates happen in television studios. All this is fine because the play's themes are so very modern.<br/><br/>Naturally, the film script shortens the wordiness of the play, and naturally this has the effect of heightening the importance of some aspects, while diminishing others. The screenplay puts emphasis on the character of Coriolanus' mother, and the direction and acting suggests that Tullus Aufidius is to some degree attracted sexually to the eponymous hero. One theme oddly neglected, especially given the use of television in the film, is the fickleness of the common people. The later stages of the film never involve the common crowds of Rome again.<br/><br/>The cast is good. The accents are a strange and unexplained mixture (Scottish, Northern Irish, English, as well as some Mediterranean ones) but this is of little consequence given that ancient Rome was probably also a mix, and the disjuncture of modern artefacts and archaic English is far greater.<br/><br/>Now I come to the camera-work. The picture quality is very poor. My eyes tell me that it was not shot on film. There are many scenes deliberately low-quality, made to resemble television broadcasts, but even the scenes with the highest picture quality are a vague haze of visible pixels. When I pay to go to the cinema, I expect decent picture quality, and a large screen shows up every failing. The style of camera-work is that trendy 'reality television'/documentary style which involves wobbling the camera around a lot in supposed simulation of improvisation. This is almost always overdone, and in this case in some scenes the cameraman seems to be having an epileptic fit, and the picture will probably give you less of a headache on a smaller screen (which will also not show you the pixels so clearly).<br/><br/>Another very annoying thing about the camera-work is that someone seems to have made the decision that a shallow depth of field is a good thing. Many of the shots are slightly out of focus, which is annoying (but will show less on the small screen). Worse, in the intense shots of actors faces in close-up, delivering key lines of dialogue, the camera should focus the mind of the audience on the expression of the actor's face and the meaning of the words he speaks. Actors move as they perform, and when the depth of field is this shallow, it becomes a great distraction that one notices that the tips of the actor's eyelashes are sharp, while the roots of them and his pupil are a blur.<br/><br/>I recommend this film, mainly because it showcases a terrific play which deserves to be far better known. I also recommend seeing it on DVD. Given how bad the picture quality is, I suspect that the makers thought that they were shooting for a television release of the film, and that the demands of the big cinema screen were not considered important."

","Coriolanus proves once again what I have always felt about Ralph Fiennes. He is not only a great actor but someone who is capable of doing so much more. Thankfully he has shown glimpses of that in Coriolanus. The movie certainly has its flaws but on the whole it is much better that what the others are peddling currently as movies. I personally feel that Ralph Fiennes needs at least a couple of more movies to mature and after that his talent as a Director can come to fruition.It felt nice to watch a well made action movie after such a long time. The performances of Vanessa Redgrave and Fiennes are impressive but Gerald Butler like always disappoints."

"david-meldrum","7","3","6","12 April 2014"," Lots of guts, tension and drama; short on heart.
","Coriolanus is a long way from being one of Shakespeare's most accessible plays. The Roman plays in general have a not entirely fair reputation for being full of long speeches and low on plot; it's tempting to meet the title with a shrugged 'who' (or 'what'?); it's not a very regularly performed play anyway, so it doesn't have many opportunities to make a bid for the limelight. <br/><br/>So on the face of it this is strange choice of material for Ralph Fiennes on his directorial debut; especially when you consider that he's also the star. In Fiennes and his adapter's hands the play becomes a sleek, streamlined political drama with visceral action sequences Transported to ""a place calling itself Rome"" that plays more like a wartime Bosnia. Coriolanus is heroic general, feted with praise and encouraged, or forced, by his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) to seek the powerful position of Consul. He finds himself unable to play the political games with the people required to get the post; his anger on not getting the position leads to a riot and exile. In exile he forms an alliance with former enemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) in order to take revenge. <br/><br/>It's a tense and gripping watch; the new setting lends greater immediacy and sense of threat, the edits give clean lines a plot that fairly zips along. The action sequences are fine; not outstanding, but suitably brutal to maintain the law of the jungle sense of ancient Rome. The air is suffused with testosterone, with men not backing down from each other. The female characters are cleverly dressed to look more military, if not masculine then at the least not emphasizing femininity. This is a male environment, with the smoke of combat never far away. That approach explains the choice of Gerard Butler for the role of Tullus; which would make sense if he didn't appear so dramatically out of his depth. He alone amongst the cast doesn't seem comfortable with the language, brooding too much and forgetting to back-up his physical presence with words that are threatening or venomous. <br/><br/>Which is a huge contrast to Fiennes in the lead role. Battle-scarred and, for most of the film, bloodied, when he's not fighting he's a caged tiger. It's clear why men will follow him into battle; haranguing bullet-ridden corpses for a lack of commitment, his men fight for and with their leader. It makes sense of his unwillingness to stay around to hear the story of his exploits; this is a man of deeds, not words. When he's finally bought face-to-face with his estranged family in a climactic showdown he's largely silence, trying to keep a crumbling facade in place.<br/><br/>Which all works well as far as plot and the themes of power and alpha masculinity go, but does mean that the film has precious little emotional heft; even in a denouement which should at the least brush the heart, it becomes more of an action movie showdown with much better dialogue. It seems a hard criticism, but ultimately it's the fruit of the understandable choices made with the plot and style of the film. The updating convinces; the drama grips; the action impresses. It's just a shame there's not more heart to go with all the guts."
"howard.schumann","7","3","6","29 April 2013"," Dramatically inert
","The 2011 Ralph Fiennes-directed film of William Shakespeare's Coriolanus is updated from its ancient Roman origins to a modern day battlefield that could easily be Iran or Afghanistan. This is done presumably to try and make it more ""relevant"" to an audience raised on non-stop mayhem. At the core of the story are several relationships. The main one is between Caius Martius (Ralph Fiennes) and the Roman citizens. Martius, now called ""Coriolanus"" because of his victory against the Volscians at Corioles, seeks political office as a member of the Roman Consul on the urging of his mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave). With less than striking political acumen, however, he dismisses the masses with disdain (perhaps as the 47% who would never vote for him), saying that allowing citizens to have power over the senators is like allowing ""crows to peck the eagles,"" not a sure-fire way of getting elected.<br/><br/>As a consequence of his attitude, two tribunes Brutus (Paul Jesson) and Sicinius (James Nesbitt), stir up the masses against him (not a hard sell), brand him as a traitor, and banish him from Rome. Another relationship is between Coriolanus and his adversary, Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) whom he seems to admire and who he joins forces with to march on Rome after he is banished. A third is the one between Coriolanus and his mother (Vanessa Redgrave), who is sent, along with Coriolanus' wife Virgilia (Jessica Chastain) and his son, to persuade him not to take up arms against Rome. Coriolanus, on his knees, succumbs to the appeals of ""mommy dearest,"" but it his pride and arrogance that will cause his undoing.<br/><br/>Fiennes does not hesitate to use the equivalent of CNN ""Breaking News"" to provide the audience with a running television commentary of what is taking place, though one would hope with more accuracy than what we have seen of late from cable news. Ultimately, however, the film seems unable to bridge the gap between the incongruity of AK-47s firing 30-magazine rounds and the eloquence and humanity of William Shakespeare, and Fiennes dramatically inert and mannered performance does not help it out."

","Coriolanus (2011) Ralph Fiennes, Gerard Butler, Vanessa Redgrave, Brian Cox. I downloaded this as soon as it came on Pay-Per-View and watched it last week two times. The second time I took some notes. Both times I used sub-titles so I would not miss any of the dialog - Shakespears words spoken by a wonderful cast.<br/><br/>This play is so topical it could be right out of todays headlines. The opening scenes are of the poor, hungry, citizens rioting against black-booted, helmeted government troops. The young woman yells ""we are considered poor citizens; the patricians good. Our suffering is a game to them."" The OWS message - the 1% against the 99%, with the armies made to serve the 1%.<br/><br/>But our hero is having none of any of it - he hates the citizens and the patricians. What he loves is the war and valor. He goes to battle against his enemy, Volsce leader, Tullus Aufidius, and takes the city of Corioles and is given the honorific name Coriolanus. Fiennes is very good with the permanent sneer this Coriolanus feels for most mortals.<br/><br/>Redgrave as his warrior Mother is good, but the character is a hypocrite. She WANTS him to have large scars - to prove his valor. But also wants him to play the game with the senate - cow-tow to win favor. He can't do it. <br/><br/>The 99% riot again and he wants full power and they won't give it to him. He says of the people, who are these ""crows to peck the eagles"". Menenius says ""You are ambitions!"" So he leaves the city and joins up with his enemy, Tullas Aufidius, to march on Rome. <br/><br/>Cox is my pick to get acting honors. Much more than Redgrave, he embodies the noble and the deviousness of the patricians. He makes you feel the tragedy you are seeing. <br/><br/>Butler as the Volscian leader is quiet and strong. The battle with knives between he and Coriolanus is exciting. Butler has such presence, when he is on screen you watch him, even when he does nothing and is in the background. As with the great Steve McQueen, he just IS. He needs no dialog. <br/><br/>Entertaining and also quite good. 8/10"
"luigisib","8","3","6","14 March 2012"," Coriolanus - Fienne's impressive debut
","Ralph Fiennes directorial debut takes Shakespeare's primal, violent and politically Avant-garde text and reattributes it, similarly to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet (1996) or even, though more loosely, Kurosawa's Throne of Blood (1957). Fiennes shows a flare for rousing melodrama both in his direction and acting, though it must be said that, for obvious reasons, his acting is far more mature and honed than his admittedly confided and promising direction. Stylistically the film owes a very clear debt to the likes of Michael Mann's Heat (1995) and Mann's long time DP, Dante Spinotti in its use of hand-held camera. The problem with Barry Ackroyd's photography, and this also refers to his work on The Hurt Locker (2008) despite the Academy Award, is that he doesn't capture the nuances and believability found in Mann's best works. Instead the cinematography can come across as slightly silly as opposed to the gruelling intensity too clearly being strived for. This makes apparent the flaw of all too many films nowadays that have the camera as a character more so than an observing force. Of course this makes sense in mockumentaries as most recognisably seen in the likes of The Blair Witch Project (1999) and Cloverfield (2008). Another area the film slips up in is its descents into unnecessary and poorly-judged machismo. Whether or not such segments are intentionally homoerotic and rife with phallic imagery as a form of meditation or ironic statement on the brotherhood and nature of war and soldiers is irrelevant. It simply doesn't work, instead coming across as childish and obtuse.<br/><br/>Where the film does excel is clearly in it acting and crucially in its delivery of Shakespeare's tale and language. The film opts for an ambiguous European setting in the struggle between liberal and more conservative powers while rebel forces lead by Tullus Aufidius, surprisingly well-played by Gerald Butler if slightly one-note, are priming an invasion of Rome, in name only. The Shakespearian dialect flows from the likes of Vanessa Redgrave and Brian Cox never feeling intrusive or out of place. This is where the film really succeeds. If the audience is not willing to buy into the very particular dialect then no matter how relevant and kinetic you make the narrative, no matter how Black Hawk Down-esque you make the action sequences (of which, it must be said, there are fewer than a handful), there will always be a degree of the intended audience that will have no intension of seeing anything with the slightest hint of Shakespearean language. This raises the question: Is Coriolanus worthy of mass mainstream penetration in much the same way Romeo + Juliet did? With the competence and flare of its presentation, it should, yes. However, where Luhrmann's film had beautiful, young romantics that wouldn't let anything stand between their love, Fienne's effort has an angry, intentionally un-charismatic, (mostly) bald man caught up in politics both personal and national. Audience or not, Coriolanus shows how relevant and thrilling Shakespeare can be when delivered with dynamism, conviction and backed by unquestionable talent."

I find traditional versions that endeavor to recreate what it might have looked like at the Globe Theatre four hundred years ago distract me in the quest to come to terms with the central ideas. Using television news shows rather than town criers and anglo versions of a Greek chorus allow me to immerse myself in the narrative. <br/><br/>And the narrative is compelling. The Roman senators re-imagined as sleazy, poll reading, PR spin purveying, party machine men might have stepped out of a news - current affairs TV show. They are instantly recognisable. (Dare I say that Australians may see parallels with their own Labor politicians who would rather retain a nuts and bolts, get things done, transactional leader they liked working with than re-instate a transformative, if somewhat arrogant and aloof, former leader?)<br/><br/>I find clock watching tends to beset me in most Shakespearian productions. This one had me engrossed, occasionally laughing out loud at some of the depictions of recognizable human weakness and folly. Everyone involved in this film - writers, actors, director - everyone - deserves credit for that<br/><br/>And then there is that wise and knowing, yet disappointing culmination. Do the right thing, swallow your pride, seek greatness of spirit and human mercy, and if one pack of bastards don't get you, the others will.<br/><br/>And the relevance of TS Eliot's Waste Land quote? If you have seen the film or play, ""Tom and Viv"", you will know that one possible interpretation of the poem is a surrealistic re-telling of the poet's disastrous marriage and its breakdown. Maybe Eliot saw himself as Coriolanus, exiled by those he sought to defend, knifed by those he delivered from tyranny, taking his last breaths. It's the never-ending story.

","Roughly 10 years ago I was in London and saw Fiennes play Coriolanus on stage (directed by Jonathan Kent, I think) in a theatre that was where Hitchcock had filmed The Lady Vanishes. Fiennes and the entire production were knockouts. I even remember the way his helmet merged with the shadow of his cheeks and his eyebrows. Wow, this was powerful! The movie version, in modern costume, was good, but instead of the modern costuming and artillery making things more real to us in the 21st century, they just called attention to the cleverness of Fiennes the director. Besides, as another reviewer said, people today simply don't talk like people at time Shakespeare wrote the play. Fiennes, toning his voice down for the screen so as not to rant, toned Coriolanus down as well. He was good, no mistake about that, but on stage he was great. A few weeks after I saw the movie I saw the DVD of the BBC's Coriolanus with Alan Howard as the lead. Better than wow! Howard was fantastically good--far better than Fiennes on screen. And Gerard Butler, in the Fiennes film, was no match for Mike Gwylim in the BBC film. I don't remember who played Menenius in the Fiennes film, but in the BBC film Joss Ackland was superb (and did not overact, as he sometimes does, e.g., Citizen X). You don't have to Balkanize Shakespeare to make him pertinent. In the original context, the pertinence shines through better. Coriolanus's battle with himself about the citizens and with the citizens was more understandable without the modern costumes (today, the issues would be different). OK, so the BBC version didn't have the budget for big battles. So what? I honestly don't remember Fiennes asking his wife for ""A kiss. Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge,"" but that may be my bad memory (I even forgot the line was in the play) or Fiennes underdoing it too much. But when Howard spoke that line, it was memorable! Do yourselves a favor and try to see the BBC Coriolanus with the great Alan Howard. If you don't agree with me, you'll at least have seen a viable alternative to Fiennes's movie Coriolanus."

","Ralph Fiennes can fall into similar pool of talented performers who can also have a knack at direction just like Robert Redford, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood. In his directorial debut, ""Coriolanus"" Fiennes combines a Shakespeare film that anyone can grasp at. Even if you don't have a degree in Shakespearean literature. In his 30 year career, Fiennes has built an impressive reputation of really getting emotionally deep into his characterizations and going out of way to make the complexities of his characters something to get his audience a reason to root for. His direction has similar traits to his performances. The film explores the strengths and vulnerabilities of his character along with the many triumphs and failures while keeping his characters look and feel real.<br/><br/>Fiennes stars as Caius Martius Coriolanus, a mighty but questionable general in the Roman army. During a altercation with a rival army brigade, he goes beyond protocol that cause his civil liberties to be in doubt. An activist elite wants Coriolanus evicted for his violations. For his heroic accomplishments, his supportive mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave) suggests he be ranked to the position to the high office of the Consul. But he must get support of from the destitute who were the ones most affected by his questionable deeds. Many people want him to reach out and restore peace which also includes his wife Virgilia (Jessica Chastain). He agrees to get support, but the activists don't want any of that. Feeling rejected from those he stood up for, Coriolanus joins forces with his enemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler). The consequences come into play once these two form an alliance.<br/><br/>I may feel like a complete idiot, but I may as well make confession to all of you. I have always had trouble deciphering Shakespeare. The language and the lingo was all so complex. Even simple tales like ""Romeo and Juliet"" are hard to fully translate. On the plus side, ""Coriolanlus"" was quite easy to get invested in. Thanks to the script from John Logan his technical skills make it easy to get under without insulting our intelligence. In various scenes, mock TV newscasts appear to gather updates during the coarse of the action. A real added treat is that some of the characters actually speak in more modernized language so that not all Shakespearean literature geniuses will be lost in translation. The actors also contribute to the worthy cause by generating emotions that are effective and their language tones are clear enough so that we can care about the characters while the performers understand that we're not living in the 16th century and our language has altered a bit over the years for better or worse.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is quite remarkable. Fiennes is just genuinely jacked up as the titular character. His rage and intensity sends chills as he plays a man who doesn't act, but demands our respect. If you put this guy down in any way, vengeance will be just a motion away whether you deserved it or not. Fiennes is just powerfully scary. Redgrave is equally ambitious as his mother who is there at all times for her son. In an extended scene, we see Volumnia trying to get some sense into Coriolanus, but her efforts end up becoming ostracized. Butler as Tullus Aufidius is just the perfect foil of an adversary to Coriolanus. There clashes are fierce with neither of them backing down. Jessica Chastain and Brian Cox show get support as Coriolanus' boss and his trusty confidant are brilliant in their respected performances.<br/><br/>It must've took a lot of work to adapt a Shakespearean story told in modern times. But Fiennes and Logan manage to accomplish that by finding the theme while modernizing the scenarios for our viewing pleasures. The action scenes are plugged in fantastically to keep us over the edge and supports the plot flawlessly. In our lifetimes, we had very powerful figures and they all shared one thing we all strive for, to earn respect. People have not always made choices to seek our approval without concern of who will face the consequences. We've been victims under leaders who have been barbarians, psychopaths and cynics. The film explore all those surfaces which makes it very symbolic and accurate.<br/><br/>Well executed cinematography, perfectly placed editing and very well performed, ""Coriolanus"" went beyond my expectations to being a very entertaining film. The intense atmosphere will likely suck you in. It might help that you understand Shakespeare to get the grasp of the story. If you don't understand the old English of Shakespeare, fear not, the Bard's work are still effective while also has the liberal license to offer new approaches to the classic play. This is clearly a great adaptation to a Shakespearean classic."

","Ralph Fiennes, a famous British actor, recently decided to step behind the camera. For his debut he chose an adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy ""Coriolanus"". It's a story of Roman general Caius Martius and his downfall. Martius is a member of Roman high society who looks down upon common people considering them a primitive, uneducated mob. After a victory over his arch-nemesis Tullus Aufidius from the Volscian army for which he is given a title ""Coriolanus"", Martius runs for Consul. But some of the tribunes don't have it in their best interest for him to be elected so they decide to use his well known contempt for people and short temper, and pit him against those who must acknowledge him as a consul, leading to his banishment from Rome. Once banished, his resentment for Rome grows so big he goes to Aufidius and offers him help in conquering the city.<br/><br/>All of the dialogue in the movie is Shakespearean and you can easily imagine warriors in their armor with swords and shields, as well as Roman senators and tribunes walking around in their togas. But here comes the interesting part. The movie transports the story in our present (or at least some variation of it), so instead of swords we have guns and instead of senators walking around we see them driving in cars. That modern setting emphasizes the parallels with the current situation in the world, where the gap between the rich and the poor becomes wider and wider and common people complain against those in power. But the movie does something even more interesting. It shows that people, how ever smart every one of them might be, when put in a group fall under the influence of mass mentality and need guidance. The question is, is it better for them to be led by someone with sweet words but selfish mind or someone who looks on them from above but is smart and noble. It seems that Shakespeare gives us such flawed candidates on purpose, suggesting the imperfection of the world we live in and showing us we'll often have to choose between two evils.<br/><br/>But the movie isn't just about showing us the flaws of the system or mass mentality. It also focuses on the relationship between Martius and his dominant mother Volumnia, which feels almost incestuous. There's a scene in which Virgilia, his wife, walks in on Volumnia nurturing his wounds, and withdraws with shame like she caught two lovers in the act. But the power his mother has over him, shaped Martius as a person of many contradictions and ultimately made him sacrifice himself for the city he wanted to destroy.<br/><br/>Although the first half of the movie is filled with gunfire and explosions, it's a full-blooded tragedy with larger-than-life characters, pompous dialogues and some, presumably deliberate, overacting from Vanessa Redgrave and Ralph Fiennes in the roles of mother and son. Placing the plot in a modern setting, Fiennes adds a kind of post-apocalyptic feel to the tragedy and makes a 400 years old story feel fresh in spite of Shakespearean language. Beside Redgrave and Fiennes, I should point out Brian Cox as Menenius, one of the senators, as well as Jessica Chastain as Virgilia. The role of Aufidius is played by Gerard Butler, who, I feel, lacks the conviction of the others, and is one of the movie's weakest points.<br/><br/>""Coriolanus"" is an interesting, if not completely successful, experiment. Though the Shakespearean element can be difficult for most, it pays off once you get accustomed to it, creating a unique experience. Fiennes has done a very good job and I can't wait to see his take on Charles Dickens' life in ""The Invisible Woman"". However, I hope there won't be any machine gun fire and driving around in cars this time.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"

","I started reading about Coriolanus after listening to the Coriolan Overture of Beethoven when I bumped into the Shakespeare's play and finally into this film.<br/><br/>What I expected was a silly adaptation of Shakespeare with smug characters and obsolete dialogues that was probably going to put me to sleep half into the movie. Well, in all honesty, this did turn out to be a rather silly modern day adaptation - while, I must admit, in most parts being quite engaging and brilliant. The politics portrayed in Coriolanus is striking in depth and so is the irony - that Aufidius, who has lost many battles against Coriolanus and Rome, is yet loved by his people ... while Coriolanus, who himself is undefeated, is hated by his own people for reasons quite obvious. OK, Billy Shakes is to be credited for the story but it's been pictured out well nonetheless.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a must watch if you're looking at a different flavor of cinema.

"TheSquiss","3","4","12","16 June 2012"," Oh, good, it's Shakespeare. Or perhaps: Oh, god, it's Shakespeare.
","Shakespeare and I don't get along very well. As a graduate of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and former FOH Manager for Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory (SATTF), it's not something I'm particularly proud of. Mr. Ward succeeded in revealing Twelfth Night to me in secondary school and our companion for tonight's screening, Rev Nev, the font of all things Shakespeare, has tried, largely in vain, to remove the mental block I have with the bard.<br/><br/>The trouble is the language. I hear the first line and attempt desperately to understand every single word but inevitably fail. SATTF's Comedy of Errors last year is a notable exception that gave me hope and Branagh has this ignoramus in mind when he directs Shakespeare for the big screen. Absurdly, the most accessible production I've seen to date was a rendition of A Midsummer Night's Dream performed entirely in Korean.<br/><br/>So why did I hand over hard earned cash to endure yet more Shakespearean agony tonight? Well, I'm a sucker for a good cast and that of Coriolanus is right up there: Ralph Fiennes (who also directs), Brian Cox, Jessica Chastain, Vanessa Redgrave and, with a heavy heart, Gerard Butler. That and (in a quiet voice) the trailer impressed me.<br/><br/>Apparently, according to Nev, it was quite good. Shakespeare aficionados may be disappointed that the three-hour play has been pared down to a more manageable two hours and two minutes but for me the strained relationship with Shakespeare is finally over. I just don't know why I put myself through it.<br/><br/>It looked good, there's great vehemence and the spittle flies during the most impassioned soliloquies but I just didn't get it. If I'm to be judged by my understanding of Shakespeare then I am little more than a squished slug in the grooves of Coriolanus' boot. I concede Vanessa Redgrave is as compelling to watch as ever and her cobalt eyes manage to be both warm and piercing. She, as an actress and as her character, Volumnia, demands attention with her flawless (so I'm told) performance. Fiennes is powerful, absorbing and a very fine Coriolanus in Nev's book and this marks an impressive directorial debut.<br/><br/>For those who know, understand and love the works of Shakespeare, this apparently ranks a little below Olivier's Henry V. For those with an Ed-type brain, stick to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet.<br/><br/>Ending on a high point, this was my tenth film of the year and January still has a week to run. At this end of 2012, my target of 120 films looks distinctly possible.<br/><br/>Another film review from The Squiss. For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk"

","Coriolanus â€“ CATCH IT (B) Ralph Fiennes adopts William Shakespeare's least loved novel ""Coriolanus"" for his directorial debut. Fiennes does adopt the modern era but also decides to keep the old English dialect for the Coriolanus. This decision made its really hard for common people to understand the movie. Even for me it was very hard to understand the movie. It took almost 30minutes for me to start actually understanding the dialect, characteristics and story of the movie. Once I was able to understand then I started to admire Shakespeare's least appreciated novel and Ralph Fiennes violent adaptation of Coriolanus. Ralph Fiennes is a veteran and once again he proved how brilliantly he can handle a complicated role like Coriolanus. Portraying a man, whom who nation hates is a difficult task. Gerard Butler is above average, he doesn't have the acting caliber to stand in front of Ralph Fiennes. Vanessa Redgrave is a legend, she is brilliant in every single scene. It's a pity that Academy Awards completely ignored her performance in the movie. Jessica Chastain is amazing though she doesn't get much scope. Overall, Coriolanus is a great attempt but could have been more effective if it was made for understating for the general public. As for common people it's really hard to catch the old English dialect."
"pturner1010","8","3","8","8 February 2012"," Voldemort does Shakespeare
","After targeting concentration camp inmates and a boy wizard in some of his darkest acting roles, Ralph Fiennes sets his sights on a lesser known Shakespearean tragedy for his film directing debut. <br/><br/>John Logan's screenplay takes the Bard's original script as a foundation for a contemporary re-telling of General Coriolanus' rampage of war, oppression, family strife and political wrangling. <br/><br/>Old Shaky's wordplay might be as impenetrable to many younger viewers as the 'youth-speak' of last year's Attack the Block was to many older viewers, but Fiennes lets the performances and violent set-pieces do much of the talking in this confident and clever adaptation. <br/><br/>Unlike Baz Luhrmann's flashy 1996 Romeo + Juliet update that featured heartthrob Leo DiCaprio swooping Claire Danes off her feet to a modern soundtrack, MTV style editing and hyperactive camera-work, Fiennes' direction is far more restrained and less likely to grab a teen audience. <br/><br/>However, Shakespeare's theatrical language for the most part translates well to the screen. The themes of power, politics and the rule of the people versus leadership and authority feel particularly relevant with comparisons easy to draw with contemporary movements such as Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring. <br/><br/>As well as calling the shots, Fiennes takes the lead role of Caius Martius Coriolanus. Amidst riots in his home, the general of 'A Place Calling Itself Rome' leads his army against the Volscians and their leader, Coriolanus' sworn enemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler). After a successful battle but failing to kill his nemesis, Coriolanus returns home to great praise and his loving family. His mother (a breathtaking performance from Vanessa Redgrave) encourages him to run for consul and despite briefly winning the support of the Roman Senate and the commoners, a pair of scheming senators bring about the general's downfall as he rails against the idea of the rule of the people. Coriolanus is banished but joins forces with the Volscians and with the help of his old enemy Aufidius decides to bring ruin to his former city and its people. The only folks who can stop him are his family and old friend Menenius, a standout performance from the ever reliable Brian Cox. With a cameo from Channel Four's news anchor Jon Snow and the use of what could easily be actual footage from war zones, the contemporary relevance of Shakespeare's tragedy is easy to digest. <br/><br/>Fiennes uses modern locations, weapons, and details such as televisions, cameras and mobile phones to bring his modern re-telling into the 21st century. <br/><br/>Despite the script's use of Shakespearean language, fans of writer Logan's screenplay for Gladiator will be gripped by Coriolanus' similar mix of violent battles and political drama. <br/><br/>It might slightly over stay its welcome but the film packs enough mighty performances (Fiennes, Redgrave, Cox) and verbal and physical confrontations into the two hour running time to keep both Shakespeare devotees and newcomers alike entertained."
"grantss","4","3","9","15 August 2014"," There's a reason this is a lesser-known Shakespeare play...
","There's a reason this is a lesser-known Shakespeare play: the plot is pretty dull and pointless. Ostensibly a revenge movie, the movie starts very slowly and tiresomely. It sketches the background, Coriolanus' career and rise to power. After the reversal of fortune it looks like the movie is going to kick into another gear, and it does, briefly. After this temporary entertainment, it subsides with a whimper.<br/><br/>I didn't mind the modern setting, and thought director Ralph Fiennes did a good job in modernizing the play. However, I also felt that some of the plot didn't translate well into the modern day, especially the speed of communication and news. <br/><br/>(Aside: as a great example of how to modernize a Shakespeare play see Richard Loncraine's 1995 version of Richard III. Richard III is, however, a much more interesting drama to begin with...).<br/><br/>The wordiness of it all (it is Shakespeare, after all) also slows things down, and doesn't help the dullness factor.<br/><br/>Good performance by Ralph Fiennes in the lead role. Gerard Butler, whom I generally don't rate as an actor, puts in a fine performance as Aufidius. The most powerful performance, however, comes from Vanessa Redgrave as Coriolanus' mother.<br/><br/>Good support from Brian Cox. Jessica Chastain seems a bit out of her element in a Shakespeare play.<br/><br/>Hard to dislike Shakespeare, so this is a rarity."
"Red_Identity","Null","3","9","26 February 2012"," Don't know what to think....
","I'm not familiar at all with Shakespeare's Coriolanus. I really don't know what to say besides it definitely is very difficult to be able to judge this film as a whole if you aren't familiar with the kind of language spoken. I still was able to understand it many times, but I found myself thinking about other things throughout. hat I can say is that Fiennes really show promise as a director. The film never feels too ""stagey"", and in fact the cinematography really expands and lets it feel way more interesting than it should be, well to me anyways. I really don't know how to judge this film, but besides some interesting things Fiennes did behind the camera, the cast also kept things interesting for me at least. Fiennes stumbles a bit in the last act, and one can see his Voldemort coming out. Redgrave is pretty good, although nothing from this film left a very big impression on me. As it is, it's hard to judge a performance when you lose track of more than half of what they are saying. Because of that, I guess I only recommend this to people who really have a knack for Shakespeare's language and who are familiar with this story.<br/><br/>Also, it's not hard to see why Redgrave was ignored throughout the awards season. I mean, she is full of emotions and a face that captivates, but at the end of the day, if the film lacks a real connection with you of understanding, you won't be able to have a look out for how great a performance involved is, although I honestly don't think this is anything out of the ordinary for her by just studying her physical acting. I guess... don't believe the hype?"

","The text has been modernised and brought forward to resemble a modern war. However this war is a fictional one made to resemble the war between the Volscans and the Romans, a more effective way would have been to place this within a modern conflict which would have resonated more with the audience. All of the settings have been kept true to how Shakespeare intended yet that seems to be the end of what he intended. I had my doubts when I saw that a screenplay had been written and my fears were realised when watching the film. I tried to follow the film with the play however I soon hit trouble when I realised that Logan had changed most of the script. There was no real fluidity in the film and I realised that there was many changes within the script in order to fit it to the big screen. The character of Valeria is all but forgotten in the film and in what I can only guess is poetic licence the character of Menenius kills himself on the bank of a canal. This I thought was strange as Menenius was a key character in the play and yet Logan decided to write his screenplay so that Menenius took his own life, something I deem out of character of him. John Logan has all but butchered the original script and as far as I can tell only one full passage remains from the original text, this comes from scene 3.3 and is spoken by Coriolanus. The passage 'you common cry... There is a world elsewhere' is the only one I could follow in its entirety from the book while watching the film. The female characters of Volumnia and Virgilia are cut and a smaller role than in the script with almost an entirety of one of their scenes cut from existence. It seems lines have been removed to add in unnecessary violence. Through the entirety of the film there were moments when violence seemed like it was just added to create a brutal and bloody storyline. While that is important in this particular play, the main theme found throughout is betrayal. Coriolanus is betrayed by his people when they banish him, Aufidius is betrayed when Coriolanus decides on peace, Coriolanus betrays the people of Rome when he looks down on the poor. These moments seem to be lost amongst the violence. The film soon became just another war film instead of honouring the plays beginning as a Shakespearian Tragedy. As well as losing some of the lines to Logan's screenplay we lose some lines to the intense noise present in some scenes. During the scenes at war the sound team have taken the idea of conflict too far. Gunshots were all to frequent and the shooting of innocent people made it hard to watch in places. I found this far too brutal to class it as anything but a war film and whilst good in its own right, the film lacked the finesse expected from something that began life on stage. Scenes had a specific order and a lot of the war is not shown on stage, when changing this you run the risk of losing the flow, which this did in some places. Sometimes it seemed rushed whilst the 'epic' battle scenes were slowed right down. This could be due to the screenplay being written by the same man who wrote the screenplay for Gladiator. I find it quite easy to follow and understand old English; however the changes and cuts made caused much of the meaning to be lost and lost to what. Violence and blood. This is all that I could really take from it. A good film in its own right, however a bad adaptation of a piece of Shakespeare."

","We have many great modern day adaptations of books or plays that have worked in changing the setting. I have to say that Coriolanus is not one of those. It is set in a modern day alternative Rome and tries to tell the tragic tale of Coriolanus while also keeping the Shakespearian dialogue.<br/><br/>Not only is the dialogue a bit confusing, it just doesn't seem right when you see people holding out cell phones at the same time. I may be in the minority but nothing seemed to click with this film. Ralph Fiennes did a phenomenal job as the lead, but then again isn't he always good? Gerard Butler was fine but didn't seem to compliment Fiennes enough. The supporting cast is pretty good but besides Fiennes nobody seemed to stand out.<br/><br/>I definitely appreciate the ambition that Fiennes brings considering the risk of a project like this, but I just didn't seem to enjoy all the risks taken. The film has several slow parts with a few cool fight scenes but it definitely drags. Perhaps ill attempt to read the play and then go back and re-watch the film to get a better understanding of why this story is so revered.<br/><br/>+Fiennes <br/><br/>+Ambitious directing...<br/><br/>-...But the time line just doesn't fit with the dialogue <br/><br/>-Drags <br/><br/>-The rest of the cast didn't really stand out <br/><br/>5.2/10"

","As a first-time director, Ralph Fiennes gives a good account of himself in a challenging production, but is under-served by two sources from whom one expects better: Fiennes the actor and William Shakespeare the scenarist.<br/><br/>Caius Martius (Fiennes) is a proud Roman, rather overmuch in the minds of many of his compatriots. In the midst of a war Martius is doing much to win, a conspiracy takes root to displace him of his high station in Roman society. Despite counsel of his mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave) and patrician friend Menenius (Brian Cox), Martius' knack for blowing up at the wrong time proves his Achilles heel.<br/><br/>""Coriolanus"" is one of Shakespeare's more interesting problem plays, articulating an elitist attitude that seems designed to annoy inhabitants of future democracies. Either you accept Martius's contempt for the people he serves, or you relish his undeserved downfall as the result of excess pride. <br/><br/>Fiennes doesn't try to recast the story in a more populist way, even as he repositions the story in a modern setting and employs the use of hand-held cameras and TV studio sets. A CNN-style network, Fidelis, provides the same role as messengers do in the original play. Combat takes place using automatic weapons in a style reminiscent of a ""Call Of Duty"" video game.<br/><br/>This all works better than I expected, grounding the play in a way it needs and doesn't have in the writing. Nice work is offered by the supporting players, particularly Cox, who plays Menenius as sage and crafty with a nicely understated delivery. My favorite line in this film is a simple one he delivers over his shoulder late in the film: ""I'll undertake it.""<br/><br/>What is wrong with the film is mainly the fact Shakespeare wasn't at his best here spinning the story. There is a rather simple plot, more a character piece where the character in question performs two 180s in two acts. Fiennes and writer John Logan employ some useful trims, but they still leave alone some rare clams from the Bard, like Volumnia's raging cry: ""Anger's my meat!"" and Martius's ""O, a kiss/Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge.""<br/><br/>Playing Martius, Fiennes ranges between two poles, those of soft-voiced underplaying, such as at his entrance; and hammy, spittle-flecked ranting, like when he has his showdown with the people of Rome. This makes empathy for an already difficult character much harder. ""Bolder, but not so subtle,"" is how his enemy Aufidius (Gerard Butler) describes him, and boy, is he not kidding. After a while it kinda grates.<br/><br/>The Shakespearean language doesn't add or subtract from the overall experience. It never quite feels natural. If you know what is happening, and Fiennes the director does a good job making it clear, you can glom onto what the various characters are saying easily enough, and enjoy the way they play with their deliveries. It's a good cast, even if no one puts forward their best work. Redgrave's entirely too gentle in the role of fire-eating Volumnia, but she has her moments.<br/><br/>It's that kind of film, really. I ended up watching it again for this review in installments because even at just over two hours I found it a bit much to absorb in one sitting. I suggest you do the same; it's a decent time-passer if not something to leave an impression."

","Ralph Fiennes stars and directs this modernized Shakespearean adaptation. In order to stay true to its source, the language is mostly unchanged and it initially looks awkward watching people in the modern day speak in the old language (Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo and Juliet' anyone?'). Even though I appreciate the performances, the delivery of the lines appear very theatrical. Vanessa Redgrave and Brian Cox are outstanding. While the former breathers fire into a role that demands a firm presence, the latter brilliantly downplays his part. Ralph Fiennes and Gerard Butler are both competent. Jessica Chastain holds her own in her final few sequences. Otherwise, as director Fiennes seems quite capable. The washed out look of the film does have its benefits but it's mostly Barry Akroyd's direction of photography that stands out especially in its creation of space. Overall, Fiennes's 'Coriolanus' may not have hit full mark but it's a respectable effort by the actor turned director."

I find the movie very hard to enjoy because English is not my native language and I have to read the subtitles so carefully so that I can follow the story.

Vanessa Redgrave is not exactly short of superlative screen acting roles to flesh out her CV but nevertheless she is now the proud owner of yet another gasser as she hits one out of the park as Volumnia, mother of the protagonist and walks away with the movie despite some reasonable competition by Fiennes himself and Brian Cox. Fiennes clearly has a secret affection for the role and I personally saw him play it on stage as part of a double-header. It doesn't suffer as much as it might by being updated to the present day though no one is going to buy Serbia as Rome. If anything the modernization helps to clarify the political machinations that Shakespeare tended to obscure.

","This is a modern day version of Shakespeare's play that retains the classical language of the original production. The play is based on the life of the Roman General Gaius Marcius Coriolanus, the legend of whom is still contested by some historians. Shakespeare wrote the play in the early 1600s but here it has been appropriated to the modern combat zone of Rome. Coriolanus (Ralph Fiennes) leads a group of fellow soldiers on a strike mission, taking down their adversaries of the state. Yet in a standoff he fails to defeat his main enemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler). Returning from combat and Coriolanus is praised as a hero. Yet he upsets the public when they believe that he is mocking them and is sent into exile, away from his mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave), his wife Virgilia (Jessica Chastain) and his son. <br/><br/>I appreciated this modern version of Coriolanus, directed by its star Ralph Fiennes, more as a concept or theory of appropriation than as a pure cinematic experience. This film asks us about timelessness and authorship but not in ways that it would ever intend. Choosing to set the film in modern times but keeping the Early Modern English dialogue is problematic. Preserving the colourful language means that the film is true to the play and its timeless themes but also potentially distancing for modern audiences too. There are some wonderful lines here like: ""There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger."" Yet if you are unfamiliar with this style of dialogue it will challenge how much you can invest in the story and characters. In being familiar with some Shakespearean plot devices, narratives and characters I was able to access the film but only in a broad overview of the narrative when there are probably much more subtle dimension to the side characters that one could miss. At least anyone familiar with 'King Lear' (1603) though will recognise elements like the exile of a leader, the failure to listen to the public because of one's hubris and the tragic ending. By remaining so faithful to the play Fiennes the director, not the actor, fails to transcend the story towards the cinematic medium. There's an early battle scene that is excitingly staged, without restoring too thickly to blood. It looks like it could be any modern combat zone and realises the timelessness of the play to current issues of dictatorships, which is one of the reasons Fiennes was interested in the piece. Interestingly, the play was banned in Germany following the Second World War, because it was linked too closely with fascism.<br/><br/>Yet despite its universal themes there are still moments that don't bode well to the modern period because of the emphasis on retaining the theatrical design. After the opening battle, the knife fight between the two soldiers as everyone stands around watching seems particularly unlikely. Similarly, as much as I'd like to see some people from TV banished, a call to exile from an audience watching Coriolanus in an interview doesn't fit either or at least seems too compressed. What remains are some incredibly long stretches of dialogue, which are testing, no matter how much conviction is provided by the cast. When Fiennes resorts to more cinematic techniques, like tight close up shots of the faces of the actors, including an outstanding Redgrave, he reveals and amplifies the anger in these character and we feel the impact of the story. It is far more engaging than just having the actors surrounded by clusters of bodies, like in a play. Disappointingly, the supporting cast doesn't match the leads because the likes of Jessica Chastain are underused and don't have enough to do. But if another version of King Lear were made, she would be a perfect Cordelia because her face is an emotive one of great innocence. Although you can appreciate the timelessness of the original plays themes and its overall essence here, I think those who are particularly familiar with the source material and general Shakespearean tropes will draw the most from the film's narrative and the performances."
"cosmo_tiger","7","2","6","27 May 2012"," A very good movie that is worth watching. It did have the ""Shakespeare speak"" in it & was, to me, hard to follow. I say B.
","""O, a kiss Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!"" Rome is in the midst of a hunger problem and when it's hero Coriolanus (Fiennes) returns they think their problems are solved. After expressing his extreme views to it's people the politicians as well as his mother decide to banish him from the city. Angry and seeking revenge he decides to join the army of his sworn Tullus Aufidius (Butler) in hopes of exacting his revenge. I will start by saying that yes I knew this was a Shakespeare play going in. I also should tell you that I am not, nor really have ever been a fan of his. The preview I saw made me really want to see this though and I was excited. The movie itself was very good and interesting with a pretty timely (hundreds of years later) idea. All that said I had a hard time getting into it because while it was set in present day it still had the ""Shakespeare speak"" and not being a big fan it was a little hard to understand in some parts. I did follow it enough to understand what was going on, but a few of the one-on-one emotional scenes really lost it's effect on me because I was trying to translate it in my mind and missed some of it. If you are a fan of this then you will probably love this. I, not being a fan, liked it but I think if it was spoken in ""normal English"" I would have liked it more. Purists though probably hate that I said that, but I just can't get into it. Overall, a very good movie that Shakespeare fan's will absolutely love. I liked it enough though. I give it a B (because of the language)."

","Whenever there is a movie, based on a William Shakespeare play, getting released, that is being placed in modern time, I'm not exactly running out to see it. It just too often comes across as weird, out of place and pretentious to me. But with this movie I really had no issues with this at all.<br/><br/>It's still definitely a bit odd, hearing all these people speak old fashioned and pretend to be in ancient Rome, while they are obviously not and carry difficult names, like Coriolanus and Aufidius. No, it's not a typical movie but then again, no one that will watch this movie will expect this movie to be an usual one. It will mostly attract the Shakespeare lovers any way, who are perhaps also already very familiar with the story, that isn't exactly Shakespeare's best known works.<br/><br/>But by saying its not one of his best known works, I don't mean that it's also one of his lesser ones. It's actually a very intriguing story about power and politics with dozens of great characters in it. The fact that it's all taking place in modern times adds a whole new and different dimension to it as well. It also makes it obvious how some of its themes are still relevant in today's world.<br/><br/>It's true that the movie does has its slower moments in it with its story, especially in the middle but I must say that the movie overall did a really good job at giving the movie a lot of pace, with its editing and camera-handling, without letting any of this go at the expense of its story.<br/><br/>The movie really has lots of great moments in it, that mostly come from its story and the actors acting it all out. This was obviously a project Ralph Fiennes had a lot of love and passion for. He did not only direct and produce this movie, he also is the main lead. And he definitely gives all he got! He does not hold back and deliciously goes crazy and gets truly intense to watch in his role at times. But he also gives all of the actors actors plenty of room to shine. You perhaps wouldn't really expect Gerard Butler to see in a Shakespeare movie but he is simply a good actor, that plays his role well. Also truly impressive were, Vanessa Redgrave, Brian Cox and James Nesbitt. Even when you are not really grabbed by its story, you will still get sucked into this movie by the powerful performances, of all of the actors.<br/><br/>It's not always an easy movie to watch with its story, old fashioned dialog and many characters but it was a movie I absolutely got grabbed by and enjoyed every minute of, thanks to its universal and timeless themes, characters, actors and just its overall style.<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"zevt","7","1","2","29 July 2017"," Above-average Shakespeare with flaws
","First, this is Shakespeare and it uses his original dialogue, so anyone that doesn't appreciate the rich language shouldn't be watching this, never-mind reviewing it. I find it sad that so many negative reviews here revolve around the difficult (wonderful) language. If anything, too much of Shakespeare's writing was cut out in order to make the movie shorter, and some scenes and characters suffer because of it.<br/><br/>Second, it is transported to a modern setting despite the language, in order to demonstrate its universal themes. Sometimes this works quite well (see Richard III with Loncraine/McKellen). Here, the result is a mixed bag. The modern settings with news-rooms, tanks and trucks work very well, but the war-action scenes sometimes feel shoe-horned in just to try to make Shakespeare more thrilling and pander to audiences, and a key plot element that involves the Roman practice of a hero showing the people his physical wounds in order to gain their trust, doesn't work anymore.<br/><br/>The acting is generally good, although the wide range of accents are too distracting, and Azabal chews the scenery and ruins her scenes. The direction is passable.<br/><br/>As mentioned, some scenes suffer from too much cutting of dialogue. I found the key scene involving the turning of the crowd against Coriolanus, too awkwardly staccato. Where the original writing had speeches that sway people's emotions, this has abrupt statements and declarations, and many of the characters lose their dimensions as a result.<br/><br/>But all these can be overlooked and the movie enjoyed despite these flaws. The one flaw I was not able to overcome is Fiennes characterization of Coriolanus. He portrays him as way too contemptuous and angry, a spiteful man beyond sympathy that basically brought the tragedy on himself. Whereas my impression while reading the play was of a socially awkward, hard, but basically honorable and good man led astray by politics and pressure. Including more of Shakespeare's colorful dialogue and soliloquies could have helped."

","The consummate soldier is lauded for his achievements, but with praise comes new responsibilities that prove more trying than warfare. Based on William Shakespeare's play about a Roman general spurned by those he serves, Coriolanus is a surprisingly well-crafted directorial debut for lead actor Ralph Fiennes.

While Fiennes delivers an outstanding performance we mustn't forget Gerard Butler. This isn't the latter's best performances but it is nevertheless very good. There are many great shots of people and landscapes and I must say that the cinematography overall is very good. Fiennes also does an amazing job directing this movie. Every detail is perfectly weighted and all the elements, symbolisms and props are fitting and his interpretation of the original into modern times is very intriguing and fitting. Overall we can say that this modern take on Shakespeare makes a great movie."
"dgl1199","8","1","3","25 July 2014"," If you know the story you will love this
","The fact that Shakespeare remains the most studied, influential, and produced playwright in the modern world is testament to the genius of his storytelling and it's transcendent, universal narratives. His plays remain timeless for this reason. Coriolanus, however, one of the last composed by Billy Shakes, is not one his more popular plays and consequently doesn't see the stage time of his other Histories. There are really four reasons for this. The title character is lacking the emotional range, depth, and just plain interestingness of say a Hamlet, Lear, or Macbeth. He is pretty much single minded and predictable. Reason two is there is no love interest to speak of, although he has a wife, she does not play a compelling influence on his life or events of the story. Reason three, the topicality emphasizes the political rather than humanistic. Reason four is it's an intense, humorless, dark play. In essence, Coriolanus is a heavily flawed man who doesn't know it and for many that makes him boring. There are no internal conflicts, only external. The play is really a commentary on the bearing of social class on the general welfare of any given nations citizenry and the toxicity of political privilege and hubris. Many theater goers, even in Shakespeare's time, were uneasy with the subject matter. Aristotle asserted that theater should serve two functions, entertain and instruct,but do so evenly. Coriolanus does more instruction where an escapist audience wanted to be entertained. Let's call Coriolanus, then, a Shakespearian political PSA. <br/><br/>But...this re-imagining of Coriolanus is spectacular. Like many modern adaptations of Shakespeare it has been modernized to suit the times, making it more accessible to audiences unfamiliar with the Elizabethan English or even the story itself. There are no robes, tights, or rapiers. There are instead tanks, helmets, and helicopters. There are suits and ties and cars and televisions and a contemporary cultural backdrop that could be literally any one of thousands of locales in our present time. Ralph Fiennes direction really drives home that this could be you, which I thought worked exceptionally well. The use of modern media, such as television talk shows and news broadcasts to deliver dialogue originally intended for an ancillary character was both clever and useful in keeping the flow of the story as well as staying true to the spirit of the original work.<br/><br/>Coriolanus is a general, a politically valued but socially inept political figurehead central to the corruption of the Roman government and the chief architect of that government's subversion of civil liberties and basic needs among it's population. For that reason he is despised by the people and feared by the politicians. Yet he is also a prized component of this society as a fearless, ruthless, and brilliant military commander. The built in irony for Coriolanus lay in his professional conduct as a soldier defending his nation, advancing it's interests through conquest, and all the while expressing utter disgust for that nation, the common man especially whom he regards as interloping rabble or a distraction to his ambitions. He is what we would call a megalomaniac. Serving only himself and those that can benefit him. Really, he functions as guardian of a status quo for himself, and no one but himself. As a side note, can't imagine that Coriolanus wasn't an influence for Aaron Sorkin when he crafted Colonel Nathan Jessup in A Few Good Men. <br/><br/>One should familiarize themselves with the story before embarking on Coriolanus. It should be said more often that production value, costumes, and theme will never replace an audiences need to understand what is going on. Let's face it, there's a language barrier with Shakespeare and nothing will substitute for an audience member who doesn't know that musty superfluidity means weakness. And perhaps that's why Shakespeare on film doesn't have the reach it should. But I do love this effort and the attempt to advance a 400 year old tale of a dysfunctional system and make it real for anyone living it today. <br/><br/>Nuts and bolts of the film. I loved the action sequences, the editing, and the brevity as much of the script was deleted to streamline the film. Gerald Butler was in his element as Aufidius, the foil to Coriolanus. Ralph Fiennes exploded as Coriolanus and gave him an unspoken internal dialogue; I hated this guy and then it occurred to me that I was supposed to, and when that happened I know they did it right. Some things I did not like. The overuse of shaky cam as if this were live footage was not all that convincing. Thought some of the combat scenes were pushing too hard. And at times, for reasons I can't really explain, felt the whole this is modern times and we are making a point of that fell flat. Maybe it was all the shots done in TV studios and board rooms. <br/><br/>Overall an excellent film, and a very relevant story to modern times. Both entertaining and instructive. Evenly."
"son_of_cheese_messiah","8","1","3","6 December 2013"," A Credible Coriolanus
","Making an up-to-date version of a Shakespeare play is always a risk. There will always be a certain disconnect between the Elizabethan language and the modern setting. Also the modern acting tendency towards naturalism can make the Shakespeare's words, so dense in meaning, unintelligible.<br/><br/>Neither of these traps are completely avoided in Fiennes production of Coriolanus which nevertheless may be considered one of the more successful Shakespearean adaptations. There is the modern embarrassment with the language which leads to much of it being cut. This is less of an issue in Coriolanus than in other Shakespearean play since the hero himself is a man of few words (by Shakespeare's standards).<br/><br/>The language is sometimes at variance with the on-screen action. The talk is of swords while the images are of guns. This is of course a necessary upshot of deciding on a modern adaptation and, by and large, it is not too troubling.<br/><br/>Fiennes himself is superb in the title role and speaks his lines with utter conviction. He is given admirable support from Brian Cox. Other actors cope less well with Shakespeare's language. Vanessa Redgrave is variable. She has a tendency to whisper. Butler speaks his lines in a moody mumble which makes me want subtitles. Others treat the verse as prose, or have distracting accents although surprisingly veteran newsreader John Snow does rather well.<br/><br/>The actual look of the piece is very impressive. Fiennes looks almost demonic caked in blood. There is a great deal of shocking violence as befits this bloody tale."
"fabiogaucho","Null","1","3","9 August 2013"," Then, now and ever
","This is the first time Shakespeare's unsung masterpiece is brought to the big screen. That alone is reason to praise this movie, and a reason for me to watch it.<br/><br/>My rough estimate is that the screenplay kept about 20% of the play's text, maybe less. The #1 priority of the screenwriter was clearly not to put off audiences with too much of Shakespeare's language (which is even more difficult in this work than in most plays). Thus we have long stretches without dialog, filled mostly with battle scenes. If you are going to produce a 10 million dollar film, you'd better not to cater only to a niche audience of Shakespeare buffs like myself. So they focus on lines that a) are the less difficult to understand and b) establish the characters. Long speeches are often cut to 10 words or less, and more often than not eliminated. So the choices in the script make a world of difference. Is the play's spirit kept? Is John Logan successful? Not fully, but mostly.<br/><br/>Coriolanus, like the bard's other Roman plays, is a treatise on the state and society, worth more than dozens of political science books. He shows the problems both with democratic government and with anti- democratic forces more than one and a half century before the French Revolution. The role of the ""people"" in the political process is at the margins of previous plays, but in Coriolanus it is fully developed, and Kudos to the movie-makers for stressing that theme. <br/><br/>The caprice of the mob is a factor throughout the movie. Key scenes are kept, as is a crucial exchange of words whereby Coriolanus and the people are compared to the wolf who wants do devour and a lamb - the powerful general being the latter. Also kept is Coriolanus' denunciation: ""With every minute you do change a mind/And call him noble that was now your hate,/Him vile that was your garland"". Logan did not miss the importance of this theme, avoiding the trap of succumbing to a simplistic story of proud ""tyrants"". It is true that he made the mistake of giving the mob too much justification for directing their rage to Caius Marcius in the beginning (he is in charge of enforcing a state of emergency) - but the latter scenes of Marcius trying to get ""voices"" (votes) among the common people make it clear that their relation is not simply one of righteous revolt, but something more complex. He is rejected for being too ""proud"" to exhibit his war scars – but it is really the mob that is too proud to accept a leader that does not cater to such a caprice. He is expelled, but just a few gestures and clever words would have made him a god before the people.<br/><br/>Coriolanus' accusation to the angry, volatile mob is spot-on. But the play is also a treatise on the individual: one of the many ironies is that every character in the play, including the general himself, is not more fixed than the masses. Everyone is divided against him or herself and carried by the influence of others. The individual minds mirror the unstable collective. All the character's arcs come full circle, but with an arrow vector that points to a continuation of the loop. And that is why I think the very last speech of the play, where Aufidius regrets what he has just done, should have stayed. The way things end suggest that at least his character reached a resolution to his inner conflict. But no such a thing is possible in ""Coriolanus"".<br/><br/>No play from Shakespeare is more fit for adaptation to modern times. Coriolanus is more contemporary to the 20th Century than to Shakespeare's England under James Stuart (had the play been written 30 years later after his death, everyone would say the bard was ""obviously"" talking about the English civil war). The film was shot in Belgrade, and the battle scenes and uniforms direct the viewers to the wars in former Yugoslavia. But the turmoil in the Middle East in the course of the revolution that started in the year this movie was made could be predicted by anyone who watched or read ""Coriolanus"". Shakespeare is worth a thousand pundits."
"l_rawjalaurence","8","1","3","14 July 2013"," Powerful Rendering of a Classic Political Text
","Shot in war-torn Serbia, Ralph Fiennes' version of CORIOLANUS vividly illustrates the play's political themes. The eponymous hero (Fiennes himself) is a brave, outwardly successful general enjoying both political and military success - that is, until he is elected to the role of consul in the city of Rome. Then his penchant for speaking the truth becomes a liability rather than an asset: Tribunes Brutus and Sicinius (James Nesbitt, Paul Jesson) contrive to have him banished from the city. Coriolanus' response is swift and bloody, as he switches sides to form an alliance with his deadliest enemy Aufidius (Gerard Butler) to attack Rome in revenge. The film illustrates the perils of political life, as Coriolanus is unable to cope with the scheming and hypocrisy necessary to sustain his success. He relies too much on Menenius (Brian Cox) who, although a consummate manipulator, cannot guarantee Coriolanus' future. However Coriolanus is not quite the heroic character he believes himself to be; he is quite willing to turn on his allies if it suits his particular purpose. Hence we feel that he somehow deserves what happens to him in the end. The film's stand-out performance, however, comes from Vanessa Redgrave as Coriolanus' mother Volumnia - a strong-minded personality who stands up for her principles. Would that her son had followed her example. British news anchor Jon Snow turns up in a cameo role, announcing the bad tidings."
"TinyDanseur27","7","1","3","20 June 2013"," Ralph Fiennes's modern take on Coriolanus is risky and edgy. Success!
","Ralph Fiennes did a modern take on Coriolanus. The setting was present day in ""a place called Rome"" which was made up of many different locations. Tanks, machine guns and knives served as the weapons, and costumes were made up of a mix of American and Russian military attire. I really appreciated the decision to set the play in a different time. It's risky and edgy and I think that it made the play way more accessible. I'm no Shakespeare expert but I think Coriolanus is not one of his most popular works. Bringing it to the silver screen in this manner really showed people just how great of a play it is.<br/><br/>What I think the movie did for Shakespeare in this instance was highlight some of the beautiful subtleties in the dialogue. Performing it as a play, the actors must project to convey the story. Having recently seen Coriolanus on a stage, I experienced that projection firsthand. I feel that some of the dialogue was better said in a whisper though, a whisper that could only be done in a film. There are some breathtaking scenes with Vanessa Redgrave and Jessica Chastain that are quiet yet passionate. I felt that the film allowed for a lot more dynamics throughout the play."
"amalank","8","1","3","9 August 2012"," Good adaptation of a Shakespeare play
","This is a movie adaptation of the William Shakespeare play Coriolanus. I had never heard of this play before and I suppose its a good thing to have another Shakespeare play adapted in comparison to the more well- known ones including Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet.<br/><br/>Even though the play itself takes place in ancient Rome, Ralph Fiennes decided to make a modernisation of this play. I have to say that it has worked very well and can be compared to Baz Luhrmann's modernisation of Romeo and Juliet, even though I thought that particular movie overall was just watchable. I am not actually that fond of Shakespeare's plays mainly because I find it so difficult to understand the language he uses which isn't used in this day and age. But this movie told me that he knows how to write a good story. Even if you had never read or even studied this particular Shakespeare play at school, you can tell that the dialogue in this movie is typically Shakespearian. But despite this, you don't really need to understand the language in order to understand what is going on in the movie. After all, it's much more difficult to understand if you're reading the text alone. I guess it was better to use the Shakespearian text rather than modernised English given the setting of this movie. Ralph Fiennes played his role very well, especially when his character becomes angry.<br/><br/>All in all, this is good movie adaptation. Even though I never intend to read any of Shakespeare's plays, I guess for the first time I appreciated Shakespeare, not for his language but for his story."
"adamcrossstills","8","1","3","8 June 2012"," it is something to be felt and to be enjoyed
","I thoroughly enjoyed Ralph Fiennes directorial debut, this modernisation of Shakespeare's great tragedy is so powerful I hardly have words to describe it without coming across half-hearted and feeble but not only is his directorial debut a visceral study on the individual's internal struggle with pride and sense of self within the context of a modern, conflict-ridden society he stays true to the original text without any attempt to modernise it ,as some might, in an attempt to connect with today's, somewhat, literately-detached youth (I, of course, include myself in that group). <br/><br/>As Luhrmann has done before him Fiennes manages a modern re-telling without alienating the Shakespearian elite, without ridiculing or making a mockery of the text. Within his own performance and direction he has shown not only his 27 or so years experience in theatre but has shown his excellent ability to command the actors around him to push that extra ounce of emotion from their souls and into the performance, imitating those actions of his character during various battle scenes throughout the film. This is by far once of Fiennes' greatest performances. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast, as I've pertained to, were very good; Gerard Butler puts in a good performance as Aufidius though I found it a rather forgettable. Vanessa Redgrave plays the part of Volumnia, Coriolanus's mother, and her performance is something to marvel at, to be be seen with the eye and listened to with the ear for it is, again, not something I can idly describe here. I was utterly spellbound by her mere presence on screen and as she begins to speak I was left in awe. Jessica Chastain impresses as Coriolanus's wife Virgilia. I haven't had much opportunity to see her films, other than her performance in Malick's The Tree of Life which I adored, but there was a great vigour in her performance here which I had yet to see from her and she reads the archaic script as though it were all she has ever known. <br/><br/>I would, obviously, suggest that you watch this film. Do not try too hard to understand what is being said. Listen to the words, the rhythms, the poetry and feel the emotion and that unique power that only a Shakespeare play possesses. Shakespeare is not always something to be understood, it is something to be felt and to be enjoyed."
"bob the moo","Null","1","3","5 June 2012"," Not a total success but engaging and well acted
","Not only had I never seen this Shakespeare play before seeing this film, I had never even heard of it and came to it with no lofty ideals or preconceptions about how it should be done or any protectionist feelings towards the text. I mention this because I have read several reviews from critics trying harder to show how intelligent they are rather than reviewing the film but mainly because I have no idea about what this film version has taken out of the original story, or how it has changed the focus, so please bare with me if I am incorrect in something as I only have the film here to go on.<br/><br/>Not having ever heard of the play before did give me pause, because I assumed there must be a reason why it is less well-known and less performed than other Shakespeare work – perhaps it isn't that good or it is very difficult as a body of text? I didn't know but I think part of it may be that Coriolanus is a fairly stand-offish character throughout the story. Again, remembering that I'm not familiar with the text, it surprised me that Shakespeare doesn't really give his lead character any ""to-camera"" dialogue whereby we learn more of his inner motives and feelings, it is normally such a common device that I wondered why it wasn't done here because at times the character seems quite closed off. In addition to this the character is very proud, which is the point of the tragedy and he is hard to feel for because he is so very trapped behind this wall he has made himself – unable to let even a slight offence pass and happen to burn his city to the ground due to an insult cooked up by media manipulation. It works but he is not the most engaging Shakespearean character I've seen.<br/><br/>The contemporary setting is interesting as a background because it does seem to fit the story pretty well, in particularly the tribunes/journalists twisting the people to feel a certain way while the political classes both sneer at the people but say the right things. Some have commented on how timely the film in because it fits in with news footage of people rioting against their ruling classes, however I actually thought that this was an unfortunate distraction because the film doesn't work as a comment on real life nor does is it really able to do much. So while it is background all this is fine but there are occasions where I felt the ""news footage"" aspects were being pushed to the fore where really this is about the handful of main characters – not about making a comment on current political unrest.<br/><br/>The cast deal well with this distraction though and as is so often the way there are lots of good performances which help to make the material easier to understand thanks to the contextualising of their delivery. Fiennes is very tight and controlled in his performance which is part of his character's nature but it does unfortunately mean he is shut off from the viewer in the way others are not. Butler manages well with the lines but never doesn't feel like an odd casting choice. Cox, Nesbitt and others are well used but the most fascinating performance is from Redgrave as she is great in every scene she is in; I wanted more from her in terms of time and I got the feeling that background matters were pushing the film away from letting this central mother/son relationship be the core of the film.<br/><br/>Coriolanus is a good film; it is easy to follow and has great flow to the dialogue but it does suffer from its main character being shut off by his pride and not having many opportunities to let the viewer inside. Perhaps this is why it is a lesser-performed play compared to others, but it does make it a little more difficult to go along with the film even if it overall is still worth seeing."

From successes like Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet to ... not successes like Sam Worthington's 2006 version of Macbeth. Ralph Fiennes has turned to a lesser-known Shakespeare play in Coriolanus for his directing debut.<br/><br/>Rome is in chaos, the country is in the middle of a food shortage, the plebs are rioting and tensions within the nation of Volsci are flaring up on Rome's borders. Caius Marius Coriolanus (Fiennes) is a top commander, with the scars to prove it. After a battle between Rome and Volsci and between Coriolanus and his mortal enemy Tullus Aufudius (Gerald Butler), Coriolanus is hailed a hero. Senator Menenius (Brian Cox) convinces Coriolanus to run for Consul of Rome, despite his contempt for the common people. Another senator, Sicinus (James Nesbitt) leads the plebs to exile the war hero, forcing Coriolanus to plot his revenge with none other than his enemy.<br/><br/>Coriolanus is a character-driven and incredibly acted movie from the whole cast. Fiennes shows his passion and love for the text, and is able to deliver those Shakespearian speeches with real conviction. It is also easily Gerald Butler's best performance.<br/><br/>Fiennes shows incredible skill with his debut behind the camera as well. Coriolanus is a very fast paced and accessible film. Fiennes employs The Hurt Locker cinematographer Barry Ackroyd to give war scenes an intense, gritty feel that will make you feel like you are in the middle of a war zone. News reports help set the movie's context and all the background information, which really shows the wider picture of what is going on involving the famine and war. It was done with expert skill and Fiennes employs respected British newsreader Jon Snow (not the Game of Thrones character), which surprisingly works.<br/><br/>Like with any Shakespeare play and adaptation there are plenty of themes in Coriolanus that everyone from movie fans to academics can sink their teeth into. Coriolanus is about the downfall of a great and important man who falls when he enters politics. Politics is a major target and it works in a modern context, as Coriolanus has to press the fresh, make deals and try to appeal to the masses, even though he does not like them. It is also about a clique of political leaders who look for a candidate that would be popular and ensure victory, not for the best or most appropriate candidate. Like in most Shakespeare adaptations the characters are complex, willing to be flexible, have their own goals and ambitions, with the idea of good and evil being very subjective.<br/><br/>Coriolanus is a very good Shakespeare movie and it is accessible to most audiences, even with the language barrier. It is an intelligent, intense movie and will please on a dramatic and intelligential level. Lets hope for more from Fiennes as a director as well as an actor and for Butler to find more juicy roles.<br/><br/>Please visit www.playeraffinity.com"

","The movie seemed pretty entertaining and I really did want to watch it but about 40min into it I knew I couldn't go the full 2hrs. A lot of scenes appeared to be very emotional and intense but I couldn't understand enough to feel the emotions that the characters appeared to be expressing so I couldn't relate to any of the characters and ultimately isn't that what makes a movie good? Shakespeare or not Gerald Butler is hard to understand as is then throw that in and yikes. Like I said, I was fine with the content of the movie but when you can't relate to the characters by understanding their emotions/dialogue in a movie like this then what's the point? I'm not one to pretend that I liked this movie because it was ""different"" in a artistic manner so be truthful with yourself, can you stand Shakespeare type dialogue for 2hrs???"

","Many great actors, having passed a galaxy of the most various movie roles, moving towards their long- awaited and main role – starring themselves. Some of them, accumulating experience for years, were nurturing the idea of showing themselves to the world like they present themselves, like they want to be. Well, that's a quite appropriate vanity. <br/><br/>For so noble and ambitious plan's embodiment Fiennes needed to generate the character, which would miraculously consolidate the predominating and supernatural abilities, being an absolute and complete excellence. The actor's filmography is an extremely replete with bright, charismatic and powerful images, most of which can be revived, refined, having cleared of defaming flaws and weaknesses, supplemented with worthy and strong qualities, to form a holistic and a monumental image of a kind of Superman as a result of this «mutations». And this image was formed. The eponymous Shakespeare's tragedy granted to Ralph Fiennes his desired pedestal. Having rendered thanks to his idol for inspiration, he, without delaying, decisively appeared before mob in the image of a great, brave, proud and invincible warrior! <br/><br/>The quintessence of the vices and passions was concentrated in Coriolanus by incomprehensible harmonious way. Heathcliff, obsessed with passion and revenge, his «light version» - the Count Laszlo De Almasy, cruel and unprincipled Amon Goeth, bloodthirsty madman Francis Dolarhyde (Red Dragon), powerful Lord Voldemort, vengeful and almighty Hades, principled and nervous ribald Harry Waters - explosive and, at the same time, such well-coordinated and impressive combination of characters found it's phenomenal embodiment in general Coriolanus. Red Dragon's strongly pronounced features acutely dominate in Coriolanus. Strong, all-destroying and sophisticated, not knowing fear and pity, rapid and resourceful – the Great Red Dragon, passed the mission's restart. Dreaming about rebirth, he reached it. Now he is a Coriolanus. Submissive crowd looks to Coriolanus bottom-up with the expression with hardened hope on stupid gazes and open mouths, revering with a fawning cringe. That's exactly the red Dragon dreamed to appear before trembling mortals, insignificant and deprived of civil rights, becoming famous over them, reigning and prevailing. <br/><br/>The actor was mesmerized by the most powerful energy message of Butler's character in «Law Abiding Citizen» and his shocking mission. «Wow, what a character! What a spark!» - he exclaimed and rightly decided, that such kind of role would incorporate the previous cult film images and would be a worthy crown of his creativity. «So help me old friend Shakespeare!» - he exhorted his arrogant impulse. And who is worthy to become a competitor of the all-powerful Coriolanus? «Why me not to battle with Law Abiding Citizen?» - it has dawned upon the newly Director, - «Let the trembling mob will understand that there's a hero more powerful and courageous! Let's fight with him, like two rebellious gladiators, on the arena of Rome!». It was a fierce and furious rivalry between the two leaders, two desperate brave warriors. Butler, dashingly pushed into the background, favorably emphasized shade the heroism of raging Coriolanus, humbly and courteously looming in the rays of his glory. <br/><br/>The outstanding Shakespearean drama was repeatedly an excellent support for implement of various theatrical and cinema projects. Shakespeare's idea to create the image of Coriolanus more courageous, generous and honest, in comparison with Plutarch's primary source, undoubtedly played into the Fiennes' hands, who dreamed about the Red Dragon's evolution. True devotee Shakespeare actor, not hesitate, returned origin of his artistic career, seeking the creation of his idol for the long-awaited directorial debut. Whether it is necessary to torment imagination, which is able to give birth to absurd and delusional images under the ruthless yoke of the hypertrophied vain ambitions? The «recipe» is quite simple indeed: fancy pastry on «Shakespeare's» yeast+juicy assorted stuffing from off-suit images+ subtle improvisation. The «pie» is ready. <br/><br/>So, what about the film? Bravo, Ralph! The mob clap! The movie – is a refined impudence. Eccentric and biting version of the Shakespeare's «Coriolanus». To play classics in modern terms is a risky deed, but very attractive. Many people tried, but very few of them managed to surprise or not to disappoint. The screened «Coriolanus» is surprisingly organic and compositional, in spite of deliberately brute performance, aggressive camera-work and exaggerated brutal acting images. Even the female characters make the impression of a kind of steel and indestructible warriors. Subtle and well thought director's work. Not so smugly, but impresses. Vigorous, defiant, and, as expected, dramatic debut.<br/><br/>The prosperity and delight are increased thanks to cast, easy on the eyes. Ralph Fiennes brilliantly realized his autocratic daring attempts in proud and fearless Coriolanus. Legendary and genius «Bella Mafia» Vanessa Redgrave was on the ball once again, standing in the image of Volumnia, the mother of all of Rome. And Gerard Butler as live and spectacular «decoration», which against a background the most significant and profound scene of explanation Coriolanus with his mother turned around of. He had the opportunity to reappear in a shot to triumphantly interrupt the life of Caius Martius Coriolanus in a tragic finale.<br/><br/>In each case when the classical works are mercilessly trampled, one idiom comes to mind: say, that one or the other Author would turn over in his grave, if could see what had been done with his masterpiece. Ralph Fiennes, in my opinion, can sleep a peaceful sleep: the rotating speed of Shakespeare in his grave is equal to zero. I would venture to guess, that a great classic, involuntarily rendered director faithful service, would be pleasantly surprised with so courageous and expressive statement of his poem and wouldn't stint his applause and sincerely praise.<br/><br/>But what the excessive vanity you need to have for making this kind of movie with starring himself? However, the director, not without bragging, confidently and stately declared to the world about himself, as all-powerful and dauntless warrior Coriolanus. It's interesting, what will be the next independent role of the actor? Perhaps God?"

","It's ignorant to believe that any film that is in Shakespearian Iambic Pantemeter is going to be an action film. I have read many of the reviews on here and feel that the reason this film wasn't a bigger draw is because we are thick as a nation. Wanting to be entertained by bullets and octane, Logan and Fiennes create an otherworldly approach to Shakespeare.<br/><br/>In a sense it's a stripped to the bone political thriller and in another sense its a character study as most Shakespeare is...Fiennes does something that people have failed to do with Shakespeare and that is make you want more of the old bard and the rich tapestry of character and verse. Its not flashy and it forces you to think the way a film like Syriana did. This has one drawback that Syriana didn't...Budget.<br/><br/>It's not quite a masterpiece but its as close as I've seen in terms of a Shakespeare adaptation.<br/><br/>Good Work Mr. Fiennes!"

"Desertman84","10","1","5","1 April 2013"," Fiennes Excels In His Directorial Debut
","Coriolanus is a British film adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy Coriolanus that star Ralph Fiennes and Gerard Butler together with Vanessa Redgrave, Brian Cox, Jessica Chastain and Paul Jesson. This movie serves as the directorial debut of Fiennes. <br/><br/>Caius Martius 'Coriolanus', a revered and feared Roman General is at odds with the city of Rome and his fellow citizens. Pushed by his controlling and ambitious mother Volumnia to seek the exalted and powerful position of Consul, he is loath to ingratiate himself with the masses whose votes he needs in order to secure the office. When the public refuses to support him, Coriolanus's anger prompts a riot that culminates in his expulsion from Rome. The banished hero then allies himself with his sworn enemy Tullus Aufidius to take his revenge on the city. <br/><br/>This film is Shakespeare done right. Ralph Fiennes takes a play about Roman war and hubris and turns it into a violently charismatic picture. There something like poetry in this film, some truth that cannot be apprehended by staring hard at the screen, but drifts softly as a dandelion spore through the burned- out ruins of some sacked and dusty ""Rome."" it's a challenging, and even exciting, piece of cinema that's sure to inspire much love from Shakespeare enthusiasts."
"KineticSeoul","6","1","5","8 October 2012"," A man driven by pride alone...
","This movie is Ralph Fiennes trying to interpret and portray a Shakespeare's play ""Coriolanus"" in a modernized form. Where the background and everything is modernized except the dialogue and the story which takes place in Rome although it isn't Rome. You will know what I mean when you watch the movie. It sorta seemed like ""Romeo and Juliet"" the Leonardo Dicaprio version where everything is in modern setting, except the story and dialogue. Audiences that aren't familiar with Shakespeare's dialogue or have difficult time understanding some of it. There really isn't anything to worry about since the story is pretty easy to follow. Even if you can't get a grasp of what everyone is saying. There is some aspects of this movie that doesn't make sense which can be understandable since this is a reiteration of a Shakespeare's play. But it can bug some audiences that wants a realistic modern interpretation of a Shakespeare's play. Ralph Fiennes did a excellent job portraying the epitome of a man that is prideful, arrogant and stubborn that value pride more than life. A man named Caius Martius Coriolanus. And Gerard Butler was exquisite as his rival and enemy in war, that has a aura of charisma ad yet mystery behind him. Anyways I respect how Ralph tried to stay close with Shakespeare's story but it would have been nice if there was something more interesting or Ralph's own artistic vision into it. Not a lot but maybe a bit of it that might make this movie more engaging. Sure Shakespeare's works is known to be artistic but something more for the modern audiences would have been cool. This is a pretty good interpretation of a modernized style of Shakespeare's play but it didn't seem like it was amazing or anything like that to the point it sticks with you.<br/><br/>6.4/10"
"crownofsprats","7","0","1","12 June 2020"," Beard to beard theatrics
","Now this is theater! Apart from the silly groan-inducing title card that informs you we're in a sort of parallel Rome, this vigorous attempt to breathe relevance into an obscure and rather opaque Shakesperian tragedy starts off with a pulse-pounding jackboot to the face. Civil unrest! Heavy-handed state oppression! Angry plebes brandishing cellphones and protest posters! Truncheon violence! Mangy revolutionaries huddling in a shabby apartment! (""I've watched enough Pornhub, Rick..."")<br/><br/>What follows doesn't quite measure up to the vibrant immediacy conjured by the opening, but it's an ambitious - and more importantly, entertaining! - gamble that actually pays off, especially considering this an A-list actor's directorial debut, which is basically a more forgiving synonym for 'vanity project'. No need to entreat for forgiveness though, because Fiennes performs admirably on both sides of the camera. Looking more Patrick Stewart than the man himself, Fiennes is fully in command of his role - his meat-necked Caius dominates the screen from the first moment we see him dish out a sneering and contemptuous verbal thrashing to a shaggy plebe. You'll never hear the word 'fragments' used with such disdain.<br/><br/>Fiennes also manages to get great performances out of the rest of the cast...although, to be fair, only like four of them have any sort of depth, and a veteran like Redgrave would deliver a knockout performance even if she was being directed by a crushed bedbug.<br/><br/>In the last decade, Coriolanus has enjoyed something of a resurgence in popularity, with various ambitious stage versions getting the ravest of reviews. It's a grim, blood-soaked, and utterly humorless affair about militarism, turmoil, and proto-fascist tendencies. If our world wasn't so fully immersed in such a zeitgeist, I doubt anyone would be getting such mileage out of this play. But besides making the obvious modern-day connections - like...it's filmed in the Balkans, duh - Fiennes does his best to draw out two novel subtexts from it. The first is the relationship dynamic between Caius, his mother, and his wife - I'm sure you can guess where this one's going! Fiennes relies on nuanced delivery and silent reaction shots (including a self-contained scene devoid of any spoken lines) to get this one across.<br/><br/>The second is the homosexual subtext between Caius and his 'blood enemy' Aufidius (a steely-eyed and amply-bearded Butler), who seems to harbor an unhealthy obsession with Caius that goes beyond mere martinet loathing. The two of them danced the tango of death together on numerous occasions, leaving Aufidius with a major hardon for finishing the job, should they ever meet again ""beard to beard"". And yeah, when they finally lock proverbial beards after Caius and his men stage a Call of Duty-style assault on a Volscian stronghold, their knife fight really does feel like it's on the verge of another sort of passionate, manly, ""beard-to-beard"" action, where love and hate are but two strands on the same goat's beard. Lest you think that Fiennes is grasping for pubic straws here, the Bard straight-up wrote lines for Aufidius that compare his reunion with Caius to his own wedding night, so...yeah. Fiennes isn't perving up classic literature for shock value - it's all in there.<br/><br/>But these are mere garnishes. The real appeal here is the magic trick of transplanting an obscure conflict from the annals of early Roman history into the present day. In real life - aka centuries before the Caesars and their wacky carnival of horrors - Volscia was a swampy stretch of land somewhere east of Latinia. In this version, Volscia and Latinia are amalgamations of various two-bit backwater conflict zones, their nationalist warlords, their shabby poverty. There are echoes of the American military machine, and of the enemies it is meant to crush. It's a heady and thrilling conceit, but it runs into problems when it encounters the constraints imposed by the plot and the immutable dialogue in the second half. (Golden rule of producing Shakespeare: you can cut lines out, but you cannot write new ones!!)<br/><br/>Fiennes and co. have done an absolutely astonishing job at deftly dodging around many of those constraints, sure. But the truth is that ancient Romans - especially as viewed through the prism of a playwright living in feudal England hundreds of years ago - were completely different folks motivated by completely different notions that are all but impossible to transpose into modernity. Even with the eloquent use of televised and recorded video as a storytelling medium, Caius's fall from grace and subsequent exile truly stretch the seams of belief-suspension. And even with the incest angle, it's almost impossible to believe that a modern-day Caius would relent simply because his Mum asked nicely - that would require an entirely different societal paradigm where ancestor worship and matters of honor are, like, actual motivating factors in a person's decision-making calculus. This is why what ought to be the most climactic scene in the film is ends up being the most poorly executed. It just doesn't work. It can't possibly work, unless you take away the machine guns and replace them with gladius swords (xiphos swords, actually, if you want nerd out on the history).<br/><br/>It's too bad, because this is great entry-level Shakespeare. The bloody, explosive action ought to help lure the young'ns to the family couch. It certainly worked for me when I was a kid and stumbled upon Julie Taymor's Titus at the tender age of thirteen - grisly, phantasmagoric, sexy, classy...and a master class on how to do anachronistic Shakespeare right. I wolfed down all of the Bard's plays after that, patiently decoding the language, lest I miss an epic diss or a sexy innuendo. It took two hours to accomplish something no amount of public schooling ever could, especially since at the time their idea of 'hip' Shakespeare was showing Luhrmann's groan-inducing R&J adaptation in class.<br/><br/>Ah, kids, if you only knew how much depraved sex and violence awaits you at the local library..."

After that Coriolanus is banished from Rome and he goes to his enemy Tullus Aufidius.<br/><br/>I did not know what to expect from this movie but I was happily surprised by it. It's a very interesting movie which is based on William Shakespeare's play, it has a very interesting plot and much of suspense. The direction which was made by Ralph Fiennes was simply amazing and it was obvious in the whole duration of the film that he did a great job on it. Regarding the interpretations, I have to mention both interpretations of Gerard Butler's who played as Tullus Aufidius and Ralph Fiennes who played as Caius Martius Coriolanus because they were simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Brian Cox's who played as Menenius, Jessica Chastain's who played as Virgilia and Vanessa Redgrave's who played as Volumnia."

","Like Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, this film was based on a play by William Shakespeare, but set in the modern world, but with the Shakespearean language remaining, this was also the directorial debut for noted Shakespeare interpreter Ralph Fiennes, so I was looking forward to seeing how it fared. Basically in a contemporary alternate version of Rome, the city is at war with the neighbouring Volsci, Caius Martius Coriolanus (Ralph Fiennes) is the revered and feared Roman General trying to help bring order. Coriolanus is at adds with the city of Rome and the citizens, he is pushed and manipulated by his controlling mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave) to seek the exalted and powerful position of Consul. But Coriolanus fails to win public approval and gain support from votes he needs to secure office, Senator Menenius (Brian Cox) and Coriolanus' wife Virgilia (Jessica Chastain) lose hope in him following this failure, Coriolanus' anger causes a riot to break out, culminating in his exile from Rome. The banished hero sees the only solution is to offer his own life and services, and ally with his sworn enemy, Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler), and to take revenge on and conquer the city, but this can only end in tragedy, it ends with Aufidius betraying him, he and his men attack and kill Coriolanus. Also starring John Kani as General Cominius, James Nesbitt as Tribune Sicinius, Paul Jesson as Tribune Brutus, Channel 4 journalist Jon Snow as TV Anchorman (an unintentionally amusing performance) and Nikki Amuka-Bird as TV Pundit. Fiennes certainly makes his presence as the commander somewhat forced into forging a powerful political career in a conflict-ravaged society, then furious and trying to get his own back siding with the enemy, Jackman is less convincing as the enemy, Redgrave is a bit hammy at times, Cox as the influential politician and Chastain as the tender spouse give the best supporting performances. Whereas Romeo + Juliet had a fast pace and stylish visuals, this modern day adaptation certainly has some exciting battle sequences near the beginning and some places throughout, with characters covered in blood, but the pace slows with the chatty scenes with the characters in rooms talking, and obviously you have to concentrate to understand what they are saying, overall it is an alright political drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer for Ralph Fiennes. Worth watching!"

","I don't like Shakespeare.<br/><br/>I tried him on multiple occasions and in multiple forms and by now I could write an essay on all the reasons why.<br/><br/>However, Coriolanus the movie, is very palatable and the lack of popularity this movie has puzzles me as much as the popularity that Shakespeare has.<br/><br/>There are some familiar core problems. Some of the dialogue is poetic nonsense, for which you have to pause and rewind so as to try grasp for some meaning. There are some issues with the story as the wordy dialogues sometimes ignore to explain some basic story aspects, motivations or fail to concentrate on the plot making the movie feel on the slow side. Again, not sure that is the movie's fault rather than Shakespeare's (or the source Shakespeare ripped off). For example, the two main men of this film state that they want to be together and then repeatedly say that they hate each other, with no clear explanation for either of those polar opposite attitudes.<br/><br/>The general dialogue is nonetheless understandable so that one can follow it. It is helped by the good acting of everyone involved. Ralph Fiennes in the main role portrays the Roman general Coriolanus with his overly proud screws loose. His eyes alone could cut you. Good casting there.<br/><br/>The main hook of the movie is that the it is Shakespeare in modern times where Rome is shown in the style of a Western country while the Volsci neighbors are shown in the cultural style of the Balkans. This is not completely novel but it works well and the cultural styles are portrayed well, interesting to look at. There is a lot of hand held camera (but not shaky cam) and it makes things look more gritty and personal. Good cinematography overall, though the real action is not well shot as the cuts are too fast..<br/><br/>The overall plot is interesting. There are no real villains, which is always refreshing. There is no cheesy love interest or a hero. The movie instead explores the clash between patriotism, personal pride and duty to your people. It is an off-beat story.<br/><br/>With so many movies being a copy of the same 4-chord pop song formula, this Shakespeare based film is like a breath of fresh air. And on top of that, it is well-acted and for most part well shot."
"Tweekums","9","0","1","19 March 2015"," Shakespearian tragedy in a modern setting
","Caius Martius is Rome's most successful general; leading from the front to secure victory over the Volsces. However he is not popular with the people; they take his soldierly attitude to be arrogance and to be fair he has a fairly low opinion of them too. After his latest victory he is given the title Coriolanus and encouraged to run for the position of Consul in the senate. Tributes Brutus and Sicinius are uncomfortable with this fearing he will one day seek to control Rome without the senate. They quickly turn the people against Coriolanus and he is forced into exile. With nowhere else to go he heads to the Volscian city of Antium. Here he joins forces with his erstwhile enemy Tullus Aufidius and starts his revenge against Rome.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes does a brilliant job, both as director and in the role of Coriolanus. He captures the military brilliance of the man as well as his sense of betrayal when cast out from the city he has served for so long. As such he rather overshadows Gerard Butler's Aufidius, although this may be because we get to see far less of his character. The rest of the main cast do a fine job, most notably Brian Cox who plays Coriolanus's friend Menenius, Vanessa Redgrave who plays his mother and James Nesbitt who is delightfully unpleasant as Sicinius.<br/><br/>Before I started watching this I was unsure how the modern day setting would work but I need not have worried; in fact it worked very well. The Serbian locations clearly reminding the viewer that this is a timeless story; the battle scenes reminding one of the all too recent war that ravaged that part of the world in the '90s. Some viewers may have difficulty with the original Shakespearian dialogue but I found it engrossing as I had to concentrate just that little bit harder while watching. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film even if Shakespeare isn't 'your thing'; just be warned it is quite bloody at times."

","In his directorial debut, Ralph Fiennes shows that not only he is capable of directing film, but that Shakespeare's insights into human behavior, especially in observations of politics, remain timeless.

Butler masters Shakespeare with such depth and tactics that fulfill that his performance is one of the best he's done. <br/><br/>Vanessa Redgrave's Volumnius is one of many phenomenal performances she has done in her career- the scenes where she is talking plans with her character's son and the scene outside of the Senate are excellently done. Redgrave has done Shakespeare before, and can easily make the language accessible as the speaker. <br/><br/>Jessica Chastain shows her versatility in her performance in this film greatly, but, as Shakespeare wrote, it cannot be said that she is underused because of that. Chastain gives a great supporting performance of a character who is still not well known of Shakespeare's tragic heroines. <br/><br/>A great film that speaks of our time, where officials of wealth and privilege feel the need that that wealth and privilege makes them special enough to disregard the right and voice of the people they claim to represent, and where officials with their own interests can stir the masses for private gain."

","Great performances by the cast, well directed, plenty of drama on Shakespeare's part -- what more can you ask for in a great movie? I love Shakespearean tragedies; they always hit so close home to me, every time, so I wonder why the movie has scored such a low number on IMDb so far?<br/><br/>Tell me, is it the old tongue that daunts you so? I think the movie made the language extremely accessible to us without straying too far from source material; that, in its own right, is truly meritorious. <br/><br/>I myself have never been a fan of Shakespeare before. I always thought his plays to be dull, unmoving and a fanciful dullard's play. Perhaps it was the numerous times in secondary school where we'd have cold readings of the script in my classroom and the very rare allowances of real, live, professional performances in actual theatre houses that made me feel this way. I blame this on the incompetence of most of my English teachers since, at times, I didn't get what it was they were trying to teach us -- and they were speaking plain English to us in the classroom, mind you!<br/><br/>Shakespeare wrote his plays to be performed and what a fine job Ralph Fiennes did at delivering the story to us! I actually was able to follow most of what was going on without referring to any footnotes since Coriolanus was originally a play I've never heard of -- I blame this majorally on the fact that popular culture hasn't brought the story up nearly as often as like, say, Othello or Macbeth. (Remember, I was never a fan of Shakespeare.)<br/><br/>The movie integrated a modern setting into the production -- and yes, I can already hear everyone's groans -- but Fiennes was able to pull it off like Luhrmann before him. There were done stunning visuals and all the blood and gore and violence made this two hour long viewing seem very brisk and fast-paced.<br/><br/>Yet, addressing all previous complaints about the characters speaking in a relatively tongue, if you can't understand what's going on then perhaps you should go away and learn a bit more of the English language. Or, you can perhaps be a little more sympathetic towards such movies like these so you don't sound like a unintelligible bitch moaning about how unfair the movie is to us common people. I must admit, this movie does have an appeal to a certain group of the audience but never forget that your 'we' should never be used as a poor substitute for 'I' because that's a little unfair to the movie, don't you think?<br/><br/>Alas, I've spent much of my time venting my frustration with other reviewers so let's get back to the gritty basics.<br/><br/>Coriolanus explores themes such as pride, patriotism, fascism, politics, war. It tells the tale of a man who's both contemptuous and admirable, asking us whether it is right to lay down your beliefs of what is fair and moral to the demands of the mob, for the sake of peace. Like many of Shakespearean adaptations, this movie is intelligent, insightful and perceptive of human nature and behaviour. <br/><br/>If this seems like a movie for you then grab a bag of popcorn because you'll enjoy this."
"sergepesic","9","0","3","3 November 2013"," Human Tragedy
","Heroes and politicians, two remarkably different breeds. The first, fight bravely and spill blood, and the second, send them to do the dirty deed and despise them for being what they made them to be. And so Caius Martius ,courageous and conceited, enters the politics and quickly sinks in the quicksand of the foul swamps of populism. Ralph Fiennes in his directing debut, sets this classic play in some troubled, presumably Balkan nation, and in modern time. Many have tried that novelty, but here it is not a gimmick but the statement that nothing new happens in this world. If we only picked up a dusty history book from a long forgotten shelf, we might have avoided a war or two. But, then there is a lot of money to be made in human tragedy. Nothing pays better than tears and despair. Not our own, of course, but in some other unimportant land. Far away and easy not to pay attention to, almost as easy as for politicians to ignore heroes. Blood stains and Armani suits never go together, although they are never far from each other."
"g-bodyl","8","0","3","27 October 2013"," Interesting Shakespeare Adaptation!
","Coriolanus is a pretty interesting and engaging effort by Ralph Fiennes who is making his directorial debut with this film. I liked the idea with setting the film in modern times a la Jesus Christ Superstar, but I don't know if I liked the idea of using Shakespeare language because the film sometimes got confusing with all the old English. That being said, it's a fun, violent film and is pretty faithful to the original source as well.<br/><br/>Fienne's film is about a general named Coriolanus who is expelled from Rome by the people because of his tyranny. So he sides with his mortal enemy, the Volscian leader Aufidius to take back Rome.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. Ralph Fiennes does a solid job as lead actor and has some intense moments. Likewise, Gerard Butler does a good job as the blood lust Aufidius. Brian Cox and Vanessa Redgrave have good moments. As much as I like Jessica Chastain, I feel like she is not needed in this film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good adaptation of Shakespeare and I love how it is set in modern times. But they should have stuck with modern English to avoid any confusion. I can't believe not many people saw this film, but it's a watchable, entertaining one. I rate this film 8/10."
"Leofwine_draca","6","0","2","23 August 2013"," Good, but spoilt for me...
","...due to the presence of Ralph Fiennes as not only the main actor but the director as well. I'm no great fan of Fiennes: I just don't ""get"" the guy, and find his coldness repellent in whatever role he's in (even in those where it's suited to the character, like in RED DRAGON). His arty whispering and wide-eyed staring leave me equally cold. I appreciate his peers like Daniel Day-Lewis, who have the uncanny ability to inhabit each role they're in, but I'm no fan of Fiennes. The guy is overrated, pure and simple, and I've disliked him ever since I saw THE English PATIENT in cinemas way back when.<br/><br/>Apart from Fiennes, this Shakespeare adaption is decent. The idea to relocate the story in time from ancient to futuristic Rome is a great one, as I'm always a fan of updating the bard and reworking his plays for contemporary audiences. Coriolanus is one of his least well-known works so I enjoyed the twists and turns as the tale progressed. Fiennes is a better director than he is actor, delivering some blistering war scenes and a great one-on-one fight along the way. Who'd expect that from a Shakespeare movie? <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the decision was made to cast some equally cold and mannered actors alongside the star, so we're saddled with a dull Vanessa Redgrave and an out-of-place Jessica Chastain, who spends the whole time struggling to master the dialogue instead of living the role. The supporting male cast are better, including Brian Cox and James Nesbitt, and the real surprise is Gerard Butler, who really takes to the material and comes across as very natural in the part - who would have thought it?"
"shechapter127","6","0","4","9 June 2013"," A tragedy
","Firstly, I have to admit that I had never heard of Shakespearean tragedy Coriolanus before the film adaptation of the same name. Released in 2011, Coriolanus is set in modern-day Rome – there's mobile phones and 24-hour rolling news – but it remains true to the original language, something which gained it criticism in online reviews. I have to say that I also struggled to follow what was being said all the time and ended up turning to Google to check that I understood what was going on.<br/><br/>Roman General Caius Martius (Ralph Fiennes, who also directed the film) is at war with his old enemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) ""He is a lion that I am proud to hunt"". But the citizens are angry and turning on Martius call for his death - a lot of the imagery is similar to images we see on the news from the current conflict in Syria. Banished from the city, Martius goes in search of Tullus, sealing his own fate.<br/><br/>Coriolanus doesn't work as well as other Shakespearean adaptations, such as the commercially successful Romeo and Juliet. There is too much dialogue, which bored me to distraction. This was an opportunity to bring Shakespeare to the masses but I feel that it will only appeal to people who were already fans of the bard - you could say, it's a tragedy."
"Joe_Crisan","7","0","2","14 March 2013"," Give it 10 minutes to settle...
","At first, just like the modern ""Romeo and Juliette"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio, I didn't like this film. However, after 10 minutes, the pace and dialogue settles in and, at least for me as a viewer, the film draws you in and doesn't let you go until you've finished it.<br/><br/>There is action in the film, but, like ""There Will Be Blood"", the true gem in the movie is the drama and the acting. Anyone can say the word ""boy"", but Ralph Fiennes puts his soul into it - and into every word he spews in this gritty drama.<br/><br/>In the end, you can't really go wrong with Ralph Fiennes and Gerard Butler, can you?"
"Ric-7","10","0","2","10 March 2013"," The tragedy is this was invisible
","If you love Shakespeare, you should see this film. I was not aware this film existed until today. That's the tragedy.<br/><br/>The film is done as a ""war movie,"" and was promoted as such, but anyone looking for the usual action film will be disappointed in this film. This is not a war movie or an action film, any more than ""Macbeth"" would be.<br/><br/>This is an adaptation of Shakespeare's play. The setting is modern, but the words are all Shakespeare. I had not encountered Coriolanus since my college days decades ago, when we studied the text. I had never seen a performance of it, and it was considered one of Shakespeare's ""lesser"" plays--not much poetry, not much audience appeal.<br/><br/>This film was evidently released in this country in early 2012, at the time of year when ""problem"" films are usually dumped on the market after the rush of Oscar-worthy movies. I don't recall it being released locally--maybe it played at a local art house. Maybe for a week.<br/><br/>I think the film is a triumph for all concerned. The major achievement is making Coriolanus (the character AND the play) cinematically interesting. The script did an excellent job of pruning the text. Purists may recoil, but let's face it, a scene performed in front of military tanks not what Shakespeare would have imagined. Further, the script did not attempt to call attention to the cleverness of the adaptation, such as how a modern legislative chamber is used in place of the Roman senate. Instead, the script focused on the enduring issues, such as whether a public servant is chosen to execute the will of the people, or whether the servant is intended to exercise those personal qualities which caused him to be chosen. Or the question of whether there should be a separation between elected officials and the military.<br/><br/>With respect to the cast, I have nothing but praise, and astonishment. Ralph Fiennes did a remarkable job, showing a restraint which was sometimes absent from earlier films which he did not also direct. Vanessa Redgrave was just incredibly perfect. She has had many recent, excellent bits in very low-key roles (e.g., Atonement). But here, she is given an opportunity to show what she can do, and the effect is heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain did a fine job in what was basically a bit part. And Gerard Butler was (for me) the major surprise. Maybe he was offered the role because an ""action film"" actor was needed to boost box-office appeal. Regardless, he was allowed to perform without regard to affecting a British accent (or any other accent). The choice to allow him to focus on emotion rather than sound was a major plus. (Side note: Butler's first theatrical offering was in a production of Coriolanus. See Wikipedia.) Brian Cox is a grossly under-appreciated supporting actor. His final scene (with dialogue) is the best of the film.<br/><br/>I can't believe I missed this when it was released. I am so glad I found it today."
"KIM_HARRIS","6","0","2","7 February 2013"," Worth seeing but the text is stripped to the bone
","I wasn't sure what to expect of this modern adaptation of one of Shakespeare's lesser known tragedies. The opening with much running around with modern weapons like a scene out of an action movie did not augur well but it got much better as fighting gave way to talking and at least some of Shakespeare's fine original text came to the fore. The play is severely cut to get it into a film of just under 2 hours but there is just about enough left to make it work. The leads, Fiennes and Butler, are good with some excellent support from the likes of Vanessa Redgrave. There are many flaws in this film but it is worth seeing and there are thought-provoking resonances with the modern politics of war-torn countries and the hubris of warriors and leaders."

","Coriolanus is a 2011 British film adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy Coriolanus. The play is based on the life of the legendary Roman leader Caius Marcius Coriolanus.This is the directorial debut of Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>This movie is a modern era adaptation of the old Rome, senate and its soldiers.<br/><br/>Fiennes used modern day setting, of a city/country called Rome at war with a neighboring enemy. While the dialogue matches the 1608 Shakespeare novel, the settings are modern.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt a great way to tell an ancient story in a modern setting while still keeping the original dialogue. It was refreshing to see such a movie, since it really made you appreciate the timeless aspect of the story and its characters without concerning yourself with set designs or wardrobes.<br/><br/>This view of the play put all stock on the dialogue, characters and the story that was being told, instead of the bells and whistles that go with making a movie like this.<br/><br/>Well made, well directed, and a great performance by Fiennes."

","I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as i did. great acting and a very interesting and accessible adaptation. Redgrave is brilliant, Fiennes is also really good. My only criticism would be the woman who played one of the 'commoners' lubna azabal, some of the worst over-acting i have ever seen. really bad and distracting in her scenes. furthermore she and one man were the only two who spoke English with an (italian?) accent. i did not understand why this was necessary. we are told at the start it is rome yet the rest of the film is made up of British actors. not a problem per se, but why make two of the characters clearly non-British. it's a kind of Hollywood tokenism of making the audience aware 'this is supposed to be set in non-English speaking country'. always annoys me when they do this. either shoot the whole film in the language it is supposed to be set in, or make all the characters at least sound as if they are supposed to be speaking their mother tongue.The language clunks with the modern day setting too often. The modern day warfare doesn't help with the understanding of what is a fairly impenetrable play and if it doesn't help then what is the point. <br/><br/>other than that, great film. captivating!"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","2","10 May 2012"," Fiennes's show – front and back ""stage""
","Ralph Fiennes directed and lead-starred this little-known Shakespearean work that he acted on a London stage some ten years ago. In a magazine interview, he intimated ""I wanted to play the part again"", confessing his feelings for the protagonist in a paradoxical quip ""I kind of like his unlikeability"". He also explained that this is the only Shakespearean play ever banned, just before WW II in France, as being too right wing. He further likens Rome in the play to the world's oppressive superpowers today, and the rebelling Volscains to Chechnya, Georgia or even the Irish.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. Unflinching iconic warrior Caius Martius's (Fiennes) heroic defeat of Volscains earns him such popularities (together with the honorary title ""Coriolanus"") that he runs for Consul, a disastrous move. Anything but a politician, he walks out of the assembly in disgust at his supporters' hard-selling pitch of trying to persuade him to display his scars from the wounds. Later, after a scene not unlike Caesar's and Mark Anthony's respective manipulative speeches to the ""barbarous multitude"", what might have been glory turns into disgrace as he is banished. Bitterly infuriated, he turns to his ultimate enemy Aufidius (Gerard Bulter), who accepts his service and assigns him a troop with which he crashes the Roman adversaries. His possessive and domineering mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave) and gentle, unassuming wife (Jessica Chastain) are sent to plead, with eventual success. But after signing the peace treaty of behalf of the Volscains and returning to continue with his service, he is killed by Aufidius and his gang.<br/><br/>Some critics mislead by giving the impression that this film deals out modern day violent action and Shakespearean art in equal measures. Far from it, the action is shown only at beginning, culminating in a knife dual between Martius and Aufidius very much in the West Side Story (1961) fashion – you can almost see Russ Tamblyn and George Chakiris coming back to life. After that, for a majority of the film's time, it is very much dialogue driven as you would see it in a regular performance of the play on stage, punctuated with only a few montages of cross cutting scenes.<br/><br/>Fiennes nails his dream role. Redgrave is at her best, but then have you ever seen her when she is not? I haven't. Chastain has a much easier role compared with her other two films in the same year, ""The tree of life"" and ""The help"". One delightful bonus is the role of a ""First Citizen"" (not big but prominent) played by Belgian actress Lubna Azabal, who has given such a tour de force performance in ""Incendies"" (2010).<br/><br/>This film rendition of an obscured Shakespearean play is a worthwhile cinematic experience, but then something which is most important is missing. The most dramatic scene has to be Volcains's series of fiery speeches that eventual change her son's mind. Redgrave is marvellous. But if you where watching it on stage, and if you were a seasoned theatre audience, you would also be watching for Coriolanus's reactions as his mother speaks. His performances here, because of the silence, could arguably be a bigger challenge than the mother's. This is where a great actor will shine while a lesser one has no place to hide. In the film however, Fiennes is one hundred percent invisible and the camera is all on Redgrave. I would love to have seen him take this challenge."
