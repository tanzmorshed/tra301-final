"andrus943","10","303","349","8 April 2004"," Enough memorable scenes and talented stars to fuel a half a dozen blockbusters.
","With at least 12 `starring actors' in character and supporting rolls, half of them legends or mega stars; this Tarantino tale defies a short review.  The different levels on which this movie works are impressive. As a love story we begin to believe that the quirky `loser' couple is unconditionally bound together.  As a pseudo `film noir' we begin to care about the fate of the central characters.  In the suspense/thriller/crime drama mode there are plenty twists and turns to push us to the edge and pull us back just in time.  The action scenes are deliciously violent and unlike most other films, this one gives us pinches of humor sprinkled in amidst the mayhem.   Even `the King' alter ego is woven in credibly enough to improve our understanding of the Clarence Worley character.<br/><br/>The plot, albeit original, fresh and mesmerizing, seems somehow secondary to the characters and the characterizations.  Any of several rolls could have been performed over the top by what seemed to be an ensemble cast. But director Scott lets the talent go just far enough. Even the remainder of the supporting cast is wonderful; Saul Rubinek in particular does a terrific job as the puffed-up/ego-feeding movie producer.  Hollywood missed giving this movie and its cast proper recognition.<br/><br/>With enough memorable scenes and talented stars to fuel a half a dozen blockbusters, True Romance gives us the `best bang for our buck' in years. The Walken/Hopper scene alone is worth the `price of admission' not to mention the Gandolfini/Arquette and Slater/Oldman match ups.  This can only be described as a `wonderfully wicked movie' for its tantalizing content, smart dialog and toothsome violence.<br/><br/>Put the kiddies to bed, be prepared for rough language, adult themes and graphic violence and enjoy a `not for the faint of heart' masterpiece."

","True Romance is a celebration of film.  It wallows in every possible seedy contrivance of American crime/action cinema.  It is absolutely shameless in its exploitation of excessive violence, over-acting, melodrama, lurid sex, and rampant drug use...I love it.  Quentin Tarantino, as I'm sure everyone knows, wrote the story, but it is the in execution that this film pays off. The cast, oh the cast:  The lynchpins are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.  They both give solid performances, which prevents the film from flying off the tracks; they serve as the pilot light.  The supporting roles are the gas.  The Walken/Hopper show down has been oft sighted as the film's best aspect, and this is, arguably, true.  Just watch this scene and then watch it again.  Sparks actually shoot out of the screen and burn people about the head and shoulders.  OK, you've got Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis, Brad Pitt as a disgruntled pot-smoking loser, Tom Sizemore & Chris Penn as cops, James Gandolfini (pre-Sopranos) as a reflective hitman, and you've even got Bronson Pinchot (from TV's PERFECT STRANGERS) for God's sake. Did I forget Gary Oldman? Do yourself a favor and rent every single Gary Oldman related project (they're not all good films, but...).  Why is Gary Oldman not in every film ever made? Why? I ask you why?  He has got to be the best actor working today, hands down.  As Drexel Spivey, Oldman chews the scenery, digests it, and then expels it from every orifice.  Keep in mind that he is an English actor with a normal speaking voice at home in the Royal Shakespeare Company.  His performance here is second only to his turn in LEON in blatant over-the-top insanity. Tony Scott, who along with his brother Ridley, has been known to over-direct a film or two, here chooses wisely to basically set up the camera and run.  The score by Hans Zimmer adds a bouncy xylophone driven theme to the film and finds the right balance. This a well made, balls-to-the-wall, popcorn throwing, cult classic.  In a market dominated with stereotypical characters, this movie avoids that trap by letting the stereotypes flourish with all the grotesque absurdity it can muster. 9/10"

","I hesitated to watch this movie because I could not vision it being a crime movie with the name of ""True Romance."" I am so glad I decided to watch it through to the end. It had enough switches and surprises to make you want it not to end. Once you get hooked, you cannot let it go. I really liked it because the way it developed and did not make you want to stop watching. Great flick and you can tell it is a Quentin Tarantino movie.

"jhurst444","10","224","284","9 February 2004"," praise to a truly great film
","""True Romance"" is one of those few movies that has it all: Action, romance, drama and brilliant acting.  Not to mention TR has an all-star cast, but many contribute their finest work in this film.  Oldman, Arquette and Slater arguably give their best performances.  Christopher Walken's scene is nothing short of pure brilliance.  I loved him in ""The Dead Zone"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" as well as his brief appearance in ""Pulp"".  I was happy with the ending, and I'm glad it ended the way it did.  We've come to not expect that type of ending anymore.  This along with numerous other reasons too long to explain here is why I truly believe ""True Romance"" is one of the greatest films ever made. Period."
"Quinoa1984","10","125","162","20 September 2003"," Tarantino's most ""personal"" writing; Scott gives commendable direction to all-stars
","True Romance is the work of two men, known for making movies (as TBS would say) for guys who like movies, and have one of the pick of the litter in the genre from the early to mid nineties. Quentin Tarantino sold his script to fund Reservoir Dogs, and Tony Scott (Top Gun) got picked up to direct. Some have complained that Tarantino should've directed this film, that it's so much his (which I agree with considering the story of the film was taken from his 1987 experimental film My Best Friend's Birthday, which refers to Clarence in this film going to the Sonny Chiba movies) that his own style as a director would've complimented it. It's a nice thought, though that's not what we as the audience are left with, and so with the final product there is much to admire about the style that Scott uses in the film. He films Tarantino's script (from a Roger Avary script originally) very much like he's shooting a Hollywood movie (as he knows how to with DP Jeffrey Kimball), with all the cut-aways and editing timing that is expected in a conventional crime-drama-thriller, then by hearing the snapping dialog from the script, and the cast performing them, Scott does become an important piece of making True Romance a success.<br/><br/>The story is a throwback to the old 'lovers on the run' formula, among others- Clarence (Christian Slater in one of his finest) is an employee in a comic book store in Detroit, loves kung-fu movies and big guns and such, who gets set up unwittingly with a call girl named Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love, and Clarence feels confident enough by a certain voice in the back of his head (provided by Val Kilmer) to go and free Alabama for good from her vile pimp and drug dealer Drexl (Gary Oldman in one of the better villain roles of the time). He does, and through a couple of accidents Clarence and Alabama wind up with millions worth in cocaine, and high-tail it to LA to sell it, as the original (mob) owners of the coke follow after, with explosive results.<br/><br/>For fans of the actors, in particular the supporting cast, True Romance is one of the treats of treats in modern movies, on par with Pulp Fiction's roster of know-ables: Christopher Walken as a gangster (who would've thought?), Brad Pitt as a stoner roommate, Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as cops, a few good lines for Samuel L. Jackson, an early plum for James Gandolfini, and my personal favorite of the lot, Dennis Hopper as Clarence's ex-cop father. Another thing that makes True Romance one of the (dare I say) most accessible of Tarantino's works is that a viewer who might not know this is his work on first viewing (this was me a few years ago, sad to say) will stay tuned through the whole thing if it's on TV just because of the star power; indeed, before Oldman's Detrix is introduced into the film, TR seems to flow like it'll be a romantic drama with light overtones. All I can say is by the end of this film, you will see that good taste can prevail no matter how much bloodshed gets on the screen, or how many obstacles get in the way of love (and Elvis!)."

"turborory","10","131","177","1 January 2003"," Under-rated
","I've seen Reservoir Dogs, I've seen Pulp Fiction & I've seen Jackie Brown, but for me this is Tarantino's best crime caper. Completely engrossing from start to finish, the story of the two lovers who are on the run is not entirely believable, but seriously enjoyable. You get your fill of guns, sex, style and pop-culture, and the usual array of celebrity cameos in a film that seems a whole lot more 'close'. Whereas Pulp Fiction felt like one long trailer, with every line razor-sharp and a load of hip music that made the film go so quickly, True Romance offers you the chance to savour every moment, as the film moves at a (slightly) slower pace. Enjoy the blazing finale, and just wonder how it might have turned out if Tarantino had got his hands on the camera..."
"Infofreak","Null","114","155","4 June 2002"," Tony Scott vs Quentin Tarantino. The winner? Us!
","Cynical, seen-it-all-before smart ass that I am, I can't but help love 'True Romance'! On paper it looks like a sure fire recipe for disaster. A typically hip pop-culture saturated Quentin Tarantino script directed by schlockmeister Tony Scott, the man responsible for rancid Simpson/Bruckheimer ""blockbusters"" like 'Top Gun' and 'Days Of Thunder'. But some how it really works! The movie is especially helped by a dynamite cast, one of the most impressive in many years. Possibly only Julian Schnabel's underrated biopic 'Basquiat' can rival its mixture of star power and cult faves. Slater, Arquette, Walken, Hopper, Oldman, Kilmer, Penn, Sizemore, Jackson, Rapaport, Gandolfini, Argo, Corrigan, etc.etc. These are many of the finest actors working today. Add them to an electric story of love on the run, jam packed with amusing, highly quotable dialogue and plenty of action and laughs, and you have yourself a genuinely entertaining update of a classic 70s drive-in movie. 'True Romance' is a wild ride not to be missed!"
"cairnsymark1987","10","24","29","1 July 2013"," I like you Clarence, always have, always will.
","Simply put, this is the best movie that has ever been made.<br/><br/>Christian Slater gives an amazing performance as Clarence, so too does Patricia Arquette as Alabama. <br/><br/>Through out the movie, there are epic individual battles between Slater & Gary Oldman. Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper. The late James Gandolfini(RIP) & Arquette, not to mention the epic finale to this masterpiece. And the awesome short scenes between Slater & Val Kilmer, who plays Slater's imaginary friend, who is none other than the King himself, Elvis Presley. <br/><br/>I am giving nothing away as it would be an injustice to anyone that has not seen it, my advice is, go watch this movie immediately. I swear that you will not regret it. <br/><br/>Easily the easiest 10 out of 10 there has ever been."

","True Romance is obscure film. Film was unfortunate to come at the time in which huge blockbusters and award winning film were slowly coming to screen, there of it was forgotten. All people to who I recommended this film never heard about it, and when they saw it, they only have one word: SUPERB! Tarantino who decided to split Natural born killers and True Romance scripts (which ere basically same script ) made terrifying job at it, but real star behind film is late Tony Scott. Without a doubt, this is best film Scott has ever made, and that can be seen in whole film, from cast to score and even ending which is best thing that Scott decided to do, despite Tarantino's wishes, but even Tarantino himself was pleased at the end of it. Scott gave himself into the film and created cult masterpiece that will never be forgotten. Cast is terrifying. Cristian Slater before he become second rate actor and Patricia Arquete had believable chemistry on screen which made whole film. Supporting cast including Gary Oldman ( In his best role ever put to screen), Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Denis Hopper not to mention others, made beautiful ensemble cast which was not very well known at the time, but today, they are all first class actors. I could write about this film for hours, but in the end I can only say that watch this film and enjoy one of best films ever made. Live fast, die young, be a ice looking corpse!"

","True Romance has everything necessary to create art on celluloid. From the writing expertise of Quentin Tarantino to Tony Scott's brilliant directing to its cast of gifted actors, the movie is all that one would hope for.<br/><br/>Beginning in Detroit and ending in Mexico, a loner that never really made his mark on the world meets a call girl who falls as deeply in love with him as he does with her. Filled with drugs, gangsters, Hollywood and of course romance, the movie's story becomes only stronger as the movie goes on.<br/><br/>With exceptional performances by Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken (the scene they share is without equal), Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, the action and violence only help to develop the plot and accentuate it's intricacies. Its superb ending has since been imitated - by Tony Scott's own Enemy of the State for one - but never as cleverly.<br/><br/>A must see for any movie lover."
"zedmh","Null","28","36","18 May 2005"," the truth about true romance
","After reading some of the other reviews on this film I felt compelled to write a review. True Romance is my favourite film of all time. True Romance was not a film that got dusted off in the midst of Tarantino fever and is not attempting to be ""Tarantino'esq"" in its direction. Actually this was the first script that he ever wrote. It was penned whilst he was working in a video and comic store in Amsterdam. He rented the apartment above- anybody who has seen this film will know the parallels with Clarence Worley. Tarantino was actually trying to get his work taken on at the time by some film companies and he requested Scott because he loved his early work. It is true that later on Tarantino kicked up a fuss because they altered the ending and he criticised Scott for making it too Hollywood. Clarence dies in the original script! Anyway Scott agreed to make both endings and let Tarantino watch them, Tarantino then conceded he preferred the new version. The film wasn't trying to be Tarantino-esq that part was just the authors input on the film which is not common when people are making films like Harry Potter as the author has no knowledge of film but it is very common when working with screenwriters! This film is the most romantic film i have ever seen, brilliant characters, amazing sound track, brilliant acting & the cast alone informs us that this is one of the best films ever made. Brad Pitt was asked to be a lead character in the film but was working on another at the time. Pitt wanted to be involved so badly that he flew in for a days shooting just to do 6 lines as room mate Floydd. ""and some cleaning products"" was ad-libbed! Just see this film."

"stebird","10","13","16","28 July 2017"," My kind of romance
","Tarantino wrote an outstanding story/script and Tony Scott perfectly captured his vision on screen.<br/><br/>True Romance is probably the best romance film I have ever seen, and the fact that Quentin Tarantino had something to do with it gives you the answer as to why. <br/><br/>Ultra violent and seedy, you wouldn't expect anything less..., Tarantino seriously sprinkles some hardcore magic dust onto all of his projects creating the quality and style we are used to from him. <br/><br/>Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) receives an unexpected gift for his birthday, a prostitute called Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), but Clarence falls in love with Alabama and vows to free and marry her, he does so by confronting her pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman) and ""accidentally"" kills him. Clarence breaks the news to his new love and reveals he has succeeded in taking back her possessions from Drexl, but the contents of the suitcase aren't Alabama's possessions, it is a large quantity of cocaine. The couple agree to leave Detroit and travel to California with the drugs as Clarence's contact, Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport) can sell the drugs there. <br/><br/>High-jinks and classic twists and turns ensue as the mob lead by Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken) want what they claim to be theirs (the cocaine) back. This leads to a rather hilarious scene between Walken and Dennis Hopper, filmed in vintage Tarantino style, having a comical discussion before Hopper is shot dead. <br/><br/>Clarence and Alabama arrive in California where they meet Dick, his roommate Floyd (Brad Pitt) and a guy called Elliot (Bronson Pinchot), Elliot agrees to get rid of the drugs and makes the arrangements with Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek).<br/><br/>At this stage in the film, there is a very aggressive fight, akin to domestic abuse between one of the mobsters played by the late James Gandolfini and Alabama. This scene can be upsetting to some viewers as Alabama is seriously knocked about and in a critical condition towards the end, her face is a mangled mess and her body is cut, bruised and bleeding; yet in a cinematic sense the scene is quite beautiful and one of the most famous in this very infamous film. <br/><br/>True Romance is enjoyable because of the aforementioned ""magical Tarantino touch"" or MTT for short, the guy can take literally anything and turn it into gold, there's no other way to explain why this film is simply so good, the plot is simple, the whole story is simple, but it's how it's filled that counts, and True Romance fills its story with integrate little details, paying attention and making even its slower points or ""filler"" meaningful and enjoyable, this is something not a great deal of films bother with. <br/><br/>Pop culture runs wild in True Romance, as it does in the equally enjoyable Pulp Fiction, the music, bright colours, tongue in cheek language and dialogue, it pulls no punches and holds nothing back for anyone, a complete and utter politically incorrect film. <br/><br/>I was astounded by the amazing performance and work rate put in by Patrica Arquette, who could've guessed that in her younger days she really was a stunner? Perfect for the role of Alabama, her chemistry with Christian Slater was so convincing too, and his performance was one of my favourites of all his films. <br/><br/>A cult classic in every sense, and a highly enjoyable film to boot, I could watch True Romance over and over and never grow tired, just brilliant!"
"jackpenmanreid","10","15","19","7 October 2016"," Absolutely Incredible
","Watched this for the first time last night and it's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. You can tell it was written by Quentin Tarantino and if you didn't know otherwise you'd think it was directed by him too. Every character is brilliantly portrayed. Even supporting actors that only have minimal screen time such as Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper and Gary Oldman give very memorable performances and have some of the best scenes in the film. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette both give Oscar worthy performances in their lead roles. True Romance has the perfect mix of great dialogue, romance, action and strong violence. Without spoiling the ending, what I really wanted from this film was a satisfying ending and it delivered %100. Some scenes will have you laughing out loud while others while have you on the edge of your seat with tension. I don't really see the point of casting Brad Pitt in such a small and unimportant role when any actor could of filled the role but this in no way hinders the enjoyment of the film. The film also has a great soundtrack which I listened to straight after I'd finished and has a good mix of different genre's. True Romance is an astoundingly exciting film and would probably be best enjoyed by fans of Tarantino but I would recommend this film to anyone. Give this film a watch ASAP."

The scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper is one that is so convincing and executed it is like watching a work of art come to life.

"Leofwine_draca","9","9","11","23 November 2016"," Great mix of comedy, romance, and thrills
","A fresh and exciting crime thriller which mixes romance with the old-fashioned gangster antics that writer Quentin Tarantino is best known for. This is a hugely satisfying movie, well-directed by Ridley Scott's brother Tony, and with some fine cinematography which really comes out in the excellent action sequences. Despite the onslaught of screen violence and bad language, the strong, old-fashioned story is what keeps this watchable and entertaining throughout and it's nice to watch a film which doesn't take its audience for granted.<br/><br/>As well as the catchy tune that plays throughout, TRUE ROMANCE is blessed with an ensemble cast who help to bring out the various character nuances. Christian Slater is here, doing his young man Jack Nicholson stuff, yet he's never been more likable than he is now. Similarly Patricia Arquette's hooker-with-a-heart is an endearingly ""cute"" character that you can't help but warm to despite her many faults. Dennis Hopper is on hand as Slater's father, excelling in a torture sequence which expertly mixes comedy with graphic horror to great effect. Endearing comic character support comes from Bronson Pinchot as the dim-witted go-between to whom Slater tries to sell the drugs and Michael Rapaport as Slater's goofy wannabe-actor brother, Dick. Unforgettably evil are Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken as the villains of the piece, whilst minor roles are filled out by the familiar faces of Chris Penn, Samuel Jackson, Brad Pitt, and Val Kilmer, who has a weird Elvis-inspired role as Slater's imaginary ""mentor"".<br/><br/>Two superbly-crafted sequences stand out in my mind after watching this movie - the first is an exchange in the hotel in which Arquette is systematically beaten and tortured by one of Walken's sadistic henchman, looking for his cocaine. The moment in which the worm finally turns and Arquette fights back is more violent than in your average gore slasher, yet the scene is just so powerfully done with so much atmosphere that its unforgettable. Then there's the finale which involves a shoot-out to end all shoot-outs, and what can I say but ""eat your heart out John Woo!"". Excellent stuff. Any film fan should watch TRUE ROMANCE to find out how such a thriller should be made."

","'True Romance' is a deliciously pulpy romp that saw director Tony Scott bring a burnished visual sheen to an early Quentin Tarantino script. While the title suggests images of hugs, kisses, holding hands, and heartfelt human emotion, the film instead bombards the audience with images of blazing guns, brutal beatings, and lots of gushing blood while telling a twisted and entertaining tale of outlaw lovers on the run.<br/><br/>Clarence (Christain Slater in his best role ever) is a comic-book store employee, living a meager but not intolerable life in Detroit. On his birthday night, he meets a pretty blonde hooker named Alabama (Patricia Arquette, reliably efficient and displaying a great chemistry with Slater) and they are soon positively smitten, declaring their love for each other, only to be married a few days later. Clarence goes to see her pimp, Drexl (a truly whacked-out Gary Oldman who devours his ten minutes on screen), with the meeting ending with Clarence killing him and making off with a suitcase. The case, which Clarence thought contained Alabama's clothes, actually contains two-million dollars' worth of cocaine, and this puts this newly-married duo find themselves in quite the thorny predicament. Once the dust - and blood - clears, they decide to trek off to Hollywood to see Clarence's pal who might know some industry folks interested in high-quality coke. Little do they know that Drexl's partners (led by Christopher Walken's quietly malicious Vincenzo) are tracking them and intend to get their merchandise back, eliminating the couple for good measure.<br/><br/>True Romance is a paper-thin but enjoyably quirky romance carried by great dialogue, an unpredictable plot, and a cast of wildly original characters. The storyline is far from earth-shattering, but it guarantees some good escapist fun, especially since the script boasts a few scenes possessive of great wit and sparkle, along with a show-stopping one chock-full of dynamic psychological tension – between Dennis Hopper (who brings a phenomenal degree of warmth as Clarence's father) and Christopher Walken, whose ""vendetta kinda mood"" head-to-head became one of the most memorable sparrings of cinema. Many people may be turned off by the graphic and sometimes savage violence of True Romance. But that is only part of the dirty, funny and unpredictably violent genius of Mr. Tarantino. Tarantino and Tony Scott never pretend that the film is more than what it is - slickly entertaining trash.<br/><br/>Eventually, it is Tarantino's gutter poetry that detonates True Romance. This movie is dynamite - a hip, clever and irreverent high-voltage thriller with nary a dull moment!"
"barnabyrudge","7","11","15","21 May 2006"," Ultra-violent, foul-mouthed crime thriller with pop culture references galore and an unignorable level of style and energy.
","Take a look at the credentials of True Romance. Firstly, director Tony Scott - brother of Ridley - had made a series of visually hyper-active and ultra-violent action movies (Beverly Hills Cop II, Revenge, The Last Boy Scout). Secondly, writer Quentin Tarantino had penned and directed the ground-breaking Reservoir Dogs. Thirdly, the cast comprises of a gallery of supporting slimeballs played by edgy character-actors, each of whom had given the world some of THE unforgettable screen characters in their earlier films (Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Ed Lauter, Bronson Pinchot). Anyone expecting True Romance to be a quiet, low-key, gentle crime caper would have to have spent their lives on Mars! True to the form of its blood-obsessed talents it is an energetic, foul-mouthed, relentlessly violent, curiously comical crime thriller which commands attention in spite of its intentional excesses.<br/><br/>In Detroit, young comic book store worker Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) hooks up with a prostitute named Alabama (Patricia Arquette) at a late-night movie theatre. Within a few hours they are in love, and soon after that they get married. But Clarence still feels the urge to confront Alabama's pimp, the dreadlocked psycho Drexl (Gary Oldman), on the one hand so that he can claim back her suitcase full of personal belongings and on the other because deep down inside he wants to hurt the pimp's pride. Their confrontation turns ugly and Clarence ends up killing his vicious rival; afterwards he leaves the scene with what he believes is Alabama's suitcase, but it transpires later that he has walked away with a different suitcase containing a fortune in uncut cocaine. Clarence and Alabama skip town and head for Hollywood, hoping to offload the drugs onto a movie star or producer at a cut price. Unfortunately, both the cops and the drug kingpins are keen to get hold of the suitcase full of cocaine too, so they put men on Clarence's trail. Clarence meets up with his old pal Dick (Michael Rappaport), now a struggling bit player in Hollywood, who via a contact arranges a drug sale with an ace movie producer (Saul Rubinek). Unknown to each other the various parties who covet the coke-loaded suitcase draw nearer to a fatal, blood-drenched rendezvous in an LA hotel room from which no-one can expect to walk away alive....<br/><br/>True Romance is full of terrific hard-boiled dialogue and comical pop culture references. Slater is brilliant in the leading role, as is Arquette as his likably weird wife, but it's the gallery of crooked supporting characters who rule this movie. Walken has a chilling one-scene cameo; Hopper is terrific as Clarence's estranged father; Brad Pitt turns up briefly as a totally spaced-out drug addict; and Oldman is instantly fearsome in his electrifying scenes as the sadistic pimp. Tony Scott piles up the body count with one stylishly violent scene after another, all set to a soundtrack that is a trash-culture aficionado's wet dream. All the cursing, blood-letting, sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll eventually lose their impact through sheer repetition, but even then there's still the acting and dialogue to fall back on. You may need to have an amoral streak - or certainly a degree of tolerance - to enjoy True Romance, but if you like your movies fast, mean and outrageously raw you'll probably have a blast."

","In Detroit, Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) goes to the movie theater alone on the day of his birthday to watch three kung-fu movies. The gorgeous Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) accidentally drops her popcorns on Clarence and they watch the movie together. Then they eat pieces of pie and they have one night stand. On the dawn, Alabama confesses that she is a call-girl hired by his boss and friend to spend the night with him, but she has fallen in love with him. In the morning they get married and Clarence goes to the club where she worked to bring her clothes. However her pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman) and his partner beat up Clarence that reacts killing them both. Clarence asks to the other girls to give Alabama's suitcase with her clothes and they mistakenly give another one with cocaine.<br/><br/>When Clarence discovers the mistake, he decides to travel with Alabama to the house of his friend, the aspirant actor Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport), to sell the drug in Los Angeles and then travel to Mexico. He visits his father Clifford Worley (Dennis Hopper) and gives his address to him. But the Sicilian Mafia is the owner of the drug and a group of killers is hunting down Clarence and Alabama.<br/><br/>""True Romance"" is a great cult movie written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater show a wonderful chemistry and have top-notch performances and the supporting cast is impressive. The movie has a non-stop action and is excellent even after watching many times. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Amor à Queima Roupa"" (""Love at Close Range"")"
"heypresto","10","12","17","29 November 2008"," WOW!!!! watch this movie!!!
","This is probably the greatest movie I've ever watched and I've seen a LOT of movies!!! I am not a film reviewer, but felt compelled to review this one... also this film has a bit of an Elvis/Kungfu theme and I HATE Elvis and kungfu, which is even more of a testament to this film! Quentin Tarrentino at his finest, we all loved pulp fiction, but in my opinion this film is far greater!!!! The casting is phenomenal, the acting is superior and the music just blows me away! When the film kicks in Patricia Arquette is narrating the intro and it's like poetry! This film will move you! This film has everything! It's funny, sad, dramatic, dark, twisted and clever I gave this move 10/10, my favourite film being the Godfather it should definitely be up there in the top 100 IMDb films! The Dennis hopper / Christopher walken part is a real treat the scripting and acting is out of this world, in fact there is something likable about all the characters in this movie I don't know how Tarrantino does it!!"
"Oberrated","9","9","12","14 November 2016"," A gift to entertainment
","Super satisfied to be directed to this movie and very upset I never took the time to view their earlier in my life. 'True Romance' is a treat from start to finish. Piling on an endless barrage of action, comedy, romance, mystery, suspense, and add any other element, this flick probably has it without ever feeling too much. The script very obviously projects Tarantino's influence, making this a treat to the Tarantino fans. The acting from everyone that appears on screen is excellent. If you have never seen this film before, you will see titans within the movie industry appear with such minor roles yet are so satisfying to see. The film as a whole is a fast-paced roller coaster ride, consistently entertaining the viewers with each moment that passes. The material within this film alone could fuel hundreds of other films. A truly fulfilling entertainment piece.<br/><br/>A definite recommendation here from Oberrated and two thumbs up.<br/><br/>--Oberrated--"

","QT wrote this film and it was directed by Tony ""Ridley's Little Brother"" Scott and it is, quite simply, a masterpiece. A violent masterpiece, yes, but a masterpiece nonetheless. Christian Slater must look back on this film with a sense of longing because he has not been given as good a project since (Churchill: The Hollywood Years, anyone?).<br/><br/>Patricia Arquette is as cute as anything and perfectly fits her role. Call me crazy, but she really seems to be enjoying playing the ""hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold"". In fact, everyone seems to be loving the hell out of a superb script. The scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken is one of cinemas greatest ever scenes! The famously egotistical Val Kilmer goes almost unseen as Elvis - sorry, The Mentor - and Brad Pitts now-famous Cleaning Products line was a brilliant ad-lib. Gary Oldman as the white-rasta Drexl is the epitome of nastiness. Even Samuel L Jackson gets a high billing in the credits, but is in the film for less than 5 minutes! Genius. By the way, check out the DVD extended/deleted scene scenes for a longer discussion on cunnilingus. It's hilarious.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a collection of brilliantly written scenes, filled with memorable quotes and held together by a sweet, believable and totally mad storyline with a better-than-A-list-cast. Even the tragically underused Ed Lauter gets a look-in. Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn excel as the cops on the trail. The weakest point is Bronson Pinchot, but even he keeps pace well.<br/><br/>My only regret is that QT didn't direct it himself. Scott did an EXCELLENT job, but I would like to see QT's version.<br/><br/>QT to remake True Romance and Natural Born Killers: The pressure-campaign starts here!<br/><br/>10 1/2 out of 10!"

"Pookyiscute","10","5","6","8 February 2006"," Excellent; funny, sweet, romantic, intense and hot!
","This film has to be one of the best films that came out in the 1990's. It has everything an audience could ask for; murder, action, romance, sex, comedy, drama and a great story behind it!<br/><br/>Quite possibly my new favorite (written-by) Quintin Tarintino film. I can't actually tell you what the film is about without ruining it, but let's just say, it's excellent. It's not a chick flick or a guy movie, it's a little bit of both...but enough of each so that everyone can enjoy.<br/><br/>I'm really excited about this film, because it's so cleverly written, with quite a bit of honesty and reality thrown into it, that you can enjoy it without getting frustrated from the unrealisticness of some parts, or the intensity of some of the other scenes. <br/><br/>The acting was outstanding, and let's face it Christian Slater is not too ugly to watch in a movie, and Patricia Arquette's breasts had top billing above her name I think. But, she herself was amazing. I don't know if she was nominated for this role, but she should have been, because she was excellent. Probably the best character and actor in the whole movie. A lot stars are in this before they were ""stars"" including; Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Michael Rappaport, Bronson Pinchot, and James Gandalfini.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to everyone! It's an awesome movie, but mind the rating. It's rated the way it is for a reason. There is some violence and some nudity and sexual content that might not be suitable for some.<br/><br/>I hope everyone takes a look...I'm adding it to my collection!"

The story makes Alabama and Clarence such a lovable couple. The supporting cast such as Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman and Val Kilmer were all really amazing. Although Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater really did dominate this film. The story is complex but flows really well. The film is an action romance mostly."

James Gandolfini is arguably as brutal and brilliant. The scene with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken is pure gold. Clarence and Alabama are played to perfection by Slater and Arquette and their love feels real. Arquette plays, in my opinion, one of the big screens all time greatest heroines. I very rarely purchase films but True Romance sits proudly on display in my Blueray collection. I refuse to reveal any plot but this is a MUST SEE!! The late great Tony Scotts Masterpiece."

"WilderMovieReviews","10","6","8","19 March 2012"," I know people that hate this film, but I know far more that love it.
","The film was written by Quentin Tarantino, and it really shows with the sharp dialogue and crazy plot. The film centres around Clarence (Christian Slater) who meets and marries Alabama (Patricia Arquette). After Clarence goes to get Alabama's belongings, through a series of mishaps, he ends up with suitcase of coke and they decide to sell it. This leads to a wild adventure involving drug dealers, police and movie executives.<br/><br/>The casting in this film is amazing with Hollywood greats turning up and each one adds something special to the film. But by far the best performance is by Brad Pitt as the roommate of Clarence's friend Dick. He is on screen for a total of about 5 minutes but steals every scene he is in. However every one of the characters in the film brings something special. The performances by Hollywood greats, including Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and Gary Oldman all come so close to being over the top, but the incredible script and brilliant directing manage to hold back just enough to stop it going too far.<br/><br/>This film is a true masterpiece where everything just falls in to place. The film is not for the faint of heart though. There are very graphic scenes of violence. One particular scene involving a woman getting severely beaten. The perpetrator definitely gets his comeuppance though. While the violence is very graphic, as with most of Tarantino's films, it is very bloody but also portrayed in a realistic manor. This adds to the shock and also to bring you closer to the victims.<br/><br/>I cannot praise this film enough. It is one of the greats that has been overlooked by many including Hollywood. Almost all of the performances are worthy of Oscar nomination, as with the script. But this film was overlooked by all the major awards.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Tarantino films, or films with a good cast and great story give this film a try. I know people that hate this film, but I know far more that love it."

"imseeg","10","4","5","21 August 2018"," Full blown Quentin Tarantino flick. ""So cool, so cool, so cool"".
","True Romance was released after Reservoir Dogs but before Pulp Fiction. Reservoir Dogs was a worldwide critically acclaimed debut, but True Romance was written by Quentin Tarantino way before Reservoir Dogs was made. Therefore it is logical to assume that the real debut of Tarantino was actually True Romance, Tarantino's first motion picture, as a screenwriter.<br/><br/>With this cool script Tarantino molded True Romance into a brilliant gangster movie like only he can make them. Yes, we gotta pay some dues to the director Tony Scott as well, but to be honest, this is a full blown Tarantino flick: ""so cool, so cool, so cool"".<br/><br/>Every characteristic later to be found in all Tarantino classics can already be found in the script of True Romance: the referals to other movie classics, the obnoxious violence and most of all lots of brilliant true to life dialogue. Tarantino is a known addict of talkshows and I love Tarantino's work foremost for his ever brilliant dialogues. <br/><br/>The acting is brilliant too, with an incredible big cast of now household names that perform as supporting actors. Choose your pick: roles by a young Brad Pitt, and a young Samuel L Jackson. The always to be feared Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman and James Gandolfini who all play crucial and shocking supporting roles. Christian Slater's best role in his entire carreer, and Patricia Arquette has never shone as brightly as she did in True Romance. This movie is an actor's heaven. Just incredible, you wont find any movie today with such a star cast.<br/><br/>Everything is over the top in this movie. It bursts with energy! And almost everything is full blown big. The soundtrack is subtle, gorgeous yet very powerful. The photograpy is over the top, but still very mesmirizing. The speed of this thing just won't stop. Even the scenes with just dialogues are performed on steroids. Everthing is big, fast and cool about True Romance! This picture shows Tarantino bursting to life with his first script. I think it is as great as his other classics. What a joy to watch over and over again. Just brilliant!"
"kimlorraine-42585","10","4","5","28 May 2018"," Quintessential Tarantino/Scott movie

"ThomasDrufke","8","4","5","12 September 2017"," Classic Tarantino
","True Romance is one of those movies that I've heard about for so many years and heard so many great things about, but never actually got around to seeing until now. In many ways, this is a classic Tarantino film. Albeit, it's only written by him and directed, it still feels like the same old obscurely charming tone that he brings to each of his films. At its heart, True Romance is a romance with a little bit of violence, luckily the incredibly talented cast and smartly written script, it's a whole lot more than that.<br/><br/>I'd be wrong not to mention the amazing Hans Zimmer score that finally turned me on to the film. It's so simple, yet so cheerfully poignant, if that makes sense. Coming and going when needed, and always having a presence, it's truly one of Hans Zimmer's best, which is saying a lot. I had to get that out of the way because there's plenty more to get excited about with True Romance. Let's take the cast for example, which displays some of the greatest cameos in film history. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Michael Rapaport, Bronson Pinchot, and Brad Pitt make up the main cast. But the supporting cast includes Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken, Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, and Gary Oldman make their presence felt for sure. I don't want to overstate it, but it may be the greatest ensemble of all time.<br/><br/>It's not just that there's a lot of great actors though, everyone gets their chance to shine. Brad Pitt has a glorified cameo-role, but yet it's one of his more memorable roles. Gary Oldman is unrecognizable as Drexel, and also has a small part, but his big scene is easy one of the best in the film. Gandolfini, in a pre-Sopranos gig, proves to charismatic yet terrifying as a henchman for a crime boss. And who can forget Walken's iconic cameo as Vincenzo Coccotti, another person after Clarence and the cocaine he stole. Scene after scene, line after line, True Romance is one of the most quotable and re-watchable films ever made.<br/><br/>Granted, after one viewing I'm over-hyping it a bit. There are some undeniable issues with True Romance, like how everything happens so easily for Clarence. There are some consequences for his character here and there, but for the most part, he gets away with what he wants and it all comes very easily for a guy who was just presented to be a nerd from Detroit. I also don't feel like the ending completely wraps up what it needs to. In classic Tarantino fashion, things happen really fast and in a chaotic and unexpected nature, therefore leaving a few strings loose in the end. Seemingly leaving the door open for a sequel, which never came.<br/><br/>In all though, True Romance is a film that is as enjoyable to watch as it probably was to film. Everything was hitting on all cylinders, and it became a classic many years later for it. <br/><br/>8.4/10"
"PredragReviews","8","4","5","5 May 2016"," ""Hey, get some beer, and some....cleaning products.""
","This is a great movie, a cool movie, a funny movie and an action movie. Directed by Tony Scott, one of the best (if not the best) action movie directors around, True Romance is the story of Alabama (Arquette) and Clarence (Slater) young newlywed lovers on the run with a stolen suitcase full of $5m worth of the mafia's coke, which they intend to sell. But as the old saying goes, the path to true love never runs smooth and a battle of wits ensues between Clarence, the police and the mob leading to a classic finale in this action packed film. As a whole, this movie works beautifully but on DVD it's even better because you can access all your favorite classic scenes that unmistakeably bare Tarantino's hallmark again and again. Such as the opening scene where the heterosexual Clarence (Slater) states that he'd sleep with Elvis if he were still alive, or the showdown between Clarence and dread-locked gangster (Oldman). Or the showdown between the mob boss (Walken) and Clarence's Dad (Hopper). Classic scenes indeed, particularly the one with Walken and Hopper.<br/><br/>Also some other great performers that make this movie as entertaining as it is, are: Michael Rappaport as the dopey aspiring actor (auditioning, of all things, for a one-time role as Crook #2 for an episode of ""T.J. Hooker"" that is set to co-star Peter Breck!), Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore as over-zealous narc squad partners, and Bronson Pinchot is wonderfully whiny as a movie producer's whipping boy and go-fer named Elliot. So I suggest you sit back, relax, and suspend disbelief while you are taken on a very strange and very satisfying ride through a lesser known piece of the Quentin Tarantino universe.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10."
"charleswjoke","10","4","5","20 November 2015"," Simple yet effective
","I LOVE True Romance. Its a simple yet effective movie with amazing moments and characters that make me happy to watch film. The plot includes the classic traction twist and twirls with many minor characters who ultimately have a lasting effect on all the characters. Some people who aren't really important exude personality and charisma and makes the viewer want to watch a whole film about them (Gary Oldmans, Christopher Walkens and Brad Pits characters come to mind). The film feels cohesive (to me) and employs funny differentiations to other films on similar subject matters: drug deals (the Dr Zhivago conversation is one of my favorites), violence, romance, friendship, family, trust, loyalty are all important themes that are explored throughout whiteout a flaw. I felt invested into Clarence's plight throughout and felt rewarded for my diligence and interest. Please watch it and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did."
"schroeder-gustavo","9","4","5","9 August 2015"," Dialogue is awesome
","Although True Romance is directed by Tony Scott, the screenplay has Tarantino written all over it, which is a good thing, cause the funny, street smart dialogue is the best thing about the movie, you could say it's what fuels it.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with cameos and great actors, including Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Brad Pitt and more. But I really have to praise Gary Oldman as the crazy pimp in this movie. Although he doesn't get much screen time, by far one of the best performances of all time. Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken also stand out in this movie, especially in a scene they share together. Oh and James Gandolfini is also in this one.<br/><br/>Like I said, the dialogue is amazing but I don't think the movie always goes down as smoothly as Tony Scott would have liked it to. It just feels to me that the pacing is kinda off sometimes and the score doesn't help. This is a weird thing for me to say cause Hans Zimmer composed the music for the movie, and I'm a huge fan of his, but I really didn't like the score to this movie, I thought it was annoying.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, True Romance is thoroughly entertaining and it's a movie that takes chances. It's not generic, it's not typical and I love that. One can't help but wonder what would have happened if Tarantino had gotten his hands on the camera."
"mgtbltp","9","4","5","6 April 2015"," Once Upon A Time In Detroit
","Once Upon A Time In Detroit<br/><br/>A heart beat of Noir.<br/><br/>The title sequence for True Romance magically conveys us to the bleak cold desolate vortex of the Rust Belt 1990's Detroit, but also back a million plus years to the time when fantastic tales were spun by ancient man around the first campfire. Only in the here and now, the fire is scrap wood fed and in an oil drum in a vacant lot surrounded by hobos, outcasts, and scavengers and the fantastic tale is offered with rising sparks and smoke up to the eternal night. A Neo Noir tale.<br/><br/>Very few of the classic noirs used the female voice over, one that readily comes to mind is Claire Trevor's in Raw Deal. This neo noir story is triggered in one long flashback by a voice over narration by ex-call girl femme fatale Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette). Arquette here is downright outstanding, if ever there was a character that captured that effervescent spirit of Marilyn Monroe's various characters (and updates that quality to the 90s and makes it her own) in a film it's Arquette's Alabama in True Romance. She is a blond, buxom, bombshell, a ""firecracker"" the ""shot from the front"" sequence where she jiggles down the courthouse steps rivals Marilyn's classic ""shot from behind"" wiggles from Some Like It Hot and Niagara. You just sense that if this were still the big studio days and she was under contract she would have been typecast into many of these kind of parts in quick succession at the peak of that phase of her beauty, Arquette might have become iconic but would the price have been tragedy as it was for Marilyn? As it is her performance is just a one off. The studio days are long gone and the atmosphere is catch-as-catch-can and Arquette did not get another similar Neo Noir role until her double parts as Alice & Rene in Lost Highway. I guess time will be the judge if contract stars of the Studios or those of the new corporate deal system will be best remembered in the long run. Arquette here ranges from sweet and coy, to desperate and deadly, her transformation into Athena with her Amazonian like war scream is chilling. <br/><br/>The tale unfolds as quasi comic book/martial arts/Elvis geek Clarence gets shot out of the saddle by a B-girl at a local tavern. Later at a late-night triple bill Sonny Chiba show, Alabama, in a contrived maneuver spills her popcorn over the seat on Clarence. She expresses her dismay in an instantly lovable cutesy/ditzy manor and is soon climbing over the seat and settling in beside him. They soon connect and later over pie and coffee in a diner begin to fall for each other. Clarence takes her back to his pad above the comic book store where they make love. Later Alabama confesses that she is a call girl and was paid and sent by Clarence's boss as his birthday present. Clarence is not mad at all says it's the best present he ever had and that it was not just the physical part but he never had so much fun with a girl ever before in his life. They pledge their love for each other and get married. The whole sequence is wonderfully written and rings so true that you suspect it is somewhat biographical. <br/><br/>Clarence, (Christian Slater) in probably his best role, watch his dialogs with Alabama and his father. He is ""cooler than cool"" as he follows his personal rockabilly espirito Elvis in the way he deals with situations and travels life's highways. . Elvis tells him to confront Alabama's pimp Drexl and it's this meeting that sends the tale spiraling into Noirsville. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is superb, Michael Rapaport as Dick Ritchie a struggling numb nuts want to be actor who lives with stoner Floyd (Brad Pitt) who has a plastic honey bear bong. Bronson Pinchot is the weasel Hollywood yes man Elliot Blitzer to producer Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek). Dennis Hopper is Clifford Worley, Clarence's security guard father who sings Country Western songs while making his rounds and lives in a trailer park wedged between the river and the railroad tracks. Mafioso Don Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken ) is a capo for Blue Lou Boyle. Virgil (James Gandolfini ) is a reflective hit-man. Gary Oldman is delightfully over the top as courier and pimp Drexl Spivey. Chris Penn as Detective Nicky Dimes and  Tom Sizemore as Detective Cody Nicholson are Gung ho LA cops. Samuel L. Jackson is Big Don a spastic druggie with some memorable lines, and Val Kilmer is ""Mentor"" (Elvis).<br/><br/>Ably directed by Tony Scott with beautiful cinematography by Jeffrey L. Kimball. A great soundtrack by Hans Zimmer stitches all the segments together. True Romance is one of those films that prove that every once in a while Noir has a pulse. A fun flick with abundant eye candy 9/10"

I challenge anyone to show me a better acted and written scene in cinema than the one between Chris Walken and Dennis Hopper. Just a powerful scene that is well directed by Tony Scott(RIP). Along with the beautiful soundtrack in that scene mixed with the intense dialogue and attitude, I promise you you will have it on your mind for a very long time. The Unrated version of this film is the only way to go! Yes, there is a lot of violence but the violence is set up with such emotion that it is difficult to not feel complete understanding with the characters as to why they did what they did and how they did it. The scene with Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini is quite emotional as well. This scene catapulted Gandolfini into the go to guy if you wanted a believable old school mafioso in your film and most likely helped him get his award winning role as the head of the Soprano family. I guarantee, if you love a violent well written underdog story you will love this film. The tension filled final scene will leave you breathless and wanting more but in the greatest way possible. Thank you Quentin for such an amazing script and thank you Tony Scott for doing what you do best!"

After one night of romance and sex the two fall in love and get married. When Alabama wants to get out of her life as a hooker,Clarence decides to get her briefcase of clothes only to discover that the briefcase of full of bags of cocaine that belongs to the mob. Now,with Clarence and Alabama heading to Los Angeles for their honeymoon,the couple have to deal with Gangsters,Cops and tons of danger and violence.<br/><br/>Released in 1993,True Romance is a classic film that despite being directed by Tony Scott,written by Quentin Tarantino and receiving rave reviews from critics was a Box Office failure and ignored by audiences. But thanks to the worldwide critical and Box Office success of Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction,True Romance was rediscovered by audiences on home video and cable and became a Cult film and a classic and the praise is well deserved. True Romance is great film that just flawlessly mixes Action,Crime Drama and Romance all within two hours and just grabs you by the throat until the very end. It's a film that thrills and excites you with suspense,drama and Action and gives viewers a truly amazing and unforgettable cinematic experience that you will never ever forget. It's a wild and unpredictable journey that is surreal and politically incorrect and it just stays with you after you watch it. TR is a beautiful love story set in the dark world of drugs and violence and you see the great balance of a love story and the dark violence that hangs over the film and that's what makes TR very clever and original. Although TR was directed by Tony Scott,TR is truly a Quentin Tarantino film through and through. The screenplay by Tarantino is brilliant and unforgettable and has all of the trademarks that are often associated with Tarantino's other films:pop culture references,sharp dialog,black Humor and memorable well-written characters. The dialog and characters in the film are amazing,fresh and original with each scene of the main characters and dialog just coming alive and explodes with fire and intensity. Each main character who's in the film for a long or short period of time will stay with viewers because Tarantino's script and Scott's direction allow them too and each main character commands the screen. Tarantino has said that TR is his most personal screenplay and it is true with references to Kung Fu films,love for movies and comic books and references to other films. Clarence and Alabama are great characters because they feel real and true and when you see Clarence and Alabama say that they love each other it doesn't feel forced or fake but very romantic and powerful. And despite the violence and chaos all around them,Clarence and Alabama stand by each other. Clarence and Albama are two characters you won't forget. The Action scenes in the film are great and brutal and the thing that I love about each Action scene in the film is that there is great build up and suspense with dialog and when the dialog and build up ends it explodes with violence. Tony Scott brings the same brutal violence and cynical style he brought two years before in his Action classic The Last Boy Scout and does it without missing a beat. The ending of the film is amazing and when the ending happens it's very explosive and at the same time optimistic and truly beautiful for the main characters Clarence and Alabama. It's an amazing and wonderful ending that will make viewers smile and cheer and is a great cap off to this classic film.<br/><br/>The whole cast is masterful. Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette are excellent and their best as Clarence and Alabama,with Slater and Arquette bringing intensity,depth and great chemistry to their roles. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as Clifford Worley,Clarence's policeman Father. Val Kilmer is great as Clarence's Mentor in a yellow jacket who like Clarence. Gary Oldman is brilliant as always in his small role as Detroit player Drexl Spivey,Alabama's pimp. Brad Pitt is hilarious and fun as Floyd,Dick's stoner roommate. Christopher Walken is wonderful as Vincent Coccotti,a Detroit gangster. Bronson Pinchot(Elliot),Michael Rapaport(Dick Ritchie),James Gandolfini(RIP)(Virgil),Saul Rubinek(Lee Donowitz),Samuel L. Jackson(Big John),Chris Penn(RIP)(Nicky Dimes),Tom Sizemore(Cody Nicholson)and Anna Thomson(Lucy)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Tony Scott is brilliant and stylish,with Scott using great camera angles,harsh lighting giving the film a beautiful visual style while Scott also does a wonderful job with the Action scenes. Rest In Peace Tony Scott you are and were one of the greatest Action directors of all time and you left the world too soon. RIP,Scott.<br/><br/>The score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful,dark,light and romantic,with Zimmer making the score beautiful and dramatic and matching each scene in the film. Great score by Zimmer.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Tony Scott,Quentin Tarantino,Action Films,Crime Dramas,Romantic love stories or films in general,I highly suggest you see True Romance,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","This was probably one of my favorite movies of all time, up there with City of God. By far the most loaded cast that I have ever seen in a movie. By having so many big-name actors (though they may not have been as big at the time) the scenes are made so much more important because despite being leading men, most of the guys are only in a handful of scenes. This transcendence made every scene not only extremely important to the movie's plot, but also very entertaining. It also helped to make the movie more suspenseful because being a 'big name' did not mean that that actor would survive certain circumstances that they might normally. All in all this movie was absolutely amazing and it is more than worth the two hours you will spend entranced by one of Tarantino's most masterfully written stories."
"bob the moo","Null","25","50","1 February 2004"," Tries a bit too hard but is still enjoyable
","When Clarence meets Alabama they hit if off immediately and fall in love. So when she reveals she is a call girl hired to get him laid on his birthday it doesn't matter, and they get married.  Clarence decides to make Alabama's break from the job official by collecting her stuff from her pimp. However when that meeting turns into a bloodbath he mistakenly picks up a suitcase full of drugs.  The pair say their goodbyes and make off with the drugs to sell them in LA, however the drugs leave a track behind them, one that both the mob and the police follow.<br/><br/>In the height of Tarantino fever, several of his scripts got quickly dusted off and handed to big name directors in an effort to capitalise on the public flavour for his dialogue and mix of pop culture references and violence.  True Romance was one such film and, in fairness it does fairly well to emulate the films of the writer himself - big cast, snappy dialogue, violent shoot outs and so on.  In fact the film lifts his style to the extent that it even rips off (or homage's) other films - most notably in the theme music that is almost a photocopy of Badlands.<br/><br/>The film wears this a little too obviously and clearly is trying very hard to be Tarantino-esque, most of the time it works out but at times I just wanted it to relax a little bit.  The plot is pure geek wish fulfilment mixed with crime thriller; a beautiful woman picks up a comic-book fan in a cinema showing a martial arts triple bill!  It works reasonably well by filling the scenes with colourful characters, pop culture dialogue and violence - at times it gets a bit much and I wanted characters to talk normally without a wall-to-wall soundtrack just some of the time; however it does have some very good scenes at times.  Stand outs are the scene with Walken and Hopper and the scene where Alabama takes a beating, but, if you like Tarantino's films then you should be happy with most of this.<br/><br/>The style of the film is a little uneven.  As I said, it is really trying hard to be a Tarantino film but at the same time you can see Scott's glossy action-movie hands all over it!  The two don't really fit together all the time and would honestly rather have had a different director at the helm. The cast however is as deep as Tarantino films were drawing at the time - everyone wanted the chance to be cool!  Slater is cool and fits the role well and even Arquette manages to be quite good, although her narration is about as flat and dull as they come.  It is the support cast though, who the film belongs to.  The film has roles for a variety of people whether it be non-speaking roles or one or two scenes.  In a way this is a bad thing because some great actors have nothing to do and are wasted but overall the effect is good and each cameo makes an impact.  When a cast includes Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L Jackson, Victor Argo, Michael Rapaport, Saul Rubinek, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore it has to be at least worth checking out!<br/><br/>Despite the fact that Tarantino's words in another directors hands doesn't feel that right, and the fact that Scott's very slick Hollywood direction doesn't quite match with Tarantino's much less establishment writing this is still a good film.  As you'd expect it rips off every `lovers on the run' movie that you'll have seen but it still is funny and slick enough to stand up for the rather generous running time.  It may bottle the brave ending of the original script but it has some very good scenes along the way."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","10","17","13 November 2005"," This movie.... is.... so.... AWESOME!
","I was watching ""I love the 90's"" on VH1. They mentioned ""True Romance"" and this movie looked so cool, it has been stuck in my head. I went to my local Blockbuster, and guess what? They didn't have it! :( That was a very sad moment for me, because this movie just couldn't get out of my head. Then finally, I discovered another Blockbuster that carried it! Yay! I loved ""True Romance"". This movie has the biggest all star cast I have seen in a while. Christian Slater, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, etc. Amazing. They all had these cool parts that they made them their's. <br/><br/>Basically, Christain Slater and Patricia Arquette have this kind of twisted but sweet romance. When they marry each other, Christain Slater tries to get Patricia's things,but instead ends up with over half a million dollars of coke that would make Scarface say ""wow! That's a lot of coke"". Their whole lives take a big turn for the worse. <br/><br/>The story is unforgettable and the speech between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, I will never forget it. That was one of the coolest speeches in cinematic history. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone! I'm going out to buy it right now! I am not joking, folks. This is a terrific movie! Please, also we should work on getting this in the top 250. <br/><br/>10/10"

","Pure genuine wonderful action romance better than any chick flick in my opinion! Technically Quentin Tarantino's first, since he wrote it which is impressive cause it's well written with heart and a joyful soundtrack that makes me smile. Packed in with an all star cast that's fun to watch.
Important to note there's some very violent scenes that were done to perfection despite the subject matter, especially the scene with Drexel (Gary Oldman) that is the bees nees of awesomeness among other flawless parts like the dark part with the psychotic character of a henchman (James Gandolfini) that's always intense.<br/><br/>Clarence's (Christian Slater) early charismatic charm is always a delight throughout to watch in this too and most anything else I've seen. I'll also mention in case anyone's wondering, my first 2 favorites are Fight Club and The Matrix. Also (Tony Scott) has done many excellent films, unfortunately he's gone now. Sorry I got off subject a little; I'm quirky and wanted to mention a few things."

","They don't come much more entertaining and enthralling than this early '90's classic. Even though this is very much a Tony Scott film (and one of his very best for that matter), ample credit must be paid to our man Tarantino for putting this wonderful, crazy ride together. His dialogue pulsates with wit and verve, his characters radiate with charisma and manic energy, and the whole film is a colorful, rich, endlessly engaging romp. And we can't forget the dynamite cast, who are all at the top of their game here. The Walken/Hopper Sicilian scene is truly one for the ages, and the chemistry between Slater and Arquette is fiery.<br/><br/>It's just a shame that the film wasn't more appreciated and lauded upon its initial release but it has rightfully found a cult following in the years to come."
"tommyboy-80445","10","5","7","23 November 2015"," Enduring cult classic
","Loved this movie from the first time I saw it back in 1993. Recently revisited it and found it just as engaging and clever 22 years later. This remains one of Tarantino's best scripts, equaling and even trumping some of his more celebrated work. <br/><br/>The ensemble cast here is priceless. Maestros like Walken and Hopper in the now classic Sicilian scene, Gandolfini in the equally infamous fight scene with Arquette, Pitt as a sedated stoner, Kilmer as a barely visible Elvis type imaginary friend. It really doesn't get much better than that, not to mention the palpable and pure chemistry that Slater and Arquette share.<br/><br/>""True Romance"" is a popcorn film of the highest order. It has stood the test of time and remains a true cult classic."

"Chrysanthepop","Null","5","7","23 November 2008"," Bloody Wild Romance
","At times, 'True Romance' reminded me of David Lynch's 'Wild At Heart' and Oliver Stone's 'Natural Born Killers' (the latter came out much later). Even though there has been movies based on similar storyline 'True Romance' has a lot of stuff that makes it its own movie. Yet, I cannot shake the idea that perhaps had I watched the film during the time of its release and not seen the other similar films that have been made since, I might have enjoyed 'True Romance' a bit more. 'True Romance' is very much a pulp fiction itself (no pun intended as Tarantino wrote the screenplay). It's got the hooker with a big heart, the 'nobody' who finds a reason to live, a fake Rastafarian pimp who thinks he's black, the mobster, the cops, blood, murder, violence, drugs....and there's enough energy to entice the viewer. I enjoyed the numerous Elvis references, the wicked humour, the dialogues, the characters and the performances. Tony Scott does a fine job as director. Christian Slater is great as the likable 'nobody' and Patricia Arquette is brilliant as sweet hooker Alabama. Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman and James Gandolfini are outstanding. Fans of pulp fiction may enjoy this more than others but even otherwise it was a fun Saturday night watch for me after a tiring day."
"Danny-Rodriguez","10","12","22","15 February 2006"," This really is the ultimate Quentin Tarantino movie.
","True Romance. Tarantino's first, and ironically enough most original, movie. Though directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun, Enemy of the State) the film remains very faithful to Tarantino's original conception. With the exception of the ending and the trademark Tarantino non-linear storytelling being taken out. There are oh so many things in this movie that Tarantino's later works reference to that it's like a Tarantino fan boy treat! Which I am not anymore. But during my one year time as a fan boy I did read the script of this movie and this was before I even saw the movie. So this being so very faithful to the script you can imagine how psyched i was seeing this movie. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie starts off in not so sunny Detroit with our anti-hero Clarence. Clarence lives a very lonely life with comic books, Kung Fu movies and Elvis as his greatest passions. But one day a woman named Alabama comes into his life. They fall in love instantly and armed with a 38 caliber revolver, a suitcase full of cocaine and most of all love, they set off to sunny Hollywood to try to sell it off and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Many people brand this movie as a narcissistic teenage boy's wet dream. Well it's not. This is supposed to be a fairy tale and it so is. I mean he's a film geek and she's a hot girl. Well it turns out this hot girl likes movies and comics to so they get married. That's every man's dream. Tarantino didn't set out to make a fairy tale when he wrote it but the changes that Tony Scott made (as small as they were) really changed the theme of the movie and made it lighter and more like a fairy tale. Personally I would have really liked to see what the movie would have been like if Tarantino had directed it.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies which has a wonderful cast. First there's Christian Slater (....well...True Romance) who plays the character of Clarence very good. Had this been directed by Tarantino in the early nineties the part would have been played by Tarantino himself. Slater plays it with a certain style and this really is his best film ever. I wonder why he doesn't get better parts in movies. Then there's Dennis Hopper (Land of the Dead, Speed) who plays his father in a couple of scenes. The whole movie is worth watching just for him. Gary Oldman (LÃ©on, Lost in Space) plays a very cool role as Drexl the pimp. Good old Gary. Christopher Walken has a small role and plays it very calm and cool. Michael Rapaport, (Friends) who we all know from Friends and Deep Blue Sea, Plays struggling actor Dick Richie and gives a solid performance. And last but most certainly not least there's Chris Penn (rest in peace) as Detective Nicky Dimes. He plays the part with such coolness and style and the film would not be what it is if he weren't in it.<br/><br/>""People have asked me: 'So would you ever do a romance movie?' like that's not what I would do. 'Well, I did a romantic movie, True Romance.' 'No, no, I mean like a real romantic movie.' 'Well that is a real romantic movie.' 'No, like one without violence?' 'Well there'll be a lot of things in any movie I do that will be contradictory, but anybody who's a fan of the movie can tell you, the title - True Romance - is not ironic...this is true romance.'"" - Quentin Tarantino."

","It was my second time viewing True Romance - the first being probably about a decade ago, around 2010. All I really remembered about it was that Gary Oldman's character was quite controversial, quite intimidating, and his performance quite impressive, while I also loosely remembered Arquette and Slater's characters falling in love. I also remember that I loved the movie thoroughly, and this time, I felt the same. It feels like a Tarantino movie because it is - his writing is clear, and if you ask me, it's one of Tarantino's best works. May I also say that Patricia Arquette in this is one of the great babes of my lifetime, if not of all time - simply stunning. Visionary, fat-free directing by Tony Scott, electric pacing designed to stimulate consistently, oodles of over-the-top sequences, a zany score by Hans Zimmer that at time reaches into realms of emotional beauty as well, and a plot structure that manages to say incredibly simple but feel completely progressive the entire time. And so many of the incredible ensemble cast only need one or two scenes to put in a classic performance, from Oldman to Walken to Hopper to Sizemore and so on. And Slater is as likable as ever. It's his Heathers character taken to an even further tier, yet in a more realistic manner. This film is sheer entertainment constructed in the most gleeful manner. Peak filmmaking."

A crime fiction movie with a script by Tarantino and a incredible line up of cameo appearances by people who went on to become more well known than they were here.
You probably won't recognise Val Kilmer as the spirit of Elvis, as he his face is never shown clearly.
Samuel L Jackson manages about 60 seconds of archetypal patter before being blown away by...
Gary Oldman, who does a great evil Ali G impression (white man with dreadlocks and African American patter) before Slater deals with him.
Dennis Hopper puts in a memorable stint, as Slater's father, before being blown away by...
Christopher Walken, in vintage Mafia mode (and he survives the carnage).
As does Brad Pitt, at least as far as we know, who plays a laid back doper dude.
James Gandolfini gets to play the prototype of Mr Blond, and audition for his career defining role in the Sopranos, before Arquette manages to despatch him.
Bronson Pinchot gets to play it straight for a change, but that still doesn't save him.
And Tom Sizemore and Nice Guy Eddie, I mean Chris Penn, turn up as colourful cops, who also bite the dust in the Mexican stand-off gone wrong finale.
Very good."

"classicsoncall","9","2","2","9 June 2018"," ""That's the way it goes. But don't forget, it goes the other way too.""
","You want to hear something funny? Not knowing anything at all what this movie was about, I've avoided it for a long time simply based on the title; I'm just not that big on 'romance' movies. Pretty dumb, huh?<br/><br/>Well when I finally learned it was partly a Tarantino project I had to get my hands on it. This all in hindsight, because back in 1993, Tarantino was still pretty much an unknown quantity. With an uncanny ear for scintillating dialog, he lights up the screen with characters and situations that defy logic and gravity alike. And the film doesn't rely simply on the actions of it's principal characters either. The Christopher Walken/Dennis Hopper matchup would be a main event in any arena. The violence of course is quintessentially Tarantino, so one wouldn't be mistaken for thinking that Tony Scott was channeling the famed director this time out, as in virtually all respects, one would think Tarantino did the directing honors on this one too.<br/><br/>With a star studded cast of principal and supporting players, this film is non-stop adrenaline all the way. So if you're a fan of this stuff you won't be disappointed. The rubout final showdown between the cops, the mob and the movie mogul's goons is reminiscent of a similar scene in the prior year's ""Reservoir Dogs"", but this time played out with a multiple cast that you can't keep track of for all the flying bullets and bodies. It's more of a roller coaster ride than the roller coaster ride, and you'll see what I mean if you watch the picture."

The dialogue is absolutely brilliant, as expected, and there are many standout scenes! Story is kind of a brutal take on an American dream, maybe? It's an action/romance with some black comedy in the mix. Very entertaining and enjoyable! Features a really good soundtrack!"
"Christopher_Reid","8","2","2","11 April 2015"," Entertaining and funny with a great cast but it's missing something
","True Romance succeeds very well at being fun, entertaining and exciting. However, it lacks depth in a noticeable way. It lacks an ending, a message. It does go pretty full out but not enough to work only on that level. I felt there was a lack of heart, of sincerity. It is kind of romantic but not really. Not in a profound way. It's a mix-match of crazy scenarios, villains, twists and accidents that don't add together but just distract you along the way.<br/><br/>But at least the plot keeps moving and is full of surprises and funny situations. It had me laughing out loud several times. Bronson Pinchot and all the scenes he was in were hilarious. Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn were also very funny. Christian Slater is likable but a bit naive while Patricia Arquette is gorgeous and lovely - she is feminine and caring but also strong.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is full of great actors giving excellent performances. Gary Oldman is one of my all-time favourite actors and it's incredible how he vanishes into his weird but menacing character. Christopher Walken is quite intimidating even with his cheeky smile and twinkling eyes. Dennis Hopper is superb and his scene with Walken appears to be one of the most popular movie moments of the 90s. James Gandolfini has a brutal scene with Patricia Arquette that makes a big impact. Brad Pitt is pretty amusing in his 2 minutes or so of screen-time.<br/><br/>It's not surprising at all that Tarantino wrote the script. In fact, his screenplay was apparently divided up into both this film and Natural Born Killers. The dialogue isn't on the level of his other movies - it's not as sharp or insightful. I prefer the philosophy and bite of his directorial efforts. But the overall structure is very similar: there are shoot-outs, the threat of torture, drugs, unexpected visitors and trivial conversations. Moreover, Tarantino intended for the scenes to be in a non-chronological order (like Pulp Fiction). It's hard to say if that might have worked better. Tony Scott seems okay as a director but I think he tends to focus on style over substance and fails to give the movie any special mark of his own.<br/><br/>One issue I did have was the exploitation of violence and lack of a solid message. Is it really just about a true romance? Considering all the violence and comedy, it obviously doesn't take the idea seriously. But great movies should have some kind of purpose and True Romance clearly lacks that. Confidence is good but it can turn into cockiness.<br/><br/>You could throw in some deleted scenes, take certain scenes out and it wouldn't make a difference. The scenes don't build on top of each-other. True Romance is engaging but only as an action comedy thriller, not as a great story. There are no unique insights, no satire or commentary. And it basically glorifies violence. As if it's fun and doesn't have serious consequences."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","2","7 January 2015"," Pretty fun
","No doubt, perhaps there could've been more fluidity in this, but it doesn't matter. The two leads are exquisite, both injecting their characters with a lot of charm and humanity despite all of the things they are embarking on and doing. That's a real achievement. It's maybe not as great of a film as it clearly aimed to be, sort of similar to other classics of older eras or even classics of its own era, but it's remember rather well, and that's impressive. I really saw it because of Patricia Arquette, and she shines here surely. I think it's a film that will be very hard to dislike for most people, and it's something that will be so much fun to most."
"Aaron1375","8","2","2","8 November 2010"," The movie is kind of all over the place, but it somehow works!
","This film is about a guy who falls in love with a hooker and marries her. What a lovely story, taking this poor miscreant off the streets and showing her that he is willing to take care of her. Of course, you know everything is going to go without a hitch. Not really, from a crazed white pimp who thinks he is black to mob types to undercover cops this couple is going to have a really hard time getting to the honeymoon. The film has lots of violence, some sex, and inexplicably Bronson Pinchot who at the time was still most known as the lovable Balki from the television show ""Perfect Strangers"". Well here he plays a guy who gets caught by the cops with some white powder on his nose and it is not from a doughnut. The film's best sequence to me though was the Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper one. Great scene, I love how Hopper's character basically realizes what is going to happen to him so he does his best to insult Walken's character as a parting shot. Just wish both of them were in the movie a bit more, especially Walken who disappears from the film after this scene. I could have done without the Elvis ghost scenes, but aside from that I have a rather positive image of this movie despite the fact it is not something I typically care for."

He never expected what Slater had in mind. And, guess what? Her clothes were not in the bag he took! I always like seeing Dennis Hopper. he just makes a movie more interesting. I'm sure he didn't want to meet Christopher Walken. He brought James Gandolfini with him - a formidable pair. He shouldn't have told that story about the Moors and my people. Gandofini did OK with Hopper, but he should have never messed with Arquette.<br/><br/>Wow! Bronson Pinchot, Michael Rapaport, Brad Pitt and Saul Rubinek, too.<br/><br/>What an ending!!!!

Christian Slater plays a silly, unbelievable character with a cocky smile on his face throughout the movie.

"fertilecelluloid","9","5","8","8 January 2006"," Outlaw cinema masterpiece with A-list cred
","I find Tony Scott's films hit-and-miss. I've liked all the Tarantino films Tarantino has scripted and directed, and I like ""Natural Born Killers"" a lot, a film he wrote but didn't direct. Originally, Bill Lustig was set to direct ""True Romance"", but Scott ended up with the project. The result? Cinematic dynamite! This is outlaw cinema with an A-list cast and budget. It is an intense, compelling, adrenalin-pumped masterpiece that is one of the most re-watchable films in my collection. There are so many great sequences and the characters, thanks to Quentin's sharp, inventive screenplay, are all distinctive and memorable. Christian Slater's ""cute meet"" with Patricia Arquette, in a cinema screening Chiba's ""The Streetfighter"", is just fantastic. Slater's across-the-bar conversation where he admits that he'd f**k Elvis is hilarious and perversely understandable. Gary Oldman's intro scene where he and his pals steal a case of cocaine and chat about eating a woman's p***y and a** is pure grindhouse. Dennis Hopper's big dramatic scene with Chris Walken is a knockout, as are all of Saul Rubinek's scenes. Val Kilmer is a great Elvis and James Gandolfino, as the humble baddie who beats Arquette senseless in one of the film's most vicious scenes, is give-the-man-an-Oscar great. Of course, cinematic masterpieces like ""True Romance"" don't get Oscars. Because all the elements gel so beautifully, why exactly TR works so well is not plain to see. It just does. It's high gloss ex-, blax- and sexploitation all stirred into one steaming cauldron of gunfire, bloodshed, sexy sleaze, hilarity, and the naive, glorious idealism of youth. It has a devil-may-care nihilism about it and an energy level that is rare for a film sent through the Hollywod machine to mainstream distribution. Not surprisingly, it didn't do great box office, but it's done good business on DVD and been rediscovered. Scott, when saddled with good screenplays, like ""Man on Fire"", ""Revenge"" and ""Spy Game"", is more than capable of delivering first class entertainment. When he's staring into the face of crap like ""Domino"", he camouflages the manure with bloated stylization. ""True Romance"" is his best film, and one of the best films ever produced in Hollywood. Oh, I almost forgot, Brad Pitt's ""Floyd"" character is simply, well, untouchable."
"yobdan","2","31","76","18 December 2000"," The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen.
","Plot Spoiler: This movie is terrible.<br/><br/>There is no doubt in my mind that the reason Tarantino didn't direct this himself is because he is smart enough to see how sophomoric it is. It has all the gore, noise, dirty characters, ""hip"" dialogue and star-studded cast of his other films except it is missing one key element... artistry.<br/><br/>Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs: I will defend forever the necessity of violence in those movies. I am a big fan of Tarantino's directing, storytelling and interesting characters; this film has none of it. Because it wasn't directed by Tarentino, it has no taste. The movie treats its characters with as much care and interest as an injured wolf gnawing its own leg off. The script and direction treat the characters as obstacles to the action sequences (which there aren't many of).<br/><br/>The violence usually associated with Tarantino (and his immediate influences like Peckinpah and Scorsese) appears for reasons unknown to Tony Scott. Violence is a way of life for the Wild Bunch or Nicky Santoro of Casino. The directors gracefully and lovingly examine the characters and foreshadow their downfall. We are not supposed to really like the characters, we are supposed to be entertained by them and enjoy their confusion amongst the terrible, dark situations they are thrown into. Here, Christian Slater plays the role as if it were Kuffs 2. He walks through the entire movie with a smirk on his face because he knows the ending of the movie and the size of his paycheck.<br/><br/>This is not a Tarantino movie. Tarantino sold the script to fund Reservoir Dogs. True Romance has the feel of a Tarantino rip-off, but instead it is basically a rip off of everything he ever saw in that famed movie store he worked at. It is interesting for true fans of Tarantino to watch this movie and see him evolve from 'wannabe-tough guy movie maker', like Tony Scott, to his unique style of film for which he is famous.<br/><br/>PLOT SPOILERS<br/><br/>The plot itself is completely unbelievable and so over the top that you want to take a shower in spring water and watch Beauty and the Beast. This movie is the epitome of ""glorified violence."" Everybody in the film has to be a bigger badass than they were five minutes before. Watch the scene between Oldman and Slater or Hopper and Walken. Both those scenes are such crap that you wish Scott hadn't even bothered with plot. Basically he wanted to show how cool his characters can be. Those two scenes ruin the movie, no I take that back, it's a terrible movie, those two scenes emphasize how terrible it is. It is based on glamor and attitude, like a Britney Sears video, and has no basis in character development at all.<br/><br/>The beauty of Tarantino's real films is the weakness of each of his characters (the gold watch, Jules' enlightenment, Mr. White's compassion, Mr. Blonde's sadism). The only character here that has any flaw is the character played by Bronson Pinchot. That character was created for comic relief, not out of an interest for his flaws and morals (or lack thereof). Not one action made by any character in the movie makes any sense. Alabama falling in love with Clarence after she is paid to have sex with him, Clarence deciding to go kill Drexl and his gang just because Drexl kicked one of Alabama's friends in the stomach, Clarence's dad suddenly becoming so badassed and hard-edged that he p***es off the one-dimensional Walken character... The only reason people think that scene is any good is because they recognize Hopper from his earlier roles in life, they obviously overlook how ludicrous it really is.<br/><br/>Every action scene has our two heroes living, despite the odds. The scene where Alabama is beaten in the bathroom quite possibly is the most pointless, mind-numbing five minutes of film ever, especially because she lives. Give me a break! If the scene illustrated how terrifyingly she was murdered then maybe I could stand to sit through it. Why does a comic book salesman think he can escort his new girlfriend through a drug deal? It's not interesting in the least. It's stupid! The whole movie revolves around the idiocy of the audience. It depends on the viewer to become stupider with each scene to understand the ending. How the hell do they survive? That's not interesting! It's stupid! Nothing about this movie is any good.<br/><br/>There is not much else to say, the movie is so unrealistic and so unbelievable that each scene makes less sense than the one before it and the audience quickly runs out of forgiveness.<br/><br/>I was going to give this movie a 1 but then I remembered Brad Pitt's cameo and decided to give it a 2 out of respect for THAT actor and the only role in this movie that was believable. I lost a lot of respect for Oldman, Hopper, and Walken.<br/><br/>*After reading the reviews to this film by users of IMDb.com I realized that nobody has seen any good movies. If I hear one more comment about the scene between Walken and Hopper I will buy the rights to this movie and burn every copy of it. Do yourselves a favor, rent a lot more Howard Hawk, John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Martin Scorsese, and Sean Penn. They make great films. Tony Scott doesn't. Tarantino is not as original as you all think. I almost want to say I am not a Tarantino fan strictly on the basis of how simple-minded 90% of his viewers are."

We get to see two broken individuals be there for one another and raise themselves up from the gutter. Not only that but we have a unbelievably talented cast in every single role that brings so much extra color to the film. That combined with the rich cinematography of Tony Scott gives us a film that surely will be remembered as a classic in years to come.

"ryanherst","9","3","4","28 January 2016"," I love this movie!
","I love True Romance, loved it the first time, and still love it! Super fun, ultra-violent twist on classic love story. <br/><br/>Extraordinary cast!!! The last really fantastic performance by Christian Slater, incredible improvised scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini doing what he did best years before The Sopranos, and a magnificent battle sequence between him and Patricia Arquette, who stands out as the all-too-rare STRONG female lead in a genre near entirely bereft of any, especially at the time. While Gary Oldman has a long list of outstanding performances--particularly as villains--from Leon the Professional to The 5th Element, I would argue that in his role in True Romance, more so than any other, he transforms himself into a character almost unrecognizable from either the other roles he's played, or himself as an actor. Even though he's got relatively little screen-time in this flick, he steals the show as one of the most memorable performances. Across the board this cast was, and remains, unmatched both in raw talent/skill and chemistry. Even with their tertiary roles, actors like Tom Sizemore and Brad Pitt bring a levity and realism to their characters in a movie that could have easily fallen into the annals of hyper-violent 90s pulp schlock. The few characters/performances worth criticizing, like that of Balki from Perfect Strangers, or the big blonde body guard at the end, are completely forgivable in the face of this film's casting powerhouse.<br/><br/>Classic Story!!! Although the story is relatively simple, it carries all of the central components to a classic archetype: redemption, sacrifice, true love, and tragedy. The simplicity of the story overall might feel boring or unoriginal to some, but I believe it frees the characters to have clear drive and compelling motives. A story with greater complexity would easily crowd a movie like this one, which devotes as much depth as it does to so many different characters.<br/><br/>Nerd Cred!!! The movie opens with a loner comic book and martial arts cinema fan falling in love with a beautiful, incredible woman that loves those same things (and long before it was cool to like comic books). Clarence then proceeds to become a total badass, mirroring the super heroes from comic books in his actions and accomplishments. The film does a great job of masking this in its raw and desperately raced tone, but the subtext remains as a nod to old school fanboys, if not a shout out.<br/><br/>This film is certainly not for everyone. If you're looking for a story with unpredictable twists, unconventional editing, top production values, complex plot elements, intellectual concepts, and/or visionary scope, this movie might not be for you. These are all fair criticisms to level against True Romance, but it's definitely not trying to be or embody these elements. This is a character, scene, and situationally driven story, and at that, True Romance is stellar ;)"
"raulfaust","9","3","4","2 December 2014"," Let me blow your mind
","""True Romance"" is a movie that people usually talk good about, and last night I could finally watch it myself and find out why it's so well recognized. The very first scene reveals what is the main quality of it all: the cast. Actors involved in this project are quite professional, so any normal scene becomes very entertaining. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette play a couple that is supposed to be the villain of the story, but due to its inexplicable power of captivating, becomes the movie's main stars. Even thought they do a lot of bad things throughout the story, every time they seem to be in danger-- or every time they're getting beaten up--, I felt extremely thrilled-- and sorry for them. Furthermore, this picture runs with a GREAT soundtrack, which sometimes mutes the characters without spoiling the movie's speed; on the contrary, it gets more and more entertaining and... cooler! The only reason why I don't give it a higher rating is because of its surfeit of violence; sometimes I believe Tarantino could have been calmer in this romance, but it's still one of his memorable works."

","""True Romance"" is a high speed crime thriller with plenty of action, romance and dark humour and a collection of characters that make every scene bristle with excitement and interest. The plot is fascinating throughout, the dialogue is witty and entertaining and the star-studded cast deliver some great performances. A story about a young couple on the run may not seem strikingly original but this one is told with so much flamboyance, dynamism and panache that it's completely irresistible and tremendously enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) is totally obsessed with comic books, movies and Elvis Presley and seems to have very few friends. Whilst he's spending his birthday alone at a cinema watching a Sonny Chiba triple feature, he gets into conversation with an attractive blonde called Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) and they end up spending the night together at Clarence's place. It later emerges that Alabama is a call girl who'd been paid to entertain Clarence by the man who owns the book store where he works. Despite this unpromising start to their relationship, Clarence and Alabama fall in love and get married the following day.<br/><br/>Clarence is a guy who periodically has conversations with Elvis' ghost who acts as a mentor to him and during one such conversation Elvis advises him of the need to kill Alabama's pimp, a dreadlocked sadist called Drexl (Gary Oldman). After telling Drexl about Alabama's change of status and that she won't be working for him any more, things soon descend into violence and Clarence kills the pimp and one of his henchmen before taking, what he believes to be, Alabama's suitcase of clothes with him. When the couple discover that the case actually contains $500,000 worth of uncut cocaine, they decide to leave Detroit and head off to California.<br/><br/>Clarence plans to use his old friend, an aspiring actor called Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport), to make the necessary connections to a Hollywood producer who is likely to be interested in purchasing the coke. Unfortunately, a number of complications develop during the setting up of the deal and things get difficult as it soon becomes clear that a couple of L.A. detectives as well as the gangsters who owned the cocaine are on their trail.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's script is an outstanding feature of this movie and contains all the intensity and sparkle that normally characterises his work as well as a good supply of witty one-liners. There are three scenes that particularly stand out. The first is one in which Clarence's father gets interrogated by a high-ranking Sicilian gangster, the second is a violent confrontation involving Alabama and a hit-man and the third is a Mexican standoff which brings together , Clarence and his associates, the gangsters, the police and the Hollywood producer and his bodyguards in a situation where tensions are running extremely high and everyone is heavily armed. These scenes are all incredibly violent but, especially in the first and last scenes, the way in which humour is used is both skillful and very effective.<br/><br/>The entire cast in this exceptionally entertaining movie is excellent with Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and Gary Oldman providing the most impressive performances and Brad Pitt standing out as Dick's perpetually stoned roommate."

","I enjoyed this film so much, it's one of my top ten all-time favourites. Oddly enough, my top ten favourites do not include a single Tarantino-directed movie - I honestly wonder if all his writing would be this good with a competent director, like Scott, or if the uncredited Avary's influence was what made this particular movie stand out for me.<br/><br/>The story is nothing new or original. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl. S*** happens. It's almost a traditional yarn, but so lovingly spun that it deserves to be a classic. It's not life-changing genius. It's not world-shaping art. It's never going to be the subject of a classical literature degree... but it *is* engrossing, entertaining, enjoyable, and honestly, utterly, undeniably romantic.<br/><br/>The cast is brilliant, and expertly placed to shine in their respective roles. Almost every line is quotable and no scene is wasted. Sure, the dialogue is recognisably Tarantino, but it's just not the same winding monotony that taints the interplay in his own directing ventures - it flows well and doesn't get in the way of real acting. Exchanges between characters feel natural.<br/><br/>Yes, it has violence (this is an action movie after all), but it serves to enhance the elements of peril that pull the viewer into the plight of our plucky couple. The most harrowing moments in this movie involve the least gun-play, deriving their impact from strong performances and believable pain or sacrifice. Despite some tried-and-true Hollywood-style action too, there is an appreciable element of reality and plausibility that makes suspension of disbelief an effortless endeavour.<br/><br/>This movie has compelling characterisation, perfect pace, well-directed dialogue, an appropriate measure of action, and characters you can really root-for... not to mention that this cynical critic can't watch it without almost (not quite, but almost) getting all weepy.<br/><br/>If you're a Tarantino fan and you haven't watched this, you may be neglecting his best work. If you are *not* a Tarantino fan and you haven't watched this, you may be neglecting a true classic."
"W_Dougherty","10","3","4","16 November 2009"," First Viewing 2009
","This 5-star movie rated 7.9 on the IMDb scale. I never viewed this movie until 2009 because I was stuck in Saudi Arabia in 93. I never heard of it until I browsed Tony Scott and saw its rating. In summary, this movie was filmed ahead of it time. It's a 'wild' and 'free' loving movie and a part of pop culture. I fell in love with Clarence and Alabama and their magical attraction to each other. Very few movies with a cast of pop stars turns into a masterpiece. This movie is Tony Scott's 'magnum opus' or greatest work. I purchased a director's cut copy. Tarantino wrote a pop culture classic. Scott directed a love story like no other. Slater, a comic book salesman and movie enthusiast, played the part of a delusional 'King of pop'. Arquette, loyal hot pants, to pimp and then husband was alluring. Hopper was Hopper, a trustworthy father who passed his freedom loving genes to his son Clarence. Kilmer played Elvis in voice as the 'King of Pop' to a mentor driven Clarence. Walken has never been better as he played a Sicilian mobster after his cocaine deal went bad. Oldman played Oldman as the pimp, drug pusher, pirate of Detroit. Pitt played a minor part made major by his drug habits. Without major credit, James Gandolfini played Tony Saprano in the making. I'm sure his unbelievable performance led to him being selected for the HBO series ""The Sopranos."" In a nutshell, this sick movie was fantastic and alluring."
"zardoz-13","10","3","4","30 August 2009"," Tarantino At His Tops with Tony
","""Top Gun"" director Tony Scott pulls out all stops in ""True Romance,"" a wonderfully lyrical, but abrasive crime thriller that opens in frigid, snowy Detroit, migrates to warm, sunny Los Angeles, and then concludes on a sandy beach in Mexico. ""Beverly Hills Cop "" lenser Jeffrey L. Kimball is such a gifted cinematographer that he makes everything in this off-beat romantic actioneer look picture postcard gorgeous and Scott orchestrates the shoot-outs for maximum impact. You will see a lot of Dutch tilt angles in ""True Romance"" to capture the dangerous, topsy-turvy hi-jinks. While Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the leaders, the producers have surrounded them with a superlative supporting cast, and Brad Pitt gives one of the best performances in a rather slight role as a slacker who lives on a couch. Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson, and Val Kilmer as Elvis flesh out the film. Further, Scott has assembled a variety of songs both popular and classical that do as much to enliven the atmosphere of a scene as the cinematography. The editing on the roller-coaster scene is nothing short of spectacular. Like any Tarantino-directed movie, ""True Romance"" contains myriad references to pop culture, especially Elvis Presley, Sonny Chiba, Charles Bronson, ""Star Trek's"" Captain Kirk, and John Woo's Hong Kong actioneers, with profanity galore. The story follows the misadventures of a young, twentysomething drifter from Detroit and his wife--a reformed prostitute--as they head out to Hollywood to sell a suitcase bulging with cocaine and then ride off into the sunset.<br/><br/>Clarence Worley (Christian Slater of ""Heathers"") works at a comic book store, Heroes for Sale, and every year during his birthday he attends a Sonny Chiba triple feature. Tonight he encounters the woman of his dreams, Alabama (Patricia Arquette) and spends an eventful night with her. Initially, Alabama plans to leave Clarence, but she cannot compose a letter and gets no farther than 'Dear Clarence.' Later, Clarence learns that Alabama is a 'call girl' and his boss paid for her. Nevertheless, Clarence and Alabama falls hopelessly in love and venture downtown the next day to wed. They have matching tattoos inked into their bodies. Clarence asks Alabama about her things that she left where she worked as a prostitute. Our blonde heroine tries to dissuade Clarence from dropping in on her former pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman of ""Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead""), so he can retrieve her things. Meantime, Clarence's idol, the late Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer of ""Top Gun"") advises Clarence on his options. What makes Elvis' appearances cool is that you catch only glimpses of his face, you see his body only making those characteristic Elvis' moves. Usually, Elvis—called the 'Mentor' in the screen credits—talks to Clarence when our hero is in the bathroom.<br/><br/>Clarence is determined that he must severe any ties between Alabama's old boss and her new way of life. A gunfight erupts at Drexl's place and Clarence survives miraculously. He orders a hooker to give him Alabama's suitcase. What he gets is a ton of cocaine. Ironically, the suitcase has an anti-narcotics bumper sticker on it. Earlier, Drexl double-crossed some associates and stole the suitcase from them. Thus begins Clarence's odyssey. Alabama and he head out for Los Angeles, but before they blow out of town, Clarence checks in on his divorced father Clifford Worley (Dennis Hopper of ""True Grit"") to see if the authorities know anything about Drexl's death. Clifford clears any doubts that Clarence has so Alabama and he pile into his pink convertible Cadillac and take off for California to meet his old friend Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport of ""Zebrahead""), an aspiring actor with an audition for the new ""T.J. Hooker."" Predictably, Dick doesn't know what to say when he sees all the coke. Nevertheless, he is frustrated that Clarence thinks that he has connections in the Hollywood industry to unload the cocaine.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, after Clarence and Alabama leave, the Sicilian mob comes a-calling, and Clifford meets Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken of ""The Deer Hunter"") who tells him all about Clarence and the stolen narcotics. Of course, Clifford doesn't believe a word of it, but Coccotti wants to know where his product is so he tortures Clifford. He starts out by slashing his hand. One of the best scenes in ""True Romance"" has Clifford telling off Coccotti with a politically incorrect yarn about why Italians in southern Italy no longer have blue eyes and blond hair. Tarantino has gone on record saying that he got this fanciful story from an African-American friend. The bit of classical music that is set against Clifford's history lesson is stunning. Naturally, Coccotti isn't amused when Clifford calls him 'an egg-plant.' Anyway, Clifford refuses to divulge the whereabouts of Clarence and Alabama, and Coccotti blasts him at point blank range with a revolver. Attired in a topcoat with a scarf, Coccotti resembles a priest about to administer last rites. No sooner have they executed Clifford than a mobster finds a note attached to the fridge and provides them with Clarence's contact information in Hollywood. The dramatic irony of this revelation and Clifford's decision to sacrifice himself for his son is quite striking.<br/><br/>In Hollywood, Dick introduces our heroes to Elliot Blitzer (Bronson Pinchot of ""Beverly Hills Cop"") who serves as a assistant to movie mogul Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek of ""Unforgiven"") and Clarence convinces Lee to buy the coke. Eventually, the Detroit mob hits Los Angeles and they come gunning for Clarence, with one of Coccotti's henchmen, Virgil (James Gandolfini of ""The Sopranos""), taking an interest in Alabama. The fight between Alabama and Virgil is one of the most violent scenes and she celebrates her victory in a chant of primal ecstasy that makes her look like Tarzan.<br/><br/>""True Romance"" is a fantastic movie with memorable dialogue worth quoting. The protagonists are both young and sympathetic. Christian Slater will never play another character as likable as Clarence Worley."

Some of the most violent scenes I have seen.  They will blow you away.  Of course, it all ends in a Mexican Standoff between the cops, the mob, and a film producer's body guards.  A great story, an unbelievable cast, and out of this world action.  True Romance will keep you on the edge of your seats."
"hankcock","10","4","6","7 February 2019"," Who could criticise this film?
","It isn't ""Remains of the Day"". But it is the best film ever made. It's one those films that you can watch over and over and never get tired of it. Especially cool is watching it with someone who's never seen it before. Which I sometimes do whenever possible. True Romance saddles up fine with Pulp Fiction and Fight Club, which I must say are number two and three on my all-time favorite movie list.
Clarence and Alabama are stupid, yes, as many critics are wont to say. But it wouldn't be fun any other way. In other words it is not a cerebral film.
And I've grown to love them both.
Gary Old man gives his best over-the-top performance ever. Nevermind his tor-de-force as Winston Churchill last year. Watch and you won't disagree
Dennis Hopper, as Clarence's dad, brings the film down to earth for a few-- as he's forgivably smitten with Alabama. And he utters the greatest dialogue in a film since Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector described eating a human being. Hateful, hateful dialogue but he pulls it off with a smile on his face as he's soon dispatched by Christopher Walken.
Love Quentin Tarantino's writing.
The grittiest scene belongs to Patricia Arquette. Alabama is discovered alone in the motel by none other than a mad, mad Tony Soprano. James Gandolfini is a superb menace. Waking up to see him in my room would make me piss my pants but Alabama ain't going down easy.
The climax is a bit disappointing. In that all films no matter how great must come to an end."

","True Romance is directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino. It stars Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Michael Rapaport, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Bronson Pinchot and Saul Rubinek. Music is by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Jeffery L. Kimball. <br/><br/>Comic book store clerk Clarence Worley (Slater) falls in love with call girl Alabama Whitman (Arquette) when she turns up at the movie theatre as one of his birthday presents. Marriage is quick but as the whirlwind romance gathers apace, complications quickly follow in the form of psycho drug dealers and the mob! <br/><br/>It's still speculated on how True Romance would have panned out had Tarantino directed his own screenplay, but really in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter. For True Romance is a wildly exciting fusion of lovers on the lam premise with violence a go go thrills. <br/><br/>Director Scott did a bang up job bringing Tarantino's screenplay to life, even making a couple of narrative changes that suits (QT agrees) the picture no end. People often get hung up on the fact that Scott had previously helmed Top Gun, Beverly hills Cop II and Days of Thunder, citing these as reasons that Scott was wrong for the material, yet the film he did immediately before True Romance was The Last Boy Scout, a thrilling and muscular actioner that pings with sharp savvy dialogue scripted by Shane Black. It was the perfect trial run for True Romance, and Scott proved to be a wise and cohesive choice for the material. He also expertly marshalled a large ensemble cast, garnering career high turns from Slater and Arquette in the process. <br/><br/>Almost everything clicks into place on True Romance, it never lacks for kinetic thrills or edge of the seat drama. In turn it likes to grab you around the throat with some wince inducing violence, cunningly drawing you in to root for a couple of lovers who will do anything for each other, while simultaneously causing carnage for all they come into contact with. There's odd ball characters galore (Oldman and Pitt excelling in this area), exquisite set-pieces and dialogue so sharp you could cut a steak with it. From conversations between Clarence and his imaginary Elvis (Kilmer) mentor, to iconography unbound with one of the 90s great sequences that sees Walken's mob boss verbally joust with Hopper as Clarence's stoic father, it's a film as rich in the art of vocal acting as it is in eye splintering gloss. All that and it's a clinically beautiful love story as well! <br/><br/>A wet dream fantasy of QT for sure, and if you wanna be churlish? Then there should have been more room made for Sizemore and Penn's glorious coppers. Hell we could even complain about the editing being a touch too slam-bang at timesBut nah! Small complaints be damned, the meeting of Tarantino the writer and Scott the director delivers neo-noir goodies galore. In fact it's a film that just gets better with age. 9/10"

","For many years I was an avid Tarantino fan however I had no clue as to the existence of the movie True Romance until it was introduced by a friend. I was immediately captivated by the movie from the opening scenes.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this movie as with all Tarantino dialogue in my opinion is top notch. The use of normal daily dialogue to spice up a very interesting plot does wonders in this film. And as with most good dialogue if it is not delivered well it is useless.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the all-star cast that is featured in this film. Many extremely unforgettable scenes were present in this film in particular the Hopper/Walken scene which provides humor, history, and a heck of a lot of drama. The Gandolfini/Arquette scene was perhaps the most intense sequence ever put on film. And of course Slater/Oldman have a very amazing scene with great dialogue and a lot of action. And who can forget the minor yet very inspiring characters of Brad Pitt, Michael Rapaport, Saul Rubinek and of course Val Kilmer as 'The King.' I was a little bummed the movie didn't follow the original script to the T however I felt the film was a 10 out of 10 no doubt. Very much recommended."

","Well, this is my favorite movie of all time, and the best movie I've ever seen. I'm kind of undecided on Tarantino's projects. I liked Kill Bill one and two, hated Pulp Fiction, hated Resovoir Dogs even worse. This movie did not use Tarantino's original ending. There is a lot of good info in the 2 disc director's cut. All I can say is if you've never seen this movie, you're cheating yourself. I've had people reluctant to watch it because it sounds like it's a ""chick flick."" It is anything but. It is a smart, action love story. A unique and one of a kind film. I promise this film will not leave you disappointed, but completely satisfied. Which is all a good movie can do. And when it comes to an all star cast! O M G! There will never be this many A list stars in a movie again. Some of the biggest only have cameos, which I love. (think Val Kilmer and Samuel Jackson.) Watch it as released then check out the alternate ending, I think you'll agree this movie was cast perfectly (like 8MM) written and directed perfectly, and even edited well. (think Indiana Jones or the original Star Wars trilogy editing) Every scene moves the story forward. I never felt like I was missing information or watching filler. I've gushed enough. I love it, you probably will too. Go watch it!"

","I've never been the biggest Terantino fan (only when I have a hankering for senseless violence), but after seeing True Romance, I now know the real Quentin Terantino...the writer! Never have I seen more clever of a screenplay! And never such wonderful unity in acting! I picked to watch this film on Valentines Day because I'm single and didn't want something too mushy, and I must say that was the best movie decision I've made since as far as I can remember. True Romance is just that. Authentic. Genuine. Real. Terantino and director Tony Scott have intertwined romance and blood in a beautifully harmonious action thriller in which every character is distinctively defined. It didn't require one of the best movie endings I have ever witnessed to make me love this film, but it included it anyway. Bravo! 10/10"
"Coventry","10","7","13","21 May 2004"," 10 reasons to state this is one of the greatest movies ever!
","Sure, purely talking cinema, True Romance isn't the most perfect film ever made (it's not boring enough for that). But, when it comes to entertainment values and coolness, this motion picture yet has to find an equal. Any first viewing of True Romance will literally blow you away and repeated viewing will only prove that this is one mean, addictive film. Through the years, True Romance built up quite a status and it's immensely popular. Still, too often it's categorized as worthless violence and therefore I'll introduce to you 10 reasons why this film is just brilliant!<br/><br/>1. True Romance was the first screenplay written by Quentin TarantinoNow, it's unquestionable that Tarantino is one of the most gifted writers in cinema ever and this first work of his excellently reflects his enthusiasm and talent. The protagonist  Clarence Worley  has a lot in common with Quentin's own personality and because of this; True Romance actually looks like one giant daydream/fantasy of an imaginative adolescent.<br/><br/>2. The choice of Tony Scott as the director. Unlike Oliver Stone in Natural Born Killers, Scott didn't feel the need to oppress his own visual style in True Romance. Yet, he adds a little more flair than QT would himself, so what you get is some sort of explosive crossover between Reservoir Dogs and Top Gun. <br/><br/>3. The all-star Cast!!!! Man, would you look at that cast! Some of Hollywood's best performers of every generation are there. Some of them only have miniscule roles but their presence is an extra added value, anyway. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Brad Pitt, Michael Rapaport, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Victor Argo<br/><br/>4. Every single personality in True Romance is adorably eccentric and worth analyzing. Clarence and Alabama are the 'good guys', yet they're pretty messed up in their heads themselves. Basically, every person in this film is a self-centered weirdo driven by mad thoughts and insanity. As a result of this, superb and colorful dialogues are overwhelming you. Excellent, first-class quote material.<br/><br/>5. The romantic on screen chemistry between Clarence and AlabamaEven though the plot may seem extremely illogical and far-fetched, the love and devotion between these two feels sincere and intense. Their interactions and sexual escapades increase the viewer's involvement. <br/><br/>6. That one particular sequence Fans certainly will know what I'm talking about now! A tour-de-force between two of the talented actors ever, resulting in a breath-taking climax. Walken and Hopper's acting almost burns holes in your TV-screen and you can almost feel the cigarette smoke prickling in your eyes. Guided by chilling classical music and shot beyond perfection, this surely is one of most intense sequences ever caught on tape. <br/><br/>7. The trivia elements and references towards other films. QT is an absolute film geek and he terrifically inserts his passion in his script. In many of the dialogues, the characters (Clarence in particular) constantly refer to cinema milestones like Rio Bravo, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Dr. Zhivago. True Romance also is one giant tribute to the King of Rock 'n Roll himself as Clarence is a dedicated Elvis admirer.<br/><br/>8. The Soundtrack! Tarantino films always have blasting soundtracks and True Romance isn't an exception. The main theme is a brilliant instrumental song by Hans Zimmer while the rest of the soundtrack mixes classic oldies and modern songs. <br/><br/>9. The coolness! Simply putthis just is one cool motion picture. Clarence Worley is cool! He drives a purple Cadillac, wears giant sunglasses and eats hamburgers right after killing a guy. That is COOL! The love of his life is equally cool. She's like the perfect woman who likes Kung-Fu movies, dresses sexy and really knows how to defend herself. When asked where to meet discretely, she playfully answers: 'in the roller coaster!' and that, my friend, is cool. <br/><br/>10. The violence! Last but certainly not leastaren't we all a little excited to see massive, grotesque violence? Qua violence, True Romance definitely overtrumps your wickedest expectations. The film contains multiple memorable action sequences and, just when you think you've seen it all, there comes the grand finale! The final sequence is one major adrenalin-rushing shootout, leaving very few to the imagination. Fascinatingly photographed and fun to see. <br/><br/>There you go In case you haven't seen True Romance yet, I have no idea what else would convince you to see it. Changes are high this will be one of your personal favorites, for sure. There only is one little turnoff I should mention. True Romance recently got released on Special (double disc) Millennium edition but that was quite a disappointment. The extras don't really feature anything special. I was hoping to see some deleted scenes or something, but there only is a B-roll documentary and a couple of short interviews."
"MovieAddict2016","5","13","29","30 January 2006"," Didn't work for me
","Seems as though it were crafted by a real geek. Sorry, Quentin. TRUE ROMANCE (1993)<br/><br/>** 1/2 out of *****<br/><br/>Much of Tony Scott's ""True Romance"" seems as though it were crafted by a real geek. The film's hero, Clarence, is a quintessential loser -- every year on his birthday he goes to see a movie and all 364 other days are spent working at a comic book store. Mere coincidence, then, that its writer is Quentin Tarantino? (A man who used to work as a video store clerk and watch ""three to four movies a day"" before hitting the big time as a director with 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs."")<br/><br/>Most of ""True Romance"" doesn't seem very real at all. It's a harsh movie, but that doesn't bother me at all. It's when the character -- a self-confessed geek -- picks up a gun and goes on a killing spree at a brothel in order to free his call girl wife that the film seems to exaggerate just a bit. (Travis Bickle? Yes. A geeky nerd? No.) It seems like the sort of dream that Quentin Tarantino may have had years ago. In the real world, this all just seems a bit odd.<br/><br/>But the characters aren't living in our world. They're in Quentin's. I originally read the script for ""True Romance"" and thought it was splendid -- but soon found that Tony Scott's direction betrayed the darkness of the screenplay, creating a sort of half-good/half-bad movie that leaves the audience wanting more. Sure, ""True Romance"" has its good parts, but the people who tell you it's the best film ever are part of the ""True Romance"" cult. It's nothing more than a good movie with a fine script and bad direction. Scott (""Top Gun"") has made some fine movies, but in terms of actual direction, this is one of his lesser ones.<br/><br/>Why? Well, for starters, the story is rather dark and grimy and bleak. Scott forces his audience into liking these characters so much that he betrays the grim tone for a happy look. The problem? Well, the characters are rather corrupt and the story is rather dark and the outcome is potentially unmerited. Scott changed the ending to the film, making it happier, which Quentin Tarantino admits works for the story. But, as he says on the DVD commentary, had he filmed the movie, it would have been a lot different. And when Quentin says that, I think he means better.<br/><br/>Don't blame the cast. These are top-notch actors in Oscar-worthy roles. But somehow, given their characteristics, they never come across as anything more than caricatures -- exaggerated molds of real people. Clarence is played by Christian Slater, and he meets and falls in love with Alabama (Patricia Arquette), soon finding out she's a hooker. Their romance is something I would expect a soap opera writer to craft -- they meet, he falls for her, she falls for him (hooker with a heart of gold!), they sleep together (in a scene reminiscent of that criticized love sequence from ""Top Gun""), and he risks everything to free her. In less than twenty-four hours. Is something a bit odd here? It's like a geek's wet dream.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is to die for: Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Michael Rapaport, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore and Brad Pitt. They all do well in their roles, but seem to be boasted on the posters for promotional value. Hopper and Oldman have the most scenes, but die early on. Kilmer's face is never seen, and his body only appears in two sequences. Walken is in a single scene during the entire film, and Gandolfini is introduced (and executed) quite late into the movie. Bummer. It's basically the adventures of Clarence and Alabama.<br/><br/>Nothing wrong with that, except that their story copies from everything in sight -- most notably, ""Bonnie and Clyde."" To be fair, I understand what Quentin meant to do with his tale, and his original ending (although depressing) was much more suitable given the content of the movie. Quentin tried to add a dark streak to the clichéd romance-on-the-run genre, and Scott mistakenly made yet another happy-go-lucky (although very violent) road romance with two very simplistic, innocent, fake characters overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. This is the stuff Charlie Kaufman hates.<br/><br/>The whole way through the movie, I felt as though I were staring at comical shadows of potentially real people, waiting to break through their boundaries and convince us all that they are more than just clichés. This script was sold early on in Quentin's career so that he could film ""Reservoir Dogs"" with the income. He was reportedly never very happy with the outcome of ""True Romance,"" a film he had hoped to direct, and I don't blame him. From the very opening credits, I could tell this film was taking the wrong path given its source material. Maybe I shouldn't have read the script first. Maybe I had preconceptions. But it's still not a very well made movie. Blame Scott.<br/><br/>How some people love this movie is still beyond me."
"Danimal-7","2","28","73","16 February 2000"," Sleazy, mindless trash
","(Minor spoilers)<br/><br/>Tarantinolatry got so out of hand during the '90s that a number of people actually took this absurd movie for a masterstroke, even though Tarantino only wrote the screenplay for it.<br/><br/>Clarence Worley is a nebbish who meets Alabama who is (sigh) a Hooker With A Heart Of Gold.  They decide to get married.  It becomes necessary to kill Alabama's pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman, whose amusing performance is one of the few enjoyable moments in the movie) so the pair can be together.  However, they decide to grab Drexl's huge stash of cocaine to finance their future together.  Needless to say, this causes a plethora of criminals to try to kill them and get the drugs back.  Also needless to say, the plethora fails to do so.  Clarence magically transforms from a nebbish into a Tough Guy, whose strength is as the strength of ten because he spouts ""cool"" profanities.  When you spout cool profanities, gangsters who are pointing their guns at you do not shoot you when you draw a gun.  They just rack their slides menacingly (this cliche is known to bad movie fans as Superfluous Racking).<br/><br/>Clarence and Alabama do not have any interesting or memorable characteristics.  There is no reason for the audience to root for them to make it to the end.  Who wants to see these two who intend to finance their married life by helping some hapless addict kill himself (or worse, helping to start some kid on the habit), enjoy the fruits of their scheme?  Cliche characters alone do not make the movie any worse than an ordinary action movie, but these characters are not just cliches, but unlikeable cliches. <br/><br/>
Nor do the supporting characters make any more sense than the leads. Christopher Walken's Vince Coccotti tortures Clarence's father in order to learn where Clarence is, and then, bizarrely, kills him without first gaining any information whatsoever from him.  But first, we are subjected to a reprehensible, epithet-laden racist spiel from Clarence's dad, apparently intended to be funny.  Unlike in PULP FICTION, where the racial epithets could be excused as not meant to be offensive, there is no question in this case that Clarence's dad, who is being painted as a ""good guy"" and is intended to engage the audience's sympathy, is deliberately trying to provoke Coccotti by suggesting that he has black ancestors (and it is presumed as a matter of course that an implication of black ancestry is belittling and undesirable).  If this were even the slightest bit amusing, it might be forgivable, but it isn't, despite the laughter of the characters on screen which is intended to cue the audience into laughter in much the same way as the canned laughter on a TV sitcom.  <br/><br/>TRUE ROMANCE could have been a bland action movie.  By ladling on racism, an extra helping of unrealism and stupidity, and characters who are not only unimaginative but also repellent, it makes itself much, much worse.  Wish fulfillment movies can be pleasant, even if silly; the shape of Tarantino's wish fulfillment fantasy is disgusting.<br/><br/>Rating: * out of ****."
"ccthemovieman-1","6","12","27","2 September 2006"," Be Warned: This Is Rough, Sordid Movie
","I guess how you view this film depends on what kind of profanity and violence you can tolerate. If that stuff doesn't phase you at all and you like tough, rough characters, this crime movie is ""your cup of tea.""<br/><br/>I found this to be one of those films that became a little too sordid the more times I saw it and it went from a rating of ""9"" down to a ""6"" after three viewings, and then out of my collection. It was just too much in the way of language and unlikeable characters. There is not one person in this movie is has anything but a low-life. It's gets repulsive after awhile.<br/><br/>However, before that - to give the movie its due - there are a number of over-the-top performances and scenes I won't soon forget: for one, Dennis Hopper explaining in derogatory history of Sicilians to Scicilian hit man Christopher Walken. That was hilarious. Then there's Gary Oldman imitation of a black pimp, so outrageous one can't describe it. Then, of course, the wild shootout scene at the end."

The script and Christian Slater remain the best parts of this film. It was interesting from a layman's point of view. Not as wild or inventive as Quentin Tarantino's future scripts, but definitely acceptable.<br/><br/>Strange how we can root for the bad guy, as we did here. They're not perfect, or completely good/bad to put in the plus column, but still we wanted these newlyweds to succeed.<br/><br/>An all-star cast, perfect for movie lovers to jizz over, they do what they needed to in their roles.

"Benjamin_Cox","7","5","9","11 August 2007"," Great film or missed opportunity? Discuss - 77%
","Question: is this a great film or one of the biggest missed opportunities in movie history? Having heard both sides of the argument in recent days, it's little wonder that it has taken me the best part of a week after viewing to reach this conclusion (if you can call it that). Given that it has possibly one of the best casts ever assembled, a typically brash and brilliant script from Quentin Tarantino and a veteran of countless action movies at the helm, this really should have been one of the best films ever made and perhaps, if Tarantino had kept his hands on it, it might have been. Instead, we have an incredibly slick and entertaining crime film that I felt needed a bit more pace and consistency to become a true classic.<br/><br/>In arguably his best film, Christian Slater plays Clarence who is an odd-beat loser working in a run-down comic shop in Detroit with an unhealthy interest in Elvis. After meeting the beautiful call-girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette), they both fall hopelessly in love and the newly-motivated Clarence decides to free Alabama from the grip of her pimp Drexel (Gary Oldman). But stumbling across a suitcase full of cocaine, Clarence decides to take the drugs to Hollywood and fund their new lives together. But unfortunately, the Mob are hot on their heels and soon discover what our lovestruck heroes have planned...<br/><br/>This really is classic Tarantino territory - a contemporary crime thriller with tonnes of funky dialogue, more big-name actors than the entire ""Oceans"" trilogy and oodles of retro charm. And yet, ""True Romance"" certainly doesn't feel like a Tarantino film - the pace is all wrong (it feels much slower than ""Pulp Fiction"", despite being shorter in length) and dare I say it, I found myself losing interest. But just when I was about to give up, somebody new steps into shot and delivers another faultless performance. I have rarely seen acting of such quality from so many individuals, despite the fact that most are only in for a couple of scenes at best. Personally, I found James Gandolfini's portrayal of a Mob hit-man utterly convincing and it certainly ensured he'd be typecast for the rest of his career. Hell, even Val Kilmer doesn't suck! But all the time, I found myself wondering how truly brilliant this film might have been if Tarantino had never sold it. I understand his reasons why - I'd forgive almost anything for giving us ""Pulp Fiction"" - but I feel Tony Scott didn't quite know what to do with it. Exhibit A - the ill-judged and misplaced scene on the roller-coaster.<br/><br/>It's not that ""True Romance"" is a bad film because it isn't and I'd happily watch it again sometime. But I just feel that Scott wasn't the right director, although he has worked miracles with the cast who are all supremely good. PBs for Kilmer, Slater and Arquette while Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper share one of the all-time great scenes like two giant beasts tearing each other to shreds. But ""True Romance"" isn't the bone-fide classic some people think it is. It's too slow and the ending is far too predictable, ruining what should have been an absolute stonker of a movie. And it should have be - all the ingredients were in place with the exception of the director. So is this a great crime film or a wasted chance? Personally, I think greatness has slipped through our fingers."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","5","9","16 February 2006"," Here it is! The most underrated movie of all time.
","""True Romance"" is criminally underrated in terms of how well known it is and how it was received in 1993 by the critics and the public. It hardly won any awards even though the acting is top-class in this movie, as well as the story itself is.<br/><br/>Basically this movie is the ultimate guy-movie. Violence, shootouts, cursing, cool characters, all put together in a clever script that is filled with some typical Tarantino dialog and situations. How could you not love this movie? It has some highly memorable sequences in it, mainly thanks to the great cast and acting.<br/><br/>The cast of this movie is absolutely amazing. Lot's of well known actors show up in some rather small roles such as Christopher Walken who with his one scene makes such a lasting impression, that you easily forget that he only is in the movie for a few minutes. Same goes for Gary Oldman in a totally flipped role and Samuel L. Jackson who basically only is in for about a minute or so. Other impressive small roles are being played by James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore (crazy as always), Michael Rapaport, Victor Argo, Brad Pitt as a hilarious stoner, Ed Lauter, Dennis Hopper, Saul Rubinek, Val Kilmer and Bronson Pinchot. The two main leads, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette might not be as impressive as the rest of the cast but the supporting cast more than compensates for this.<br/><br/>But it really are Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken who steal the show in this movie. Gary Oldman is totally crazy over-the-top as a white pimp who acts- and thinks that he is a black person. The famous sequences between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken is a true classic and one of the best acted sequences I have ever seen. Those 10 minutes alone are more than enough to make this movie worth watching. It's such a well written and acted out sequence. It never loses it's power, no matter how often you have already seen it. I think I already know that dialog by heart right now.<br/><br/>It's a great story of romance, drugs, stealing and killing. The movie is made very lighthearted, meaning that it's incredible fun to watch. The movie is obviously not made serious, just look at the over-the-top characters and dialog. It's really Quentin Tarantino who deserves most credit for this movie, even though it was Tony Scott who directed the movie.<br/><br/>I absolutely love this movie and I never get tired of watching it. The characters, actors and writing are all at their very best. Violent crime movies don't get much better than this one.

","Darkly comedic action-based movie about two young marrieds--a clerk at a comic-book store and an ex-prostitute--on the run from police and from drug-lords after killing a coke-peddling pimp and making off with his valuable stash. Written by a pre-""Pulp Fiction"" Quentin Tarantino, whose love of cinema and movie-lore is apparent right from the beginning (with an opening credits sequence that seems a direct riff on Terrence Malick's ""Badlands""). Tony Scott directed, and though he's more attracted to sleaze than movie in-jokes, he keeps the action strong and hard-hitting. Unfortunately, after a promising start, the characters become stock figures in Scott's morass, a game of bad guys vs. worse guys. As a result, there's no emotion by the end, no exhilaration, just the feeling of having been batted around. Worth a look for ""Pulp Fiction"" fans and for some eccentric ideas and casting choices (such as Gary Oldman as the half-black pimp or Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis!). **1/2 from ****"

","I was a bit disappointed in this movie, i've seen a few Tarantino movies, (i.e. Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown) and i've got to say he isn't at his best here. He includes his usual mixture of dark humor and extreme violence, but i think if Tarantino directed this it would have been quality viewing. Tony Scott should have stuck to directing Military/espionage movies (i.e Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State). Christian Slater does his best to be convincing as the Love addicted Clarence but will only disappoint the viewer. Arquette is on babe duty and i think that draws attention away from the fact that she is a bad actress.<br/><br/>I think what makes this movie interesting is that we get to see big movie star's before they became famous (i.e. Pitt, Gandolfini, Slater, Kilmer).<br/><br/>All in all the script is pure QT, but with Slater and Arquette in the lead roles and with the guidance of Tony Scott, Tarantino might as well disown the movie."

It's the suitcase full of cocaine that everyone's after and, like, who gives a bloody damn how many people have to die for somebody, anybody, to get their greedy mitts on this jackpot.<br/><br/>Some people tend to put the blame for True Romance's considerable shortcomings squarely onto the shoulders of its director, Tony Scott (Ridley's bro'). But, personally, I think that Scott (who has clearly proved his competent directorial abilities, time and again) could only do what he could do, considering the dismal source of the inferior script that he was expected to work with in order to make something entertaining out of it."

","`True Romance' has got to be the most overrated movie.  It has a sensational cast and, what could have been, decent story but it was completely misdirected.  There was no nuance in the direction.  It was all violence and excess.  Christian Slater was a waste and Patricia Arquette was there for her body.  There were some bright spots because of the cast.  The scene with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken was good and could have been great except for the subject matter which I thought was in very poor taste, even for this movie.   The movie was made for an audience who would think a couple of hundred thousand dollars would provide a lifetime of happiness and the behavior of the psychopaths in this movie was somehow justified.  I did not enjoy this piece of trash."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Excess is part of the fabric of film. In some cases, the excess is part of a strategy to enrich the film, as in `The Good Thief' and `Moulin Rouge.' Sometimes it is a strategy to simplify to dullness and just press through with the sensory overload. Rock music has this division as well.<br/><br/>Many moviegoers don't seem to know the difference, especially when the simple-minded excess is artificially flavored, as we have here. Tarantino's basic approach is flavored mere noise. The noise is to take character stereotypes and make them as extremely stereotypical as they can be, way past outrageous. The flavor is to do this in a way that is distinctly self-referentially ironic. That way, the audience `participates' believing themselves to be in on a celebration of excess in film through excess itself.<br/><br/>It seems to work, since the audience doesn't seem to need much: here a salute to comicbooks and dope. It is a simple pleasure and painless we are told, so lay back. But with so many intelligent uses of a similar device (see `Ghost Dog'). Do we really need Quentin? Do we really need him to suck all the oxygen out of efforts that would be better? Are we ever going to get it straight whether Quentin is a whore who really loves us?<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements."

I know, I know...I should be sort of used to this when Tarantino is involved...but it still didn't go over well.  I feel the use of the 'N' word was unnecessary in that case.  Nevertheless, seeing Walken and Hopper on screen together was awesome.  The violence was just overkill, the scene with Arquette and Gandolfini was just too much. And what was with the 'True Romance' of the movie?  What romance?  A call girl is called to give Slater a good time, and they end up falling in love? How are we supposed to believe that this is a 'true romance'??  Because they kiss every chance they get?  They've been together for like 3 days or such! Puppy love, anyone?  C'mon.

"Rockwell_Cronenberg","1","15","40","26 January 2012"," Bleeds Tarantino.
","Quentin Tarantino has long been one of, if not the, person in the film industry that I loathe the most. Despite him not directing this one, I had always avoided it just because I didn't want to deal with another one of his shallow disasters of a script. However, I figured at this point I should at least watch it for Gary Oldman's performance, since a ton of people consider it one of their favorites from him. Oldman did not disappoint. As a white pimp who tries to act black, he crafted yet another unique character in his long career, one totally removed from any other character he's ever played. He absorbs so deeply into this character and it serves as another example in the long line of roles that make him the first actor people think of when they hear the word ""chameleon"".<br/><br/>Unfortunately he's only in it for about ten minutes and then I had to deal with the rest of this awful mess, which is pretty much everything I hate in a Tarantino screenplay. If you're not going to do anything new then you should at least do the old things in an interesting way, but that sure isn't the case here. The whole thing is a pathetically thin old-as-bones story with Tarantino's trademark dialogue that so many people eat up but I find to be disastrously artificial and awkward. No actors would be able to pull off the kind of absurd, unrealistic dialogue that he feeds them here, but a lot of the cast here feels like they aren't even trying to make it seem anything but awful.<br/><br/>Some of the supporting players do all right in their brief screentimes, but Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are terrible. It doesn't help that they have thin, completely one-dimensional characters (and in Arquette's case, a totally inconsistent one) but they just make matters worse with some abysmal portrayals. This one was a real chore; a completely shallow, needless exercise with some scenes that go on so long I thought I had died and fallen into hell."

It punctuates Scott's own romantic, fairy-tale view of a story which should really represent a heightened-reality retelling of 'Bonnie and Clyde' - grim ending and all. 'True Romance (1993)' suffers from the usual problems that plague this writer's work, but is still a highly entertaining and brutal picture that shows off its astute pop-culture sensibilities, excruciatingly long moments of nail-biting tension and brilliantly explosive sequences of violence with pride.

As usual tarintino turns out a fantastic script and the direction from Tony Scott is sheer brilliance, but the cast, wow, it must be one of the greatest casts ever, even cameo roles are filled by stars.

Clarence goes to sort out her pimp (gary Oldman) and ends up killing him. He finds a suitcase full of cocaine. they flee to L.A to unload it whilst the owners of the coke follow them in an outstanding turn of events. With some of the most memorable scenes in film this is a must see, it would be worth seeing just for the actors in it. Dennis Hopper plays Clarences father and Christopher Walken as the drug dealer in pursuit. With many great performances from James Gandolfini, Micheal Rappaport, Saul Rubinek, Brad Pitt, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel. L Jackson and Val Kilmer as Elvis. This film promises not to disappoint. Tony Scott has always been known for his way of making a certain topic interesting (Top Gun, Days of thunder, crimson tide) and in this case Love.

I ventured to the video store that night and, with reservations, found the movie on the shelf and checked it out. Fast forward three hours...<br/><br/>This movie is perfect in every aspect. It has great directing, excellent casting, magnificent dialogue, great music, the whole package. Every actor does a superb job in their role and you feel like you really get to know the main characters. This is by far the best Tarantino movie of all. I'm not sure why this movie is not in the IMDb ""Top 250"", I guess its because it is relatively unknown.<br/><br/>I beg you, please see this movie. You will absolutely not be let down. I have recommended this movie to many friends and family members and, so far, I've not had one person say that they were disappointed. This is not ""Reservior Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction"", its a modern love story (not a sappy, tear-jerker), mixed with hard-core action, and gangsters.<br/><br/>Prior to seeing this movie I always said that ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""The Godfather"" tied for my favorite movie of all time.... However, after seeing this film, it is now a three-way split."
"retarded_fuzzball","3","11","29","17 April 2008"," True, Hollow, Poorly-written Romance
","True Romance...where to start.<br/><br/>I did NOT like this movie. After about an hour and a half, my interest waned and I turned back to writing up my chemistry lab report.<br/><br/>Straightaway, I disliked the dialogue when Slater was talking about Elvis to the girl in the bar...for several minutes. And it continued to turn me off: the lines were too stylized, expected, and long winded, with little fluff/point to them. And they were often incredibly vulgar. I can handle swearing no problem, but the sheer amount of f-bombs and vulgarity was entirely unneeded.<br/><br/>However vulgar the lines, a stellar performance by the actors can make it tolerable...I mean, Boondock Saint's was an incredible movie! But Boondock Saints also had incredible acting. Not a single one of the characters in True Romance held any sway over my emotions. I felt zero empathy; who cares if Alabama gets the crap beat out of her? Who cares if Slater gets shot in the head? Not me. The actors just did not seem to exude any feeling while delivering their lines, leaving me in a state of complete boredom and apathy.<br/><br/>The storyline wasn't too bad, though it seemed a bit forced along and strung together by the aforementioned bad acting and weak dialogue. I think the only thing that provoked me to rate this with a 3 is the cinematography. The fight scenes, explosions etc, were excellent, touched with Tarantino's talent of creating that funky mood through the use of cameras that we love so very much.<br/><br/>I would not, however, recommend this to anyone. No matter how pretty it looks. 3/10 is the best this can get."
"Ziya90","3","11","30","5 December 2009"," What is so great about this movie?
","Almost many people including critics (probably critics's favorite) agree that True Romance is the best Tony Scott film, a masterpiece. However, the problem is what is so great about the movie? Direction? Sorry, but we are not talking about Enemy of the State here. Acting? I don't think so, no Oscar worthy performance here. The cinematography? Nothing special. Story? A guy and a girl meet and get troubled. That's the story. This is not a great road movie or lovers on the run movie, there is nothing impressive or even artistic like Quentin Tarantino movies itself. There is not any remarkable scene to mention with enthusiasm. I don't know this adulation is because Tarantino wrote the script or not, but this is the case. It was like one of the TV movies with a dreamy cast. Years years before I bought it from a newsstand, because saw the list of the cast on the cover and saw Tony Scott. However, not only it was only a huge disappointment, but also I did not enjoy at all. Some people say look! they watch a fighting movie in the film, a reference for martial art movies. That's funny, because I love martial art movies and I would prefer to watch any martial art movie instead of watching this again. True Romance has a dreamy cast probably you will never see once again in another movie. I could not pull myself together for a long time, after had seen the cast as mentioned, but it does not save the day. By the way, honestly, I couldn't see some of them, for example I couldn't see Brad Pitt against my full attention. Thus, this is not a 'cast driven' movie at all. Tony Scott's style (I mean Tony Scott in his early days like Top Gun or Enemy of the State) is missing in this movie. True Romance is not a stylish movie, it is just ordinary in terms of direction. And as I see, especially critics don't like Top Gun, but love True Romance. True Romance recalls One Night at McCool's in the final part. That part was a little bit sloppy, but at least entertaining. Tony Scott shot such a scene? Hard to believe. Later, I exchanged the movie with another one after watching. I know that it sounds intolerable for the fans of the movie, but it sounds intolerable for me either, when reading that they watch the movie again and again with great pleasure."

","""True Romance"" is definitely for fans of ""Wild at Heart"" - the title gives you no warning and the quality cast would surely convince that this was worth the rent. Bloody, violent, gruesome, improbable to the point of surreal, one has to ask if there is a lesson hidden somewhere in this. Maybe it's just to be thankful you weren't in it. The most wonderful actors were nearly reduced to walk-ons and some never showed their faces or lasted less than 30 seconds. Perhaps there's so much blood and violence to divert the viewer from the lack of content. The main characters seem to know this because whenever there's a break in bloodshed they start making out. If causing discomfort is the aim of this story, then it's right up there - I would be really curious about the kinds of people who have this on their favorites list! Yuck!"

","You know when you've done a huge load of dishes and there's lots of dregs stuck in the plug? It might have been part of something nice to begin with but there's no way you'd touch it now. That's True Romance - a gutter trash fiction roller-coaster powered by pop-culture references and overdone Tarantino dialogue. The story and execution are so adolescent and grim that I am surprised that it wasn't actually written and directed by an angry 15-year-old with mental health problems.<br/><br/>Since James Gandofini died a few days ago and since it's actually Tony Scott's birthday today I figured I would give this film another go. Time has not been kind to True Romance, even by 1993 standards the film looks dated. This was the fourth, and last, film Tony Scott made with cinematographer Jeffrey Kimball with whom he always used smoky diffusion to fog up the frame. It doesn't look good.<br/><br/>The story has Christian Slater's comic-book geek get together with Patricia Arquette's dim-witted hooker and go on a killing spree for a pathetic amount of quick, easy money. Apparently it was one half of Natural Born Killer's before Tarantino split it into a new screenplay, but he forgot to distance Clarence and Alabama from Mickey and Mallory. True Romance is a thoroughly ugly, sadistic, mean-spirited, nasty film filled with characters who have absolutely no morals or redeeming qualities (well, Patricia Arquette has a couple attached to her chest). There's no one to root for or identify with. Why should I care what happens to any of these psychopaths? And where's the romance? Making Clarence and Alabama have sex in awkward locations or have them kiss and make-out in every other scene doesn't mean that they are high on love. I'm not feeling any romance with this one. There's no sense of liberation or exciting new chances, just gloom and darkness.<br/><br/>The saving grace comes in the form of many cameos from Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and Saul Rubinek (playing, but pretending not to, a Joel Silver-type producer). Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore pop up but they don't get a chance to bring much to the story as it is already building to a climax by that point. I can't recommend this any fans of crime fiction, romantics, or even fans of Tony Scott. Sure the sycophantic Tarantino fans will get a kick out of it, but I doubt I will ever be watching this reprehensible junk ever again."

Reality occasionally rears it's ugly head, but never when Clarence is around to see. He never has to face any consequences for his foolishness. He never even finds out that his actions lead to the death someone close to him, much less grieve for the poor fool.<br/><br/>The ending is a complete cop-out. We're asked to maintain the same state of denial that Clarence is in. (Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know.) Imagine if the Godfather ended with Michael and his wife breaking out the Champagne bottles to celebrate his victory over his enemies, then living happily ever after.<br/><br/>Years after seeing this movie, I found Quentin Tarantino's script in a bookstore. Wow! What a great script. It's the same story, but it's structured differently, and it works a lot better. It also has a much more believable ending, which doesn't descend into codependence. It's too bad Tony Scott had to butcher the film. Don't see this movie. Read Tarantino's script."

","At the height of Tarantino's fame, everyone wanted a piece, so this was made, adapted from a script of his. Featuring one of the best casts ever, with old and new stars coming together in a pulp world to tell a modern story of love, True Romance is one of the best cult movies of the nineties. Slater plays a loner, a young'un with a love for comics and old kung-fu movies who meets, and sleeps with a beautiful young woman one stormy night. He learns that she came to him as part of a set-up, (his boss thought he needed to get laid) but they soon fall in love and get married. After a run in with her pimp, they find themselves with a case of coke, and on the run, and so begins a series of superb cameos, and great set pieces all filled with witty dialogue.<br/><br/>The soundtrack and acting are excellent, as is to be expected, and the dialogue is just as quotable as that of Pulp Fiction. Perhaps superior to PF in that we want the lead characters to succeed, as they are not just cool, but manage not to be scumbags. The alternative ending is good also, on the DVD. Definitely a movie for serious movie fans, or at least movies of this type."

The fast and clever language often found in Tarantino movies is heard all throughout this film. The plot and story often feel predictable and the unfolding of events lead to a conclusion that is relatively obvious from halfway into the film. I didn't find myself captivated by the story but I was invested in the smart directing and writing in several of the individual scenes. Multiple scenes in the film stand out with the Tarantino dialogue and interesting direction from Tony Scott including the showdown at Drexel's and the interrogation scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. The closer the ending came the less the film seemed to engage me. Despite the story not entirely working for me, I really enjoyed many of the individual scenes. It is clear from the story and style of the film that there is an influence of 70s cinema with films like Terrence Malick's Badlands, referenced throughout the movie. If Howard Hawks was right and all you need to have a good film is ""three great scenes and no bad scenes"" than this film is definitely worth checking out."

","Because I'm not sure why I love this movie so much. I think the main reason is because of the sweet innocence of their romance amongst everything else that's going on. Their loyalty towards one another really drives the film forward and makes the audiences love towards the characters a lot stronger. You get to know the characters as well as they know each other because of their short time together, which makes you cheer on their romance even more. However, that's just a small part of the movie (I'm not a huge fan of pure romance movies). From beginning to end, the movie grips you and takes you on a rollercoaster of different emotions; as you smile at how cute Alabama is and laugh whenever she laughs, and fill with anger when she is being thrown around the hotel room, beaming at her persistence to succeed. Or when you cling onto everything Clarence says, hoping that he comes out the other side alive even though you watched the movie a million times before. This movie is a new experience every time you watch it and overall, this movie just makes me really happy and that is probably the main reason why I love it so much.
It's not just the two main cast members that make this movie. The smaller parts bring just as much importance into the film. Brad Pitt's small role as pothead, Floyd, brings a comedic break into the movie. As well as Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken's roles as the fictitious villains, Drexel and Vincenzo, giving the lead characters something to fear and adding more excitement to the script. And let's not forget that famous fight scene between Alabama and Virgil. I love that scene!
Originally written by Quentin Tarantino, Tony Scott read his script and wanted to direct it. This being one of Tarantino's first movies, Scott approached him and that he could make him huge, if he let him direct this movie. He agreed. Tarantino said Scott ""glossed up my script, made it too pretty, too vivid. That's what makes it work so well, and the casting and performances he got."" It is unclear whether Tarantino loved what he did with the movie, but I think that whatever he changed from the original script, worked!
Linking to the poster. I think it stays very true to the movie itself. It doesn't give much away and merely shows the two main characters with Clarence holding a gun. However, just by looking at the poster it shows straight away how much Alabama means to Clarence at his persistence to keep her safe. And I think Alabama's smile in the first poster against Clarence's serious expression shows the whole reason why this movie is a masterpiece."

","Directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino, ""True Romance"" couldn't be more Tarantino-esque if it tried. Christian Slater is on hand at a surrogate of sorts for Tarantino himself, romanticizing pop culture and 1990s bohemia like nothing could be cooler. Patricia Arquette is also extraordinary in her signature role, exuding both naivete and streetwise weariness at once (not unlike Juliette Lewis in ""Kalifornia""), and her confrontation scene with James Gandolfini crackles with unsettling intensity. Additionally, there's a terrific supporting cast, which includes an Oscar-worthy appearance by Christopher Walken and a number of famous performers playing largely against type, and it's a downright pleasure to watch so many terrific performances in one movie. There are a number of thrilling scenes (including a climactic shootout for the ages) along the way, but this is the type of action movie that works best when concentrating on its compelling characters."

So I picked up the movie, hoping that if it become a mess I at least enjoy watching Patricia Arquette.<br/><br/>And I was unfortunately right. The movie is simply a crap. Starting from the silly story, non-convincing acting and stupidity of the main characters - all this makes the movie a disaster. I was watching it, hoping ""it will start to make sense on next scene"". But it did not. I don't know why ratings are so high here - it says ""Tarantino"" in the credits, so maybe people think, ""Oh, it can't be crap. I just missed the point. It's my fault"". And they rate it then - 8, 9, 10(!) for no real reason.<br/><br/>I rated it 4 stars (and I think 3 would be still fair enough): 1 star for Gary Oldman's scene in the club, 2nd star for stoned Pitt scene and last 2 stars for Arquette (but the credits here goes rather for Mother Nature, not for the her ""acting"" I am afraid).<br/><br/>To summarize: if you love B/C class movies - give it a try (but don't expect the Godzilla in it anyway).

","A friend recommended this film to me, knowing that I like kung fu movies. However, in hindsight, I really wish he'd kept his recommendation to himself. It was only at his urging I kept watching this film, as this sort of super-violent film does not appeal to me and it seems disturbing that people find this style of movie entertaining. Not only did the film use the f-word 1488203240234503 times, but it was unrelentingly violent and featured no one to care for during the entire picture. The main characters were tough to like--one was a prostitute and the other a seemingly normal guy that all the sudden becomes the next Rambo--killing with about as much regard as the average person would have about popping a zit! Plus, on top of all this, they are completely morally bankrupt as when they stumble upon a HUGE stash of uncut cocaine and their first and only thoughts were to sell it. The only problem is, the coke belongs to the mob and so much of the film is spent dodging the mafia. And in the end, the foul-mouthed mob has a showdown with the foul-mouthed cops as well as some foul-mouthed security guards and the foul-mouthed ""heroes""--resulting in perhaps the bloodiest and most violent five minutes in film--and looking much like the recent massacre at Virginia Tech. And to top it all off, the film then is sure to REWARD the antiheroes and kill off all the gangsters and cops--as if there was some sort of moral equivalence here!<br/><br/>Just WHO is the audience for this film? Is it possible this film was made as a tool to determine who LIKES this sort of violent stuff in order to lock them away where they can't hurt anyone?!?! I doubt it--like most of the super-super violent crap from Hollywood, its sole purpose is to ""entertain"". When I want this much extreme violence, totally unlikable and sick characters, etc., I really worry about my mental health and the health of this country. What is wrong with America that we put up with crap like TRUE ROMANCE?! Are we really all that different from the ancient Romans who were entertained by seeing people torn to pieces before their very eyes?! Apparently not. If you are one of the ones entertained by this film, apart from a few clever moments here and there, what is it that's so entertaining? Seeing people die?!<br/><br/>PS--One aspect of the film I did like was when Christian Slater was apparently having psychotic hallucinations where Elvis came to give him advice. This was a variation on Bogey coming to Woody Allen in PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM. I just wish these Elvis scenes had occurred more often--seeing a mad man getting advice from Elvis to kill people was pretty compelling."
"jimbo-53-186511","6","3","7","1 February 2016"," Fun, entertaining and stylish with good performances to boot but all these things are carrying what is merely an average story
","Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) falls in love with call-girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette) and ends up getting married to her. When he hears of how brutally her pimp has treated her, Clarence has a violent showdown with him and Clarence takes from him what he believes to be Alabama's clothes (which turns out to be a suitcase full of cocaine). With the assistance of Clarence's estranged father, Clarence and Alabama flee with the cocaine with the intention of selling it to a major film producer. However stealing drugs carries major repercussions and Clarence and Alabama find themselves being pursued by both the owners of the drugs and the police.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino penned the screenplay for this film and what's most surprising here is that Tarantino merely serves up a fairly average script (one which lacks his usual creative flair). The story plays out as a sort of Bonnie and Clyde style road movie and pretty much every other drug related crime film in existence so there is very little in the way of originality here. Whilst the 'average' story is a weakness, thankfully it isn't a major one as the script is still interesting enough to make sure that one's attention never wanders.<br/><br/>One problem I did have with this film is that I felt that it wasn't quite as exciting as it could have been; the moment Christopher Walken's character showed up I expected him and his goons to terrorise Arquette and Slater more or less continuously, but aside from the one scene with Arquette and Gandolfini and the showdown at the end this is never really explored and it just meant that the film lacked that extra bit of intensity required to put it among the top tier of crime films.<br/><br/>Despite the above, part of the reason that this film does succeed is down to many well-known faces who command attention throughout; Walken is one of the highlights in this film and although his appearance is brief he makes damn sure it's a memorable one. The scene with Walken and Hopper was menacing and chilling (the two men are laughing at each other for a few minutes which was actually quite unnerving). This scene also contains some excellent 'Tarantinoesque' dialogue which is one thing that made Pulp Fiction both bizarre and fascinating. It's a shame that we're not treated to more of that here to be honest. Arquette is also excellent here and despite her being an accomplice of sorts she still shows a sort of vulnerability that endears us towards her. The rest of the supporting cast were OK, but I have to admit that Gary Oldman's performance here was a little embarrassing and for me no white man should try to be black. Oldman was fun here, but I suspect that this is a performance that he'd rather forget.<br/><br/>Tony Scott's direction is also very good and he certainly doesn't hold back in trying to bring some of Tarantino's vision to the big screen (the scene where Arquette and Gandolfini are fighting is shocking, brutal and realistic and is spoilt slightly towards the end of this scene by Scott allowing things to get silly and not knowing when to quit whilst he's ahead). The showdown at the end was silly, but at least it was fun.<br/><br/>For me, True Romance is a fairly average crime story but it's elevated by some magnificent performances, impressive direction, brutal style and a sense of fun that underlies all the menace. Worth watching for sure, but I definitely felt there was room for improvement."

","Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) is a lonely, but pretty hip kind of guy. He works in a comic book store, is obsessed with Elvis Presley (he even talks to his ghost, whom of which is played by Val Kilmer), and has a thing for Kung-Fu films.  Things take a turn for the better when Alabama (Patricia Arquette) walks into his life.  They automatically fall in love and just days after they first meet, they decide to get married.  Alabama, however, has a confession to make: She is a call girl and is determined to leave behind her old life in order to make a fresh start with Clarence.  Even with all of this behind them now, Clarence still has something eating away deep inside him.  It seems that he can't stand the fact that Alabama's former pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman), who is also a white wannabe homeboy, is breathing the same air as he is.  So Clarence decides to pay Drexl a visit.  Drexl is not exactly anxious to let go of Alabama and so a shootout ensues which leaves Drexl dead and Clarence with a suitcase full of cocaine.  Clarence walks away from the situation as a hero in the eyes of Alabama, but from this you can also conclude that he is very stupid, yet courageous.  After the confrontation, Clarence hatches a brilliant scheme to go on a cross-country road trip to Los Angeles to sell the cocaine to a rich movie producer named Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek) and with the money, they can go anywhere in the world that they want.  So Clarence reunites with his childhood buddy, Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport) and his slob of a roommate, Floyd (a very stoned Brad Pitt).  Dick has setup a meeting with Lee through his connection with Elliot Blitzer (Bronson Pinchot) who is Lee's assistant. Clarence's plan seems perfect, except that what he doesn't know is, the cocaine that he stole actually belongs to a group of very p****d off mobsters who have come looking for it. <br/><br/>""True Romance"" is now my all time favorite movie.  The performances are excellent and with an all-star cast such as this one, how could it not be? Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make a very good couple and you cannot help but praise their efforts for what they have to go through to start a new life with each other.  Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken have one great (and very offensive) scene together.  Gary Oldman is totally off the wall as the wannabe homeboy, Drexl.  Although he is only in two scenes, he does make a lasting impression.  His first scene, which is during a drug buy with Big Don (Samuel L. Jackson), is amongst some of the best parts of the movie.  <br/><br/>I cannot find a single fault with this movie.  I have noticed that Quentin Tarantino has not received a lot of credit for this movie.  That is most likely due to the fact that he did not direct this movie; that credit goes to Tony ""Top Gun"" Scott.  Of course, since Tarantino DID write this movie, you can expect the following: witty dialogue, unbelievable characters, lots of dark humor, and at least two or more scenes of unsettlingly, brutal violence.  To those who do not know what I am talking about, watch Patricia Arquette's encounter with James Gandolfini in the hotel room or watch the ever-famous ""Mexican Standoff"" at the end. <br/><br/>10/10"
"jens.karlsson","6","3","7","15 December 2000"," A boy's dream
","""True Romance"" is a peculiar movie. While it caters to all the action-kinda-romance-kinda-comedy-kinda-immature movie clichées, it still manages to put on an entertaining, and in many ways original, show. This movie is a boy's dream (of a boy, let's say, between 13 and 25) since the lead character (""Clarence"") gets to have a job which seems to amount to reading comic books all day long, gets to meet, and win, a knockout girl who just happens to have the same interests as he (i.e. comic books, kung-fu movies, Elvis, etc), gets to drive all the way from Detroit to Los Angeles with a case full of coke (which they ""innocently"" plan to have transformed into a case full of money), all the time outsmarting criminals and policemen alike just like in....that's right!: the movies. It's clearly evident that this screenplay has been written by ""the one and only"" (you can interpret that expression in any way you like) Quentin Tarantino as the characters discuss things like Elvis's good looks and bad TV shows with the same intensity as if their lives depended on it. Almost in spite of itself, though, this movie feels original. For example, the relationship of Clarence and Alabama feels quite original, genuine and even sexy. And then there is, of course, that outstanding ""interrogation scene"" with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. Clarence's father, played by Hopper, knows for sure that his last moment has come when he is captured and interrogated by the Mafia guys. He knows for certain that they are never going to let him walk. He knows that he's going to die, so he decides to keep his honor and integrity to the very last minute and tells Christopher Walken ""the story about Sicilians' ancestry"" which, of course, amounts to his very own death penalty. This scene is great, played by two great actors."

","Since ""Pulp Fiction"" has become such a huge success, the film industry thought it was cool to pen down the name of Tarantino even if he was involved for 5 seconds or less, but this gem is one of the sweet exceptions. It's like the Tarantino-movie Quentin never made as this movie goes down the screen with a very high speed. Clarence (an incredible Christian Slater) is a kind of weirdo who lives in his own dreamworld (he even has Elvis as an imaginary friend) whose life got tumbled up when his colleagues give him a hooker as a present. Clarence first can't believe that Alabama (Patricia Arquette in her best role ever) is the girl of his dreams, she even, likes obscure kung fu-movies but when he finds out that she's a hooker, he decides to show what real love stands for and kills her pimp so they can start a whole new life. The sole thing is that instead of a bag of clothes, Clarence came home with a bag of cocaine. A real cat and mouse play starts with some incredible small roles (Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini, Samuel L Jackson and an unrecognizable Brad Pitt)."
"johnnyboyz","6","4","11","23 March 2013"," Clumsy, scattershot and mostly devoid of any real substance, True Romance is a flash in the pan thriller with bits-and-pieces going for it.
","Nothing in True Romance is especially mature, but that doesn't stop it from being quite the little blast of cine-literate pulp nonsense. Some of it's funny, some of it's actually quite disturbing; most of it has a lot to do with drugs and pimps, and lowlifes killing other lowlifes to an omnipresent rock-'em-sock-'em aesthetic; it's put together in this manner that has it creep along the line of what's acceptable and what isn't, but it works in the long run if for the time you're sitting there watching it. To state that it's one of the best films a certain Tony Scott ever made speaks volumes; to say the likes of those such as Brad Pitt went on to play roles much more interesting in films that were a lot better speaks even greater volumes. Most of the film is good value; very little of it is especially grown-up; it's tone and content, which will sway wildly from stoner comedy to one of the two leads receiving a beating from a mobster in a nasty little scene, just about holds together with this dumb, infectious energy constantly ticking it over in the engine room.<br/><br/>Christian Slater plays Clarence Worley, a store clerk in his twenties; a sensitive and kind, although schizophrenic, man who craves a female presence in his life and talks with great enthusiasm about things that are dear to him, namely comic books; Elvis Presley tracks and import kung-fu films of the 1970s. When I think of a ""Clarence"", I think of a deliberately dorky looking character in a Gary Larson sketch. He sits at a bar, during the opening scene, and talks to a sex worker about these things, but he's out of his depth - as if he's too nice-a guy to be in this zone speaking to this calibre of person, but so starved of anything remotely of Clarence's ilk is the zone within which he's based, that he must resort to such places and people. She is disinterested, but then again of course she is.<br/><br/>Cut to an establishing shot of where we are: a grim looking Detroit with a grey cloud over it and a generally gloomy atmosphere. Fate appears to deliver an amiable blow when another young sex worker, Patricia Arquette's Alabama, enters the cinema within which Clarence is watching a kung-fu film and sits next to him. They bond, appear to get along and before True Romance's second act can even stretch its legs in preparation to enter the fray, they are married. Clarence is happy he's quashed his desire for someone female and with the apparent interest in what he likes and Alabama's search for some sort of consistency in this, her trek up from far and away Florida, has led her to young Clarence.<br/><br/>Where Slater's character lived for the adventure in his movies, and could only feel passion and love for certain comic books in that he's very protective of certain rare varieties of them, he is now able to direct unto Alabama this enthusiasm to keep something that needs protecting as pristine as possible as well as experience the adventure and dangers abound in his films and comic books. This is born out of what lies within the threatening circles within which Alabama operated prior to knowing Clarence: specifically, her pimp Drexl (Oldman) and the fact he takes issue with this newly formed matrimony. The point of no return is crossed; this first barrier the ""new"" Clarence must hurdle if he is to live out his fantasies and maintain what it is he's found after years of searching accomplished in his killing of Drexl. Once carried out, the pair of them head for Los Angeles out of the fact somewhat skewered twist of fate that saw Clarence grab a case of cocaine upon leaving Drexl's abode, with the mobsters (the true owners of the drugs) out looking for it too.<br/><br/>It's no secret the film loses a lot of its energy and verve upon its arrival in California; primarily out of the fact they get there too quickly and the early poking around under this cloud of gloom and apparent despair as a young guy and a young girl fall in love and try to work around this psychotic pimp is quite good. I've never been fond of crime films set in sunny, bright nor indeed welcoming locales, but what's lacking here is much for Clarence and Alabama to actually get up to. We do not, to the film's ultimate detriment, have the leads' journey to L.A. depicted; a passage of time rife with the potential for dramatic ingredients and the opportunity for a stone-wall antagonist to establish themselves so that it might provide these two leads something to do. There is the potential for this sort of material, in that Christopher Walken plays the boss of a group of these mobsters looking for their cocaine, whose verbal standoff with Clarence's father as he strives to find where they've gone calls to mind the best of what True Romance writer Tarantino can do: think the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds or the final scenes of Pulp Fiction. Alas, he disappears after this one sequence. Credit must go to Christian Slater, who does well in his depiction of someone going from being this weak clerk to a hardened guy having to punch well above his weight, but the film lacks any sort of backbone. Its persistency to use Malick's overture from Badlands serves only to remind us how good that film was, whereas with hindsight, one is able to point out how Tarantino forged an early forte out of depicting partnerships, or couples, dodging bullets and doing crime as apparent in Natural Born Killers; From Dusk 'til Dawn or strands of Pulp Fiction. This is the lesser of the four, and not particularly brilliant as a standalone film either."

This early screenplay by Tarantino contains many of the fun ""tarantinoizms"" that make his movies so much fun!<br/><br/>Overall Tony Scott has done a good job adapting the screenplay.<br/><br/>One of my main problems with the film is that the final shootout Is a bit anticlimactic. The characters simply stand in a room and shoot at each other. This scene could have used some more suspense and style. Also the relationship between Clarence and Alabama was sometimes, like the plot of this movie, too close too the edge of believability.<br/><br/>*Spoilers* I also want to make special note of the scene where Alabama is almost beaten to death by one of the mafiosi. It was very difficult to watch not only because of the emotionally intense and graphic violence, but also because this scene was excruciatingly long, with little ""funny"" scenes in between of Clarence driving to the hotel with not a care in the world, unknowing of the horror that is taking place in the hotel room."

","True Romance, I have seen this movie about 50 times, No lie. And I can tell you right now, that every time I have watched it, I liked it even more. One reason why I did not write this review a long time go, when the movie came out is..... well...... The movie came out in 1993. Im 25 now and I'm pretty sure it was not a good movie for a lil dude to watch . But let me tell you, when i got older, I was never so happy to find an older movie that I loved Right off the bat! So that being said, let me give you a lil plot summary to spice up this review a bit. Clarence and Alabama are newlyweds who acquire an unexpected wedding present. Unknown to the blissfully happy couple, ruthless gangsters are on their tail, determined to reclaim their lost property......<br/><br/>First I wanna get into the writing. Quentin Tarantino Is a great, great writer, Known for writing movies like, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Natural born Killers, From Dusk Till Dawn , Jackie Brown, Kill Bill vol 1 and 2, Death Proof, Inglourious Basterds and his upcoming film Django Unchained (which he all directed). So Obviously he has skills. but even with all those great movies under his belt. I think that True Romance is the best thing he has wrote..... SO far that is. and thats saying A lot. Just the way the story moves along and keeps you interested is Beautiful!!!!! By the end of the movie you feel like you know these characters and you actually care for them. You don't want anything bad to happen to them or worse die. <br/><br/>The Directing, Tony F-ing Scott (Tony Scott) WOW! Known for Directing (just gonna say the ones i like) Top Gun, Crimson Tide, Enemy Of the State, Spy Game, Man On Fire, Domino, Deja Vu, The taking of Pelham 123, and unstoppable. In True Romanced He did an Outstanding job capturing the scenes and angles where you actually feel like your in the room with the characters. You feel there tension, the love, the hate and the innocence. For Example there is a scene with a GANGTER/PIMP (gary Oldman, Believe it or not) and Clarence (Christian Slater), In this scene you feel and see the anger clarence has towards this pimp, but its the way Tony Scott presents these scenes with there theme and mood that get the hairs on your neck to LITERALLY stand up. True Story, It happens to me every time i watch it. And it happens more then once.<br/><br/>The Music, First off i wanna say Hans Zimmer is the man and if you have read any of my other reviews you will know that he is one of my favs. Known for (Seriously there is way to many so I'm only saying a few, and that's still gonna be a lot) Inception, Gladiator, The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, The Da Vinci Code, Black Hawk Down, The Last Samurai, The Rock and The Lion King. So in this film the music sounds like we are about to go to an island and drink pina coladas or go lay on the beach in the nice hot sun........ Sorry not happening here. Instead it throws you off a lil and makes you focus on whats going on in the film. thats what i always liked about Hans, he really sets the theme. But he doesn't always have a song playing in the background. Sometimes its just sounds and weird noises (BUT ITS MUSIC) . <br/><br/>SO ALLLLLL OF ^THAT^ being said. Do I think you should go see this movie? What do you think? YES DUUUUUHHHH! The cast is SUPERB, You got Christian Slater (The guy who falls in love), Patricia Arquette ( The girl that falls in love with the guy), Dennis Hopper (The Guys Innoncent Father), Val Kilmer ( ELVIS.... Yes Elvis), Gary Oldman (Ganster/Drug Dealer/Pimp), Brad Pitt (Stoner on the couch, yes that is literally his role the whole movie), Christopher Walken (The DON of the MAFIA Family in this film), Samuel L. Jackson (Drug Dealer), Michael Rapaport (Cop), James Gandolfini (Mafia Muscle/Hit-man). I mean the cast ALONE is worth the watch. But then you got Quentin Tarantino Writing it, Tony Scott Directing it, hans Zimmer Composing it. LIKE what could be better? NOTHING! The definition of this movie is ""WIN WIN""<br/><br/>THIS MOVIE is a 10 out of 10 ALL DAY!"

","In True Romance, director Tony Scott and writer Quentin Tarantino take us on two lovers' journey through a world of crime and romance. The two lovers (Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette) meet in a movie theatre and Tarantino's love for films is present throughout the film. It's pretty safe to assume that Christian Slater embodies at least some part of Tarantino. He keeps his cool, always has a line on his lips and faces off against the criminals, doing everything to defend his girl. <br/><br/>True Romance does keep the promise given by it's title. It's a story about a couple wound up in a net of evil guys, backstabbing and a suitcase full of Cola, as the aspiring actor Elliot played by Bronson Pinchot calls it. The world of coke-snorting Hollywood guys and suave Italian mafiosi portrayed in True Romance, feels like a Tarantino world at every moment. In fact the whole film screams Tarantino. It's a romantic film in the sense that it romanticizes this world, and the idea that two lovers can get away from it if they stick together. <br/><br/>The dialogue is as always with Tarantino top-notch. The characters are somewhat cartoonish but in the most positive sense. A great cast rounds this experience up, and you just have to love this film as soon as you get to the performance of the pot-smoking slacker version of Brad Pitt."

","For me this movie has to be my all-time favourite, until (if-ever) i see a better one with a better story and better actors(not-likely). Christian slater has always been,in my opinion,one of the finest young stars to have emerged when this film was first released. His James-dean style image adds a certain depth of character to his acting in this and many of his movies. Patricia arquette plays the role of Clarence's (slaters) girlfriend so well, that i stand here today and challenge any-man to tell me that you don't remotely want to love or get to know her in at least a small way. The way Alabama (arquette) genuinely falls for Clarence for me was one of the many fine-points about this excellent script. Coupled with the fact that there love for each other bonds almost instantly & Clarence's jackanapeses makes Alabama his perfect life-partner, because they are chalk & cheese plus she tames her Clarence!!. Both these factors make the scene - where James Gandolfini subjects her to the beating to obtain information, genuinely heartfelt for the viewer. Every thread inside me wanted to put gandolfini down, and have Alabama run back into Clarence's hands. Because there love for each other was just meant to be. Yes this film has a-lot of action & violence in it, but this just makes Quentin Tarantino's predominant love-story a-lot more genuine. Adding tony-Scott's direction makes this one movie you will never forget...... Because it really was TRUE ROMANCE."

","I hadn't watched ""True Romance"" in years, I have it on videotape, what a great balls-out, utlra-cool movie! This movie kicked ass on every level. Tarantino showed why He'd be force in moves and Tony Scott is a great interpreter of his work.<br/><br/>""True Romance"" lives up to its title and then some. When comic store clerk Clarence (Slater) hooks up with Alabama (Patrica Arquette) all hell breaks loose as they try to unload a case of coke in Hollywood. They're just two kids with big dreams, its easy to imagine this in medieval times, talk about romance, peasant boys kills evil warlord to defend his lady's honor! Actually Clarence offs Drexl, unbelievably played by GAry Oldman, what a great actor! <br/><br/>The cast is unreal! Brad Pitt plays permanently high roomie Floyd and makes you wonder what happened to this brilliant actor. I understand he may have done good work again in ""Jesse James"", still here he was young and unkempt and theatrically brilliant in a small part. Remember Brad, there are no small parts only small actors.<br/><br/>Dennis Hopper, a frigin genius, steals scenes and out-acts Chris Walken, no small feat, in a brilliant scene where he informs Mafioso Walken that he's a... Well watch the movie for that one. The film only gets better when they get to Hollywood. James Gandolfini, long before the ""Sopranos"" scores as a hit man roughing up Alabama. He's awesome in this scene! Bronson Pinchot makes you forget ""Perfect Strangers"" Though he is very funny here. The cops are great and was that really Eric Kramer as Saul Rubinek's thug? He deserves better than what he's gotten lately. Rubinek is great too, note the ""Godfather"" like line, ""I treated you like a son, you f*ckin stab me in the heart!"" Awesome.<br/><br/>This flick is just great from start to finish, everyone did a superb job. I didn't even mention Sam Jackson, Val Kilmer or the late Chris Penn. This was one of the best flicks of the decade. Not to be missed! One note, this is a hard ""R"" with strong language, extreme violence and some sex scenes."
"Howlin Wolf","10","2","4","23 August 2007"," Just how far would you go for love?
","Well, if you're a guy like Clarence, then it would seem the answer is 'Pretty far!'. He's a nice enough guy who doesn't have much luck with the ladies, so when Alabama walks into his life it seems like there's going to be strings attached... and there are. Through it all, however, the passion of the young wins through. If that sounds like it's going to be a little too weepy and predictable for the guys though, then you have the wrong film. ""TR"" is smart, sassy and brutal, with an all star cast and notable director delivering the goods at a fast and furious pace.<br/><br/>Things settle into a more traditional and familiar vibe in the last quarter, but until then the delightful surprises come completely out of left field. Any scene from the first third, you could take on its own and make another different movie from. To that end, I say commission another script focusing on Gary Oldman's ""Drexl"", now!! It's nothing short of amazing how the British chameleon takes the character on the page and makes him come alive like you've never seen before! The dialogue is good, but his distinctive accent and appearance make this all about creating a memorably loathsome individual from the ground up. Brad Pitt actually performs a similar feat too - as the lovable stoner ""Floyd"" - with only slightly less impact.<br/><br/>I love this film so much because it's full of some of the best characters you'll find in crime cinema. Let them take you on a journey with them, and you're liable to find yourself wrung out at the end of it."
"Skynet789","6","2","4","2 July 2007"," Not truly a romance movie
","Original director Quentin Tarrantino wrote this movie, but didn't direct it, Tony Scott did. True Romance is about a comic book store clerk named Clarence (played by Christian Slater) who falls in love with a call girl named Alabama (played by Patricia Arquette) after a one night fling. The movie centers around these two characters, and a suitcase full of cocaine Clarence finds after killing Alabama's pimp Drexl (played by Gary Oldman) in his sleazy whore house. After realizing they have a suitcase full of cocaine, this takes them down a journey that involves the mafia, police officials, and the movie industry. I would tell you more, but you should go see it yourself. I gave this 6 stars because I felt the romance part of the movie took away a lot of the excitement (or it could of been Tony Scott's directing ability that did it). I also didn't like the ending because I thought it built you up for something good, then evaporated into nothing. But, there are a couple of good scenes in the movie you will enjoy such as the Sicilian scene between Christopher Walken & Dennis Hopper, and the hotel room scene between James Gandolfini & Patricia Arquette. All in all a fairly entertaining flick."

","To me this movie is a masterpiece! Everything works in this movie. The cinematography is great. The story is compelling. The music is beautiful. The acting is superb. There is a lot of humor. There is some nice action. And there is drama. For me to tell me what the story is about would be sacrilege. You have to see it for yourself and you will be amazed. Very important is the fact that this is a movie you can watch over and over again. ""True Romance"" suggests a romantic love story. It is about love and the consequences of this love. After several viewings you will discover more themes. I know that Quentin Tarantino wrote the screenplay and you will recognize his influence:wonderful dialog and tribute to Hong Kong and Japanese movies (""Streetfighter Trilogy"" with Sonny Chiba is playing in the cinema where Clarence meets Alabama,At Clarence's home Alabama is watching "" a better tomorrow 2"" from John Woo). But the story works so good because of the great characters. All of the characters in the movie are interesting and there are many of them. You will hate them,love them, laugh with them,yell at them,in short you will be involved. ""True Romance"" is a masterpiece!"

So it prompt me to come look up info about it AGAIN, and I realize nobody has posted here for years, but I just had to add something.<br/><br/>If you read the other comments, you will realize that this is an action packed, star studded movie that snuck under the block buster radar back in 1993. I think the title turns most people off, and I remember a critic saying that back then.<br/><br/>But that is my point. If you follow this movie closely, and you know how Quentin loves his dialog, you will realize that this is a very very romantic movie. What Clarence does for his love, is close to what spiderman does in his favorite comic book he talks about. Clarence is just a mild mannered, boring nobody, he's not a gangster or tough guy.. it's just what he is willing to do for his soulmate and to guarantee a happy ever after.<br/><br/>OK, enough.. nobody will probably read this.. but I just had to throw my 2 cents in about my most favorite movie of all time.

It really is one of my all-time favorite films and should definitely be considered a MUST SEE by anyone who likes a good action/comedy/drama. Since it's written by Tarantino, expect the prerequisite violence and obsessive cursing...but this is by far my favorite film that he's had anything to do with. The cast alone is a who's who: Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Tom Sizemore, Michael Rappaport, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Balki from Perfect Strangers, Brad Pitt, and of course the legends themselves - Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper - who share a scene that I swear to God is one of the best in film history.

","What a cracking film this is. All my favourite actors in one film (Oldman, Walken, Arquette, Hopper). I'm not a big Christian Slater fan but he portrays the Clarence character so well. Clarence has so many unexpected sides to his character, comic book store manager for years, then, for love of Alabama kills two men in cold blood and a-whole-nother character appears. Oldman is the business as the psychotic wannabe dread (""it ain't white boy day is it Marty?""). Dennis Hopper excels as the ex-alcoholic father of Clarence (Christian Slater) especially in the best scene the film (the eggplant scene). Best scene in a film ever - what a work of genius both in acting, screenplay and writing.

"mmel__98","10","2","4","3 April 2005"," True Romance - a definitive QT trend-setter....
","True Romance is an incredible movie; not only are the characters rich, well developed and highly interesting...but there are many subtle parts to the movie that are incorporated in later QT works. The triple feature that Clarence goes to (the Sonny Chiba films; Sonny plays a prominent role in Kill Bill, as Hattori Honso), the Samuel Jackson character (a brief but brilliant sign of things to come in Pulp Fiction), and the way Tarantino includes various cameos and short scenes that seem to lift already popular actors to an even higher plateau are just a few things I love about this film. Did you know that James Gandolfini's scene in the hotel room with Patricia Arquette is the defining scene that secured his being cast as Tony Soprano? Gary Oldman shows how versatile he is by playing a well disguised white pimp with amazing dialogue; the scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper is (in my opinion) one of the greatest ever filmed. The Director's Cut version of this movie has a slightly different ending to the shootout; subtle, but strangely powerful. I would HIGHLY recommend this film to anyone who enjoys the wacky, brilliant world of Quentin Tarantino."

"agmoldham","9","2","4","5 May 2004"," The Best Tarantino movie
","Even though directed by Tony Scott, this is the best Tarantino movie. Any great movie needs several stand out scenes and that is just what True Romance has. Clarence (Slater) is set up with a call girl Alabama (Arquette) for a birthday present. They fall for each other and Clarence looks to even things out with Drexl (Oldman) which leads to a rather violent conclusion. This sets the tone for the movie and anybody that has a squemish nature should steer clear of the movie. Some people may also find some of the language a bit industrial and it's not always politically correct in terms of race and gender.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast put in some outstanding performances and the film is gripping from start to finish. If I was being really nit picking I'd suggest the ending was a bit weak, but it's just so good upto that point who cares. I'm sure Tarantino would have liked to have shoved this script away on his mantlepiece for a few years, because it knocks the spots off Kill Bill. With non stop action, great acting, unfussy direction and spellbinding script this is undoubtedly one of the finest modern day films to come out of Hollywood. 10/10"
"paul_mampilly","Null","2","4","11 February 2004"," Tarantinos romantic story with the unnecessary Hollywood gloss.
","Ever since I saw the indie classic `Reservoir Dogs', it felt like it was my mission to watch all the movies which was directed or written by the former video clerk. I have seen the mutterings of having cheeseburgers for breakfast in Pulp Fiction, the arterial spurts of a freshly chopped arm in Kill Bill Volume I, the double crossings of an air stewardess in Jackie Brown and the crazy obsession with celebrities in Natural Born Killers. So having read recently that QTs first major transcript was not Reservoir Dogs, but a movie I have not seen called True Romance. Basically I heard that this film was written way before the ear cutting classic. Sorry about the small story about the past works of one of the most influential directors of our time, but it helps me to be able to write this movie review.<br/><br/>
POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>We should start this review at the only place it should begin, which is at the start. The film starts of with a chance meeting between a call girl named Alabama and an Elvis fanatic called Clarence during a martial arts extravaganza in a seedy cinema. During the usual getting to know chit chat, it seems that they have truly fallen in love, and before long they get married. One day, Clarence finds out that Alabama has a pimp, who was a nasty piece of work. With this knowledge, Clarence anger rises and silently swears to the King of Pop that he will seek vengeance on the prostitute pusher. After eliminating this person, Clarence picks up a bag, assuming that it was his wife's belongings. Instead it turns out to be a large stash of uncut cocaine. His plan was to sell this whole amount of cocaine to a big Hollywood producer to make a tidy amount of money. However another element joins into the equation, such as a sadistic mob who are pretty irate about their cocaine being stolen and would do anything to get it back. That is where the real fun starts in this movie, with the gangsters being on the tails of this movie's Bonnie and Clyde. <br/><br/>The casting ensemble for this movie is filled with some established actors as well as some up and coming actors who will become A-listed players. (Look at Brad Pitt and Samuel L Jackson for their bit parts in this movie) Christian Slater's character was believable, and he did have some aspects to make himself cool, especially liking Kung Fu movies and The King himself. Patricia Arquette played her character of Alabama, with some sexiness yet with simple and innocent way about it. Christopher Walkens made his role his own, by playing the stony face, sadistic Sicilian gangster. Dennis Hopper did do a good job on playing a simple living semi retired cop, who is the father of Clarence. However I do have to say that my favourite character in this movie was Bronson Pinchot's weasely, boot licking and cowardly portrayal of Elliot. This is probably one of his best acting screen time ever. Also, I do not want to forget the concept of Val Kilmer playing the King himself. It is a good thing that you do not see the King himself, but only his tacky gold suit, otherwise you would think that he would look nothing like Elvis.<br/><br/>As the review title says, this movie does not go without any flaws at all. The first flaw is the directing. Tony Scott did a reasonably good job in the directing, yet I still felt that it was out of place with the dialogue given by Tarintino. Once again, I would have to say sorry about the biasness towards Quentin, but if he was behind the camera in this movie, it would have turn into a much better picture. Personally I did not like the Hollywood gloss given over the movie. It just seems too fake, even though there were visions of Elvis taking to this guy, and a gratitous amounts of violence. Also another thing I did not like, is the concept of Gary Oldman playing Drexel. To me it just does not make sense to get a white guy to play a Rastafarian. Would it not have been easier to have gotten a black guy to play this role. Sorry to have gone Spike Lee on all you readers, but I had to say what I had to say. This does not mean that Gary Oldman acting was rubbish in this movie, but it would have been better that this character was played by an Afro Carribean origin. <br/><br/>To conclude, I do believe that this movie is very enjoyable, and great to watch, especially seeing cameos of soon to be big Hollywood players (Samuel L Jackson and Brad Pitt). Watch it if you like good crime movies with witty dialogue."
"Manthorpe","9","2","4","21 January 2004"," What a cast.
","I typically do not enjoy Christian Slater's movies, but this one is a definite exception. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Tom Sizemore.I mean come on, how could it not be a cool movie? I was told that I had to watch this movie by several friends, but for some self-admittedly ignorant reason, I was always put off by the name as romantic comedies usually make me gagwith a few exceptions. This is no romantic comedy and I'm glad I came across this film. And if you're an Oldman fan, this flick is essential to your collection.<br/><br/>Minor Spoilers:<br/><br/>Clarence (Slater) and Alabama (Arquette) meet when Clarence's boss hires a hooker for him for his birthday, with instructions to not let him know who and what she really was. As it turns out, the couple instantly falls in love and after a short night together, and they spontaneously decide to get married. Clarence becomes obsessed with the fact that while Alabama was only a call girl for a day or two and had only a few customers, that she actually had a sinister pimp named Drexyl (Oldman) who was also a big drug dealer somewhere out there. With the advice of Clarence's imaginary friend and mentor, Elvis (Kilmer), he decides that he cannot be happy until Drexyl no longer exists and decides he must be taken out. The confrontation starts a whirlwind of events that the couple must somehow get through before they can live together in peace. It all comes down to a huge climax with guns drawn, bullets flying and much bloodshed. Will they survive and live happily ever after?<br/><br/>I love this movie and am quite surprised that it's not at a loftier position on IMDB, which is the reason why I feel obligated to put in my 2 cents. I usually only write reviews for over-rated or under-rated movies.....and this one is certainly under-rated. TR has it all, romance, comedy, action, and some very tense scenes and situations. The acting is top-quality, even Slater, and with such an ensemble cast it's definitely one of the movies strongest points. All of the characters are well thought out and make the film a true joy to watch. Simply seeing Oldman (probably my favorite actor) depict a Jamaican pimp who thinks he's black is an awesome sight. I don't think there's a character he can't pull off, and especially if it's someone a bit deranged and a little bit out of his mind. Another performance worth mentioning is Christopher Walken, who plays a Don for the Mafia. I won't give away his involvement but I will lead on that he has one of the coolest lines and performances I have ever seen in a long time. Dennis Hopper who plays Clarence's father in the film is in the scene with Walken and has equally witty dialog and attitude. My only problem with the movie, and it's a very minor one, is that Clarence and Alabama's romance seems a little hokey at one part, but that's it. Other than that, I love this movie!<br/><br/>Tarantino wrote it and it's very obvious throughout most of the film. I highly recommend this movie to QT fans or anyone interested in any of the cast. Because of the acting performances, True Romance has a very high reply value.<br/><br/>Overall 9/10."
"FranktheRabbit","7","2","4","20 December 2003"," Not your average 'romance' movie...
","True Romance (1993/Tony Scott) {written by Quentin Tarantino} *** out of **** <br/><br/>I recently purchased a boat load of Tarantino flicks, and this was one of them. Sure it wasn't directed by him, but their are still many of his trademarks (hamburgers and kung-fu films) featured in the film.<br/><br/>
I want to start out by saying that this film has the finest cast I have ever seen on film. It starts out as the strangest Romance I have ever seen, but quickly changes gears into a violent/action/thriller. The films starts out with a nerdy Elvis fan in Detroit named Clarence(Christian Slater) who has a one night stand with a call girl named Alabama (the very sexy Patricia Arquette). They soon decide that they love each other and get married. Then, Clarence takes it upon himself to kill Alabama's old Pimp (Gary Oldman in dreadlocks ). This is were the ultra bloody/violent fun begins, when they take it on the lam. <br/><br/>Other players in the cast are Dennis Hopper (Clarence's father), Christopher Walken (a ruthless mobster), Brad Pitt (the ultimate stoner), Val Kilmer (Clarence's vision of Elvis), Chris Penn & Tom Sizemore (two cops), James Gandolfini (a cold-blooded hitman), and Samuel L. Jackson as a Drug-dealer (very small part). The only problem I have with the cast is that a lot of the characters either are killed off or disappear before they can develop fully. The best scene is when Walken interrogates Hopper's character. It is surreal to see such great actors in the same scene. Excellent dialogue too. I also found it strange to see Hopper in such a toned down role.<br/><br/>Some die-hard Tarantino fans might not like the fact that it is not directed by Tarantino, but that isn't really a problem. Tony Scott ('Enemy of the State' and 'Spy Game') does a credible job directing, if not a little fast paced. But the film has that ""we've seen it all before"" feeling, especially with the blood soaked climax. <br/><br/>All in all, a worthy effort. A must for Tarantino fans, but others rent before purchase. The DVD is excellent, and a great addition to my collection.<br/><br/>-30-"
"vpanand4-1","Null","2","4","16 October 2003"," Gorgeous Love (Spoilers)
","Quentin Tarantino's writing is what the movie's were made for. Living characters hiding in cliched but rich characters The criticism it received for it's emphasis on violence, and extrapolation of characters is most likely the same criticism Spielberg received when he took aliens and comic-book heroes like Indiana Jones, and revered them into movie theaters.<br/><br/>
Quentin took the people that read the dime magazine romance novels, underground comics that treat love like a child's plaything, mobsters that are aware of their own violence, and placed them in the world as it can horribly turn out to be.<br/><br/>I'm a big romantic comedy fan, and could empathize with how many details are peppered onto Patricia Arquette's character as the woman of someone's dreams. She might not be perfect, but she reminds that the woman you fall in love with aren't perfect, and that's why you love them.<br/><br/>
The first few scenes between the two of them evolve so naturally and at the same time with that dime-magazine exaggeration that it becomes compelling to love them and judge them. Especially when you can distance yourself from them, call them comic-geeks and white trash. Where the writing gets you is that you still love these two, because they're as afraid of waht they're into as any could ever be.<br/><br/>The violence is effective. Your heart is broken when you realize how much your heart could possibly bleed for years knowing that while your lady was dying for you in a hotel room, you were out buying burgers and talking about Elvis. And dying because she thought you to be the woman you always wanted to be for somebody but you know you're not. The love of a good woman, who ain't perfect but lives in a reality that makes you the strongest man alive is a truly romantic way to live forever. It's the biggest most deliciious slice of America's culture that anybody could want. It's America, living fast, making fresh new love in a phone booth in the desert, while the biggest truck in the world rolls past. 10/10"

"Paul-93","10","2","4","9 February 1999"," The Perfect Recipe
","Apart from being the breathtaking cinematic experience that it is, True Romance doubles as a masterclass in movie production by selecting the very finest ingredients: cracking script, mouthwatering acting talent and stylish director.<br/><br/>Many have been quick to point out the Tarantino script and wealth of star actors but few have acknowledged the input of the film's director.  Being a fellow Brit, I can't help but feel proud to know that one of the finest thrillers of the decade was directed by Tony Scott.<br/><br/>With this film, Scott proves he has the ability to handle wordplay as well as anyone.  If there was ever any doubt before, merely breathe in the chilling, claustrophobic atmosphere he crafted in the Hopper/Walken scene. Scott was also able to mold memorable character moments for all the other cameo players.  A feat all the more remarkable, considering the limited amount of screen time given to each actor.  Even the Tom Sizemore character lingers in the mind, despite the frantic editing each moment he's on screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I cannot acknowledge Tarantino (the director) with the same regard. His blistering screenplays all contain the trademark incisive repartee but Tarantino's directorial style caters too much to the scriptwriter.  Tarantino merely shoots the actors performing to dialogue (similar to that of a parent videotaping his child in a school play). Considering the excellence of his writing and the ability of each actor, this approach almost works but an experienced director is needed to sustain a visual momentum.  As a result of his one-dimensional approach, all three Tarantino films suffer from the occasional pocket of tedium. One example would be the Jack Rabbit Slim's scene in Pulp Fiction (an opinion also shared by the film's editor - Sally Menke). I even heard someone SNORING during my screening of Jackie Brown.  Tony Scott may have the reputation of favouring style over content, but once given a quality script, he has the ability to carry it with precision timing as well as flair which leaves you feeling like you've seen an electrifying movie as opposed to an electrifying play.<br/><br/>This is not to disregard the fact that Tarantino has directed many classic movie moments but his forte remains behind the pen  not the megaphone.  It can be argued that out of all his screenplays, the two most entertaining movies were True Romance and From Dusk Til Dawn.  Neither of which were directed by Tarantino himself.  As True Romance has shown, once you have the very best players working in their respective fields, the result can be awesome."

","In general, this movie was an enjoyable criminal drama. As always I'll be telling about the good and the bad. So let's start off with the good.
I enjoyed the story. There was plenty of action in it and the dialog wasn't clunky, it flowed really well. I enjoyed the main characters. Christian Slater and his co-star were fantastic. The supporting characters were great and there were a lot of big names in there, most notably the great James Gandolfini. But inevitably there will be some bad elements.
The pacing was a bit off. I think the pacing was off because at first it was going to be directed by Tarantino. It wasn't going to be in chronological order, but when Tony Scott took over that changed. The ending was too feel good for me. Apparently there was a darker ending, which would have fit the story better imo.

"robsta23","7","0","0","8 January 2016"," Odd Title
","Knowing this film was written by Tarantino, it was a no-brainer that it would be violent and rich in dialogue. It also seemed like a strange title since Tarantino has never directed a romance story, and this movie is only devoted to the titular romance at certain moments. Rather than focusing on the actual romance, this film primarily focuses on the aftermath of Clarence's decision to ""rescue"" Alabama from her pimp. What I mean by this is that the movie is driven by the fact that people are after Clarence once he steals some cocaine as well as by Clarence's sense of freedom by sitting on a fortune as long as he sells the coke. The romance is something that compliments this story.<br/><br/>When the romance is actually given attention in the film it proves to be interesting. Clarence learns that Alabama is a prostitute who his boss had hired to show Clarence a good time on his birthday, and this makes no difference to his feelings for Alabama. She is touched that he genuinely had a good time with her - the greatest time he has had with a girl in his whole life. Sex is not the deciding factor here; Clarence loves Alabama for who she is, what she loves, her comforting presence. Perhaps this is the meaning of the title - the romance is formed regardless of the situation of how the two met. The two are together throughout the movie, but it is a shame that most of the film focuses on the crime Clarence becomes involved in rather than the dynamics of this relationship.<br/><br/>This movie is made up of a stellar cast, and it is a shame that a good amount of recognizable names are only in the film very briefly. Though Tarantino only wrote this film we see a lot of faces found in films which he directed: Brad Pitt, Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Walken, and Chris Penn. Christian Slater as Clarence is a perfect fit for the role though he is not a well-known actor. He adds great personality to Clarence who is a true Tarantino character, defined by his taste in pop culture, as well as just a touch of craziness to make his desperation believable.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is because this film is directed by Tony Scott and not Tarantino, but True Romance is a decent story which lacks Tarantino- level energy, especially in its action sequences. True Romance is a fun experience if you keep in mind it is a screenplay by Tarantino in his early days.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"

This is not to say that Mr. Scott has let us down, but if you don't like full on, in your face action flicks, you'd better forget about this one.<br/><br/>All the cast, quite an ensemble, have a great time, especially the walk-ons. Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken are most enjoyable. Leads Christian Slater and the sexy Patricia Arquette hold up very well. Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Saul Rubinek and Val Kilmer also drop in on proceedings.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's music works reasonably well, cinematography is exciting and gunplay action sequences are nerve racking.

Leads Slater and Arquette do fine, but it is the support cast that grab our attention. Gary Oldman is totally absorbed in his character as always, playing a white pimp whose psychosis has him convinced he's anything but white. Just as entertaining are Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, and the scene played between them is a particular highlight. Joining the fun also are Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Chris Penn, Saul Rubinek and Samuel L.

","True Romance is a not really good. It wallows in every possible seedy contrivance of American crime/action cinema. It is absolutely shameless in its exploitation of excessive violence, over-acting, melodrama, lurid sex, and rampant drug use...I love it. Quentin Tarantino, as I'm sure everyone knows, wrote the story, but it is the in execution that this film pays off. The cast, oh the cast: The lynchpins are Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. They both give solid performances, which prevents the film from flying off the tracks; they serve as the pilot light. The supporting roles are the gas. The Walken/Hopper show down has been oft sighted as the film's best aspect, and this is, arguably, true. Just watch this scene and then watch it again. Sparks actually shoot out of the screen and burn people about the head and shoulders. OK, you've got Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis, Brad Pitt as a disgruntled pot-smoking loser, Tom Sizemore & Chris Penn as cops, James Gandolfini (pre-Sopranos) as a reflective hit-man, and you've even got Bronson Pinchot (from TV's PERFECT STRANGERS) for God's sake. Did I forget Gary Oldman? Do yourself a favor and rent every single Gary Oldman related project (they're not all good films, but...). Why is Gary Oldman not in every film ever made? Why? I ask you why? He has got to be the best actor working today, hands down. As Drexel Spivey, Oldman chews the scenery, digests it, and then expels it from every orifice. Keep in mind that he is an English actor with a normal speaking voice at home in the Royal Shakespeare Company. His performance here is second only to his turn in LEON in blatant over-the-top insanity. Tony Scott, who along with his brother Ridley, has been known to over-direct a film or two, here chooses wisely to basically set up the camera and run. The score by Hans Zimmer adds a bouncy xylophone driven theme to the film and finds the right balance. This a well made, balls-to-the-wall, popcorn throwing, cult classic. In a market dominated with stereotypical characters, this movie avoids that trap by letting the stereotypes flourish with all the grotesque absurdity it can muster. 9/10"

Tarantino is soooo derivative, skip his films and enjoy his source material instead (blaxploitation & kung fu films).

The film begins very well, the first 30-40 minutes are interesting and absorbing. But! As soon as the film shows it's real colors, it falls on it's face. Also, the goings-on get too violent and gory, which puts you off completely. More over, the culmination is also a downer. The impact clearly seems missing! <br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is my favorite filmmaker, I am a huge fan of his. But, I have no option here, but to say this popular faze: When The Mighty Fell! Same goes for Tony Scott.<br/><br/>In the acting department, 'True Romance' gets an ensemble cast, and there are some note-worthy performances. Christian Slater is excellent.

It was interesting watching one of Tarantino's very first screenplays come to life, and it was actually pretty good, however it was nowhere near as creative as the other films he wrote. This isn't exactly what Tony Scott does best. While The Last Boy Scout and Beverly Hills Cop II were directed with skill, he fails to fully satisfy with True Romance. I've always wondered how this movie would turn out if Tarantino had directed it instead. He could probably have done it better. But ultimately, the plot is so poor that even if Tarantino would direct it, it would still be a sinking ship.<br/><br/>Christian Slater and Juliette Lewis are pretty good though, but what really saves True Romance is the exceptionally great supporting cast, notably Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken, who deliver top-notch performances. They are, without a doubt, the best thing about this movie, despite their screen time is no longer than 10 minutes combined. Another supporting role worth mentioning is Brad Pitt in a two-minute role. His character is a major influence on stoner comedies later on, and it is this small role that, in my opinion, was the first to define how good his acting abilities actually is.<br/><br/>Overall, True Romance is worth the price of admission, because of the great supporting cast and Tarantino's (occassionally) good writing. - Moose finds this film worthy of an 8."

His style, visual flair and balls out frenetic action gives Tarantino's pitch perfect script the care and attention the lover's on the run, action thriller truly deserves. Scott has been quoted as acknowledging True Romance as his favourite piece of work as well as recently screening an anniversary showing of his own personal copy of the masterpiece. I only wish I had been there for that experience.<br/><br/>The story ignites with two social misfits Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) & Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) meeting at the movie theatre in Detroit where they quickly begin a whirlwind romance. However, Alabama's past comes into the fray and all hell breaks loose as the couple abscond with a suitcase full of trouble, with the mob and police in hot pursuit resulting in a spectacular orgy of ultra violence and punchy dialogue.<br/><br/>The calibre of cast in this movie is outstanding all at the top of their game with some note worthy stand out performances such as newcomer Brad Pitt in a perfectly suited stoner role...

"movieguy1021","6","2","5","15 June 2004"," True Romance: 6/10
","As much as I love Quentin Tarantino (well...love his movies), he does get pretty pretentious at times. One prime example was Kill Bill: Volume Two, where he thinks his dialogue is so good that he forgets that it's only good dialogue in a Tarantino fashion if it's funny, also. The same thing happened to True Romance. Often, Tarantino's writing is memorable, making his movies memorable and immortal. Although I'm behind on reviews, so I saw this movie a few weeks ago, I remember almost nothing from this film. There are some speeches characters give that could go down next to the ""Royale with Cheese"" sequence from Pulp Fiction, but, alas, they don't for a variety of reasons.<br/><br/>Clarence (Christian Slater) is a typical loser. His boss hires prostitute Alabama (Patricia Arquette) to have sex with him on his birthday, and before they know it, they're married. Clarence kills her pimp (Gary Oldman), steals cocaine from him, and goes to Hollywood looking to sell it. The pimp's men go out to chase them. What an exciting story.<br/><br/>I'm not going to blame it all on Tarantino. Much of the problem should be directed to director Tony Scott. You may remember him as being the one who took a possibility for a great movie called Man on Fire, chewed it up, spit it back out, and turned it into total crap. He shows more restraint here, making True Romance bearable and, at times, exciting. But nothing in it is memorable-the shootoff in Reservoir Dogs (which wasn't memorable per se) was more memorable. The characters weren't memorable, the scenes and speeches weren't memorable, and most of the movie wasn't memorable. I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm making True Romance out to be this awful movie. It really isn't.<br/><br/>Some of the movie was interesting (for then), and there's a great scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. It doesn't resonate with me now, but as I was watching the movie, I was thinking how cool it was. While the characters weren't really defined much, they were acted well throughout. Samuel L. Jackson could have done more, though. Then again, Sam Jackson eating cottage cheese is exciting for me. But I digress. True Romance is nowhere near the potential Tarantino has, but if you watch it, you'll probably enjoy it. But don't think about it afterwards or you'll not like it as much.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence, language, and drug use."

","i didn't see this movie until recently, and it is one of those 90's film that just invokes nostalgia for that time and in many ways captures the essence and style of a period in time. I dont know what it is about quentin taratino but many of the projects he's involved with provoke this response.Even though I know he was unhappy about natural born killers, i love that movie and feel the same way about it, you coould probally say the same for pulp fiction. True Romance is one of the greatest films to come out of the 90s, every scene, every line, every shot! Some movies just do it for you, this is one of those movies for me. If you havent seen this movie watch it with your girlfriend."

","Don't kill me yet, let me speak, although Tarantino is good he is definitely nowhere near greatness, yet. Kill Bill was his best film (which i would give a 9 out of a 10), reservoir dogs was good, but far from great, a 6 out of a 10, Jackie brown was bad, and finally pulp fiction, one of the most overrated films ever alongside 2001 and Seven Samurai (both of which sucked terribly). Pulp fiction wasn't bad it just wasn't very good, just because the story was chopped up doesn't make it a good one, it was uninteresting and had ZERO action, also the rape scene and the dialogue were pointless, all they said was the f word and the rape scene was just wrong, if it had more action and a better story with better dialogue it would be much better, i would give Pulp a 4 out of a 10, so as you can see Tarantino is good but needs to do a lot more to become great. Now onto this movie, just let me say that this is Scott's film so give him some credit, Tarantino wrote it, Scott made it, all the performances and style are from Scott, he is a good director capable of just as much if not more then Tarantino. Overall this was an average film, basically a chick flick with violence, drugs, and great dialogue, a highlight of the film, the dialogue was creative an hilarious, and Brad Pitt cracked me up, he played the pothead so well, in fact he was a little too good, wonder what he was doing back then. It had style, it had humor, it had decent performances, but it lacked a complex story, action, and drama. I give it a 5 out of a 10, Scott has gotten better since this and i cant wait to see Domino, as for Tarantino i hope he continues making movies just as long as he makes them more like Kill Bill, he is good but don't think of him as a god because he is far from anywhere near that status, i hope he does Inglorious Bastards he would make a great war movie, also i would like to see his new kung fu movie, sounds good."

Gary Oldman is fantastic is his brief scene as a drug dealer. Brad Pitt has a drug user (stoner) also amazing. It's fun and full of excitement.

"richard-fieldhouse","7","1","2","5 January 2020"," Good - but I'm not sure it's That Good
","Yes. It's a good film, but I don't really know that it justifies quite the accolades or the overall score that it's received here. Are there perhaps fanbois - devotees of the work of Tarantino, or Christian Slater or any of the dozen or so famous and talented contributors who are rating what they think these people can do, rather than what they actually have done - in this film - here?<br/><br/>The basic story is fairly simple: Clarence and Alabama are thrown together - almost by chance - and they fall for each other. They also come - again more or less by chance - to find themselves in possession of a suitcase full of cocaine. A true romance grows - between the man, the woman and the illicit wealth...<br/><br/>Some of the acting is top notch and some of the episodes in the tale are entertaining. The whole though, is a little disjointed: strong gory violence and drug taking are pretty much ubiquitous and just about the deepest message of the story is that some people get lucky while some notorious criminals and law enforcers can be absurdly incompetent and trigger-happy.<br/><br/>Take, for instance the scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. Perhaps these are impressive performances but the scene is both violent and exceptionally racist - and all for nothing. The plot motivation behind the racism is comparatively clear, but does that make it justified? Not for me. And does the scene advance the plot? Only really in the last couple of seconds, and only in a way that has been trailed far too obviously about five minutes earlier.<br/><br/>We still have to wait a further fifteen minutes - about an hour into the movie - before things get going properly in a long scene between Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini.<br/><br/>By all means watch the film - enjoy the film - but don't forget that violence and drug-taking and racism have consequences - and not just for other people. In the real world, the central actors are more often damaged too.<br/><br/>Overall 6.5/10"

I suppose it doesn't help that the protagonist's sudden transformation isn't convincing, not to mention that what he does is unnecessary and perilous (i.e. stupid), which turns him into a bit of a creepy nutzoid.

Each character that comes on the screen is just as memorable as the next one. Both Slater and Arquette give great performances and have good chemistry with each other. Gary Oldman as Alabama's pimp is terrific. He is sinister, evil, and greedy at the same time. The supporting cast consisting of Michael Rappaport, Brad Pitt, Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini, Saul Rubinek, Tom Sizemore, and Chris Penn all do stellar jobs in their roles.

","Guns, girls, cigarettes, karate, violence, curses, movies, thugs, Hollywood, motels, fast cars, money, cocaine, mafia bosses, pimps, prostitutes, sunglasses, hamburgers, blood, laughter, Elvis, and romance. <br/><br/>I could go on writing lists for hours, but these 24 words are True Romance. Really. If it were a person, it would proudly state that it lives in the United States of America and, chances are, it would probably be a hormonal 15-year-old boy. This might suggest that it is a shallow film, but as it one of Quentin Tarantino's first screen writing jobs, the shallow attributes are lovably shallow rather than stupefying.<br/><br/>Tarantino's mind, I assume, resembles a glorified exploitation movie theater, bursting at the seams with Kung-Fu triple features and Spaghetti Westerns, rockabilly music drifting in the background of the foyer. True Romance is a chase movie on crack, exploitative in its violence but charmingly energetic in its dialogue and its acting; it's unbalanced, sometimes off-putting and sometimes gloriously enjoyable.<br/><br/>The true romance on display rests on the shoulders of Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) and Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), who marry after a whirlwind night surrounded by movies and bedsheets. Clarence is a comic-book nerd, a friendless average Joe who celebrates his birthday every year by watching a series of Sonny Chiba vehicles; Alabama, in serious contrast, is a prostitute, or, as she puts it, a call girl for the last three days. They're a mismatch made in heaven, he with his skinny, badly-postured mannerisms and she with her red lipstick, beach- blonde hair, and seedy fur coats.<br/><br/>Though he's euphoric knowing that he's finally found Mrs. Right, Clarence simply cannot ease into domestic bliss knowing that Alabama's pimp (Gary Oldman) is still sneaking around, possibly looking for her. So, after a long-winded and seriously violent confrontation, he kills him, steals his suitcase of cocaine, and hits the road, his wife in tow. <br/><br/>True Romance is directed by Tony Scott and stars Christian Slater, and those are the most prominent obstacles the film encounters in its explosive 120 minutes. When directing, Tarantino generally makes his violence comically bloody, silly even; Scott, on the other hand, doesn't have the same tongue-in-cheek attitude his writer does in terms of bloodletting, not always lining up with Tarantino's cavorting screenplay. The sequence in which Alabama is ruthlessly beat up by one of her dead pimp's associates is so disturbingly brutal that it mismatches the splintery, witty writing of the earlier scenes. Slater, while decent enough to be a distraction instead of a film destroyer, is miscast. His acting is too calculated, too cautious. In a film so unhinged, the lead must be just as unhinged; thank goodness for Arquette, Gary Oldman, and Christopher Walken, who are all tremendous, and, yes, unhinged.<br/><br/>That's what makes True Romance so frustrating. 60% worth consists of absolutely brilliantly realized conversations, traveling with the ease of a continuous meet-cute, but the other 40% is composed of heinous violence that doesn't quite match the lurid wink of the remaining 60%.<br/><br/>The violence is almost forgivable, but when you find yourself with a clearer image of Dennis Hopper getting his hand sliced open by one of Walken's henchman than Clarence and Alabama's initial meeting, it's much too difficult. But when True Romance is good, it's truly exceptional; there is a reason why so many consider it to be a classic of '90s cinema. Some might praise it for its climactic shoot-em-up, some might root for Clarence and Alabama's unconventional romance, and some might get a kick out of its dialogue. There's something for everybody, but one out of those three people will have a hard time consuming it all with no questions asked. <br/><br/>Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com"

It might not be as raw as Reservoir Dogs, or as trendy as Pulp Fiction - you could even say it's more of a 'mainstream' gangster flick.<br/><br/>It's about a pair of lovable rogues who steal cocaine from someone they really shouldn't, then go on a joyride to Hollywood to sell it. It's fair to say that, along the way, they meet plenty of people who want to put a damper on their plans (or simply just murder them horribly).<br/><br/>As I mentioned, there's an all star cast, so expect one great performance after the other.

Christian Slater (the once-promising young Jack Nicholson) carries the load admirably, and Patricia Arquette is sexier than ever. If Quentin Tarantino should be remembered for any one film, it's this one: it's by far the best movie bearing his name- thanks to a mostly outstanding cast, guided by a director who really knew his stuff."
"videorama-759-859391","8","1","2","14 July 2014"," True Tarantino tale, that's volently romantic
","It's highly unlikely, we'll ever meet another writer who can match the unique, original, and potent style of dialogue, with sharp, cutting observation such as Tarantino. Not in this lifetime anyhow. Admittedly this was his first movie script, which he drew from his own experiences down at Video Archives. The title here is a killer, where much more is happening than just romance. The names and characters which aren't just drawn from a hat, are loud and interesting, and I'm even talking about the baddies, such as pimp, Drexl Spivey, played with such evil and loathing from the ever versatile Gary Oldman. His demise is one of the most shockingly violent moments in Tarantino history, as was the scene with cutie pie Alabama Whitman (a perfectly splendid Arquette) enduring a hell of a bashing by mobster, Virgil (the late great Gandofini) in that motel suite, one of the strongest cinematic moments, I've craved revenge. When seeing it back in 94, two women behind me went off at that scene violence. Remember you've walked into a film penned by Tarantino, where like Dogs, generated the same kind of violence. He's set a new standard. Believe it or not too, both these films are more violent than Pulp Fiction. The violence here is nasty, and bites. As a follow up to Dogs, Tarantino couldn't cut it more perfect, where as Tarantino films, there's a lot of similarities. As you know he retains some of the same names, surnames, dialogue quotes, and insignificant close up shots of coffee cups and ten minute commentary on things like songs, franchises, and how restaurants hardly get held up. The dialogue springs to life from the very go, as Slater plays an unbalanced Elvis idol, junk food eating, comic reading, trigger finger loner, Clarence Worley and he does it, in one of his best ever performances, where it's still up there, in spite of every other movie he's done. He's set up on a blind date with Alabama, an prostitute new to the game, who accidentally falls in love, creating a manifold of mayhem, when Clarence tries to square things with Drexl, where things of course, don't go as planned. When retrieving Alabama's case from the very dead Drexl, he takes the wrong one. It's full of Coke. So, Clarence and Alabama take off to L.A, to sell it with a contact friend of his, the mobsters and that in tow. Hopper's performance, as Worley's gentle cop father, was a nice change of fine role, where of course I loved Walken as the main mobster baddie, who doesn't take kindly to racial insults. The Q and A caravan torture scene was one of the best scenes in the flick. And the shootout in the motel room near the end, again as a similarity, all so reminded me of the Mexican standoff in Dogs. But this guys got style and knows how to make movies exciting, and this two hour pic is a perfect example of that. I was more for these films, than his later ones, which gets MA ratings instead of R's. True Romance is one of his most explosively violent films ever, and like I said earlier it bites."

","When Clarence Worley goes out on his birthday to watch a martial arts triple feature he doesn't expect it to be a life changing evening but it is. Here he bumps into Alabama, a beautiful young blonde, and they immediately hit it off; one thing leads to another and she stays the night. It turns out that their meeting wasn't chance, she was a call girl hired by his boss; he isn't upset though; in fact he falls in love with her and she falls for him; so much so they are married the next day. Clarence goes to collect her stuff but after a confrontation with her now ex-pimp he kills the man and picks up the wrong case. Instead of a case of clothes the newlyweds find themselves with half a million dollars' worth of uncut cocaine. Clarence has no idea how to sell it but a friend of a friend might have an idea so the two of them set off for LA; not knowing that the coke actually belonged to the Mafia and they want it back.<br/><br/>This action film brings together director Tony Scott and writer Quentin Tarantino; which leads to slick violent action and some snappy banter. The story isn't full of twists and turns but that isn't a bad thing; the only real question is 'will Clarence and Alabama get away with it or not?' and that is what it is all about. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette do a fine job in the lead roles and they are ably supported by some well-known actors in the secondary roles; these include Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Denis Hopper and Christopher Walken they may not be on the screen for long but they put in memorable performances.

","""If you gave me a million years to ponder, I would never have guessed that true romance and Detroit would ever go together.""<br/><br/>I would never have guessed that Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino would ever go together, but what a pleasant surprise this romantic crime thriller turned out to be. Thanks to a sharp and witty script and entertaining characters True Romance was extremely cool. The best way I can describe this film is to take Patricia Arquette's character's words and sound like a broken record: all I could think of while watching this film was Quentin Tarantino you are so cool; Tony Scott you are so cool; every single actor in this film you are so cool, True Romance you are so cool. I can't believe I had to wait 21 years to get around to watching this considering how big of a Quentin Tarantino fan I am (and I'm also a huge fan of Tony Scott's work in Man on Fire). Tarantino's energetic script and Scott's stylized direction blended perfectly in this near masterpiece. The cast is absolutely brilliant here and there are so many memorable characters and scenes in this film. I think I enjoyed this film more watching it for the first time now than if I would have seen it in 1993 considering there are so many familiar faces that I probably wouldn't have recognized back then. Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, and Chris Penn all have small but memorable roles. Oldman is barely recognizable playing a pimp with dreadlocks and a glass eye, but it is a unique performance. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette give the performance of their careers here; it's a shame Slater has been in so many terrible films in the past decade because his performance here was promising. Arquette is adorable as Alabama and I can't think of another sweeter performance than hers. There is so much energy and charm in this film that it's hard to resist. Like good wine, True Romance will probably age better over time considering I couldn't believe how much fun I was having watching an early 90's film for the first time. True Romance you are so cool!<br/><br/>Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) is a comic book store clerk who also happens to be a martial arts film buff. He plans to spend his birthday as he always does, at the movies, watching a triple feature of Sonny Chiba. What he doesn't expect is that he will find the love of his life there. While he is watching the film, a pretty woman walks into the theater spilling her popcorn all over him. She apologizes and introduces herself as Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love with each other after she opens up to him about her true identity. This leads them through a series of dangerous adventures involving pimps (Gary Oldman), the Sicilian mafia (Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini), drug dealers (Samuel L. Jackson), police officials (Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore), and Hollywood producers (Saul Rubinek, Bronson Pinchot). The film is full of energy and thrills as the two lovers face several obstacles along the way. Thankfully, Clarence seems to have a mentor on his side to guide him: an apparition of his idol Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer) who is sort of his conscious.<br/><br/>Even if you aren't a huge fan of Tarantino you could still enjoy True Romance for all the beloved actors in this film that weren't probably big Hollywood names back then. The film moves so quickly and the script is so energetic that It makes for a very entertaining watch. There are so many memorable scenes in this film, like the face off between Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, the group Mexican standoff, and the violent hotel scene involving Gandolfini and Arquette, but the real scene stealer would have to be the one in which Dennis Hopper, who plays Clarence's father, is ambushed by Christopher Walken and his gang and they have a not so friendly chat about Sicilians. It was a pure Tarantino moment and there are a lot of these great dialogues that allow for the film to have such a great pace and move along so nicely. The style and characters in this film make it such a unique experience and film lovers will enjoy the Hollywood satire as well. I am so glad I finally got to see this wild and romantic film. This is another reason why Tony Scott will be missed."

","I think this movie is amazing the dialogue believable and sometimes a bit funny. I may be biased but i'm a girl who loves killing spree movies. or crime movies in general. But this movie was more than that, it had everything! humour, romance (or course), murder, action and drug dealing. lets face it: Christian Slater is at his best when he's holding a gun. Think about it, Heathers was great (he killed a few people) a pretty much MADE Very bad Things enjoyable. and now we have this, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L Jackson, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken... what a cast! This is the best movie of Patricia Arquette's career, although i'm not well informed of her career but i have certainly seen some of her other films. this obliterates them all. is it over the top? yes is it accurate? no. is it supposed to be over the top and inaccurate? yes because it's a Tarentino movie. his films are amazing and thrilling, not accurate. who cares? just see it, this review hasn't been much help to you i'm sure but take my advice... see it. it almost makes you want to be criminal."
"aakash-karkare","6","1","2","10 November 2010"," Tarantino's early work
","It was great to see the humble beginnings of Quentin Tarantino. True Romance was the first script he sold. He wanted to direct it himself but no one was willing to give him the chance so Tony Scott got the job. I haven't heard much about Tony Scott but I think with Tarantino directing it would have been a better movie. It lacks that goofy feel that pervades through Tarantino's movies. The love for movies and just plain fun that is so integral to a Tarantino movie is missing in True Romance. Still, True Romance is a good movie. Stylistically influenced by Terence Malick's 1973 film Badlands it also stands as a movie in its own right. Who knew Tarantino was such a sap and could right halfway decent romantic dialogue? The voice-over narration and the background score is where it heavily borrows from Badlands and of course the serial killers on the run. But Alabama and Clarence aren't serial killers on the run. They are just people wanting to start over and try to live a better life, a happier life. But Tarantino will not let them do it easily. There are gangsters, Hollywood movie producers, old friends, drugs, policeman and guys with wires. More often than not Tarantino's movies have a variety of different plot that collide and all hell breaks loose. We witness this again and have a Mexican standoff. I guess that is where the problem lies. Tony Scott just directed the movie and I guess he didn't care so much about the characters and the Mexican standoff became very predictable in the last half hour of the movie and the action scenes were a little too cheesy.<br/><br/>The supporting cast features some of the biggest stars of today. Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini to name a few. Back then I guess they were just starting out. It is great fun to see a young James Gandolfini a couple of years before he played Tony Soprano doing what he does best. It's surprising how Michael Rappaport frequently plays the old friend of the lead character. He plays the same character in Beautiful Girls and some Schwarzenegger movie. I guess this was the movie that made him typecast in that role. The cast is decent. I never really like Christian Slater that much. His voice always irritates me but he's done a decent job in the film. The female decent is quite good actually. She is very pretty and plays her role with aplomb. True Romance is about well a True Romance. How two people meet and realize they are perfect for each other. It is about innocence and losing, grabbing chances and trying to struggle for something better. A better future. Because mostly things go wrong. But sometimes they go the other way too . . . . . . The other way too . . . . . . . . . . . ."

","""let's re-watch True Romance""...that's how I ended my IMDb comment of Quentin Tarantino's first, if never officially released and incomplete, film My Best Friend's Birthday. I remember finding True Romance on R4 DVD about two years ago under the title of ""La Fuga"", that means something like ""The Escape""(I remember being surprised after finding the R4 DVD, being like ""damn, how I was going to find it! That's why we don't f****** learn English!""), and I saw it immediately. After seeing, finally, My Best Friend's Birthday (the basis of the script of True Romance) I had desires to watch for the second time this film (pretty much back in 2007 I liked it but not really as much as any other film that I would like to watch more than once) and I finally did so last night. I think I liked it a bit more than the first time. <br/><br/>Christian Slater is Tarantino, I mean he is Clarence and he has the same name and some same dialogs of Tarantino's character in ""Birthday"" yet here Clarence is the one of the birthday (and his last name ain't Pool), then the one who is going to receive something that tastes like a peach from his best friend, or better said from his boss since apparently he has no friends. Clarence is a guy who will f*** all of his possibilities to make out with a nice chick by inviting her to a Kung Fu night at the cinema (""you wanna take me to a Kung Fu movie?"", asks the probable date of our hero and he f****** gains us more yet and certainly not her once he responds to her question, he goes like: ""three Kung Fu movies""), and who will be in his birthday, just like every year, having a good time at the cinema (fortunately the DVD of The Street Fighter is there on my shelf just waiting!) but then it happens, a dream comes true, it's paid but nevertheless it's a dream come true! Patricia Arquette for your birthday! And the dream goes on and on: true romance, wedding, love tattoo, Elvis but also lots of violence, the clerk of a comic book store is now a pimp f***** (you gotta love Gary Oldman in this one!), what love makes...<br/><br/>Anyway, for me with True Romance we don't have a film that has some parts that really stands out as the better ones. Is not like once they, Clarence and his wife, Patricia Arquette's character, Alabama, arrive to Los Angeles (that is like the second part of the film) the film is better or worse. Is more like, we have good and not so good moments during the whole film. Some of the performances are not quite convincing and some scenes should have been better (for instance the final confrontation between practically everybody at a hotel room could have been much more exciting and tense). Going back to the performances, well as you know we have a cast full of stars: from Dennis Hooper to Brad Pitt passing through Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Walken (and for the TV fans we have Tony Soprano, as a mafioso that will make us see another side of the peach Alabama, and Berta from Two and a Half Men. Oh and for us The Wire fans there's Paul Ben-Victor, aka: Spiros Vondas, also as a mafioso). Seeing the film in 2009 is of course seeing a film full of real Hollywood stars yet is not seeing a film full of truly great acting. All of them are okay and most of them have at least a memorable bit. Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper stands out for the part in which we confirm two things and both Brad Pitt (minor role but very funny and quite relevant even though he never goes out of his place) and Gary Oldman delivers a lot of fun... the rest, well like I said they all are okay (it's nice having Elvis, by the way).<br/><br/>And just like its performances for me True Romance is not a truly brilliant masterpiece (or a film I would like to watch again and again) but a fun ride nevertheless."

I know you know where they are, so tell me before I do some damage you won't walk away from."" <br/><br/>The above dialogue is said by Christopher Walken (Vincenzo Coccotti) in what , in my opinion is one of the greatest scenes in modern cinema.The verbal sparring between Walken and Hopper is one of the reasons why i love movies so much, so thanks guys! <br/><br/>It's been far too long since i watched this film , 15 years to be precise , and thanks to a little bit of self indulgence i have re equanted myself with the film that is ""True Romance"". <br/><br/>Clarence Worley is a well-meaning but socially unskilled comic-shop clerk whose idea of a big night out is catching a Sonny Chiba triple-feature at a downtown grindhouse. Clarence is celebrating his birthday in just such a manner when he meets a beautiful girl named Alabama , and it's love at first sight for both of them. <br/><br/>Clarence's enthusiasm isn't dampened much when he discovers Alabama is actually a prostitute who was paid by his boss to bump into him; she's only been in the business for a few days, and is more than eager to give up streetwalking to be with Clarence. However, Alabama is certain her pimp, Drexl ,will not be happy; he's an ill-mannered sort with mob connections and a fondness for violence.<br/><br/>Chivalrous Clarence offers to break the news to Drexl and collect her belongings, but he doesn't tell her he also plans to kill Drexl while he's there; a melee breaks out that leaves Drexl and his henchmen dead. Clarence grabs a suitcase that he thinks contains Alabama's clothes, but he discovers it instead holds five million dollars' worth of cocaine. The couple hits the road for California, planning to sell the dope and enjoy the good life in South America with the proceeds, but soon a group of very unhappy underworld characters are after them, as well as the police. <br/><br/>It's a rare thing that a group of actors are on top of their game , all at the same time in the same film but when it does happen , you get a film like True Romance. In my opinion Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are perfect in roles as Clarence and Alabama . Slater oozes charm and Arquette could make any man fall on love with her . I think that these two actors put in the best performances of their careers. ( i cant think of anything they have done since that is as good.) .<br/><br/>Christopher Walken makes the best ten minute cameo in a film i can think off. he's funny , yet menacing , which in turn has a knock on affect with Dennis Hopper. An actor i don't normally rate that highly , yet in the scenes with Walken he is amazing. <br/><br/>There are other good performance from Brad Pitt , Gary Oldman and what looks like a young Tony Soprano from James Gandolfini. <br/><br/>Having given all this praise i still think True Romance is far from being perfect. Quentin Tarantino's script is not a polished as we see in later films such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, yet it's undeniably Tarantino . Also i was a little disappointed with the final five minutes of the film especially after THAT monumental shoot up. It's all a bit too ""happy ever after"" for my liking. <br/><br/>Never the less this is a classic movie and has a special place in my movie watching heart. <br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"tonysx","8","1","2","24 November 2008"," Review
","True Romance is a film that is so well written that you almost forget about its faults and cliché action movie moments. I said almost. Christian Slater plays Clarence, an Elvis loving, Kunfu watching, comic bookstore nerd. He meets a hot blonde hooker named Alabama played by Patricia Arquette and they fall instantly in love. The film is written by Quentin Tarrantino, a former video store nerd himself, and his touch is unmistakable. The plot twists as Clarence kills Alabama's former pimp and steals his drugs causing a chain reaction of events involving the Detroit Mob and the police. It's amazing how many characters Tarrantino writes for in his films and how much depth and complexity they all have. The supporting players such as Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, and Chris Penn offer some of the most memorable moments in the film most notably a discussion on the origins of the Sicilians. The performances are all very solid especially Gary Oldman as the dread locked pimp, Drexl. He transforms into the character with such detail it's hard to recognize any noticeable traits of the actor on screen. So the acting is great and the script is incredible. Where could it go wrong? The direction of the film by Tony Scott for me brought the film down a few notches. The entire movie felt very claustrophobic. There were way to many close ups that had no motivation at all. In the final shootout he cuts from one close up to another of people shooting and guns. It's hard to tell who is who and where anybody is. Its action movie film-making and overdone. That scene is very similar to Tarrantino's first film Reservoir Dogs, which he directed. There is a shootout in one room where basically everyone dies. The difference is how it was shot. Tarrantino shows all the action in one static shot and it is far more effective. I still love this movie because the dialogue is so unique and the characters are so well rounded and performed so strongly. Its entertaining but I wonder what it could have been if Tarrantino also directed it."
"dairylanddon","10","1","2","8 October 2008"," 3 Good Things, 1 Bad Thing about... True Romance
","ONE GOOD THING: Quentin Tarantino's script is so vastly rich in its menagerie of characters and settings, that it becomes virtually epic in its scope. Gary Oldman's pimp, Brad Pitt's stoner, Samuel L. Jackson's drug dealer, Michael Rapaport's actor, and James Gandolfini's mob henchman are just a few of the ""minor characters"" who show up to steal the movie from its stars.<br/><br/>ANOTHER GOOD THING: Although many feel this film would have been better if directed by Tarantino, I would disagree. This film falls ideally on the Tony Scott directorial time line, somewhere between his glossy, almost over-polished earlier works (Top Gun and Days Of Thunder) and his rapid/frenetically edited later films (Domino and Man On Fire). Scott did, unfortunately, change the movie's original time structure, which was closer to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs; but that appears to be a reflection of ""Hollywood Money's"" readiness to accept change, more than Scott's eagerness to meddle.<br/><br/>EVEN ANOTHER GOOD THING: Howard Hawks once theorized that a good movie featured three good scenes and no bad ones. This film features, possibly, the greatest scene in modern movie history without a hero narrowly out running a fire ball, nuclear explosion, or ELECTRICITY!!! By placing Cristopher Walken and Dennis Hopper in a smokey house-trailer with Tarantino's dialogue, Tony Scott crafted the most watchable conversation in recent movie memory.<br/><br/>ONE BAD THING: Time has not been kind to the film's two lead stars (Slater and Arquette), who have now been reduced to primarily television actors. This, unfortunately, gives perspective viewers/renters/buyers the wrong impression of the movie and it's superior quality level.<br/><br/>OVERALL GRADE: A+"
"th-horn-1","8","1","2","7 July 2008"," The Ultimate Hollywood Fairytale
","The Ultimate Hollywood Fairytale<br/><br/>A script that was (party) written by Quentin Tarantino seems to be impossible to get on film. Nevertheless, Tony Scott took a shot and delivers the fairytale about ""the movies"". After some modifications in the storyline (which was originally connected to Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs), Scott and co. produced a true classic.<br/><br/>Leading character Clarence Worley (Slater) guides you during a wild ride, which contains literally sex, drugs and rock and roll. Basically, the story is about Clarence who meets Alabama (Arquette), a callgirl, falls in love with her and attempts to start a new life with her. However, there are some complications concerning her pimp, Drexl (Oldman). Clarence and Alabama end up stealing cocaine from Alabama's former pimp. The newlyweds decide to sell the drugs in Hollywood, finding themselves chased by the former owners of the ""half a mill"" worth of drugs. <br/><br/>True Romance is a film that should be regarded as the guide through Hollywood. The incredible strong cast (with appearances of, amongst others, Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini and Dennis Hopper) delivers the most comic, over exaggerated, varying and creative characters imaginable. Literally every part of this movie is overdone; from the Elvis impression by Kilmer, to the stereotype director Donowitz (Rubinek). Why then, do I rate this movie with 8 points out of the 10 possible? Simply because in this movie the interaction between the actors in every scene is just fantastic, which truly is the engine of the picture. Above that, the dialogues are brilliant, and you will find yourself laughing out loud on more than 1 occasion. Most of the times it is not a good sign when you are laughing out loud during serious dialogues in an action-filled motion picture. This is not the case for True Romance. Scott displays the action fairytale in which everything is possible. The choice of exaggerating every character and scene turns out to be the magic touch that turns this movie in to a classic. <br/><br/>Although the entire movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, the scene where Walken, playing a mobster, visits Clarence's father, Hopper, is the very best part of this picture. During this scene, which contains of more than 10 minutes of dialogue, you are blown away by the actors' performance, their lines, character and appearance. In this scene, Gandolfini also displays his talent of playing a fearless gangster. <br/><br/>True Romance provides an adrenaline rush, which does not stop until the very end. Referring to Gandolfini's character, watching this movie truly feels like tasting the snow at the end of the rainbow. Hollywood's rainbow, that is."

","True Romance (1993)- 4.5/5 <br/><br/>Possible Spoilers.<br/><br/>One more impressive outing from the writing of Quentin Tarantino and a long list of credible actors. The dialog and performances really make the film entertaining and engaging. The storyline involves movie geek Clarence Worley (Slater) who meets a hooker named Alabama (Arquette) and falls in love with her. Clarence has trouble with her pimp, Drexl (Oldman), but ends up killing him after a fight. Instead of picking up Alabama's belongings at Drexl's apartment, Clarence picks up a briefcase filled with half a million dollars worth of cocaine by accident. The two plan to travel to Los Angeles to sell all of it and move away with the money, but a group of mobsters and the LAPD are both informed on the situation and try to reclaim it. Slater, who I don't particularly care for, does his best here and I was not let down with his performance. Tarantino's script is just great - using far more talk rather than violence to make the movie work. The cameos and supporting cast do very well in their roles, most notably Walken and Pitt. Tony Scott's direction is pretty impressive, as he provides us with a film far superior than the list of mediocre flicks the director has made. Maybe not one of the top films from the year, but definitely enjoyable and the best movie by Tony Scott.<br/><br/>Cast: Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Michael Rapaport, Gary Oldman, Bronson Pinchot, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Saul Rubinek, Val Kilmer, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, James Gandolfini, Samuel L.

","SPOILER ALERT Don't READ IF YOU Haven't SEEN THE MOVIE I love this movie so much. It's so outrageous in terms of violence, but yet almost EVERY thing the movie touches on could be real, or at least each character is too vague in their line of work for you to say its fake/real (Hollywood producer, pimp, mafioso, comic book guy, prostitute, actor, and on and on). I've watched this movie a 100 times, and the thing that really, really gets me is the aftermath of the final shoot-out. Did anyone notice that almost every character in the shoot-out, is NOT a main character, but was fleshed out like a main character? You got the Hollywood bodyguard screaming that he hates cops, the black cop who does that great acting in that 5 second scene 'he shot me', the Hollywood bodyguard screaming ""I need an ambulance, get me an ambulance"", and Chris Penn instead giving him street justice ""naw man this is for _____"", Alabaman shooting Chris Penn. This movie is so machismo and over the top violent I couldn't help but burst out laughing when Chris Penn says to his partner about the guy hiding with a gun on the other side of the room, ""hey is that guy Italian?"" as if he's ascertaining what has taken place, but then follows up with ""Come out you ***** guano!"" I literally thought that these characters at the end could have their own entire movie, but it was so funny that the director thought to flesh them out that much."

","Here's a movie that seems to contain something for everybody..sex, romance, violence, tension, humor, great directing and some of your all-time favorite actors. I wouldn't quite go as far as some of the reviewers here who wrote that it's the greatest movie of all time and it's so unpredictable. On both counts, it's not. I found it very predictable, but with the acting so good and the movie so fast paced...it didn't matter. I particularly loved Patricia Arquette. She was terrific and very hot and sexy. All I want to know is..where has she been hiding all these years? It seems that her resume is short and unimpressive. She deserves better. And just to watch James (Tony Soprano) Gandolfini do his violent thing, was worth the price of admission in itself. True Romance is miles ahead of Pulp Fiction. The characters here are so believable and sympathetic. I would compare it more to Bonnie & Clyde. So I recommend it highly for its acting, directing, and story line. But don't eat your dinner just before you watch the movie."

","I first decided i wanted to see this film after becoming completely obsessed with Quentin Tarantino. Pulp Fiction is my favourite film ever and i also loved Kill Bill (1 and 2), Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown, so i wanted to see true romance, which Tarantino wrote the script for.To be honest i wasn't sure what to expect, as the name seems to suggest a romantic comedy of sorts, but this definitely not a chick flick. From the very beginning you can see the 'tarantino-ness' of the film, the coolness, the pop culture references, the clever, quote-able dialogue, and although it lacks the visual flair of the films he has directed, this is still top notch entertainment. The main thing that hit me was the way i felt at the end of it. You know a film is good when u are still thinking about it long after the end credits have rolled, and the thing i couldn't get out of my mind was the line 'You're so cool'. you have to see it to understand, but i'd recommend this to anybody; a clever, entertaining, iconic film that has the 'cool factor' all the way through.

Maybe someday someone will write a movie that has Hopper,Walken,Oldman,Guy Pierce, Christian Bale,Michael Caine,Gene Hackman,and Tommy Lee Jones. Now that would be a cast. Batman Begins did have four of the above. And fans of the film P.C.U. know that Caine and Hackman appeared in A BRIDGE TOO FAR together, creating the basis for a character's doctoral thesis.

You have to have pulled some crazy s*** in your life to totally appreciate this movie, but it is awesome."" That's so damn true, it's not funny. If you have a little history of drug dealing, or a little bitty piece of violence in your background, and have ever loved someone else so inherently that you would live and die for that person, you have to be six feet under to not be moved by this movie. Much love to everyone involved in this project, and to all those who ever really felt this movie, I'm buying the first 7 rounds. P.S. Hans Zimmer is a money-whore now, but this is the best score he ever did. It's been borrowed (I know it wasn't original) WAY too many times."
"general_jihad","10","1","2","2 November 2006"," If you don't like this movie, you are an idiot!
","Tony Scott may be Quentin Tarrantion's long lost brother. Granted, the script was written by Tarrantino, and used a few people that would eventually wind up in his films, but the look and feel of this movie is very reminiscent of a Quentin film. Brad Pitt, back when he was still a good actor, nails the pot smoking, looser roommate. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make a good couple, although flawed in their life choices at times. But that makes for great cinema. The one thing that can kill or make a movie is a large cast. If the formula is followed to closely, the movie will seem like endless bit parts taped together out of order. If done properly, the movie seamlessly intertwines the lives of unrelated characters, bringing them together in ways they would normally never experience. This is True Romance. A series of events brings together a long cast of great characters and stories. In the end, you will be happy and sad for the ones that made it, and the ones that didn't.<br/><br/>This is one of those films with characters that aren't necessarily good or bad, but shades of both at times. And who cares, it's great, and more importantly, it works. This is the type of film that should be taught in film class. Thankfully, it is not, because we would have tons of copies, and work like this isn't easily duplicated."

He has a small part in this movie but he does bring humor to his role. Gary Oldman is truly creepy as a pimp and really makes you not like him at all. This is a movie that shows what happens when people meet the right person for them, and that you can forget about your past and become a happier person.

Just for clarity's sake, Clarence went to her pimp after they get married to retrieve her clothes and tell the pimp that Alabama was quitting as a call girl. Drexel, the pimp (played by Gary Oldman, so you have to love that), listens to Clarence telling him that he married Alabama and starts beating the hell out of him. Clarence pulls his gun and shoots almost everyone in the small apartment. A girl handed him a suitcase, but it was filled with cocaine. <br/><br/>When he gets back from the shootout, they realize the mistake, and simply take advantage of the situation.

A cast of fine actors with the supporting cast including Christopher Walken and Gary Oldman performing as well as Slater and Arquette. It is the scenes which include their characters which really make the film so good, I thought the Drexell scene was very funny. The Tarantino influence is obvious and it would have possibly been even better directed by him. There was less violence than I expected but this was necessary to understand the characters such as the Arquette/Gandolfini scene. This is definitely a film I will watch again and again."

","Tony Scott's ""True Romance"" (1994) is a cocktail mixture of action, drugs, sex and violence rollicking with the heedless enthusiasm of a newborn puppy in a Christmas box. The plot is a miasma of over-the-top situations centering on a comic store clerk and a call girl who fall in love and set about making their mark in the world. The murder of the call girl's pimp and the re-appropriation of his drug stash allow this dynamic duo to attain their dreams, but not without some bumps along the way.<br/><br/>Scripted by Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary, the film exists in a high-octane and bullet-riddled universe where paper-thin characters thrive with no sense of nagging morality or long term purpose. The viewer never knows what Clarence (Slater) or Alabama (Arquette) want to be, other than a mad dog killer and a gorgeous hooker, or even what they want to do, other than have sex in phone booths and watch Kung Fu movies. In fact, their long-term goal of ""getting far, far away"" throughout the film is revealed as spending money, making love and lying around on tropical beaches. Does this make the film not worth seeing? No: Quite the opposite.<br/><br/>Once the viewer realizes he is not watching a realistic film but instead a film written for twenty-something college dorm inhabitants, the film can be enjoyed for what it is: an entertaining action movie with lots of crazy dialog, fast-paced antics and bloody situations.<br/><br/>The two stars, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, are ideally cast for their roles. Slater effortlessly conveys the bored-out-of-his-mind young man who hasn't grown up and spends his time clerking at a comic book store. As the peppy hooker, Arquette's performance encapsulates the Playboy nymph of a male teendom's dreams: the breezy gal you hope would crash at your pad for a week in Daisy Duke Shorts and halter tops.<br/><br/>The best performances in the film are by Val Kilmer, unrecognizable as the imaginary Elvis, and Brad Pitt, who bumbles along as the stoned-beyond-all-reason roommate that is all too eager to give directions. Dennis Hopper gives a mostly by-the-numbers performance with the exception of a tense yet hilarious speech delivery on Sicilian genetics. Christopher Walken instantly tops the speech and calmly egresses with his usual cool. The icing on the cake is the talented Gary Oldman as a psychotic drug-dealing wacko-path who rants about White Boy Day and is the epitome of urban mayhem.<br/><br/>If you are bored on a Saturday night then I suggest you rent ""True Romance"" and let the chaotic genius of Tarantino Land wash over you.<br/><br/>**** (Four) out of ***** (Five) stars"

"MonteCarloMan","8","1","2","23 August 2005"," A dazzling film about pop culture...
","Before there was Pulp Fiction, there was True Romance, which continued writer Quentin Tarantino's obsession with pop culture. Arguably his best film to date. He didn't direct this movie, Tony Scott did, which notably spares the viewer those awful back and forth scene sequences typical in Tarantino directed films. Major kudos are in order for the casting director; who featured one of the finest casts in movie history, although its standard formula in Tarantino films. True Romance basically puts together a story of true love between two people who won't let any obstacle get in their way, no matter how dire the situation becomes. Its bold and dynamic. Christian Slater is dynamite in the lead role, you can tell he had a lot of fun playing his character. Val Kilmer plays ""Angelic Elvis"" who provides a small dose of good conscience on Slater's shoulder, and Patricia Arquette co-stars as the love of his life. Has all the familiar faces: Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Victor Argo, among others. The confrontation scene between Hopper and Walken is a must-see highlight! The gunfight at the end and the prelude that leads up to it is non-stop drama and excitement. Movie is worth multiple looks, if not for just the memorable scenes by themselves."
"smatysia","8","1","2","7 June 2005"," Check it out
","One can easily see the Tarantino influence in this film, with the stylized violence, the amoral/heroic characters, and the fixation on using the word ""nigger."" It's a pretty good script, but I think taking out of linear time, ""Pulp Fiction""-style would have been a mistake. The cast collected for this film was awesome. Samuel L. Jackson in a very small part, almost a cameo. Dennis Hopper was tremendous in his last scene, as was Christopher Walken. Even James Gandolfini, who would have been relatively unknown then, put in a very good turn. Much of the rest of the supporting cast was also excellent, with the possible exception of Gary Oldman, who went just a little far over the top. Now, Christain Slater is a pretty good actor, and I've enjoyed some of his stuff. For that matter I enjoyed this one. But with these giants in the cast, Slater fairly obviously comes up short. And mention must be made of Patricia Arquette, who more or less stole the show. Her portrayal of Alabama's defiance in the scene with Gandolfini should be a cinematic classic. If you can stand the violence and profanity, I recommend checking this one out."
"little_miss_scarlet","10","1","2","14 March 2005"," Tony Scott's greatest achievement to date!
","True Romance is just one of those movies that has a knack of representing all the negative points about society in the most beautiful way. I mean who would have thought murder would lead to being the most romantic thing in the world? I suppose the thing I love the most about this movie is its ability to make you happy and give you that essential feel good factor. I love how Christian Slater was put in the leading role - I don't think I could imagine anyone else with so much energy and charisma. Its also refreshing to see him in a leading role as he is usually a supporting character.<br/><br/>And as for the supporting cast - so many amazing cinematic achievements in one film! Christopher Walken is scarier than I've seen him for like, well, ever! Dennis Hopper's last speech is actually beautiful. Val Kilmer pops up there somewhere too - but I'm not spoiling that for you. And just what was Brad Pitt thinking? Obviously he was still in his Kalifornia role when he signed up for the ride. Enjoy my 4th favorite film of all time"
"GCMILLER","10","1","2","18 January 2005"," Oh my gosh, the perfect film??
","Pulp Fiction remains my favourite film and is the bench mark that i judge all other films against ever but when you realise that the format for True Romance was the same and that it was Tony Scott who changed it to a linear format,then this could have been the perfect film. Having said that, it still remains one of the few films that i could watch at least once a week forever.Listening to QTs commentary on the 2 disc set, and the problems he had getting the film off the ground,it seems inconceivable that this film very nearly slipped away.Every time i watch this film, i always wish that i hadn't seen it and that this was the first time!! I rate it that highly.The razor sharp, snappy trademark QT dialogue, the music, the characters and the attention given to establish each one,the intricate build up to the final Mexican stand off,the music, even the ending(and here you have a choice!)Just reading the list of actors involved, Hopper,Jackson, Walken,Pitt, Kilmer, Slater,Arquette,(yeah, cistern lids don't break when you belt someone over the head with them! )Sizemore, Penn (sadly missed),etc says quality. And this,a first screen play?? A hidden gem, a cult movie?Shout it from the rooftops, this film is that good, and the whole world needs to know. It would be perfect if the deleted scenes could be inserted into their true position.This film never got the credit it deserved and still remains a classic amongst film goers who know their stuff. I only wish that this had been QTs first girlfriend,the one that he married!"
"Ben_Cheshire","8","1","2","27 June 2004"," Exciting, sexy crime thriller with top-notch Tarantino script.
","Clarence: I always said, if I had to f*ck a guy... I mean had to, if my life depended on it... I'd f*ck Elvis. <br/><br/>Exciting, sexy, enjoyable crime thriller with great and great-looking stars is one of my favourite Tarantino scripts. Sparkling pop-culture dialogue, great characters, great scenes (check the one between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman's gem of a scene, Brad Pitt's just lying there on the couch, the classic movie theatre scene where Clarence and Alabama meet, followed by the just as classic diner scene).<br/><br/>Has a great sense of humour - the pervasive joke is every reaction you think Alabama will have to the various stupid things Clarence does, she has the opposite. Violence is true romance - sick? Perhaps. Its the one thing Tony Scott and Tarantino agree on: unnecessary violence is not cheap exploitation, its entertainment. I personally think the shock effects Tarantino uses to structure his screenplays are quite gimmicky and undergraduate. Quality does not always mean sudden shifts of sex and violence. Surprise is not always good. I could have done without the hotel room scene, for example, where Alabama has a near-deadly encounter with a hit-man. One of the most violent things i've ever seen.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, if you skip these scenes, its a compulsively enjoyable ride, and one of Tony Scott's least offensive films (Top Gun is sheer obnoxiousness today).<br/><br/>8/10"
"akpiggott","9","1","2","23 June 2004"," Tarantino's Fairy Tale
","I recently read Tarantino's original screenplay to ""True Romance"". Apart from the change in narrative structure (non-chronological), it hints to a bleaker, grittier urban drama, with a tragedy ending. It would be very interesting to see the final film in Tarantino's vision.<br/><br/>Tony Scott's sugar-coated adaptation works wonders though. It was made very clear in the script that the relationship between the two leads was very strong. Scott took this unison and gave the film a fairy-tale tone. The villains in the film are very colourful, contributing to the feel that Scott has established. Hans Zimmer's score does nothing better, than to enforce this vision.<br/><br/>The cast is one of the most impressive line-ups I've ever seen. Much of the film rests on the shoulders of Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, both characters come off very likable with clear, clean, simple motives. These are career performances. Dennis Hopper gives good in his limited screen-time as Christian's ex-cop, ex-alcoholic father. It is in his time shared with Christopher Walken (being a one-scene wonder, like in ""Pulp Fiction""), that he comes off at his best. The Sicilian scene is Walken's most intense since ""Deer Hunter"". Gary Oldman also gives another deliciously evil and memorable performance, the man is a chameleon, he is yet to unimpress me.<br/><br/>But one of my favourite things about the cast is seeing then-relative-unknowns Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini in small, but memorable roles. A real shame that Jackson's performance was cut down heavily from the script, some of the dialogue in his one scene was very amusing, if maybe a little offensive to some.<br/><br/>""True Romance"" is a brilliant crime drama, and a perfect (if phased) introduction to Tarantino's work, it is probably the most accessible film he's penned. People will always ponder over whether or not Tarantino's directorial version would have been better, but they can always rest-assure that Scott has given a wonderful adaptation, supported by a very strong cast. It could have been much, much worse. 9/10"
"Weezerman","8","1","2","15 June 2004"," Amazing Movie, but not like Tarantino's others.
","I'm a fanatic of Quentin Tarantino's work, and when I saw True Romance, his name was painted (or should I say splattered?) all over it. He wrote the screenplay, and I thought it was great. But one thing did bother me. I like Tony Scott's style and frenetic camera changes, but this isn't the movie to do it in. This is the type of film that needed to be seen in a non-linear look (ala Reservoir Dogs), in order to get its full understanding.<br/><br/>Not to bang on Scott's shot.....It's kind of mixed for me. I love Tarantino's awesome storytelling techniques, but I also Love Tony Scott's action-esque directing. If both had been mixed, this movie could have been so much more.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong on this: This is by far one of my top 20 favorite movies of all-time, but it seemed a bit too run-of-the-mill in direction. But all its flaws are healed by an amazing script, and it's so farfetched that it's fun to watch.<br/><br/>It's good to see a movie once in a while that says ""Screw oscar winning titles, and give me a movie the action fan dreams of"". This movie was great, and I really enjoyed it, but not a latch-on title like Tarantino's masterpiece, Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>
By the way, I saw this movie on its 1997 DVD release. I'm currently in the looking for True Romance's Special 2-Disc Edition, and if the extras are good, this may be a movie I'll be talking about for a LOOOONG time.<br/><br/>
Overall: **** out of *****"

He plays Lee Donowitz, a corrupt Hollywood movie producer with criminal tendencies. <br/><br/>It's tempting to speculate that the part was based on an actual person (quite possible in La La Land). Whatever the origin, Rubinek portrays the character with enormous skill - sleazy, charming, camp, vulnerable and menacing all at once.

It's hard not to detect at least an element of wish fulfillment in this tale of a lonely, Elvis-obsessed comic-book shop clerk who finds love with a beautiful call-girl.<br/><br/>While not among his best, the script by Tarantino still amuses with plenty of his usual banter about movies, comics and other aspects of popular culture.  The direction, by Tony Scott is slick and flashy, and the parts are well-played by a great cast (Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt. Samuel L Jackson and Christopher Walken are among the great actors with cameos in this film).<br/><br/>One of the main problems of the film is that it is very derivative (particularly of the 1973 Terrence Malick film ""Badlands"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"").

","Tarrentino's films all give the impression of being segments or episodes in an all encompassing interelated saga. That's probably more of a shot than a compliment however. The Q to me has always meant Quirk, not much else. True Romance has a couple of truly fabulous scenes, but overall, the movie only rates as good. Too much is variations on themes he explores in previous or subsequent stuff, and the repetiveness to me is boring. Slater in lieu of his usual Jack Nicholson impression, instead here, gives us Harvey Keitel (I think). The accent he employs wanders in and out of his performance, and invokes cringes at points. The rest of the cast is terrific, and the film warrants a viewing just to see all of these huge performers working together in one project.

"great_sphinx_42","7","1","2","15 March 2001"," With Plenty to Praise and Little to Deride, 'TR' is a Worthy Film
","It's interesting to note that this same screenplay spawned 'Natural Born Killers' the year after 'True Romance' was released. I love that movie to pieces and it has a lot more to say than this one, but that should not be taken as an affront to an enjoyable film- which is exactly what 'True Romance' is. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are Clarence and Alabama Worley, two relative innocents- a comic-book store clerk and a call girl- who fall in love after his boss hires her to sleep with him. He develops an instant hatred for her pimp, so he puts a gun in his sock and goes to visit. Her pimp is Drexl, played by Gary Oldman as a half frighteningly realistic and half laughable 'wigger'. A shootout commences, from which Clarence flees with a suitcase filled not with Alabama's things as he had though, but with cocaine. He realizes he and Alabama could definately use the kind of money that can be made off selling it, so they skip town and head to L.A. after briefly visiting his dad. From there they get mixed up with a famous actor named Elliott, an aspiring one named Dick, Dick's pothead couch potato roommate, Floyd, and a whole gallery of folks who want them dead. 'True Romance' ends well but goes at a fast clip and feels shorter than what it is- for one thing, the time is never taken to develop the sense of inevitability of love between Clarence and Alabama that was created between Mickey and Mallory Knox. Nonetheless, Christian Slater is enjoyable as a guy who knows he's in over his head but is trying to do his best in the situation, and Patricia Arquette has one of her best roles in that guy's cute, not-as-dumb-as-she-seems wife. Her scene with the goon sent to collect the cocaine from their hotel room is both nauseating (who wants to see our heroine get her face bashed in?) and terrific, (how often do you get to see a woman win a brawl this nasty in the movies?) and from it and her ending voice-over, you know that this woman is a survivor through and through. Fun, well-done, and fast-paced, 'True Romance' is a worthy companion film to 'NBK' or, indeed, just about any of the other movies Tarantino has scripted."

I can only accept good comments on this movie, because it is possible to find out several positive aspects we look for when watching a movie... You can smile, cry, learn, be tense, be happy... Just to highlight some good moments, I would briefly describe the scene of the conversation between Dennis Hopper (Christian's father) and Christopher Walken (gangster)when you can learn about history of South Europe civilization and in the same time can realize the very romantic and funny way found by Dennis to face his death (He gave to Christopher the explanation of South Italians have dark hairs). Also, how deep can go a dream of a person who has a pure love by his fan, and knew all the time how to use this dream to take him into the real world (This is Christian love by Elvis - his mentor all the time). This is a example of a movie you can really have a good fun!!! Congratulations to Tony Scott and Quentin as well."
"moviegoer99","Null","1","2","15 April 2004"," One of the all time greats....
","The man, the myth, the legend:  Quentin Tarantino....brings us..... The man, the myth, the legend:  Christopher Walken....<br/><br/>in one of the greatest scenes in any movie...ever.  This film has it all..great cast, great writing, great photography the whole nine yards.  I am not a Christian Slater fan, i feel that he can not carry a movie on his own, but because of the superb cast...he doesn't need to.  Even though many of the bigger name stars have roles that are really just cameos (Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Tom Sizemore), the film still has a massive entertainment value.  My only wish was that Tarantino himself could have helmed the film (But being that it was his first script, and at the time he hadn't directed a film, I understand.)  Tony Scott can do action, perfect examples are the Last Boyscout (a genre classic), Enemy of the State, and Crimson Tide.<br/><br/>This film also has some newcomers that will later become freakin' HUGE! Brad Pitt (in one his finer performances in my opinion).  And Samuel L Jackson (SHAFT himself).  But one person that I just can't see how he got in this movie but turned a good performance was Bronson Pinchot (Balki from ""Perfect Strangers""(TV)). I can imagine the studio meeting on that one...let's get a lovable TV star and make him a foul mouthed naive coke-head!? Inspired casting indeed.  <br/><br/>If you watch Tarantino's film in order (1) True Romance, (2)Reservoir Dogs, (3) Pulp Fiction, (4)Jackie Brown, (5) Kill Bill vol. 1.  You can see that True Romance isn't stylistically the same due to direction, but you can see the evolution of the poet that is Tarantino.<br/><br/>10/10!"
"cofemug","7","1","2","3 September 2000"," Great, sappy, romantic movie
","This movie is so awesome.  It is one of the very few romantic movies that I love.  Generally, I refuse to see movie such as City of Angels, You've Got Mail, and I hated Sleepless in Seattle and Pretty Woman.  But, this movie was the second best romantic and cliched movie I have seen.  The best was Bonnie and Clyde, and that was probably original.<br/><br/>*****SPOILERS*****SPOILERS***** Plot: Semi-sappy plot that would generally make me gag.  Guy and Prostitute fall in love.  Guy kills pimp, and runs with cocaine stash.  They plan on selling it to big producer for money to escape.  It was mentioned before that we should hate them for being drug dealers, and I think that the general public should not like it, but who would do crazy things for a little thing called love?  Every single action in the movie is done out of love and dedication.  Their ultimate goal is to run away and have a family.<br/><br/>Acting:  Decent.  Slater was Slater.  However, in this movie, he was somewhat toned down from his normal Nicholson-esque acting, and you could see some emotion.  You could tell that the couple were truly in love, and it works really well.  The best roles were the secondary characters (although, Arquette is, as mostly, superb).  Brad Pitt as a pothead, Walken as a drug lord, Val Kilmer as Elvis, Gary Oldman as a pimp.  All of these roles are just perfect.<br/><br/>The whole movie is done with enough finesse that you almost, but not quite, forget about all of the cliches in the movie.  The violence is over-the-top, almost no consequences in the movie, and it is almost a fantasy world, like how people feel when in love for the first time.  Highly recommended to all romantic types as a cross-over introduction to the violent cinema, and to all violent cinema lovers as a intro to romantic movies (it may not fully change you however.<br/><br/>9/10"

","True Romance is a movie that has very little faults. It is also one of those movies that require viewing more than once before the full impact hits you. Its the story of a dorky southern boy, who falls in love with a prostitute his boss hired for him on his birthday. From that description, the movie sounds sleazy and maybe even dumb. However, it is far from it. As the movie moves along, things get more and more involved in complicated for the star crossed lovers. Its an action violent romance which has one of the most powerful scenes in cinematic history. If your not familiar with it, its because its a cult classic, and will always remain a favorite of 90's rockers and prepubescent teenagers."

"QwikBall","Null","1","2","13 August 1999"," True Romance as an updated Badlands?
","I find that True Romance intersects with Terence Malick's Badlands in a few interesting ways - perhaps QT is responding to Malick's classic by copying some stylistic devices.  Both films are capable of being lumped together under the ""road movie"" subgenre of the crime film, so it's not too inconceivable that Tarantino and Scott had Bad Lands on their minds while making Romance.  Both films open and close with a voice-over by the female lead and in both voice-overs, the character establishes herself initially as a rather inexperienced person, one who didn't expect to be involved in the action to follow.  In Badlands, Kit murders Holly's father and thus begins their crime spree; in Romance, Clarence kills Drexel, the closest thing to a father-figure that Alabama has and likewise makes it necessary for the couple to run from the law.  Also, the two films' incidental music is too similar to be a coincidence."

","This is without a doubt my favourite film I've ever seen. It has an original story, although it does nick stuff from every lovers on the run movie ever made, and I personally think that the acting is superb, pariculary from Dennis Hopper, and surprisingly Christian Slater. There are a number of characters in this film that although they are bad at times (Gary Oldmans pimp 'Drexel' for example), you actually start to like them.<br/><br/>The scrpit is very funny as well, although maybe a little corny at times. There are also a number of what I would say 'classic scenes. Two of them being the brutal beating of Alabama in the motel room, which shows an effective use for a toilet seat. And probeably best of all where Dennis Hopper gives his history lesson to Christopher Walkens mob leader about the origin of the Sicilian blood line, concerning a lot of bed hopping involving black people. This scene is both intense and funny, which will keep you giggling on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Overall, this films deserves to be seen by anyone who likes their films funny, and very violent. try to see it in widescreen if you can, and hopefully the directors cut, which has a lot more of the violence in it.

There is an all star cast lead by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette in their career best performances. Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, Speed) and Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter, Dogs Of War) eat up their 10 minutes of screen time in the greatest psychological confrontation in movie history. Val Kilmer (Top Secret), Chris Penn (Reservoir Dogs), Brad Pitt (12 Monkeys, Interveiw With A Vampire), Samuel L Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Jurassic Park), Michael Rappaport (Higher Learning), Tom Sizemore (Natural Born Killers), Gary Oldman (The Professional) and Bronson Pinchot all throw out some of the best performances in their careers into tiny parts. A simply stuuning Mexican stand-off and shoot out towards the end is one of the best gun fights in movie history. Great writing produces many, many memorable lines. Confrontations between Christian Slater and Gary Oldman, Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini, and Brad Pitt vs anybody produce classic scene after classic scene. A great soundtrack, great story, and great cinematography boost this movie even higher. Plus trademark Tarantino style pop-culture references give it even more appeal. This movie is awesome.

","This is one of the few films where the IMDB average is about right, at 7.5/10. It maybe fractionally overated but not by much. Had the potential though to be better & much of it's popularity is probably due to the great cast and also the director (who I personally don't rate, but everybody else seems to) rather than the plot.<br/><br/>Spoilers<br/><br/>True Romance lost marks because the film never actually covered that much ground & took a little long to get to the shootout which was basically the core of the film. The shoot out itself was also a slight farce as they tend to be when more than 2 are parties involved. Also, though the swearing was sometimes justified, half of the F-words that came out of Slater's mouth were completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>For those 3 criticisms I'd have it at 7/10, still fairly good & excellent acting, from, just about everybody really.<br/><br/>Two side issues. Was it me or did the Christopher Walkern, Sicillian character just disappear after the scene with Dennis Hopper & if so, why?<br/><br/>It also never ceases to amaze me how people any scene, of any of these type of gangster related films (Snatch, Pulp Fiction, Lock Stock, Goodfellas etc) funny in any way. I'm not saying they're not good. They are, well the last 2 anyway, are brilliant, but not because they make me laugh. It doesn't matter what way people getting shot is jazzed up, I fail to see where the laughs are. Thankfully though this doesn't lessen my enjoyment at all, as I never expect to be in hysterics."

Dennis Hopper has never been much of an actor but gives a good performance. Why he waited until this piece of trash before delivering the goods is anyone's guess.<br/><br/>Tony Scott has his photographer shoot with the usual irritating filters, back lighting and blacked out faces presumably because Jeffrey Kimball felt that if you have one photographic idea in fifteen years it's got to be worth repeating."

Whatever the origin, Rubinek portrays the character with enormous skill - sleazy, charming, camp, vulnerable and menacing all at once.

"Maladjusted_1","6","1","3","12 July 2015"," Whilst 'True Romance' has the trappings of a Tarantino film, it lacks cohesion and substance.
","'True Romance' is instantly recognisable as a Tarantino film, although it is directed by Tony Scott, with the writing credits attributed to Tarantino. The cast is promising, and the opening credits intrigued me with the promise of performances by Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini and a host of other acclaimed actors. The lead roles are played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, as a couple of cinema-goers who stumble upon one another and inadvertently fall in love. The plot soon acquires an action- thriller narrative as drugs, pimps and gangsters infringe on the couple's peace. Arquette handles her role well and plays some scenes excellently, but I'm not so sure about the casting of Slater: I think there was substantially better talent on-hand for 'True Romance', and I have to say that I didn't enjoy Slater's performance very much at all. One of the most talked about scenes of Scott's film seems to be the one between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, perhaps the two most distinguished actors in the film (at this point). The scene is certainly decent, but doesn't really seem integral to the wider story. Many of the other scenes take a very Tarantino-esque approach: heated arguments are made between characters, followed by a bloody shootout. I think that this is milked somewhat in 'True Romance', and I thought that a lot more restraint could have been shown. The whole film seems like a proto-'Pulp Fiction', but with less interesting characters and developments. I also noticed that by the 45-minute mark, every character in Scott's film annoyed me for a different reason. The whole production is as inexplicable as 'No Country for Old Men' and as desperate as '25th Hour', but lacks the strong characters and narratives that defined both of these superior drugs-themed films."

","True Romance has it all. Likable central characters, over the top 'ultra' violence, dark humour, memorable quotes, poetic monologues, surrealism and above all else, incredible performances from a cast with an immense array of talent. <br/><br/>The script, which was originally a 500 page screenplay that was reportedly a hybrid of Natural Born Killers and True Romance, is Tarantino at his very best. The execution is even better. The film is a 2 hour whirlwind that never settles, keeps throwing plot twists at you and most importantly, never takes itself too seriously. <br/><br/>The supporting cast are the force that drives this movie and the protagonists (Slater and Arquette) are completely lovable. Their 'love at first sight' storyline is completely absurd but in a strange way believable. You really buy into their relationship and want to see their romance blossom. <br/><br/>As for set pieces, the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is just phenomenal. I won't give too much away but it's clear that Tarantino has always had a strange, sometimes disturbing obsession with the word 'nigger'. The delivery of both Hopper and Walken's dialogues is a an absolute masterclass. <br/><br/>We also see Gary Oldman showing exactly why he is one of the best actors of the past 2 decades. Casting him as a dread-locked rasta is both surprising and stunning in equal measure. He is, as always, completely believable. Comparing his performance in this with say, The Dark Knight Rises (which is a very understated and underrated performance) shows this actors amazing range of diversity. I have to admit, I thought his part was slightly underwritten. <br/><br/>Add to that Val Kilmer playing 'The King', Chris Penn playing a cop, a pre-sopranos Gandolfini as a hit-man, Brad Pitt as a mindless stoner and you have one of the greatest casts assembled in recent years. With some brilliantly ad-libbed scenes, industry 'in-jokes' and a thrilling climax, this is a must see piece of perfection."
"Desertman84","9","1","3","29 December 2011"," Tarantino's Early Script
","Quentin Tarantino scripted this wild and wooly blend of action and dark comedy,True Romance, which reached theaters a year before his breakthrough hit Pulp Fiction.True Romance is a film written by Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. The film features Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette with an ensemble cast consisting of Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Corrigan, James Gandolfini and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Clarence Worley is a well-meaning but socially unskilled comic-shop clerk whose idea of a big night out is catching a Sonny Chiba triple- feature at a downtown grindhouse. Clarence is celebrating his birthday in just such a manner when he meets a beautiful girl named Alabama, and it's love at first sight for both of them. Clarence's enthusiasm isn't dampened much when he discovers Alabama is actually a prostitute who was paid by his boss to bump into him; she's only been in the business for a few days, and is more than eager to give up streetwalking to be with Clarence. However, Alabama is certain her pimp, Drexl, will not be happy; he's an ill-mannered sort with mob connections and a fondness for violence. Chivalrous Clarence offers to break the news to Drexl and collect her belongings, but he doesn't tell her he also plans to kill Drexl while he's there; a melee breaks out that leaves Drexl and his henchmen dead. Clarence grabs a suitcase that he thinks contains Alabama's clothes, but he discovers it instead holds five million dollars' worth of cocaine. The couple hits the road for California, planning to sell the dope and enjoy the good life in South America with the proceeds, but soon a group of very unhappy underworld characters are after them, as well as the police.<br/><br/>Based on an early script from Tarantino, Tony Scott's wild movie is suitable for youth of the 1990s for it is a gutsy, violent and satisfying. This is obviously a Tarantino film as it was the energetic and exhilarating - a style that would be the trademark of his films in the years to come. Definitely,the cast delivered a brilliant performance."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","3","19 May 2010"," Early Tarantino at its core, this is an unforgettable ""Romance.""
","""True Romance"" blossoms on a lot of levels, but it most distinctively bears the mark of an early Quentin Tarantino film. The scene dynamics and the way it plays beautifully in and out of turning points are all early signs of the would-be master at work. Released the year between ""Resevoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""True Romance"" doesn't carry his directorial signature, but it reeks of Tarantino in all the right ways and compares favorably with those two early '90s crime thrillers.<br/><br/>The replay value of ""True Romance"" dwells in how its bounty of supporting actors all went on to outdo its two stars. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette play Clarence and Alabama, a couple who meet because Alabama was a call girl hired to sleep with Clarence as a birthday present. They fall in love and marry instantly. To put the past behind them, Clarence visits her pimp (Gary Oldman -- that's awesome supporting role number one), kills him and makes off with a half million in coke.<br/><br/>Hunting the runaway couple are agents of a mob boss played in one 100 percent Tarantino scene by Christopher Walken and later by James Gandolfini in a breakout performance. Brad Pitt, who worked with director Tony Scott's brother Ridley as an unknown just two years before in another fugitive film, ""Thelma & Louise,"" plays the unassuming stoner roommate of Clarence's best friend (played by comedian Michael Rapaport). Other notables are brief appearances from Samuel L. Jackson and Val Kilmer, as well as Dennis Hopper's as Clarence's father.<br/><br/>Even with this ""secret"" knowledge, this dynamic works for this story, one that attempts to broaden one's definition of love to include murder, running from the law and flat out acting nuts. Clarence and Alabama are unconventional and completely stupid, deserving of losing everything, but in front of a backdrop of characters who define true moral scumminess, it becomes easy to root for them.<br/><br/>Scott certainly helped create the suspense necessary for a dialog-heavy Tarantino script and that warrants applause, but Quentin simply owns this picture at its core. Hopper's ""history lesson"" where he laughs in Walken's face as he refers to his ancestors as a racial epithet showcase Tarantino's classic tension-twisting. The way a scene's momentum shifts at the drop of a hat and climaxes into pure mayhem captures his utter brilliance. <br/><br/>The characters spanning a wide array of vivid strangeness and the sheer untamable wildness of the story and events make ""True Romance"" hard to forget.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","This is an entertaining crime-flick made from a Tarantino script. It isn't as good as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction; in fact, it isn't nearly as good as those but it is a good film none-the-less.<br/><br/>This movie contains all of the usual Tarantino style dialogue  pop cultural references, un-PC stuff, funny one-liners, etc. And it has to be said, it is one of True Romance's strong-points. That and the acting; this film really does have a very good cast. There are excellent turns by Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Chris Penn, Bronson Pinchot, Brad Pitt and Saul Rubinek. Every one of these actors really makes the most of their screen time. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the two central players. Christian Slater is unconvincing, although his character isn't exactly the most convincing Tarantino creation  a comic book assistant who instantly turns into a gun-toting, unhinged madman? Come on now! And Patricia Arquette, despite being incredibly sexy, comes across as just a little too gigglingly moronic most of the time. Generally speaking, the romance aspect of this film was really trite and unengaging. These weren't great characters to hang the story onto to be perfectly honest.<br/><br/>But all of that aside, the rest of the film is very impressive both in terms of tension and writing. The Gary Oldman scene is terrifying. The Walken/Hopper confrontation is an acting master class. And Bronson Pinchot, in particular is absolutely hilarious as Elliot the cowardly actor  I particularly enjoyed the scene where he is pulled over for erratic driving  priceless! Despite the unappealing central characters, True Romance is a film that is well worth seeking out."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","3","14 April 2008"," This will be remembered as one of Tarantino's best...
","This one is Tarantino's wish-fulfilment movie (even though Tony Scott directed), written when he was still an unknown video store clerk, so we have a largely friendless comic-store clerk named Clarence (Christian Slater) winning over novice hooker Alabama (an impossibly cute and sexy Patricia Arquette) with his guileless charm and then putting one over on all manner of bad guys.<br/><br/>This is a good film. Everything Tarantino touched pre-1997 was fresh and new and entertaining, and back then he was only filling his films with references to his favourite movies instead of ripping them off under the guise of paying homage. Here, the film fairly bulges with these references, from movies playing on TVs in the background to posters on toilet walls to the wallpaper in the runaway couples' motel room and the Badlands-style voice-over and music. The dialogue isn't as hip as it would be in Dogs and Fiction, but it's still good and there are some stand-out scenes  two of which involve interrogations in which the person being interrogated turns the tables on their persecutor in different but equally effective ways.<br/><br/>The other thing that should be touched upon is the quality of the cast. This one really is a one-off: Slater, Arquette, Oldman, Walken, Hopper, Jackson, Gandolfini, Pitt, Kilmer  it reads like a list of who is, was, or is going to be. No doubt Tarantino can still assemble such a starry line-up, but whether he will ever again be able to fashion such a spirited, entertaining and unpretentious piece of work is open to question."

","I was 22 when this film was released, and I remember it was autumn, it rained a lot, it was cold.

I like to say it has the best love story in it, cause I despise the ""regular"" love stories so much. Sure, it's over-the-top and cartoon-like... and that's what it makes so great.<br/><br/>Everyone knows (or should know, at least) the magical moment of truth with Chris Walken and Dennis Hopper, the way Hopper's character orders a quick bullet in the head with his famous ""Sicilian speech"". This episode alone is one of the highlights of cinema history, period; right up there with Rutger Hauers last dying moments in ""Blade Runner"" or Robert De Niro's you-talking-to-me-speech in ""Taxi Driver"". Hell, I could go on and on praising the acting and utilizing the momentum in this scene.<br/><br/>One of my best friends likes to say the film is just a poor sketch off Tarantino's scrapbook and only shines momentarily. I think he needs re-programming, to be honest. Sure, it's got kitschy bits (Alabama's clothes, anyone? Theme music, anyone?), sure the script has a feeling of let's get drunk and write something FUN, and sure it goes off the wall more than once. But that's the BEAUTY of it.<br/><br/>No other movie comes even close to combining love, crime, violence and comedy, together what must be the best cast of all times, in this way.<br/><br/>In my Top 10 Films of All Times, and will stay there, for good."

","There are movies with incredible cast and crew which turn out to leave a lot to be desired (Departed is a great example), but if you think True Romance might be one of them, you're going to miss a classic! Tony Scott was responsible for putting it all together, and he did incredible job. The script was written by Tarantino, and you can feel his unmistakable charisma in dialogs. Definitely one of his best scripts, as there are moments so touching you'll have to cry, so funny you'll laugh your ass off, and guess what? Some violence too. It's hard to find a movie with more great actors in one place than in True Romance. What's more surprising, ALL of them do terrific job! Both Slater and lovely Patricia Arquette are at their top, and Christopher Walken created one of the most classy mobster characters ever. Fuelled by Tarantino script and inspired by his incredible performance, Vincenzo is a guy sure to remember :) This is an absolute classic, so don't wonder anymore, go watch it :)"

","Tarantino. With all the Elvis freaks in this world how brilliant is it to write a screenplay where your main character summons The King whenever he needs advice? True Romance is one of those best kept secret type movies. There is no way The Accademy would honor a movie with such gratuitous violence with an Oscar.<br/><br/>The best way for me to describe this movie? Whenever I meet a fan of the cinema and we start discussing what we consider to be ""the greats"" I get excited, hell I get jittery when I learn that this person HASN'T seen True Romance. Why? Because I remember what it was like viewing this movie for the first time, expecting nothing, yet being totally in awe while watching True Romance for the first time. I get excited because I know that when I insist that THIS be the next movie this person watches, they too will soon be enlightened.<br/><br/>While Tarantino should receive credit for knocking out an incredibly original screenplay, it's the cast that makes this movie so special. No one tries to steal the show. No one tries to make it ""their"" movie. Believe it or not, there are times in Hollywood when an ensemble cast so special is assembled that the end result truly is magic. This is one of those times.<br/><br/>The big scene, of course, occurs between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. A scene that True Romance is known for. But standing toe to toe with these two Hollywood veterans are actors like Bronson Pinchot (yes I said Bronson Pinchot), Michael Rapaport, Brad Pitt (responsible for the summary title), Patricia Arquette, Tom Sizemore and Saul Rubinek.<br/><br/>There isn't a dead spot in this flick. It flows perfectly. It's safe to say that most of the characters are unlikeable, yet we love them all.<br/><br/>For me to describe the plot would be pointless. It's a waste of time. This is the type of movie where, even though the plot is superior, it doesn't matter because this is a movie made for people who love movies.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen True Romance, do yourself a favor and BUY it. I am getting jittery already."

","Comic bookstore salesman Clarence liked watching martial arts film. When he was watching movie in a theater on his birthday, he met a beautiful call girl Alabama. She came to Detroit just for seeking true love. In fact she was paid to meet Clarence by his boss. They fell in love at the first sight. Although Clarence wanted to take back her clothes from her previous working place, he mistakenly took a suitcase that was full of cocaine. An unavoidable great escape started.<br/><br/>This love story was different from common love story. Although it was quite violent in some degree, its straightforward and humorous style was refreshing. Witty talk and lively music made me in an exciting state from start to end. The success of the movie should be attributed to excellent screenplay. Quentin Taratino's talent in writing was proved completely many times by his later famous works (for example: Pulp fiction, Kill Bill 1 & 2). No doubt his directing level was high too.<br/><br/>An exciting romance movie. 8/10"

","I've always been a massive QT fan and was so surprised to see that True Romance seems to have slipped through the net in comparison to the success of his writer/director movies as when I saw it, it blew me away. A day later, I ordered it from play.com and since then ( a week ago) have watched it 9 times. It's definitely in my top five favourite films of all time. Glorious. I'm not a big Christian Slater fan but the role seems to suit him and Arquette does a fantastic job of playing the part Uma Thurman would have had had Tarantino the gift of foresight. I've never seen Gary Oldman as such a memorable character and if only for that I'd recommend it. It's movies like this, and people like Quentin, that make mu sure-fire certain that I want a career in the film industry."

There were many other things I loved about this movie but I was wondering something. What if Quentin Tarantino directed it, instead of Tony Scott. I personally think the movie would have been even better. The movie had an all star cast but some characters we barely got to know. True Romance could have been Pulp Fiction if Tarantino directed it. There were so many characters like Gary Oldman's character and Samuel Jackson and some others. I would have liked to go more in depth. I also would have liked to see more of Christopher Walken.

","True Romance, is about a young man named Clarence Worley, who one night in a movie theater meets a girl named Alabama Whitman, and after that they go get some pie and then go back to his place. Later that evening Alabama admits to Clarence that she is a call girl and was hired by Clarence's boss to sleep with him. Alabama tells Clarence, that she is in love with him and he is in love with her so they get married. Clarence one day decides to go and get Alabama's stuff which is being held at her pimp's place. His name is Drexl Spivey. Once Clarence gets there he kills Drexl, and most of the people in the room and along with getting Alabama's belongings he also takes a suitcase full of cocaine worth a lot of money. Clarence and Alabama then visit Clarence's father Clifford Worley, and tell him that they are going to California for their honeymoon. A man who works for a well known gangster visits Clifford and tries to find out where Clarence and Alabama are because apparently the cocaine belongs to his boss. So while in California, they have a gangster on their trail and while trying to sell the cocaine to a movie producer and things are not as they seem during the deal. True Romance, has good direction, a good script, good performances by everyone involved, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The version of the film I saw was the unrated version. True Romance, has some great dialog and is a very fun and entertaining movie. The film is full of action and thrills and it is all done very stylishly. The film is well made and has a good script by Quentin Tarantino, which he sold before he made his first film Reservoir Dogs. The film does have some flaws and some characters I might wanted to have seen and learned more about and some scenes kind of felt like they went on a little too long but the film is generally a lot better than most action films out there and the acting, writing and style of the movie make it also an above average action film. In fact the film is really good and it was a good film for Quentin Tarantino to have been involved in to start his career. A very good action film that is full of energy and will definitely appeal to action fans and fans of Quentin Tarantino."

","I definitely enjoyed the movie with all the great acting performances, but thought it dragged on a little during the second hour. The interactions between Walken and Hopper, Slater and Oldman, and Arquette and Gandolfini are all fun to watch. <br/><br/>One of the main issues I had was making up my mind about Christian Slater and whether to think of him as a hero or not. Also what happens to Walken? It seems odd that he has his one scene and then only his men are involved throughout the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I went back and forth on whether to give this movie a 6 or 7, but as I think back to the earlier parts of the movie, it's worth it's 7."
"podge_uk_2001","10","1","3","2 June 2005"," Tarantino's best script, one of the best casts ever
","Go to the main details page for this film. Then look at the cast. Have you ever seen a better group of actors in one place? I know Christian Slater doesn't have a rep as a great actor, but in this film he is. He stands out above everyone else, and that is high praise indeed when you're comparing him to the likes of Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. Actually, speaking of Hopper and Walken, they share one scene together, and it is one of the best I have ever scene. I say this with no exaggeration. It's impossible to look away from. The film is worth watching just for this scene.<br/><br/>Christian Slater's character is cool. He works in a comic-book store, has a fixation with Elvis Presley, and on his birthday every year he goes to the cinema alone to watch a Martial Arts Triple Bill. Not exactly a standard definition of cool. But he is. He's the sort of character you'd like to be. I can't work out why though, but he's great.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what else I can say about this film. I try to be a harsh marker of films, so I only give films that I think are literally perfect 10/10. Which means that only Shawshank Redemption, the Usual Suspects and Return of the King are rated as a 10 by me. But honestly, this film is as good as any of them*. You have to see this movie.<br/><br/>*Except for the Shawshank Redemption. That film deserves about 17/10. Unfortunately that might make the universe implode through some paradox or other."

It is easily their best movies - they look good together in this preposterous wonderful ride ----and there is another classic hilarious scene with Brad Pitt which alone is worth the 'price of admission' You will have no idea as to what will happen next in this movie, a violent comic romantic fantasy ==I'd give the movie a 10 but the movie is only a great movie to see and watch --it is not a serious movie but who needs serious- it's a very big small movie and that's just fine"
"amway-1","10","1","3","22 May 2005"," This is really Tarantino's best and I loved his other movies
","This movie introduces many of today's powerhouse actors and the cast alone is so full of future and current (at the time) stars that it almost can't help but be great. All I will say about the characters is this: watch for Brad Pitt's character, he only has a few minutes, but you won't be disappointed. Also, watch for the scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. It may be the best scene in a film that I can remember.<br/><br/>The thing that makes it it hard for True Romance to gain the acceptance of other Tarantino's films is that it really is a romance story and most of Tarantino's fans (I assume) are male and are probably not interested and or threatened by watching a ""love story"". However this is romance Tarantino style with violence and blood galore injected with appropriately timed humor. But like all good movie dramas an attachment to the characters is vital to the emotional impact of the movie and it is the love story in this that makes every gun fight, torture, or death that much more interesting, meaningful, and powerful.<br/><br/>If you like other Tarantino movies see this one, you will definitely like it. It is the least known of his movies, his first, and arguably his best"
"bix010","10","1","3","24 April 2005"," Racism and Elvis
","Think about this movie as a series of skits with the most prolific/clichéd actors of the early 1990s and you'll come to appreciate its worth on a whole new level. True Romance is an SNL skit gone serious. Plus, there's enough latent racism to cover three Andrew Dice Clay monologues (though we all know that Dice was being ironic, but that's another discussion). In conclusion, any time Christopher Walkenand Dennis Hopper share the screen you can't go wrong. It's like coke and girls with low self-esteem.<br/><br/>In addition, Val Kilmer plays an unseen Elvis, Michael Rappaport is his normal goofy white boy/wigger and in the history of cinema Brad Pitt does more with three lines than any other untalented actor with great bone structure, ever. To top it all off, the soundtrack kicks my ass and everyone's ass I've ever met."

"TOMASBBloodhound","10","1","3","9 January 2005"," A landmark piece of cinema. It couldn't be any more entertaining.
","Quentin Tarantino and Tony Scott would seem like the oddest of couples when it comes to movie making. Tarantino is the indie God and Scott is Mr. Blockbuster. But in True Romance, as well as with Crimson Tide, we see just how well their styles actually blend. With True Romance, we get a healthy dosage of the raw energy and memorable dialogue one associates with Tarantino, wrapped up in a technically flawless and perfectly paced package. Certainly the best of the two worlds.<br/><br/>True Romance is the story of a young loner who spends his time reading comic books and watching Kung-Fu movies. (I wonder where Tarantino came up with that angle!) He's watching a Sonny Chiba tripple feature at a mostly deserted movie house on the night of his birthday, when a beautiful young call-girl walks into the theater and into his life. She has only been a call-girl for a few days, and she's been sent to show this young man a good time. In their brief night together, these two fall deeply in love and get married. There are some problems, however.<br/><br/>The young woman has a nasty pimp (It took me about four viewings to realized he's played by Gary Oldman!), and her hubby takes it upon himself to off this guy as an apparent symbol of his love for his new bride. After an extremely violent confrontation at the pimp's lair, our hero finds himself with a suitcase full of cocaine that he mistook for the young woman's belongings. That coke belongs to the mob, and let's just say that they'll do anything to get it back. They follow the young couple all the way from Detroit to L.A. in an attempt to take back what's theirs before the young couple can sell it off. The resulting action is incredible.<br/><br/>The film is great on many levels. With the exception of Tombstone, I cannot recall a film where so much of the cast is made up of well-known actors. Many of them like Walken, Kilmer, and Hopper appear only briefly, but they leave a lasting impression on the viewer. And nearly the entire cast dies convincingly. Saul Rubinek does a priceless parody of Joel Silver.<br/><br/>Some highlights include an interrogation of Dennis Hopper by Christopher Walken and a bunch of mafia goons. This conversation epitomizes why I love Quentin Tarantino. It is such a brutal scene, but you'll be howling with laughter before it's over.<br/><br/>There is quite a bit of violence that some people will find difficult to watch. In one scene, Patricia Arqutte is beaten to a bloody pulp by James Gandolfini. Watch closely after the first punch he hits her with. The camera pauses on his face for a moment, and he gives a truly weird look. You can tell this character loves dishing out pain. Overall, this is not a family picture.<br/><br/>The film delivers everything it tries to. The hip brutality of this film has helped set the tone for action films ever since.<br/><br/>10 of 10 stars <br/><br/>So sayeth the Hound."
"ckaloo80","10","1","3","1 December 2004"," GREAT MOVIE
","I recommend this movie to anyone who believes in true love and the lengths people with go to find and keep it. True Romance has a superb leading and supporting cast ( Brad Pitt almost steals the show on the couch ). Yes it is a bit obscene at times, but then again so is the everyday world. If the timid can look past the violence to the true meaning of the movie you'll experience an incredible story of family values, friendship, and most of all love. The lengths these two go through to stay together and stay true to each other are very inspiring, and make every person hope they can find someone to share life with. Well as you can tell I liked it so give it a shot and keep an open mind. Don't forget about the moving score by Hans Zimmer."

","True Romance is the story of how Clarence (a comic book store employee, obsessed by Kung Fu and Elvis) and Alabama (a call girl) fall for each other, are chased by both gangsters and the police with a case full of cocaine.<br/><br/>True Romance is an excellent film - a thrilling mix of love, gangsters and those Tarantino cult pop-culture references. There are so many stand-out performances - the lead couple (Christian Slater / Patricia Arquette), Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper (gotta love the Sicillian speech scene!), Brad Pitt (as the crazy stoner) and Gary Oldman (the wannabe black white pimp).<br/><br/>True Romance feels like a Hollywood-ised version of a Quentin Tarantino film - written by Tarantino, but directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun fame). Apparently - the ending was changed (to make it more happy) and the story was made linear (as opposed to a Tarantino-esquire non-linear story). If True Romance had a fault - it would be this. But this is a relatively minor problem - the strong cast and screenplay sees this movie through.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended!"

","Tony Scott did an great job directing this fine film, But all credit must go to Quentin Tarantino he wrote one heck of a script. I know this was one of Tarantino's first scripts, but it could be one of his best. I can understand that at the time Tarantino didn't have enough to budget or get this film off the ground. He did a good move in giving the script to Scott. Scott knows what to do when it comes to movies and i know he let Tarantino make the movie almost like a partner. All of the characters were well thought up and deep. Walken has a great role as does Hopper. Drexel could be one of the best villains of all time. This is one of the 3 movies that all tie in to each other in Quentin's mind. This, Resevoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction are all connected. With Vincent and Vic being brothers and Mr. White and Alabama being lovers/partners in crime this shows yet another way Quentin is one hell of a script writer. I know the ending is not as Quentin dreamed up, but there is a good viewing of his ending in the Directors cut of this movie. The movie has everything you want. Thrills, Kills, and blood Spills. The movie is also a love story in a true Quentin T. fashion. This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. its a 10 of 10."

","I like True Romance not for the story, but for the cool and funny scenes that make it so fun to watch. The story was okay, but not as good as the others Tarantino wrote, such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. I think the movie might have been better if Tarantino had directed it himself, but this is still a good movie and fun to watch. What makes it so fun to watch isn't the story, but certain scenes, like when Alabama's getting beat up but she just smiles and flips the guy off. Or any of the scenes with Brad Pitt, when he's high and acting like a moron. My favorite scene is when Dennis Hopper is being interrogated by Chris Walken and he's just making a fool of the guy, knowing, but not caring, that he's about to get killed for it. One thing I don't like about this film, however, is the ending; Clarence was originally supposed to stay dead, but they changed it in the movie so that he ends up living after all, and that ruins the ending of the movie. The casting and acting are excellent, however, and Dennis Hopper and Chris Walken were both a bonus to have in the movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of either of those actors and to anyone who likes cool movies. Four stars out of five."
"phmurphy","Null","1","3","21 July 2004"," Tarantinos Best Script
","I know that all the great stories and movies that Quentin Tarantino has written and made have been nothing short of brilliant, but i think the best story/script that he has ever done is True Romance. Not necessarily everybody knows that he wrote it too. It is so brilliant and The story is so original. Im not saying that Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs aren't, but think about all the genres that are rolled into one here. Theres love, comedy, drama, violence, crime, mafia, drugs, hollywood, and the list goes on and on. I think that it may be one of the top 5-10 best screenplays ever written. Also, aside from the writing, the casting is superb. I mean we have Christian Slater (his best role), Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Samuel Jackson, Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini (the role that pretty much had Tony Soprano written all over it) and other great actors. When you put a lot of marquis actors in a movie, it doesnt always work out because sometimes its just too much, but in this movie, their appearances in the movie are all balanced out that it works. I mean Christopher Walken is only in the movie for about 10 minutes and in that 10 minutes, he has the most memorable scene in the movie. Same goes for Gary Oldman. Tony Scott's directing is also remarkable. All in all, if you haven't seen this movie in a while or havent at all, rent it, buy it, order it, or whatever means of movie purchase you are accostomed to, and enjoy it because i think that it is a true classic. You literally will laugh, cry, and cringe, but most importantly, you will be satisfied......10/10."

Maybe that is part of why this film was not marketed in the manner it deserved. I'm always amazed at the number of film fans I know who have never even heard of it! Tarentino did not direct this, but he wrote it.<br/><br/>It has almost as much (or as much) violence as Pulp Fiction, so if you hate Pulp Fiction maybe you wouldn't like this film either -- but otherwise it's AWESOME...! Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Patricia Arquette, Christian Slater and many others in this star-studded cast were excellent in their roles. This is most of all a FUN movie to watch. Brad Pitt's role is amazingly small -- and even more delightfully funny. I've watched this film at least 10 times and he cracks me up every time.<br/><br/>I really can't write a good enough review for this film. It is something you really must see for yourself. I don't usually like to pay retail for movies, and this is one of only two movies I just HAD to buy retail (this and Pulp Fiction)!"
"psikill","9","1","3","11 March 2004"," Ain't This A True Romance?
","Tony Scott has made his most interesting and linear vision of romance, directing this film. In fact, 'True Romance' is almost a unique film, as it combines romance with action and drama, and it does it so well. Few are the films that have succeeded in doing this. The film centers in the dangerous and risky romance of Clarence (Slater) and Alabama (Arquette), as they fight against drug dealers, mafia thugs, cops and pimps.<br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>It all begins with a present from Clarence's boss, which consists in spending a lovely and sexual-appetizer night, with a prostitute named Alabama. Little did he know, that she has a problem that makes her like only one man, and immediately falls in love with Clarence. With the relationship moving forward, they face many problems. Clarence has to wipe-out Alabama's pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman), in a superb cameo performance, which only brings more problems, as they steal Drexl's drugs (without knowing of course! They're not drug addicts, as far as I know). Drugs, which had the mafia as its destination. They then try to sell it, so they can make some money, bu little did they know, that the final showdown they would be involved in, would be one of the most violent endings of the movie industry. (You would expect no less, when we're in the presence of a Tarantino story).<br/><br/>End of Spoilers<br/><br/>The plot is pretty straight-forward, with no complex stuff, just plain simple and good. It is funny, violent, dizzy and sexy. Slater's performance is just enough for his role, and I thought Patricia Arquette was lovely and at the same time innocent and sexy. The rest of the cast is almost cameo performances, Val Kilmer portrays Clarence's inspiration (Elvis), Dennis Hopper (best performance of the lot) stars as Clarence's dad, James Gandolfini also makes a vintage performance. Brad Pitt stars as a drug addict (pretty funny guy), and another superb performance by Christopher Walken. In fact, the most fantastic scene in terms of acting was the part between Walken vs Hopper. True acting that part, and the music that supported it, made it more marking.<br/><br/>Overall, I truly recommend 'True Romance'. Watch out for the ending, it is a beauty in terms of realistic violence. Maybe this film will stay on your mind, maybe it won't, but one thing's for sure, it will surely make you love even more your wife/girlfriend.<br/><br/>PsIKiLL's Rating: 9/10"
"stamper","7","1","3","7 February 2004"," The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 3 - By his hand, but not through his eyes: True Romance
","It all depends on your definition of Romance<br/><br/>
After the surprise success of Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino managed to get another of his writing efforts made into a film and the result, which is called True Romance, features quite a lot of blood, profanity and some strange dialog. True Romance is basically a romantic thriller and by that I mean romantic in the really broad sense, because for most people romantic is when you have a candle lit dinner under the stars. The main characters in this film though, Clarence (Christian Slater) and Alabama (Patricia Arquette), do not do that sort of stuff and I must say that, although I understand their feelings for each other, they really have a screwed up definition of the word romance. <br/><br/>
The thrilling element of the film comes from the fact, that almost throughout the entire film, Clarence and Alabama are hunted by a bunch gangsters who want to kill them. Now Clarence and Alabama are no angels, but when they are not in the criminal circle both of them are very open and pretty cool, so not matter what happens, you start to like them and feel for them. This enables the film to maintain a pretty high level of thrill throughout, except for the scenes where nothing of that tension shines through and it is as if Clarence and Alabama have a life without worries and this is what gives True Romance a weird, yet original touch. I do not know if this touch made the film worse than it could have been, but I certainly cannot imagine the film without it.<br/><br/>
There are some similarities between True Romance and Reservoir Dogs. First of all, the events in True Romance also happen in a criminal milieu. Second of all, there is quite a lot of profanity and blood. And third of all, there is (as in Reservoir Dogs) some strange dialog, which I think only Tarantino could have produced. I mean everybody who has seen Reservoir Dogs remembers a couple of crazy dialogs from that film, like the scene in which all of the guys are talking about the meaning of the song Like a Virgin' or the scene in which the nick-names' are given to the gangsters. True Romance features a couple of dialogs like that also, for instance right in the beginning, when Clarence talks about Elvis to some blond in a bar or when Clarence's dad (Dennis Hopper) tells some gangster from Sicily, where his ancestors come from. I enjoyed those dialogs and I think together with the ending monologue by Alabama, those are probably the best lines in the film.<br/><br/>
Overall, this is not a bad film, but it seems to lack that extra something. I feel, that the viewer is not sucked into the story enough and I also feel, there are some scenes which need some work, for they feel awkward or are unnecessary bloody and / or emotional. Those scenes include the interrogation scene with Dennis Hopper, the last scene with James Gandolfini and the last scene with Chris Penn. Don't get me wrong, this is by all means a good effort, but it is not good. Maybe Tarantino should be the only one allowed to direct Tarantino stories. <br/><br/>

"rosscinema","7","1","3","27 January 2004"," True Romance is pure fun
","There are some films that you gladly forget about common sense and logic and just sit back to enjoy the energy of what your watching. Story is about Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) who works in a comic book store and watches kung-fu films and while sitting in a movie theater one night he meets Alabama (Patricia Arquette). They hit it off and go back to his place where after some lovemaking he finds out that she is a hooker that was hired by his boss but she really likes him and vows to give up prostitution. They get married and Clarence decides to go get her belongings from her pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman) but after a bloody altercation Drexl and his hired thugs are killed and Clarence grabs a suitcase and runs out. At home they discover millions of dollars in cocaine stashed in the case so they decide to go to California and look up his friend Dick (Michael Rapaport).<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>
 They arrive and Dick gets them a deal to sell the cocaine to a famous film producer for 200,000 dollars but the cops find out about it and want to make the bust but Italian gangsters are hot on Clarence's and Alabama's trail.<br/><br/>This film was directed by Tony Scott who also directed ""Top Gun"" and he has shown good skill at directing action films that keep a steady and exciting pace. But the films real flavor isn't necessarily in the action but in Quentin Tarantino's wonderful script and dialogue. Even when the film slows down and there is no action taking place you're still enthralled by the words spoken by the actors and there is a truly memorable scene involving Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. The fact that these two terrific actors are interacting in a film was exciting enough but the scene between them is written so splendidly that it has become a classic. Slater is well cast as the hot headed but reckless Clarence and I've always been a big fan of Arquette. They have good chemistry together and this helps the film as we watch this story unfold. The cast is top notch and along with the main leads you can see Brad Pitt, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson, Saul Rubinek, Conchata Ferrell, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore and Ed Lauter. Also, Val Kilmer pops up from time to time as the ghost of Elvis that mentors Clarence in his actions. I personally could have done without the whole Elvis/Ghost part of the story but this is just nit picking because this is a whole lot of fun to watch. This has more than it's share of violence but this film is highly stylized and generates an abundant of energy that never lets up."

","I really wish Brad Pitt would consider reprising his role as the stoner Floyd someday cause he absolutely stole the show-he's hysterical. Some of the classic Tarantino lines of all time and phenomenal scenes that are way outside the edge of reality, but it works. A better ensemble cast than anything else you're liable to find. Was this Gandolfini's first ""sensitive hitman"" role? Patricia Arquette is yummy, Hopper is in rare form, Walken is as menacing as he is weird, Oldman makes a great pimp, we find out about Samuel L's sexual preferences, and Slater manages to turn in a credible understated but high energy performance. A monument to the Nintendo generation I suppose but a great movie worth watching over and over again. Oh yeah, if you're quick to scream ""ripoff"" when you see a road movie that resembles True Romance, NBK, Freeway, Love and a 45, etc then pick up a copy of Badlands with Martin Sheen. Tarantino makes better movies than his predecessors but he's borrowed an idea or two along the way. 10/10"
"t_brown_17","Null","1","3","28 October 2000"," The acting and script tower over mindless direction
","I'm sure that the final shootout in this movie was originally written by Tarantino to be a farcicist romp, but Tony Scott makes no light of that. Instead of showing violence as absurdity, he shows it as a glamorous way of dealing with one's aggression. In fact, Scott's direction almost made me not like this film. The camera never stops and the fanatical editing is overkill. This just goes to show you that no one can direct a Tarantino script other than Tarantino himself. Old QT would have made this movie violent and funny, instead of violent and silly. The acting cannot be faulted, though. Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken are the best of the bunch. I've never cared much for Michael Rapaport, and would've much rather seen someone like Steve Buscemi play this part. And about Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn: Was I supposed to feel for these guys in the movie? I know that they're cops, but they weren't likable at all and they're introduced about three-fourth's into the film, seeming like they've come straight out of another movie. So all in all, the good things: The acting. The script. The bad things? The direction. The editing. And I'm sorry, that ending too! What cheese!"

","Last Christmas, I had a bunch of friends over, ogling my favorite gift, a Sony DVD player and a bunch of discs. When They asked what film we should christen it with, I recommended True Romance. As I am known as a person who likes action movies, they began wondering what in the hell I was talking about and saying they did not want to watch a ""chick"" flick. Laughing, I put the disc in. Two hours later, they were applauding. Several of them begged me to watch it again and asked if I would give them my videocasette of it.<br/><br/>The thing about this film that made it such a failure was that it is a film that requires a certain amount of confidence and allowance of violence. The film's really a love story. Real love. How often does a marriage survived based on two people knowing each other but a day. With these two characters, we do not have to worry about that. What we do have to worry about are an inebriated gangster{Walken, stealing his only scene, and he steals it from Dennis Hopper. One of the film's classic lines comes from here:I'm the Anti-christ, you tell the angels in heaven you never saw evil so singulary personified as in the face of the man who killed you}, his henchmen, a bunch of cops{played to a perfect clique{this is a complement} by Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore} who have tracked them down thanks to a traitor, and a bag full of cocaine. Of course, the real concern is whether Clarence{A movie,Elvis obsessed weirdo} and Alabama{A former prostitute and giggly blonde} can get through this. This film is a triumph for everyone involved, including Tarantino. THis screenplay, the first he ever wrote, is a very effective and entertaining one. It would not have survived or be as well praised had the original ending been intact, but that does not matter. We see Tarantino{normally agressive about doing his own material}'s world through Tony Scott's eyes. THis is Scott's smallest and greatest film. It shows how effective his directing can be. Christian Slater is phenomenal, Patricia Arquette is VERY effective, Dennis Hopper is great, Walken was amazing, and Gary Oldman gives one of his better performances as a pimp{yep, a pimp}. This is a really great movie, and one that makes you happy in the end. Although violent, it will make you walk out of it with a dopey grin on your face. IT IS A GREAT FILM."

Although it's not for all tastes, the main characters are a loser and an ex-call girl who somehow find each other under crazy circumstances, the story will definitely keep you watching.

A lot of people have blasted Tony Roberts' direction, but he DID get these performances for this scene.  The way Walken reacts and smiles at Hopper's ""story"" is subtle and brilliant.  You can see from his reactions that his anger is increasing with each new sentence from Hopper, but he chooses to make it look as if he is amused, not letting Hopper know.  Of course Hopper DOES know, having sized up Walken as well as the situation within seconds. This is his last hurrah -- he knows he is going to die, but he is actually getting the better of Walken in doing so, and you can see it in his eyes during this scene.  Walken creates a sense of menace/impending doom while all the while being friendly and polite -- he is in my opinion the best actor in Hollywood today.  (See The Dead Zone if you don't believe me.)<br/><br/>I have to also put in a good word for Gary Oldman's stunningly brilliant performance as well."

Arquette has zero character other than loving Slater and dressing ""quirky"" while Slater's character is just a Tarantino clone who loves Elvis.

","The British school of direction. I suppose few of you out there go for Director's Commentaries, so few of you would know about The Persuader employed by Tony Scott. Before I continue, the man is dead, I'm hesitant to throw stones at somebody who is no longer with us, but I only found that out a little while ago. But as for what Tony fondly refers to as the British school of direction, smacking his leading lady through the face to get her to sufficiently emote for two scenes in this movie (the romantic 'billboard' scene where Clarence finds her softly weeping outside on the roof, and the one where she thinks Clarence is dead)... Isn't it just too damn much that the movie that is notorious for its violence against women (the James Ganfolfini Virgil beating up Alabama scene is surely the cinematographic zenith of just exactly this, and IF THERE IS SOMETHING OUTDOING THIS, KINDLY DON'T BRING IT TO MY ATTENTION, I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT) had a director that slapped an (in basically his own words) innocent kid with a child-like quality through the face? To get her all teary- eyed after a grueling shooting schedule when she wasn't able to project herself as the script required... Believe me, I do understand. I just find it absolutely appalling. Hell, is this what they did on PARTY OF FIVE? Imagine if that was what they did on weepy old PARTY OT FIVE!<br/><br/>As for the movie, I find it overrated. Everybody's so damn pleased, it is such a beloved classic. To me it seems that as long as you satisfy people's need for on-screen violence (which this one does in spades!), it is just hunky-dory, everybody is so peachy- keen on it, nobody's complaining, the reviews are favorable EVEN THOUGH THE EFFING THING FAILS TO MAKE ANY EFFING SENSE! I could point out that I find obnoxious Virgil's comment re the first time you kill, how difficult that is, to be what-I-accept-to-be the truth. Yet killing doesn't affect Clarence, he takes to it like a duck to water, he is therefore a natural born killer (ha! No pun intended) yet he is supposed to be a sweet comic book store Average Joe, Oh For Crying Out Loud I Rest My Case, I won't go on this any further (my tea is getting cold), the script is torn between a madman genius's schizophrenic bipolar conflicted mind's disparate working.<br/><br/>From the start, especially there in the movie theater, Patricia reminded me of Christina Applegate (Kelly Bundy in MARRIED WITH CHILDREN) and I'm pretty sure the two are interchangeable :)"
"The-Sarkologist","8","1","4","13 March 2013"," This is how romantic comedies should be made
","I always thought that this was Tarantino's first movie, however he only wrote it rather than directing it, and also it appears that Reservoir Dogs did come out first. As I understand it, being a writer he had a lot less control over the finished product than he would have had if he directed it as well. Maybe it was because this film was somewhat more complicated than Reservoir Dogs (which is pretty much entirely set in a warehouse, with only a few scenes – and they tend to be flash backs – set outside).<br/><br/>The story is about how a young man's boss gives him the birthday present of a prostitute who then falls in love with him (and him with her) so she renounces her former trade (she was only one for a couple of days) and moves in with him. However, as with all hopeless romantics, he decides to go and teach her old pimp a lesson (who turns out to be played by Gary Oldman) and lands up with copious amounts of uncut cocaine when he takes the wrong case. This, of course, attracts some unwanted attention, and they then decided to flee Detroit to go to Los Angeles to attempt to offload it.<br/><br/>I do not necessarily want to call this a classic Tarantino movie since there is a lot of Scott's influence in it, however we have the quirky characters (such as Floyd, played by Brad Pitt, who is perpetually stoned, and seems to always manage to keep the mafia goons happy). Okay, there is none of the shock violence that one would expect to see in a proper Tarantino movie, but there is a classic, what I would call, a Tarantino standoff at the end of the movie (and I will not go into any more detail than that).<br/><br/>I do really like this film, however the thing that I do think drags it down is the fact that Tarantino was not in the director's seat, which means that we do not get the same impression or feel as other films of his (such as Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, and Django Unchained). In fact, the film seems to try to have those strange and bizarre conversations that tend to punctuate his films, but simply falls flat."
"oneguyrambling","8","1","4","3 February 2012"," Only a couple Elvis appearances away from True Greatness...
","Guys like Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith burst out of the blocks, garnering massive critical acclaim for their originality and fresh approach to both dialogue and film-making in general. The unfortunate reality for both is that as their careers progressed they both fell in love with their own press and reputations, resulting in a loss of perspective and an inability to differentiate between truly entertaining moments; and self indulgent crap.<br/><br/>That's why I strongly believe that for both of the above mentioned allowing other directors to take a crack at their scripts. Hopefully the fresh eye might be more likely to excise irrelevant and plain silly material, while keeping the core elements intact.<br/><br/>I strongly doubt anyone else might've improved on the final versions of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but since then it's fair to say that Tarantino hasn't made anything rivaling either in terms of quality or longevity. (I'm not sure what anyone else would've made of Dogma, Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back to be honest!) We'll never know what Tarantino might have done if allowed to proceed with his True Romance script, what I can say is that the guy who ended up with it did an extremely good job. Not quite great mind you, but about as good as I think this was destined to be.<br/><br/>The tale of young lovers Clarence and Alabama Worley starts with them finding each other in Detroit, shows how they come into a large cache of drugs when Clarence decides to 'emancipate' his (now ex-)hooker wife from her menacing and dangerous pimp, and follows them as they flee cross country to LA to work out how best to turn the illicit stash into travellin' cash with which to finance their new lives.<br/><br/>But True Romance is more than a rote tale of young lurrrve, it is essentially a series of memorable moments placed amid a sea of references to the obscure and unusual, references that Tarantino has since turned into a career obsession. The resulting Tony Scott helmed film contains Elvis, Kung Fu movies, wannabe-black white boys, comic books, B-movie references and of course long tracts of intricately crafted dialogue.<br/><br/>As we saw in Pulp and Dogs, these speeches delivered from the lips of quality actors in between well directed passages of action often result in simply legendary output. Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Walken, Harvey Kietel and Steve Buscemi have the capacity to elevate. In lesser hands er lips not so good, (David Carradine, practically everyone in Death Proof – even Kurt Russell couldn't 'cool up' his banal speeches).<br/><br/>True Romance manages a few classic moments and has introduced some legendary bit characters. In the moments category the stand off between evil mob boss Christopher Walken and humble everyman – and Clarence's Dad – Dennis Hopper is one for the ages.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman squeezes every ounce out of his drug dealing pimp Drexl, and Bronson Pinchot gets many laughs in one of his less cartoony film roles as out of his depth PA to a big time Hollywood producer Elliot Blitzer. (Brad Pitt and Samuel L Jackson have less meaty roles but do what they can to remain in the memory banks.) The only misstep in my view is the inclusion of Val Kilmer as Elvis Presley, who appears only to Clarence as sort of his guiding angel – apparently this is a sign of Clarence's mental state but this is never really explained and comes off as a little too much – even in a film such as this.<br/><br/>Aside from the King, True Romance works because it gets the mix right between violence, laughs and even music.<br/><br/>Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are both perfectly capable in the central roles as Clarence and Alabama while the rest of the cast try to steal scenes from them.<br/><br/>Clarence is cocksure and confident, and Alabama is equally arresting and sassy – with Arquette's bouncing jubblies deserving acting credits of their own.<br/><br/>It might have turned out better in Tarantino's hands, but I'm more than happy with what the underrated Tony Scott managed to conjure up. Given his track record of turning potential mediocrity into entertaining flicks such as The Last Boy Scout, Deja Vu and last year's Unstoppable I think he deserves as much credit for the end result as Tarantino does for coming up with the script in the first place.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8 / 10. One or two moments from greatness. True Romance is certainly violent, profane and at times plain ridiculous. It is also fun, creative and extremely memorable."
"ElMaruecan82","9","1","4","6 January 2012"," The Amazing Story of a Bullet-Proof Love ...
","There's one thing that ""True Romance"" doesn't lie about: its title. The romance is the core of the story and the soul of the movie from beginning to end. As soon as Clarence Whitman (Christian Slater), a comic-book vendor, fan of Elvis Presley and old Kung-Fu films -translation: a geek- meets Alabama Parker (Patricia Arquette), a hooker, we know and we feel that for each step one would make, the other would follow.<br/><br/>What is extraordinary in Tony Scott's film is how it detaches itself from both action films where romances are usually reduced to cheesy subplots, and from romances since the two protagonists fall in love in a very surprising immediacy. No time for build-ups, for growing complicity, for love-and-hate wisecracks, ""True Romance"" echoes the classic loves-at-first-sight movies such as ""West Side Story"", ""Romeo and Juliet"" or any Disney film. It's a deliberate naivety enabling us to keep our hearts hooked to two endearing characters, trapped in a world of drugs and shotguns, where a bullet can hit you faster than love. The romance defines the couple's new life but also their new quest: living together in peace.<br/><br/>And there's this dreamlike feeling conveyed by Hans Zimmer's score. The ""You're So Cool"" theme is so close to Gassenhauer's music it clearly indicates that the film is a homage to Terrence Malick's ""Badlands"". But while ""Badlands"" was about crime in a romantic setting, ""True Romance"" is a romance in a criminal setting. One is a nihilistic escape; the other is much more idealistic. Clarence and Alabama try to find a new path for their lives and escape from cops and gangsters, both equally antagonistic. Their escape is materialized by the 'Caribbean' tone of Zimmer's music, playful, sweet with a child-like lullaby purity, embodying a beautiful dream. And the closer they get to their dreams, the louder the music is, culminating with a powerful ending.<br/><br/>And the dream's beauty is worth the deadly price. The dream-like nature of the romance illustrated by the music creates the perfect contrast with its sordid setting, allowing the story to create a dichotomy between love and violence with passion as their common link. The treatment of violence parallels love's connection to the future: it's less the violent moments that scare but the way they are patiently built up. Four times, the movie involves a confrontation where one has no chance AND nothing to lose, except a beloved one. And these scenes are cleverly slow paced and punctuated with thrilling exchanges, just to let us time to revise our prognostics. On that level, ""True Romance"" stands alone as one of the greatest action thrillers for four specific scenes magnificently written.<br/><br/>The first scene seals the union between Clarence and Alabama when he decides to 'buy' her from Drexl. The pimp, played by Gary Oldman in a terrifying mix between Taxi Driver's Spot and Norman Stansfield, is defeated by the geeky Clarence who wins Alabama's freedom plus a briefcase of cocaine that would start the whole trouble with the Mafia and the Police. The second scene is probably the most praised and mainly remembered for its confrontation between two acting Gods: Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, the deliverer of the infamous ""Sicily"" monologue. These two scenes alone deserve to be mentioned among the best pieces of screen-writing from the last 20 years; from Clarence's bluffing confidence in the way he retells all the trivia about an obscure blaxploitation film airing on TV, to the story of Sicilians having African heritage that would have made Vito Corleone roll over his grave.<br/><br/>The third scene involves a disturbing fight between the future Tony Soprano, James Gandolfini, and poor Patricia Arquette, the fight is so unequal that it's physically painful to see that poor creature beaten to death by that big thug. Yet, it powerfully serves the idea that one having nothing to lose can develops a superhuman strength. The last scene is the pay-off of the entire intricate plot, a Mexican stand-off where all the protagonists meet: the cops, the snitch, the dealers, the Mafia, Clarence and Alabama, for a final mayhem of bullets. ""True Romance"" is also a true thriller and a film served by great supporting performances through roles with extremely short life expectancies. Still, all these scenes have less in common their violence than the way they romanticize violence as the only answer when one has nothing to lose, where there's no passion without pain, no triumph without hardship. Whether it's Clarence challenging Drexl, his father provoking Cocotti or Alabama against Virgil, it's all about love.<br/><br/>These scenes have another thing in common, they break taboos, cops die as casually as bandits, a man beats a woman, the ultimate insult to the Sicilians is made, and a ruthless pimp is defeated by a poor geek, fan of Elvis  The script defies all our conceptions of gangster and crime movies, playing both on the field of homage and iconoclasm. It's like the dream of a movie fan who's finally got the big role in the film, and this embodies the whole dream-like aspect of ""True Romance"", something transcended by the ending and sublimated by the last lines, some of the best I've ever heard in a film. The movie is pure geek-escapism but written with so much confidence that it refreshes all the dusty heritage of a genre as old as cinema, with a harrowing fantasy dimension.<br/><br/>I mentioned before that Tony Scott's ""The Last Boy Scout"" had an entertaining value because we didn't have to care much for the plot, here not only we care for the story but also for the characters, and this is why the film is one of the few that belongs to the writer more than the director, a movie written by a man who loved films so much he decided to tell them his way... a young movie genius named Quentin Tarantino."

However, Slater and Arquette are unappealing and annoying as the leads and their characters are clichés. The violence is gratuitous and revolting.

A deranged love story surrounded by impossible odds. Using street smarts, sometimes, our hero ""Clarence Worley"" played by Christian Slater, mostly trips and falls out of the way of bad situations. You can see the train wreck coming as the calamity of errors start brewing from the very beginning to it's climatic end.

Slater's career was still new but it started to take off shortly after this film. Brad Pitt was pretty much a nobody back then and many of my friends are fascinated to the role he plays in this movie. Samuel L. Jackson's stock continued to rise while Patricia Arquette's remained below the radar. Gary Oldman gives a phenomenal performance and should have been nominated for an award, he is a brilliant actor.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","1","4","30 April 2005"," Very pulpy... perhaps too pulpy for my tastes
","I'm not sure what would have made this film more appealing to me... maybe Tarantino should have directed it... maybe someone other than Christian Slater should have played the lead role... maybe there should have been fewer deaths... maybe the film should have been shorter. As is, the film just didn't interest me all that much, and I only really paid attention to the first few and the last few scenes. The plot never really got my interest, though I thought the love story between the two leads was surprisingly good. The pacing seems much too slow and jolted for a Tarantino film(honestly, either Tarantino should have been allowed to direct it or Scott should have written his own script). The acting ranges, but most of it is good. Slater is acceptable, but a good actor he is not. His performance is passable at best, and him being the leading man definitely took a lot out of the experience for me. The film never really seemed to take off or go anywhere... and not long into the movie, it was just waiting for the next guy to get killed. The dialog is typical Tarantino, meaning somewhat roundabout, but usually funny and/or insightful. The humor is pretty good, and also fairly typical Tarantino(though it too would have benefited from Tarantino directing the film). To make it perfectly clear; the film is clearly and obviously and in many, many ways a Tarantino film. His unique and easily recognizable style is here, just like in Reservoir Dogs, both volumes of Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. However, this is, by definition, not a Tarantino film. He didn't direct it, and believe me, it shows. Scott just doesn't ""get"" Tarantino's style, and messes up so many of his trademarks(most notably, he removes the important non-linear time-line) and references, stuff that Tarantino never would have blown, not in a million years(here I feel it is necessary to point out that I am not a fan of Tarantino's). Yes, that's what really brings this film down; another director trying to shoot a story that Tarantino has put together, and who completely misses the boat. Just for the record, an example of a director's perfect use of a Tarantino script is the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino collaboration From Dusk Till Dawn. Go see that one before even thinking about this one. I recommend this film to Tarantino/pulp fans. Give it a chance. Just don't expect a Tarantino film. 7/10"

"mattymatt4ever","8","1","4","20 April 2001"," Truly magnificent entertainment!
","""True Romance"" is a hopped-up, hyperkinetic action piece from Tarantino, who wrote the script.  It parallels with ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" on the violence level.  Well, Tarantino's films are known to be violent, but more in quality than abundance.  ""Pulp Fiction"" didn't have A LOT of violence.  It simply had that scene in the car where the man's head got blown off and blood splattered all over.  That shocked viewers--Well, most of them, it didn't shock me--to the extreme.  <br/><br/>This movie has all the familiar Tarantino-ish elements--the extremely witty dialogue, the vivid character development.  The film sometimes goes over the top, with a plot that's pretty implausible and based on coincidence.  But it's handled in such a slick, intelligent style.  Therefore, it doesn't look like a poor excuse to showcase gratuitous action and violence.  Like all of Quentin's work, we get to know every single character--even the supporting ones--on a very intimate level.  He has great respect for his characters. Even if the character is going to get blown away in a few minutes, he wants us to get to know that person.  And that's his main tool in getting the audience deeply engaged in his films.  In Tarantino's eyes, there is no minutiae.  The characters will have a conversation about what they would call a Big Mac in France if it enables us to get into that someone's mind. Because that's what real people talk about.  Much like the dialogue exchange between Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette in the diner.  We get to know the two of them, through unpretentious dialogue, what kind of movies they like, what kind of music they listen to, etc.  How often do you see character development like this in an action movie?<br/><br/>Just like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown"" there are many quotes that stick out in my mind and love reciting at my leisure.  As well as dialogue, there are many memorable characters.  Gary Oldman sticks out the most, as the ebonics-speaking pimp Drexl.  A character like that really proves Oldman's versatility as an actor.  How often will you see a sophisticated English actor take on a role like that?  He blurts out the film's most memorable quote:  ""He must've thought it was White Boy Day.""  Christopher Walken also makes a brief, but memorable, appearance.  The dialogue between him and Dennis Hopper is intense, and it's one of the pivotal moments of the film. To watch two magnificent actors like that in the same scene is always a treat.  It's like when Robert DeNiro came face-to-face with Al Pacino in ""Heat.""  <br/><br/>I also enjoyed Slater's ""Elvis fetish.""  I'm not part of the Elvis fan club, but I take enjoyment in Elvis's music and persona.  Therefore, you can expect to hear a few of The King's famous hits in the soundtrack.  The film opens with a very funny and original scene in which Slater talks to a random woman at a bar about his feelings for The King, and that he'd do as much as f**k Elvis if he had the chance.  <br/><br/>The director is Tony Scott, so naturally the action is also emphasized.  I thought some of the action scenes were overlong and gratuitous, but they often worked.  With the film's fast pacing, there's never a dull moment, so I couldn't complain.  This is a type of movie that is so energetic, so original and so entertaining that you can't turn it down, despite its flaws. <br/><br/>""True Romance"" is a wild ride that keeps its foot pressed firmly on the gas. I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Tarantino, a superb ensemble cast and basically anyone who just wants to have a damn good time.  'Cause you definitely won't be disappointed!<br/><br/>My score:  8 (out of 10)"

","There is simply no denying the terrific platform given to an ensemble cast of gritty character-actors, but the problem with Quentin Tarantino's Tony Scott directed TRUE ROMANCE are the two leads... <br/><br/>Christian Slater's Clarence Worley and his gift-turned-girlfriend Alabama, played by Patricia Arquette, lack both chemistry and experience, seeming more like friends of the apartment-dwelling briefcase guys massacred by the following year's PULP FICTION killers Jules and Vincent than anyone those particular assassins would spend time conversing with, or admiring. Slater spouts pop culture diatribes - ranging from Max Julien to Carol Speed to Richard Pryor (THE MACK cast) to Sonny Chiba to Spider Man - like he's just learned how while Arquette's voice grates on the nerves, and beyond.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough: After what was supposed to be a one night stand, Clarence falls so hard for Alabama that he decides to get rid of the person who makes her what she is, or what she used to be, a whore... And they eventually wind up with a ton of cocaine as mobsters and cops dog their heels. Backing up to an important scene, straight out of Woody Allen's PLAY IT AGAIN SAM replacing Elvis with Bogart: Clarence, a hardcore Presley fanatic, has a hallucinatory conversation with The King (Val Kilmer), who suggests he follow through on a particularly violent urge...<br/><br/>Though you'd think Elvis gave Clarence more than advice. Maybe a superhero pill since the transition from kung fu cinema fan/comic book seller to ultra violent pimp killer is so quick and unsupported, during the rest of the movie - where real adults take part in some intense interactions - our lovestruck Bonnie and Clyde seem like passengers in what's supposed to be their very own ride.<br/><br/>For cinema history's sake, TRUE ROMANCE was the script Tarantino sold to give him the last-minute power to replace Monte Hellman as the RESERVOIR DOGS director. And on paper, ROMANCE is extremely unique and, most importantly, non-linear, an uncommon style before PULP FICTION paved the way. So the mainstream Tony Scott put the story in order, threw in a glossy Aerosmith track, shoots Clarence and Alabama's initial love scene like a steamy TOP GUN sex scene, and provides his usual choppy closeups resembling inserts in a grainy music video.<br/><br/>Not that TRUE ROMANCE doesn't have value: The famous Dennis Hopper to Christopher Walken ""Am I Lying?"" monologue is good (for two characters we hardly know as the writing trumps the acting) and there's a handful of fitfully edgy moments set within a sparse Neo Noir backdrop and yet, strangely enough, at times the retro-soaked Tarantino dialogue, not spoken on his own stage, feels more of a neurotic intrusion within Scott's gritty template than the engine of a potential hot rod that, even after twenty long years, just can't shed that new car smell."

","""True Romance"" starts out peculiar enough to make it a tad unique and special. An Elvis loving comicbook store manager named Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) has a rendezvous with a woman named Alabama (Patricia Arquette). What seemed like a happenstance sexual encounter was really a pay-for-sex transaction set up by Clarence's boss. What could not have been known is that they would fall in love and get married the next day. That was as cute as it got, and IMO, as good as it got.<br/><br/>It only devolved from there.<br/><br/>Though Alabama was now Mrs. Worley and had no intentions of ever going back to being a ""call girl,"" Clarence couldn't release the thought of her ex-pimp, Drexl (Gary Oldman). So groused was he by the thought of her pimp, he decided to go kill him. Why? For violence. This was a Tarantino written movie after all, so we got plenty of violence and plenty white people uttering the N-word.<br/><br/>Clarence, in an effort to get Alabama's belongings after blowing away Drexl and his bodyguard, actually took a suitcase full of uncut cocaine. So, after having become a killer, Clarence also became a drug dealer and the whole affair was ""so cool"" to Alabama, who was mentally stuck in kindergarten.<br/><br/>As all of these different characters entered the movie in one way or another-- being connected to the drugs in one way or another-- I knew that there would be a lot of blood and that Clarence and Alabama would live HEA (happily ever after).<br/><br/>That's precisely what happened as a henchman (James Gandolfini) couldn't dispose of a petite blond. As an actor (Bronson Pinchot) couldn't help but expose all the coke he had. As a producer (Saul Rubinek) couldn't help but buy a suitcase full of coke. As a police squad bungled a drug bust. As a mob walked in on said drug bust to turn it into the OK Corral. And as a heartbroken near-widow decided to shoot a cop. It was a bloody disgusting finale that was supposed to be poetic and romantic in its bloodiness.<br/><br/>I do believe you can have righteous, poetic, or even romantic bloodshed.

There's never any doubt about it, though, so we don't have too many domestic disputes, no anguish over whether the two will find spiritual fulfillment in one another, no tearful complaints from the wife that the husband is married to his career, nothing cute at all, as a matter of fact. Adequate support is provided by Bronson Pinchot and a couple of others, including several one-day walk ons by figures you'll recognize at once.<br/><br/>In possession of half a million bucks worth of cocaine, which they are willing to part with for half that amount, just to avoid the hassle of cutting it and selling it, Slater and Arquette take off for Hollywoodland where, as everyone knows, the cocaine is as ubiquitous as the car exhaust. The mob, however, does not approve of Slater's absconding with their ""cola"" and are in pursuit, at the end of which they (and the cops too) catch up with the couple during a deal with a Hollywood mogul surrounded by well-armed gentlemen. The Hollywood goons shoot at the mob, the mob shoots at the goons, and the police shoot at everybody. The air is filled with feathers from exploded pillows as Arquette and the wounded Slater sneak out and head for Mexico.<br/><br/>It's funny, but it's a pretty gory movie too. James Gandolfini shows up at Arquette's apartment and demands to know where the coke is. Arquette can't stop giggling as she tells him that there's a Coke machine at the end of the hall. She giggles through howls of pain even as he beats her to a pulp and throws her through walls. She winds up a bloody mess. It would be nice if professional make up personnel would remember that blood in the open coagulates and turns dark after half an hour. Here, as elsewhere, it's vermilion throughout.<br/><br/>Despite the tumult, it's amusing. At times the dialog reaches for the keen.

","If you compare this to another Tarantino flick (let's go with ""Pulp Fiction""), ""True Romance"" offers a load of memorable bits; the Sicilians conversation; Brad Pitt's classic stoner; Bronson Pinchot; Gandolfini's merciless beating; the absurd shootout at the Ambassador. This movie's full of funny dialogue - and with that, some pretty gruesome violence. For me, it's not very cohesive, and once we leave Detroit for California sunshine (when it goes overboard with the cigarette smoke and filtered light) it loses something. The first act is where the sweetness between Slater and Arquette really shines; once they get the drug deal rolling, we lose Walken and that cute couple and it's a standard Tony Scott movie. We get back to the romance at the end, but by then, I really did miss Walken (and Gary Oldman - man, that guy's nuts).<br/><br/>It's the loud and in-your-face style that I wasn't really onboard with. Some Scott movies work pretty well. Some really don't. This was somewhere in the middle. And don't get me wrong, I'm not averse to violence; far from it. But here, it takes control.<br/><br/>6/10"
"OutlanderOmega","8","0","1","17 March 2015"," Amazing, while Comparable to Pulp Fiction
","Pulp Fiction is seen as Tarantino's best movie, but True Romance is overlooked. While it wasn't directed by Tarantino and doesn't go into situations as bizarre as Pulp Fiction, True Romance was one of his first screenplays. Fortunately it was picked up by Tony Scott after being sold. You know how people say things are ""high-octane"" when the stuff has energy, but they don't want to think of a real way to explain it? Octane is the oxygen in gasoline that makes it burn slower in cars to get more mileage. This movie had the right amount of octane to be fast-paced, but not blow past its human moments. There was plenty of nitrous-oxide on the way to help it be batshit crazy.<br/><br/>The first twenty minutes of this movie were insane. We see a ridiculous love story that's believable and very well acted by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. We see a shootout with a wigger pimp played by Gary Oldman. And most importantly, we see a huge briefcase of cocaine fall into the couple's possession, forcing them to sell it in Hollywood. The story wastes no time moving right along to the conclusion that is a solid example of convergence.<br/><br/>The one thing that threw me off was the score. It wasn't fitting in a lot of scenes. Hanz Zimmer is the man as far as movie scoring goes, but it was awkward in this film. It wasn't crime drama music. It was we're-going-to-the-beach-with-our-xylophones-and-bongos-man kind of music. This got in the way of some deeper character moments that would have been better left without music at all, let alone this music. Halfway through the movie this trend of unfitting music tapers off and doesn't disturb the torture scene, the climax, or a few other key pieces.<br/><br/>I loved the hell out of every scene in this movie. It was a prime example of both crime and drama. Character is so often shoved to the side in an act of domestic violence by its abusive owner: action. In True Romance, the two concepts were married and stayed together until their chaotic, but fitting and synchronous passing in the last scene. Should I meet the cast and crew, I'll blow them all over-exaggerated air kisses. Mwah to you. Mwah to you. Mwah to this movie. Entertainment with sympathetic characters has happened before us, let it not be forgotten."

","Having watched True Romance, I have now seen every film that Quentin Tarantino has had a major involvement in (i.e the films he wrote and directed, not the ones he presented). It's fair to say that none of them have disappointed me - except Jackie Brown, but I'll moan about that if and when I review it- and True Romance is absolutely no exception!<br/><br/>I loved this film, fair and square. But what's so intriguing about it is that it's unlike any of Tarantino's other films...maybe that's because he didn't direct, he only wrote it, and it is slightly lovy dovy - not something I would expect from Quentin! Most of the soundtrack is songs I would never really expect to hear in one of Q.T's flicks (espically the song that's played almost every time someone has an intimate conversation) and a lot of the cast I just would never expect to see in association with him. That may sound a little negative but come on, ask yourself, before you heard of this film, did you really expect to see Gary Oldman in a Tarantino movie...I don't think so! Having said this though, when you listen to some of the dialogue, you can instantly tell it's Q.T's words. I don't really know how to explain it but, you'll know what I mean. Oh and Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance too!<br/><br/>One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the cast. Gary Oldman (one of my fav's), Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. I'll be honest, I have never seen a Christian Slater movie (other than Robin Hood, but I don't count that as a Slater movie) and I wasn't really all that fussed about seeing him, but I tell you, he just really sits right with Tarantino's screenplay. Of course, I don't really think he was the only actor that could have cast has ""Clarence"", but he shone none the less. Once more, I felt that he really made a proper connection with Patricia Arquette, or rather ""Alabama"" - the love interest. <br/><br/>Christian and Patricia are the stars of the film and are in pretty much every scene, but all of the other big names get a maximum of 2 scenes - though I think Dennis Hopper had 3. This may come has a bit of a downer to those of you who are looking to see your favourite actor, but don't be disappointed - remember, Anthony Hopkins stole Silence of the Lambs and he was only in it for 15 minutes! Gary Oldman's performance was utterly staggering and slightly frightening; not only was he in a film I didn't him to be in, but he was also playing a role I could never have imagined him as. He plays...wait for it...a pimp who thinks he's black! Who'd of thought Commissioner Gordon could pull that off? <br/><br/>The one scene that Christopher Walken is in, and I mean ONE, is one of my favourite parts of the film. Chris just reels you in when he says ""I'm the Anti-Christ"" in his very thick accent! Now, I really enjoy Val Kilmer's films (don't ever mention Batman Forever to me though, that film just makes me weep) and I was looking forward to him playing another one of these amazing cameos, but the credits rolled and I just couldn't for the life of me remember seeing him and I'm sure that those of you who watch this film, and don't watch Val on a loop, will feel the same way. I looked at his name in the credits and it says he plays a character called ""Mentor"" and I had no I idea who the hell he was. But, then it hit me, there are two scenes in the film where Clarence (Slater) is MENTORED by his hero, Elvis Presley, and when looked back at those scenes I thought that Elvis did sound quite a bit like Val's character in Tombstone. So now you know...and knowing is half the battle! Though his face is blurred, so you can't see his questioning face.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is simple to judge, all of the songs that feature are stuck in my brain and...I like it!<br/><br/>People who will like this: Tarantino fans, Oldman fans, Walken fans, Slater fans, Rom-Com fans, Gangster fans<br/><br/>People who won't like this: Those who fancy Val Kilmer, those who didn't like Platoon due to it's over-repeated main theme"

","I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art.<br/><br/>Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch.<br/><br/>There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget.<br/><br/>The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made."

","Truly a heavy dose of Pop Culture not only inhabits this Movie but is this Movie. It is grit with sugar on it and Hard Boiled cooked soft. It is a stylish overdone Mall Movie with Grindhouse roots, but tamed enough to be date worthy.<br/><br/>A Fantasy Film for teenagers and Young Adults that is so ""Hip"" it can be at times quite snazzy. There are some truly memorable scenes and the two leads are attractive and engage with so much energy that it is electrifying. <br/><br/>The Movie is very violent and full of trash talking and clever twists and turns and it has a buzz that is infectious. There are some real Characters here and fanciful fictional they may be they are enormously entertaining. The best parts of the Film are as good as any at the time and realized a new Screen Writer's entry into Hollywood.<br/><br/>There are a few things that keep this from being the Director's and the Writer's best. It is just so heavy-handed at times that it almost loses its edge. The two cops for example are so over the top that they become almost unbearable (""I love this Clarence guy"") is not only used once but again and again. The Movie Producer and his aid almost bring the whole thing to a point of asinine absurdity that is intolerable. And perhaps a few other irritants, like ""Dick Ritchie"".<br/><br/>But overall one cannot deny that this is entertaining stuff for the in-crowd and is Tinsel Town glam and ""collar up Cool"" that is Tarantino turf and surf, prepared by Tony Scott."

"orbitsville-1","8","0","1","19 January 2013"," Nerd Rules
","The spirit of Elvis inspires comic-bookstore employee Clarence (Christian Slater) to do great things. Or is it his sudden love for wild-girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette, who did a mini-run of playing women who fell only for comic-book/movie geeks with more guts than attention to detail; see the film Ed Wood, from the following year) that makes him stand up to possessive pimps, and skip to Hollywood to sell stolen cocaine? Clarence's charisma seems at first a bit implausible; his adeptness at surviving lethal situations would better suit a guy who has stolen drugs and call-girl from gangsters every other day. But Clarence is that much more charming as we realize he is simply unleashing the superman who has been waiting inside him for just such a chance to battle his way past anything that wants to spill his entrails. Clarence and Alabama are too likable for a viewer to want them any other way; the more they run from impending torture and death and gangster smart-aleckiness as only Tarantino can write such stuff, the more it seems like just a trick to lure various creeps into their clutches. The lowlifes never quite see what hits them--if Clarence and Alabama are good at one thing, it's being underestimated. Sometimes this even compensates for Clarence constantly leaving a trail that Wrongway Feldman could follow.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes involves a cadre of gunsels, led by Christopher Walken, getting led to Clarence's father, played Dennis Hopper, thanks to Clarence's carelessness. The gangsters want the father to lead them to the son and his new girl. Walken using scare tactics on Dennis Hopper--I mean, you could flip the roles around and have just as terrific a scene...and heck, it takes a Walken to scare a Hopper. Anyway, once that bit of ugly words and deeds comes to its conclusion, James Gandolfini gets sent off on his own to get the cocaine and bury our brave couple. Full marks to a superb Gandolfini, who corners Alabama/Patricia Arquette while Clarence is off in some washroom reading a book--ack!, no wait, he's off getting munchies. Now, ahem, James Gandolfini versus Patricia Arquette seems more of an easy bet than sorting out odds on Walken versus Hopper. That said, the scene contains a few surprises, and where it looked as if any later scene involving Clarence selling a monster bag of coke to a sleazy movie producer would be minus an Alabama, our wild, plucky heroine with the cocaine shows her hidden side too.<br/><br/>Tony Scott would later riff on his own finale to this movie by essentially borrowing it for another fun movie, Enemy Of The State, but both versions demonstrate that the bigger the crowd present for a drug buy (at least in the case of True Romance), the more rewarding for anyone who gets to watch it from a safe vantage point. The kitchen sink is not present for the final stand-off, but everyone else with a gun and an ego shows up. Perhaps Clarence and Alabama's dreams of flying to some tropical paradise with a couple hundred grand have finally led to a situation they can't charm their way out of: conflagration incarnate.<br/><br/>This is a cool, slick crime movie starring a loving couple who, though they are doing bad things to get their own slice of the pie, are not doing unspeakably horrendous things for more than their slice, while enjoying some nasty slicing. This separates our lovable anti- heroes from most of the other characters, and gives a fun, bubbly duo to cheer for, while the rats follow the cheese. Swiss cheese."

","Like most of you guys I have seen all Tarantino's movies but I have always liked this one the most - to me, as a writer, creating the story or screenplay makes you the author of a movie. Tarantino wrote the movie And Tony Scott was the director. For this kind of writing, directors you can hire.<br/><br/>The screenplay is the most important creative process. And Scott changed True Romance to give the movie a happy ending. That was to avoid depressing the US test audience (no doubt in LA). But these days movies make their money worldwide as downloads, so why not test a movie with an international audience? They may well have gone with the original Tarantino ending (which I will not reveal here. Don't want to spoil the lucky first time viewer).<br/><br/>True Romance is one of the greatest movies of all time - and one I watch every year. Along with Grosse Pointe Blank, John Wayne's True Grit, the Danish version of Girl With a Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World.<br/><br/>Do these movies have something in common? Yes - the story sells the movie. And it rolls along like a barrel down a hill -- you can't help watch where it's going. That is something the writers of the James Bond movies, including Skyfall (boring) should take on board.<br/><br/>Ian Flemming took the 'James Bond' name from a book on his shelf. The book, by James Bond is ""Birds of The West Indies"". That probably had a better story line than Skyfall.<br/><br/>Peter"

Inside is a large quantity of cocaine. He and Alabame head for California with the stolen coke in the trunk. They are pursued by a mobster, Vincenzo((Christopher Walken). Clarence stops at his father's for information on the pimp's murder, because his dad is a retired cop. Dennis Hopper is brilliant as he is interrogated by Walken in classic Quentin Tarantino dialogue. The 'n' word is used frequently as it relates to the Moors and the Italians shared ancestry, according to Hopper, as he gives Walken a quick history lesson regarding his family tree.

","Has it ever occurred to anyone else that ""True Romance"" (aside from being a completely wonderful movie) is a long homage to Terrence Mallick's ""Badlands""? The langorous voice-over narrative, the despicable controlling male figure, right down to the music, etc.,etc. Both films are wonderful variations on a theme. As Tarantino is quite the student of film, I don't think that these similarities are any accident. And I don't think it's a kind of thievery either. As T.S, Eliot once said, ""Immature poets imitate, mature poets steal"". I'm a huge fan of both these film makers, and I find it really interesting to see what they do with similar subject matter."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","0","5","4 September 2011"," High Energy, Non-Stop Violence
","True Romance (1993) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>High-energy romp written by Quentin Tarantino that all you need to know if that Dennis Hopper of all people plays the most normal character. Clarence (Christian Slater) marries Alabama (Patricia Arquette) after knowing each other one day and when he goes to her pimp (Gary Oldman) to get her things he ends up killing the pimp and running off with half a million in cocaine. Soon the new couple are on their way to California to try and sale it but gangsters are hot on their trail. TRUE ROMANCE, at its heart, is a love story between the couple but with Tarantino's name attached you know it's not going to be your typical romance. Instead we get a foul-mouthed, non-stop violent and at times insane action picture that starts off weird and just keeps getting nuttier as the film goes along. As I said, you know you're in for a wild time when you've got Dennis Hopper playing the most normal person. It should also be mentioned that the mad man Hopper gets a terrific scene with Christopher Walken, which is worth the price of admission. I mean, the two craziest guys of their era in a scene together? Tarantino's screenplay is full of everything people have come to love about him including the references to older movies and the dialogue itself is just so sharp and fresh that you'll have no problem connecting to these characters even when the majority of viewers would never have come into contact with their type in real life. The all-star cast is another major plus with Slater and Arquette doing a terrific job together and they really come off as a wild and crazy couple. The terrific supporting cast includes the already mentioned Hopper and Walken but there's also Val Kilmer playing Elvis, a mentor to Slater plus Brad Pitt as a pothead, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Rapaport, Saul Rubinek and James Gandolfini as one of the goons. The violence in the film is pretty brutal from start to finish with the pimp really getting a workout and the ending, which features the good guys doing battle with not only drug dealers but also gangsters and the police. The incredibly violent shoot out is so unrealistic but it's so stylishly done that you have no problem turning off your brain and enjoying. Some of the violence goes a tad bit too far and especially a sequence where Arquette gets her entire body broken to a pulp. There are a few minor issues with the story including how this comic book nerd could turn into a mad man over night plus the fact that it seems like the police are always missing no matter how crazy everything in the story gets. With that said, TRUE ROMANCE isn't a masterpiece but it's still a very entertaining little gem that contains enough energy for two movies and the solid cast really makes it a must see."
"nikolai7554","9","0","3","6 July 2011"," Should have been filmed by the king: Tarantino
","The only reason I give this film a nine out of ten is because of the directing. This is Tarantino's story and it should have been his film to direct instead of Tony Scott (not that he's a bad director). My reason for this thought, is that after watching every film Tarantino has created it saddens me that he hasn't fully constructed True Romance. The true Romance cast was perfect and he could have produced some sheer magic with the chosen actors. Also, the music would have been completely different if Tarantino was utterly in charge.Tony Scott was out of his domain filming True Romance. He simply did not display Tarantino's ambiguousness as it should have been. <br/><br/>Now you might ask yourself why I gave the film such a high rating. The answer is merely simple. This movie is still awesome disregarding my little problem. It grasped me from beginning to end. The unexpected kept on leaping towards me. I thoroughly enjoyed every part of the film, including the romantic one's (hence the title of the film). This is the core of Tarantino's complicated mind that has brought us so many masterpieces. Tony Scott did do a wonderful job with the complicated story he was given. It is only a shame that this film wasn't Tarantino's directing debut. <br/><br/>Any genuine Tarantino fan is required to watch this film!"
"Tom-But","8","0","3","5 April 2011"," A racist Dennis Hopper, stoned Brad Pitt and a cameo by Tony Soprano... Cool!
","Watching True Romance for the second time, I realised that it worked best to think of it as several brilliantly written and acted segments, strung together loosely by able direction (from the ""other"" Scott) and a ""whatever"" kind of plot.<br/><br/>When I think of this film, the moments that come to mind are Clarence and Alabama eating pie at a dingy little diner, Clarence confronting Gary Oldman's wigga Drexl in his crack den, the classic Sicilian scene between Dennis Hopper and the inimitable Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini interrogating Bama at the motel.<br/><br/>Then, I pause and try to remember how the characters got from the diner to Clarence's bed... And what happened directly prior to Gandolfini's scene? And how and when did Bama and Clarence get to L.A., anyway?<br/><br/>I can't freakin remember! And this is simply because these are the wind- down moments, the story progression which takes a back seat to the writing and directing style, which are interchangeable at best and, when worse, totally pointless. <br/><br/>This films is like Pulp Fiction lite, a collection of interrelated vignettes that ultimately build to something resembling a climax. The only difference is that I could virtually re-enact any and every scene of Pulp Fiction for you at the drop of a hat, because it's ALL vignette, and it's ALL written like these segmented parts of Romance, which is decidedly less memorable because of it.<br/><br/>But, I mean, what kind of criticism is that: ""It's not as cool as Pulp Fiction."" Jesus wasn't as cool as Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>So, 8/10, because the characters are endearing (especially Arquette as Alabama), the dialogue is undoubtedly Tarantino and because, watching it, I always envision what could have been a generic and insignificant film transcending its own genre and setting, all thanks to QT and, I suppose, even a little bit of help for Scott...<br/><br/>And also for the Sicilian scene. God, I love that scene!!!"
"tim-764-291856","9","0","3","15 January 2011"," Tarantino ""Lite""
","I refer to ""Lite"" as in a Tarantino movie with more room to breathe, where not everyone is a murderous gangster and a road movie with warmth and humour. Tarantino's screenplay absolutely bristles with electric energy.<br/><br/>True Romance is one of my favourite films and I'm now onto the Director's Cut, that director being Tony Scott. What makes True Romance work for me is the central casting of Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, neither obvious candidates for such; he a geeky, ever cheerful comic-book store clerk and she a kooky, but endearingly naive hooker who he 'accidentally' meets in a back-street cinema. <br/><br/>Clarence (Slater) has quietly divine interventions with Elvis (Val Kilmer), who guides him in mirrors of washrooms, and falls head over heels with the deliciously anatomically pleasing Alabama (Arquette). They kick around, watching kungfu videos, not particularly giving much of a damn about anything. <br/><br/>When Clarence hears of her past - and her vicious pimp (an intensely psychotic Gary Oldman, in dreadlocks) and visits him, he ends up with far more than he ever bargained for.<br/><br/>A welcome, natural tone comes when the couple meet up with Dennis Hopper as Clarence's security guard (& ex police) father, keeping the film's feet on the ground. The setting - a solemnly industrial Detroit winter-land, contrasts with lusciously sunny madcap road trip to L.A, a suitcase of cocaine to sell to a producer 'friend' of an actor 'friend' of Clarence's, this actor thinking he has a major part in a film. <br/><br/>Hopper gets a not particularly welcome visit from the requisite Christopher Walken, as the 'owner' of the white stuff. That is pure Tarantino and a highlight for many lovers of the film.<br/><br/>After the two leads, my favourite is Brad Pitt as the permanently stoned slacker, friend of the actor friend of Clarence's who habitually watches TV all day and casually invites mobsters in to join him in his leisure pursuits and then tells them all they want to know, totally not thinking of the consequences for his buddies. A slimline ""Soprano"", James Gandolfini who lays in wait for Atlanta gets the fight of his life and this truly becomes suspenseful and blood-splattering violent. Meanwhile Clarence, still on 7th heaven about his marriage is getting the biggest cheeseburger ever for them both as a celebration.<br/><br/>Black humour in abundance mocks Hollywood and its system, whilst cop Christopher Penn wires up another actor in the most awkward of places, who's been caught foul of the law when his dope literally ends up all over his face. It does get a little mad and bad and this is about the only part I think that lessens the film. A traditional shoot-it-up, bullet spraying ending leaves our couple running for their lives once again. <br/><br/>Do they live happily ever after? This is Tarantino, not Disney, so you'll have to find out for yourself.<br/><br/>A sublimely cool Chris Isaak song unrolls with the end credits. Overall, a very satisfying film that hits so many buttons - sharp script, black humour, sex, bloody violence, sunshine, wit, drugs, daft people, cool and clever people and a nice load of A-listers all doing spot-on roles with enthusiasm and skill."

","Let's face it... romance is weird. It can be sappy, it can be schmaltzy, it can be awkward, and it can be violent. For the film True Romance, we focus on the violent. The film is only written, not directed by, Quentin Tarantino, and you will not forget it. It is directed by Tony Scott, and props to him for handling a Tarantino script so substantially. True Romance is about Clarence Worley, played by Christian Slater. On a lonely night, Clarence meets Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) and makes love to her that night, only to find out later that she is a call girl. It doesn't matter to Clarence, however, as he eventually goes on to marry Alabama. The films begins as a sappy romance story, but it eventually leads to being a parody of the typical boy meets girl story. The trouble begins when Clarence goes and kills Alabama's former pimp (played by the always incredible Gary Oldman) and steals 500 grand worth of cocaine from him. The two star-crossed lovers find themselves in a mess when they skip town to try to sell the cocaine in Hollywood, all the while being chased by the mobsters who want their stash back. What could have been a silly and over the top disaster of a film, becomes something absolutely awesome.<br/><br/>True Romance is simply just fun and intense. The story is absurd and crazy, and it fits with all its hectic dialouge and nutty characters. Everything in this film works. Clarence and Alabama are the only two characters in the film that we begin and end with. The rest of the cast is a makeup of cameos, each serving their own great purpose. Gary Oldman's scene as the pimp Drexl is absolutely incredible, and Oldman proves once again that he is one of the greatest character actors of this age. Dennis Hopper appears for a couple of scenes as Clarence's father, and he masters his scenes with all his subtle excellence. In his final scene he appears with Christopher Walken, and it makes for one of the most intense and riveting scenes of the whole film. It is one that will keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense billowing over you. Other talents like Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, and even Samuel L. Jackson for a very brief scene, give each of their scenes the full appreciation and dedication they deserve.<br/><br/>I can't imagine what this film would have been like if it didn't have the kind of talent behind its dialouge like Quentin Tarantino. This kind of darkly comic, visceral, pulpy thriller is just what Tarantino excels at, and he turns a schmaltzy romance into a violent and drugged up thriller, that happens to be driven by a strange and very unconventional romance. Ironically, Tarantino was hardly a recognized name at this point in his career. His only credit at this point was his independent success of Reservoir Dogs (1992), that really wouldn't get the recognition it deserved until the massive success of Pulp Fiction (1994), the year after True Romance. And even though Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are, in my opinion, much better films, True Romance is not a film to be forgotten. It can definitely be considered a hidden gem.<br/><br/>True Romance delivers everything you want. It has a great story, snappy and quick witted dialouge, a great cast of characters, and some of the most wicked and bloodiest fight scenes you'll see, especially in films with the word romance in them. The title of the film is extremely fitting, because this film no doubt displays the true meaning of romance, which is sticking by your partner through thick and thin, and not leaving their side no matter what kind of trouble they get themselves into. And Alabama is just that kind of person for Clarence. These two characters are not good people, they are ruthless and violent in every way, but they are no doubt in love.

","In the way the plot is laid out and flows, it feels like an extremely fun B-movie. The way everything is done however, makes it something more than that. The fun factor comes from how characters react to certain situations (not similar to how real people would react) and this makes them create a character for themselves. They're unique and memorable. The plot is so over-the-top and incredible that it doesn't need to develop itself; it already developed itself from the get-go. But as it develops itself, you find yourself thinking that your next guesses to what might happen will indeed happen. What's is grand is that the unexpected pops out of nowhere, and gives you a moment of joy. You realized what you just watched was not something to be analyzed for how well it was done, but how well it struck you. Though it is well-done, it needs no further glance because your instinct reminds you that it was; your brain realizes it in an instance. Maybe not Oscar worthy, but it's a fun movie to experience."

","Revisiting Tony Scott's True Romance for the first time since somewhere in the throes of high school, I find that, as a lifelong Tarantino admirer, everything that tends to annoy me about Tarantino is more evident here than in any of the films he directed himself. And yet what is also evident is what shocked critics and audiences about Tarantino's work that jumpstarted the new generation of movies. There is an unhinged, guileless relatability to his material. Everything he writes is so rich and ripe. True Romance, nevertheless, implodes on itself. It is so inundated with homage, references and explosively gruesome set pieces that it seems to obliviously waltz right past countless opportunities for real drama so that it can continue on its path of totally, completely external and over-the-top narrative clockwork.<br/><br/>You see, when I was 12, I could invest myself in Clarence and Alabama's romance, because I felt like a Clarence, just like a lot of 12-year-old boys who watch a lot of movies. So that's how I fantasized that it would be one day, that we suddenly happen upon the perfect beautiful buxom blonde hooker who likes whatever we like, and worships us from then on. I'm 21 now. Perhaps the least interesting thing to me now is the eponymous romance. Like the relationship between Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon in director Tony Scott's first film The Hunger, the dimension to Clarence and Alabama's is too entrenched in male fantasy to be completely convincing. And let's not get so carried away with these theories about Clarence picking up where Travis Bickle left off. It's not exactly a ridiculous or even invalid theory, but let's look at what Clarence really is, which is why so many guys respond to this movie: He is in some way how we see ourselves when we are preteens and (successfully) acts upon all of the sexual or violent or adventurous fantasies that obsess him and derive from an overwhelming intake of popular culture.<br/><br/>This is clearly exemplified when Clarence goes to kill his new wife's pimp, specifically acknowledging that he is haunted by the fact that he's breathing the same air as him and getting away with it every day, that he doesn't deserve to live. Revenge and retribution take the thematic cake in the QT canon. In each Tarantino script, something goes awry in the life of some cruel, brutal and violent men due to the intentional actions, or farcical negligence, of other people. Brutal and violent behavior ensues, and yet there are glimpses of compassion and morality among the tough, cruel and depraved people that populate them, according to their own self-conscious universe. True Romance is the epitome.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie by far is its renegade structure of reserving entire self-contained scenes for characters who we haven't seen before and won't see much after, interacting with another character who's been introduced already and probably won't live to see his third scene. The pinnacle of the effectiveness of Tarantino's free-wheeling narrative feature is the much-discussed scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. In eight pages of dialogue, Walken delivers every line so coolly, with Hopper not much with which to answer except ""What are you talking' about?"" and ""I don't believe you."" But Walken creepily alternates between cruelty and empathy. Then when he slides in for the knockout, it turns out to be a cool, jaw-dropping rope-a-dope. The two veterans' attentiveness is unreserved, their performances candid, so they just lean back and Scott's camera catches them every time, never letting them fall.<br/><br/>Overall though, it's ultimately all dressed up with nowhere to go, only really indicating how it's supposed to be read through intertextual links with other films. Each character and plot strand is either transplanted from vintage plot formulas, specific films, or classic character and scene stereotypes. Characters don't relate to the world in any manner except through celebrity idols, movies, music or character embodiments emerging straight from those very worlds. Natural Born Killers achieved a traumatic degree of satire with such material, but True Romance takes itself very seriously, indulging it exactly what Stone held up to horrifying censure, much to its writer's odd chagrin. It's a soap opera hiding in the Heroic Bloodshed genre wrapped in a Badlands homage with exploitation dressing.<br/><br/>Tony Scott, the ultimate post-MTV filmmaker, has always worked exclusively in the commercial American industry. His films have always been unabashed business and mostly within the action/thriller genres. He's certainly not as mercenary as Michael Bay, and his choice of projects is more interesting. Regardless, he places emphasis on slick, high-concept narratives while drawing heavily from the diffused, neon-tinged visual style of music videos and commercials, complete with rapid-fire editing and prominent rock soundtracks. True Romance is no exception, and he retains his own familiar quick cuts, colored filters and swanky production design while achieving the allusive pop culture awareness of its writer's own directorial work. It's a big, fat pop culture chocolate cake. And just like regular chocolate cake, the older we get, the more we start to appreciate treats of nutritional value."

","A brazen thug-fest, played like an adventure story for boys.<br/><br/>Tony Scott (TOP GUN, DAYS OF THUNDER) directs TRUE ROMANCE, but it's got Quentin Tarantino's stank all over it - delicious dialog juggled with vicious gun play. Though Tarantino is listed only as ""writer,"" TRUE ROMANCE seems to be the middle child of what could be construed his breakout trilogy, bookended by RESERVOIR DOGS (1992) and PULP FICTION (1994).<br/><br/>Comics/kung fu geek Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) marries naif hooker Alabama (Patricia Arquette) after just one night of molesting her mungus ta-tas, and resolves to rescue her from debauchery and bad people (which is somewhat ironic, considering he uses a big shiny gun to do so.) Cross country to The City of Angels they flee, with $5 million in cocaine that Clarence unwittingly steals from Alabama's pimp after a Very Serious Shootout.<br/><br/>So begins a series of vicious vignettes, featuring a smörgåsbord of delicious cameos. Dreadlocked Gary Oldman is Alabama's pimp Drexl, more nigga than wigga (""He musta thought it was White Boy Day!""); diabolical Christopher Walken is unstoppable mob boss, Mr. Coccotti, who slams up against the immovable force of Clarence's working class father (Dennis Hopper) in the most intense genealogical examination of ""the n*gger gene"" this side of a Klan rally; James Gandolfini is - what else? - a hit-man, which would inform his own breakout role soon enough in THE SOPRANOS; Brad Pitt, hilarious in a tiny stoner role; Michael Rappaport is Clarence's bad actor buddy who just landed a role on T.J. HOOKER (Clarence: ""You get to meet Captain Kirk!""); Val Kilmer as Clarence's inner Elvis monologue.<br/><br/>If ever there was a dialog-driven scene for aspiring young actors to hone your emotive palette, grab the few pages of Hopper and Walken. If you can pull off the galaxy of nuance between those two acting leviathans seemingly jovially discussing telltale signs of lying and eggplants, yet with the undercurrent of lives in the balance, you're ready. Call William Morris.<br/><br/>Honorable mentions to Bronson Pinchot (with sweater tied around neck, like he is part of a Country Club who is embarrassed to admit he is a member) as a director's gopher, misrepresenting himself as only those whom Country Clubs repudiate can; and Saul Rubinek as the esteemed Hollywood director so egotistic he believes he can have someone killed if they cut him off on the highway.<br/><br/>With the uplifting music of Hans Zimmer sparkling the savage storyline, TRUE ROMANCE is a paean to youth and freedom and impulsiveness and righteous wrongdoing, oozing that insouciant hipness that Tarantino does so effortlessly. And yes, it all leads to that Tarantino trademark of everyone pointing a gun at everyone else.<br/><br/>True love is so much more romantic when hookers and drugs and guns are involved."

","""I'm not lying to you. And I swear from this moment forth...I will never lie to you again."".<br/><br/>Everyone knows that True Romance was written and sold by Quentin Tarantino. Then came the spat between Tarantino and Tony Scott when Scott wouldn't allow the rights to revert back to Tarantino, so he could direct it. And it's not a surprise that Tarantino would have wanted to direct it, because it's a great movie.<br/><br/>The title is correct, the movie is about a romance. A romance surrounded by all the stylish violence and well-written dialogue that you would expect from a Tarantino movie. <br/><br/>Call girl Alabama (Patricia Arquette, the best part of the movie) and store clerk Clarence (Christian Slater, in the best role I've ever seen him in) meet and fall madly in love one night. The next day they're married, and Clarence gets the notion in his head to kill Alabama's former pimp. It's all cascade of drugs, violence, mobsters, cops, and movie producers, from there.<br/><br/>I don't know if there has ever been an on-screen couple that I rooted for more than Alabama and Clarence. They both go through A LOT of stuff for each other. Their relationship is never melodramatic is sappy, it's the kind of thing that puts a smile on your face to see two people who are just obviously perfect for one another. You can't help but want the two of them to get out off all this okay.<br/><br/>I can't help but think that the music used in the movie would have been better if QT had been able to direct it, but there's not much else about the movie that I can complain about. The cast is great, it's very funny, and the pacing is outstanding. Any fan of Tarantino owes it to their self to see this."
"Samiam3","8","0","1","11 June 2010"," Crazy fun (even without Tarantino's direction)
","Quentin Tarantino is not in the director's chair, but True Romance feels almost entirely like his product. It has all the trademarks of the auteur he would amount to in the years that followed; the film is delightfully hammy, sprinkled with amusing banner which shows (among other things) a love for the cinema. It has a dose of Asian cinema to it, and the violence, while gratuitous, is effectively satirical. It features a cast of highly familiar faces, some who can act some who can't, but everybody pulls their weight here, and nobody upstages anybody else.<br/><br/>In scene one, Chrisitian Slater sits at a bar and tells the girl next to him how he wishes he could be Elvis. It is ironic considering he got his wish seven years later, backing up Kevin Costner in 3000 Miles to Graceland. Tarantino loves bar scenes. Were he in the director's chair, this intro would be longer.<br/><br/>So who IS in the director's chair then? True Romance is a film by Tony Scott, (who probably needs no introduction). Tarantino would surely not give his script to anyone unless he felt they would match his vision or intended approach. Scott clearly achieves this. The movie is played mostly for fun, yet it doesn't get carried away. Scott's direction is progressive. Tarantino films are much more slower. Even though True Romance gets increasingly more convoluted, so to does it get funnier, and it comes with a pretty good pay off. <br/><br/>True Romance is definitely a forerunner to Pulp Fiction. Back in 1992, this would've been a good hint to the critics of what was to come from Quentin Tarantino. Pulp Fiction was definitely his most inventive feature, but True Romance may be more fun."

","Bravo to Tony Scott who directed this film. I was really quite impressed with the outcome of this film. It was a Tarantino script which practically guarantees the viewer that what they are about see is full of wonderfully crafted violent sequences, smart storyline and wonderful characters that are wildly entertaining and sometimes dark and mysterious.<br/><br/>So, the movie's plot is really quite simple. it centres on a loner guy, Clarence (Christian Slater), who inherits a call-girl, Alabama (Arquette) for one night on his birthday thanks to his boss whom we never meet funny enough. Anyway, Alabama pretends to be interested in kung-fu movies and comic books in order to entice Clarence. She succeeds. Alabama however, after a night of steamy love-making with Clarence, falls for him and admits it along with the admission of her being a call-girl. The flow of events that follows are really quite intriguing and are punctuated with as star-studded cast that is bound to wetten the taste-buds of any movie buff. We have Gary Oldman as Drexy Spivl, a cocaine obsessed WIGGER of a pimp who Clarence kills when he arrives at Drexl's joint to pick up Alabma's possessions. Then we have Val Kilmer as Clarence's sub-conscious alter-ego and despite never actually seeing his face, we are entranced by his words of wisdom to Clarence and we are persuaded into thinking of him as a kind of Elvis like character. Following on, we have Dennis Hopper as Clarence's father, an ex-cop whom is unwillingly and unknowingly entwined into Clarence's mess after Clarence kills Drexl Spivy and Hopper meets an untimely death at the hands of Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken).<br/><br/>Adding amusing turns are Brad Pitt as a stoner room-mate of Clarence's friend Dick and among others, Chris Penn as a hard-hitting but determined cop on the trail of some huge cocaine deals in and around Hollywood. Oh I cant forget Samuel L Jackson's brief turn as Big Don who is on screen for about 30 seconds discussing eating pussy and ass. Hilariously vulgar!<br/><br/>Scott uses vivid colours and compelling dialogue to entrance the viewer and the film is given a somewhat light-hearted tone thanks to the xylophonic jingle of Hans Zimmer.<br/><br/>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and wasn't deluded beforehand into expecting some sort of masterpiece that should ave swept me of my feet. No, what I expected was a well-scripted, well-acted and skillfully directed film that produced a few laughs and thrills. That's exactly what I got and was entirely satisfied. <br/><br/>9/10. Highly recommendable!"

","After getting married Clarence (Slater) and Alabama (Arquette) run off with stolen drugs and attempt to sell it which leads a big drugs baron to chase after them Arguably Tony Scott's most violent film shows a true dynamic of criminal justice and vigour that could have only been well executed by the man in the know, Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>As of its release in 1993 there was a collection of relative unknowns starring in this picture that has all gone on to be huge in Hollywood. Pitt, Kilmer, Slater, and Oldman the list is endless. For the already established stars of Hopper, Walken amongst others this was one of their crowning glories. Who can forget the ""eggplant"" scene with Hopper and Walken, a truly outstanding confrontation where passions, opinions and controversies are running riot.<br/><br/>Slater leads reasonably well from the front being engrossed into his role of jealousy and determination for a better existence. However he is upstaged by hooker Alabama, played with a sophisticated sexiness by Patricia Arquette, a marvel who shines through and through. The character opens with a beautifully charming foreplay scene, to being incredibly distraught when involved with the crime sequences, a perfect femme fatale.<br/><br/>Despite the stunning array of Hollywood on show this is unquestionably about the startling narrative which encodes your familiar elements of Tarantino. Drugs, business like dealings, brutal killings and no holds barred language. And though Scott does a reasonable job directing this brutal story, there are moments when you would have liked the Pulp Fiction director to pick up the camera. The final scenes in the hotel could have done with a more flinching and focused styling whilst the drug taking sequences can be too kind and sparring of the audiences.<br/><br/>However Scott controls the necessary elements of the picture with a modest and still action orientated styling. For example the opening scenes in the bars and cinema are well managed and told with the scripting in mind and the confrontation between Hopper and Walken is certainly the best scene I've ever seen him direct.<br/><br/>The feeling of sexual orientation being significant is often stated in his films. The constant topless shots in Top Gun and here the carefully respected sex scene would otherwise be appreciative of the moment rather than posing to get viewers.<br/><br/>The ending in the hotel was good and quite stupid of me I had seen Enemy of the state prior to this and couldn't stop the comparisons flowing.<br/><br/>This is a great film. Flinching ordeal of a happy life dreaming mixed so fluently with shocking illegal crime activities and with an array of stars this is simply watchable."

","Here we have a movie that really had the chance to be great, and it even turned out great to some extent. First and foremost, the scene where Dennis Hopper explains Christopher Walken his cultural background. It is cited all the time, but that's just because it really is one of the best movie scenes of the Nineties, and definitely something among the best ever to flow out of Quentin Tarantino's pen. I think , Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are perfect in their roles and their relationship, their falling-in-love is set up very well by the script. I also totally dig this idea of really going through hell for love. And for that matter, I think the title is chosen very wisely, it's a ""True Romance"". But as the movie goes on and introduces new characters, it loses. Those police officers, Dick Richie, they were just patterns of characters, not real characters.

","True Romance is a film that has been rated very highly and rightly so, although I found that when Clarence and Alabama hit the road heading towards LA the film dies a little. Why? I guess because the first 30 minutes was the best start to a movie I have ever encountered and so once there was a change in pace the movie lost interest a little. If I were the director no way I'd kill off such a great character in Drexl so soon.<br/><br/>The movie did have a strong ending though when everyone was gathered at the hotel room for the exchange of money for drugs where a final shootout takes place.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Val Kilmer who played the mentor just before Clarence was about to make a decision - Killin's the hard part, getting away with it, that's easy.

Cops'd throw a party, man As long as your not at the scene with a smokin gun in your hand you'll get away with it This movie had so many well known actors who all played their part from Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper and a younger James Gandolfini. Even Brad Pitt put in a great performance as Floyd who sat around all day smokin drugs.<br/><br/>The only weakness I found in this movie was straight after Christopher Walken kills Dennis Hopper which was a scene that was brilliantly written.<br/><br/>True Romance was a well written and acted out movie!!!"

","""True Romance"" is one of the top crime/adventure/love stories of the 90's. Written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott, the film portrays love, fate, action, and crime on multiple levels. An up-beat score by Hans Zimmer (using major tones with steel drums) keeps the movie from delving into any state of melodrama.<br/><br/>Christian Slater heads up the film as Clarence, a young kung-fu movie buff/comic book store employee who, over the course of one night, falls in love with Alabama (Patricia Arquette), a young, vibrant call girl. They wed and all is well until Clarence learns that Alabam's pimp, Drexel, was not the nicest of men (Gary Oldman). The confrontation that ensues results in Clarence and Alabama travelling across the country with a suitcase full of cocaine. To their later surprise, they are being chased by a number of mercenaries under the employment of Drexel's boss (one of them played masterfully by James Gandolfini in a ruthless pre-Sopranos manner).<br/><br/>Tarantino handles the dialogue masterfully, allowing the chemistry between Arquette and Slater to develop naturally. One of the most captivating scenes is an exchange between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. The truly unique dialogues occur between Slater and Kilmer, who plays the ghost of Elvis, Slater's imaginary friend. ""True Romance"" boasts an ensemble supporting cast, including Brad Pitt (in a very unique role), Samuel L. Jackson (In a very small role), Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, etc. Typical of anything Tarantino has his hands in, the film ends with a group of men armed to the teeth pointing large caliber guns at one another (Resevior Dogs anyone?). However, the scene becomes almost poetic under Tony Scott's direction. The background music is almost classical, slow motion is used effectively, and feathers pour all around the combatants from destroyed couches, as though they are fighting in a dream state.<br/><br/>Overall a solid movie with a strong plot, good character development, and all around exceptional performances. To those who shy away from the typically dark nature of Tarantino's films, note that ""True Romance"" has a happy ending."

","True Romance is a very famous film which benefits from possibly the greatest cast there has ever been, almost every single role is played by a well known actor, even some of the extras. The cast is lead by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette who aren't the biggest names True Romance has to offer, but do a fantastic job here in probably the biggest and best film they have been in. Clarence (Slater) and Alabama (Arquette) immediately have the care of the audience as they have a love that's so pure that are prepared to kill in order to protect one another.<br/><br/>It is clear that Tarantino wrote this, as many scenes are very violent, brutal and uncompromising. The scene between James Gandolfini and Arquette really highlights this due to the shock factor of violence towards a woman and then her bloody revenge. The contrast of the characters in this scene makes it incredible to watch, he is deadly calm whilst she is borderline hysterical.<br/><br/>The 'Tarantino Dream Scene', as I like to call it, is a conversation between veterans Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. It is an essential scene as it tells the audience and Hopper's character that Clarence and Alabama are in more trouble than they could have ever imagined. The dialogue in this scene is very clever and gives Walken and Hopper a real chance to show their charisma.<br/><br/>In order to prevent the audience becoming bored by the violence, there are some comedic characters thrown in the equation which do wonders to lighten the mood and increase the enjoyment level of the film. The best example is Brad Pitt as Floyd, the permanently stoned room mate who constantly gives away the position of the lead characters.<br/><br/>Tony Scott is not the greatest director of all time but considering the screenplay, he couldn't go far wrong. I believe he was a better choice than Tarantino for this film however, as he changed the original ending which Tarantino wrote. Tarantino has a stubborn desire to make films 'non-Hollywood' which would have ruined this film.<br/><br/>Entertaining, touching and funny, this is one of the films of the 90s."

","Tarantino sold this script in the 80s to attempts to raise funds for the making of Reservoir Dogs. For me, this is a great shame. Tony Scott was handed the duty of trying to turn it into a great film after the success of Reservoir Dogs, but failed. Each scene is just about pieced together in the most standard possible way, and Scott brings absolutely nothing to film of any distinguishable note. The awesome cast, obviously attracted by Tarantino's script (which hard large parts edited by Scott, including a different ending), is undoubtedly a true ensemble of modern greats, and yet Scott does them no favours. He gives the film virtually no direction, and keeps everything simple and safe like many of his other films. The lead characters played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, seem dazed and confused through most of the film, and do nothing to grip the audience. Slater's character, for example, makes a bizarre transformation from loner to drug dealer, without ever really drawing a line between the two.<br/><br/>The film keeps itself moving but by no means at a excitable rate as you predict each scene before it starts. It's one saving grace however, is a truly fantastic scene between two Hollywood heavyweights - Walken and Hopper. In Chris Walken's only scene in the film, he dominates and becomes his ruthless Mob boss character. Hopper is superb as a father hiding his son's secret. Apart from this intense scene (you can cut it with a butter knife), the film has no other stand outs, and is quite disappointing and an anti-climax.... if only Quentin Tarantino could of directed it, we could of ended up with a far superior piece of film...<br/><br/>I would still recommend it to all film fans, if not only because of the Walken/Hopper scene... if it wasn't for that, there would be no point in seeing it."

","I discovered this buried treasure two years ago and was completely blown away.  For a film that has often been dubbed a movie geek's wet dream, it sure is a great ride.<br/><br/>As a film he wrote before he ever did Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino's script, brought to life by director Tony Scott, is considered to be a trashy first film where everything is ridiculously and overblown for the sake of being overblown.  But QT acknowledged this, and anyone who finds fault in this and likes his other films needs to recognize that this is a tribute to such films in the manner of Jackie Brown (Black exploitation) and Kill Bill (grindhouse cinema).<br/><br/>This film packs all the genres in just like Tarantino's other scripts, but this one benefits from one major thing: romance.  Many of the most ardent fans praise this as the reason they like this above all his work.  And if that doesn't suit you, the film's got a dozen more genres packed in."

","When you see the cast on this one, you just think to yourself: Now this must be a movie!! However, unfortunately, most of the stars only appear in brief minutes, like Samuel L. Jackson (you can hardly tell it's him) and Val Kilmer. I was disappointed that Gary Oldman's character (excellent) had only one big scene. Brad Pitt was fantastic, his character must be the coolest junkie I've ever seen on film (ok ok Johnny Depp was also terrific in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas). Also, most of these actors didn't even act together, which was a shame. The main characters are played by Christian Slater (not very good) and Patricia Arquette (ouch... how HOT can she get?).<br/><br/>
This film lives by ""flashes"" instead of the development of the story (which is pretty basic). For instance, the little ""chat"" between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, the fight between Gandolfini and Arquette, the Oldman vs Slater scene, any scene with Brad Pitt, and finally, the ending, were all memorable.<br/><br/>I saw this mainly because Quentin wrote it, but I guess that the Two Thumbs Up go to the director Tony Scott and the actors. Quentin made it possible, but they made it memorable. I guess it's just good team work.<br/><br/>If you just want to know if you should watch this or if it is a waste of time, well, I guess I would definitely recommend it for the scenes I mentioned, but don't expect an amazing plot. And also avoid this if you have a problem with constant shooting and bloodshed, because this one is loaded with it.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

","Send in the clones, a new era is born. In one of Quentin's first scripts we find trace elements foreshadowing the next decade of film. Threads of romantism weave the fabric of this crime epic filled with some of the most quotable dialouges and monolouges since they added sound to film. <br/><br/>
Plot: Cupid shoots an arrow in Detroit and sends a pair of young lovers to L.A. to make an early withdrawal from their newly found retirement fund. Then Quentin happens.<br/><br/>Risa Bramon Garcia & Billy Hopkins should be given Academy Awards. To assemble a cast which fits the script like a hand in glove. Slater plays our 'Hero' a comic book store employee who wills confidence backed by Elvis, his conjured 'Jimeny Cricket'. Patricia is our heroine with subtle glances, giggles and moxy that can beat a man to a pulp in ten minutes. Besides Christian and Patricia the rest of the cast is given very select supporting roles, with sometimes as little airtime as one scene. Regardless, every performance is truly memorable, whether it be Oldman as a Pimp City Wigga, or Walken as a ruthless Sicilian. Sizemore and Penn work magic together as Narcotics officers looking for the collar. Pinchot as the manic drama intern caught in the middle of the fiasco. Gandolfini as a ruthless thug who doesn't hold back when it comes to beating a woman. You really can not find a bad performance in this film. <br/><br/>Truly this is the case when the script moves the cast and vise versa. Tony Scott should not be ignored either, of 'Top Gun' status and forefather of post modern 'Hollywood' action flicks. He wagered against Hollywood odds by keeping as close to the script as possible. The steel drums on the sound track are placed so accurately it reminds the audience the title involves 'Romance'. The only problem I could have with this movie is the fact that it's filmed in chronological order unlike the script which segments the beginning in to the middle.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: A Must See! On my Top 5 List. This is a volitale movie, it combines scenes of simple social interaction with grave violence, you feel comforted and horrified at the same time. Overall you, when it is over you will find a new found love in cinema."

","Based upon a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown) and directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun, Enemy of the State) 'True Romance' follows the humorous and sometimes violent love story of young comic book store worker and Kung Fu film obsessive Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) and his wife, a former hooker named Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette). Through a situation involving Alabama's mean spirited pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman), the couple ends up with a big score of drugs and hit the road to LA in order to sell the drugs and to find a place to settle down. As they pursue the goal, Vincenzo Coccoti (Christopher Walken) tries to get his drugs back by using twisted mafia goon Virgil (James Gandolfini). Thrown into the mix are two cops looking to make a name for themselves (Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore), Clarence's friend Dick (Michael Rapaport) and his stoner buddy Floyd (Brad Pitt), a thickheaded Hollywood producer's agent Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek), and an enigmatic Elvis style mentor (Val Kilmer) and 'True Romance' is the result. The list of actors is impressive, not to mention Dennis Hopper as Clarence's ex - cop father. As the plot develops, many of these characters get more and more involved with one another until a huge shootout climax at the end involving many of these people.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Quentin Tarantino is, as usual, heavy on scorching, quick dialogue from everyone on board. The relationship between Clarence and Alabama is wild and filled with youth and vigor as the couple constantly expresses their physical attraction with one other. In other words, they have a lot of sex. While a good sum of the characters are criminals, Tarantino opts to make them distinct. While the cops speak quickly and in bursts of spit, characters like Coccoti are given more careful, slick dialogue and sometimes even monologues (a similar example can be seen in the character Bill of 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2'). They talk in rapid fire ways with a lot of personality and a lot of gusto, and Tarantino tries his absolute hardest to make it all sound real and clever. Like in 'Reservoir Dogs', he fails. While its not alone his fault, the relationship between Clarence and Alabama seems forced rather than natural. The audience is supposed to feel their passion for one another, but instead of throwing at us something to work with Tarantino simply tries to make up for it with sex scenes. The ""realistic"" dialogue doesn't come across that way, once again not every person in the world says ""f*ck"" every second line. These characters are incredibly basic and simple, with little to no depth underneath their looks.<br/><br/>Tony Scott, known for usually directing action type films doesn't exactly go the distance in the case of 'True Romance'. His direction follows what is on the page given to him by Tarantino, and while some of the performances are noteworthy it seems to be the case from the actors themselves instead of Scott's direction. Its a wonder how he assembled such a fine ensemble together, but he makes poor use of most of them, and such fine actors like Gary Oldman are given much smaller roles. There are some clever moments throughout the film, but nothing too noteworthy. It feels as is Scott's direction is patchy, and the violent comes of as brash and obnoxious. There are a few scenes of extremely graphic violence, but Scott seems to shove it so much in the audience's face that they turn away in disgust. It doesn't feel necessary to the story like it should. In the case of other films with high levels of bloody violence, its used to a level where it shows the means of the plot but in 'True Romance' its rubbish and it even detracts from the film.<br/><br/>I give some credit to 'True Romance'. Its by no means a bad movie, and the cast gives some solid performances all around. Tarantino's screenplay has its moments, and the movie is definitely entertaining but Scott's abusive direction and Tarantino's trademark messy screenplay aren't enough to propel the film into something ""good"". Instead, it turns out to be mediocre.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Tarantino was both erroneous and entirely unfair concerning the Sicilian people. Clifford Worley's remarks are as racist as white supremacist Arthur Kemp when he asserts that Sicilians are of a mixed race.  Worley is racist remarks use false historical evidence claiming this just for the sake of race baiting that the Moors are responsible for the injection of sub-Saharan African blood into Sicily. First fact is, the Moors were not black. They were Hamito-Semitic peoples, meaning that they began as Semites from the Near East and then absorbed physically similar Hamites, or Berbers, during their conquest of North Africa, prior to entering Europe.<br/><br/> Moors who colonized most of the Iberian peninsula for 800 years are estimated to have left a mere 3.8% genetic imprint on modern Iberians. Hence, those Muslims who held Sicily for a comparatively shorter period of just 250 years and, in their thwarted efforts to take mainland Italy, conquered various Southern Italian cities for periods of less than 100 years, had an even lesser genetic impact on Italian populations.<br/><br/>  Secondly the ""Norman"" King Roger II, the founder of the kingdom of Sicily during the first half of the twelfth century liberated the island from the Islamic yoke. His kingdom was mixed east-west culture and the development of its royal government the most advanced in twelfth-century Europe.   After Roger Sicily was the home to a large Jewish population, became Spanish Colony, and held under the Viceroys of Spain from the late 13th century to the early 18th century making the population more of a Judeo/Greco/EspaÃ±a blended ethnicity.<br/><br/>  Moreover, the unfortunate blacks that were brought enslaved into Europe by imperialists at the start of the Atlantic slave trade were  absorbed into their host populations, often by way of royal houses. It was Britain, France, Holland and Germany who were then the dominant colonial powers and slave traders.  <br/><br/>   Therefore, this leads back to Tarantino's statement which can now only be construed to be there for its shock value only; it is total untrue, and never be taken as fact. Unfortunately there are too many white racists out there who take lines from movies as Gospel truth to support and fuel the fires of their own prejudices. For certain, there will be more battles ahead dispelling the myths concerning Sicilian people.<br/><br/>Bibliography:For further information look up The Races of Europe, Chapter XII, Section 7, Italy, and http://www.geocities.com/racial_myths/italians.html"

Theres the love-story at it's center, not unlike Natural Born Killers (and even to an extent Jackie Brown). The stoner who sits on the couch all day smoking. The Mexican Stand-off.

","Well, i've been watching films like this and others since I was five, and i love them. Maybe not as much as i use to, but thanks to my dad movies wil always be a big part of my life. My dad once mentioned true romance when Gary Oldman and Tom Sizemore (Drexil Spivey and Cody Nicholson) where my fav actors (Tom still being one, but he's now and has been for a while heavily matched by Robert Downey Jr) anyway I once saw it at a car bootsale with my parents and bought it, i then watched it that day and it became my fav film. I admit, others have knocked it off the top spot occasionally, but when someone says fav film, true romance springs to mind. The acting is excellent, teh direction and gun fight at the end where masterly handled. And of course with Quentin Tarintino being one of the most brilliant writers of our time the dialouge and film itself is funny as hell. The characters u all get to know, there are great preformances lead by Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette, a whole load of famous cameos (Christopher Walken and Samuel L. Jackson to name a couple), Tony Scott is now one of my fav directors (Enemy of the State was also a Gem), and Tom Sizemore I think stole the film as Cody Nicholson, him and his cop partner Dimes were the greatest LA Cops ever, even if they were only in it for twenty minutes. All actors should take note of how to preform from this film, and take Nicholson's advice, 'Ur an actor act motherf****r!' A tour de force"

","I love this movie. I am by no means a Tarantino groupie (have only seen Reservoir Dogs once!!), but I rate this movie above Pulp Fiction (if only just slightly) Whenever I go to my local video store and can't find a movie to grab my attention, I reach for True Romance because I know I will get an enjoyable, action-packed, funny, interesting and totally engrossing 2 hours of entertainment. Slater and Arquette are great, but to see Walken, Hopper, Pitt, Galdolfino and (barely recogniseable as Elvis)Val Kilmer strut their stuff with no limitations is simply classic cinema. Just a great ride and possibly my favourite movie of all time.

","True Romance is one of those movies that could be easily mistaken for being just another pointless violent action movie.  What separates it is the love story at its core.<br/><br/>Penned by master-of-dialog Quentin Tarantino, True Romance is witty, touching, and quite badass.  The movie's plot is character-based, so the situations change around our main characters, played to key by Slater and Arquette.<br/><br/>Speaking of actors, this movie has one of the best-assembled ensemble casts I've ever seen, and they all play their characters to the bone.  Christopher Walken is the mobster ""antichrist"", Oldman is the violent psychopath, Pitt's a stoner, Hopper's a retired cop with just a bit of fire left in his blood. Together, they're both entertaining to watch, and have great chemistry (the Walken/Hopper scene is classic).<br/><br/>Overall very funny, violent, and Tarantino, True Romance also succeeds in being a genuinely good love story, that, despite all that blood, is really quite touching."

"magnoliaX82","7","0","1","5 December 2002"," True Romance (1993) [Directed by Tony Scott]
","NOTE: This review is in reference to the Unrated Director's Cut, and it may refer to some scenes not featured in the original release.<br/><br/>True Romance has for a long time been considered the middle-piece in a loose trilogy by filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, wedged in between the now-classic Reservoir Dogs (1992) and the always timeless Pulp Fiction (1994). However, I am urged to disagree with public opinion -- as is usual -- and shed some light on why True Romance is not a Tarantino film. Firstly, it is directed by Tony Scott -- a man who's had his moments, but should really leave movie-making to Ridley -- and, therefore, has a very shallow, action-based tone (despite it's desperate attempt to be categorized as independent). This is made extremely evident in some utterly ludicrous ""adrenaline-rush"" scenes (e.g. the roller-coaster segment) and in the inscrutably dull performance of Michael Rapaport (who plays a poor -- both financially and literally -- actor somehow capable of purchasing rare, out-of-print film posters, framing them, and hanging them on his wall). But I must confess that what irritated me most about True Romance was the ending. For those of you who aren't as well-informed about Quentin and this screenplay, the original ending (SPOILERS AHEAD) involved Clarence being killed in the Mexican stand-off and Alabama becoming a call-girl once again (eventually teaming up with Mr. White from Reservoir Dogs). Tony attempted to justify his compromise -- which is basically having Clarence and Alabama live happily ever after, despite the fact that stole a suitcase full of cocaine and pumped more shotgun shells in their opponents than any other two lovers I've seen on the silver screen -- by saying that (and I quote) ""I loved the two main characters so much that I wanted them to get away with it."" Although I may not speak on behalf of the reader or any other viewer, I didn't care at all for Clarence or Alabama. Perhaps if their roles had been given to more experienced and ""loveable"" actors, this ending would have worked. Okay, I will give this to fans of the film: Patricia Arquette isn't bad, but I couldn't stop thinking that Christian Slater looked like the devil. This said, True Romance does have some good aspects: the soundtrack was unique and worked well with the mood, Quentin cleverly incorporated Elvis' ghost into the screenplay, and supporting actors James Gandolfini and Chris Walken are great. The best thing about this movie, though -- and the only thing that keeps me from giving it a lower grade -- is Brad Pitt. His performance is, for lack of a better word, hysterical! And I found it very interesting that even though all he does throughout the film is lie on a couch and get high, he ends up causing half of the deaths in the movie -- and no one even knows it. Also, I feel compelled to mention the recently released 2-disc DVD set, which features Quentin's only audio commentary ever recorded, and a montage of the alternate ending. In conclusion, Tony Scott's interpretation of True Romance might have worked if Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs had never been made, but with shoes that big to fill, it can't help but become a failure.<br/><br/>Grade: C-"
"lovejam","7","0","2","29 November 2002"," Painfully Enjoyable
","Whenever I watch this movie, I have to get ready the mute button: that disgusting ""N"" word pops out of one of my favorite actors, and he says it more than once. The worst part of this scene, is that it's my favorite one(Rock/me/A Hard Place). Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper are the best actors in this entire movie. Not to put down the others, but doesn't anyone disagree that that scene is their favorite one? My favorite quote:""...it's better to have a gun and not need it, than to need a gun and not have it"". It rides along with that old boy scout motto: always be prepared, but Clarence's way has more lettering, and funnier. You forget that it's a romance until the ending, otherwise people focus on the violence and the profanity. Ridley Scott did a good job of handling Quentin's script (no comment on Oliver Stone's butchering of Natural Born Killers), but I want to see more of QT's direction, (and less of his acting). He'll use that disgusting ""N"" word, and we'll call him a genius, and I'll be venturing out to view his latest,""Kill Bill""."

"Maw7391","10","0","1","28 October 2002"," An incredible movie filled with top notch cameos of today's hottest actors.
","True Romance is my favorite movie of all time.  The story is compelling. The acting is exquisite.  The dialogue is what takes it to another level. The movie is funny in a weird way because of the dialogue.  Gary Oldman should have been nominated for best supporting actor if his role had been a little bit bigger.  Then again, you could say that about Christopher Walken's performance also.  The scene between Walken and Dennis Hopper was absolutely awesome!  Gary Oldman amazes me in every role he portrays.  An English actor that is able to ""nail"" that ""wannabe"" accent that Drexl has is just incredible.  It is a very violent movie but it was violent for the sake of being violent.  It was necessary to understand the charachters and their definition of ""True Romance"".  James Gandolfini shows his brilliance in portraying a mobster strongman which no doubt lead to his casting in The Sopranos.  Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn add interesting dialogue that I particularly found funny.  Even Bronson Pinchot had a good part in this flick.  Saul Rubinek was excellent in portraying fat cat movie producer Lee Donowitz. The Bottom line:  Great short performances out of Oldman, Walken, Hopper, Rubinek,Gandolfini and solid short performances out of Michael Rappaport, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn,Bronson Pinchot, Val Kilmer and Brad Pitt.  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette provide their best performances as the two main charachters who define ""True Romance"" a little differently than the rest of us.  I think the title of the movie threw off mainstream America and mislead them to believe it was a ""romance"" in the traditional sense."

","When it was said that True Romance was a ""Bonnie and Clyde for the 90's"", the statement was both true enough to be accurate and false enough to chase off those who may have really enjoyed this movie. What True Romance truly is is an old-fashioned romance put through the pop-culture blender that is the mind of Quentin Tarantino, then interpreted by the ever-imaginative Tony Scott. The actors are entirely comfortable in their roles and mesh together so well that it is hard to believe that many of them were only on set for a day or two. A word of warning: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! Foul language and over-the-top violence abound, but it is all done in good fun. If these elements are not enough to deter you from seeing a movie, do not deprive yourself of such a bona-fied classic entertainment. Bronston Pinchot is genius, Brad Pitt makes his part so much bigger than it really is, and Val Kilmer becomes the greatest actor to ever play Elvis without ever being clearly seen on camera. In short (though this review is anything but), great acting and clear directing took a great script with amazing action and hilarious dialogue and turned it into a classic film."

","Movies don't get much more well rounded than this.

Jackson, Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn will. Clarence and Alabama (Slater and Arquette) are on the run across America from the police and the mobe after Clarence kills Alabama's pimp and accidentitly steals his cocain, who he plans to sell to a big time movie producer (Rubinek). The script is a wild ride that is over the top and unbelievably fun. All the performances are superb, especially Christopher Walken as one bad ass gangster. Brad Pitt also provides some memorably amusing scenes as Floyd, a stoner roommate. Tarantino's script is fill of surprises and twists at every corner. I pose a question to all of you, tell me one action movie that doesn't have romance of some sort in it. Of course you can't, all action has romance, it is a marketing sceme to appeal to a larger audience. But this is not an action movie at all, no in fact it is a romance film with the odd gun battle and fist fight, think Thelma and Louise meets Pulp Fiction. All in all a great entertaining romp that will have you laughing and biting your nails with excitement while not killing a single brain cell. Who would have thought love could be this fun?"

","Before I watched True Romance I knew I would like it.  And as it turned out I liked every minute of it.  The main reason I knew this would be a good movie is because of the director, Tony Scott.  Tony Scott also directed ""The Last Boy Scout"" which was an awesome movie and one of my all time favorites. But each line in the movie has the Quentin Tarantino trademark on it as Quentin Tarantino did write this movie.  I find this film similar to ""Reservoir Dogs"" because at the end of the movie at the climax you have everyone in the same room pointing guns at each other.  The cast in ""True Romance"" is great from Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, and Christopher Walken.  I especially like Gary Oldman's character as he plays as a pimp.  And you have Val Kilmer playing as Slater's imanginary friend as Elvis.  A great movie.  9 out 10."

","Tarantino's script for this film is very mature...its best viewer is a viewer who watches a lot of movies.<br/><br/>Many of the scenes are striking not only for their plainly-observable actions, but also for the method by which the scenes are played out.<br/><br/>IMO, it is difficult to write a movie script that talks about movies, yet Tarantino expertly weaves in and out of characters, drama and violence as though he his stitching his own kickass boxing gloves for a brawl out West.<br/><br/>True Romance consists of scenes that stand firmly on their own ground. You could pluck a scene from True Romance and show it as its own clip and the viewer might walk away slightly dazed but with a lucid point of view.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>-The Dennis Hopper & Christopher Walken scene<br/><br/>-When Alabama kills that guy<br/><br/>-All of the Drexl scenes<br/><br/>-All of the Lee Doniwitz scenes<br/><br/>Nevertheless, True Romance is packed with interesting characters that offer cohesion - - more so than just by good actors reading good lines. The actors seem to be knowledgeable that they are part of something great, and their performances, spoken words and subtleties reflect that greater knowledge.<br/><br/>Not for the timid, True Romance may influence your movie theater candy-stand decision on whether you should purchase the Gummi Bears, or whether to go full throttle and get the all-beef frank."

","True Romance has it all. The cast: combines experienced actors such as Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, up and coming actors such as Micheal Rappaport, people making names for themselves such as Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette and Brad Pitt, and Cameos from Samuel L Jackson, Val Kilmer and Gary Oldman. The plot is comprised of many different genres including romance, action and comedy. The romance between Clarence and Alabamma is in my mind the greatest on screen romance in a film. The attraction between them remains strong throughout the film. The comedy varies between farcical scenes such as the three way shoot out at the end and the pop culture chatter from all the characters. The action also crops up in every other scene. There are even some highly serious scenes including the classic mafia scene at the beginning. The superb direction from Tony Scott and the brilliant script from Quentin Tarantino together with the outstanding performances from the cast and great soundtrack all contribute to make this film a classic all round film and in my mind, the best film there is."

","The only reason I like Tarantino is because of this movie.  It is simply a brilliant script.  Say all you want about Pulp Fiction.  I think True Romance is the better movie.  Pulp Fiction has originality coming out the wazoo, but in the end I think being entertained is most important, and True Romance delivers.  I don't know how this movie got made in Hollywood, since the first ten pages of the script are slow and nothing incredibly interesting happens in them (not that I'm bashing it, but usually you have to start with a bang to get anyone to read the rest of your script, so I've heard).  Tony Scott is the right director for this, too.  He has an eye for these things.  What the movie is really great at is giving you memorable characters without any traditional development time at all.  This is due in large part to the tremendous acting.  This is like a big ensemble movie - without the ensemble ever occuring.  Also great is the dialogue, and if you share anything in common with Tarantino, you'll love all the references he throws in to movies, comics, television, etc.  Is it just me or was that producer supposed to be a jab at Arnold Koppelson?  They look similar, and if you replaced ""Brought Home in a Bodybag"" with ""Platoon"" it fits perfectly with what people said about Platoon.  ""After Apocalypse Now, the greatest Vietnam war movie ever made.""  ""When veterans of that bull$hit war say [good things] about my movie, it makes the whole thing worthwhile""  etc. Definitely check this movie out if you haven't already!  Loads of fun!  And great on DVD!"

I have an affinity for Mr. Tarantino's films, but none more than this one. Everything about this movie is fantastic.  <br/><br/>Christian Slater leads the all star cast.  Other actors include Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and too many others to mention. <br/><br/>In layman's terms Christian Slater plays Clarence a comic book store clerk who is down on his luck.  He meets Alabama (a hooker, unbeknownst to him) and falls in love.  When Clarence tries to make an innocent woman out of her, all hell breaks loose.  Murder, drug deals, and more murder take place. Somehow Quentin (the screen writer... he does not direct this film) is able to pull this off while making us (at least me) laugh the entire time.<br/><br/>Like other Quentin flicks this movie is not for the weak stomached.

The cast and acting in this movie are amazing. Once again, Tarrantino serves up a no-crap array of characters.  Patricia Arquette is EXCELLENT.  i saw this and thought she'd be my new favorite actress, until i remembered how horrible she was in Stigmata. The story is, a guy meets this hooker, they fall in love.  He goes to confront her pimp and ends up killing him and stealing a huge case of coke. The coke belongs to a very big time dealer who then chases after them and finally catches up to them when they try to sell it.  As a guy with a girlfriend, there's a scene where one of the 'bad guys' goes to retrieve the drugs and finds Arquette alone with them that just angered me.  Not in the sense that i was offended by it, but because you become so infatuated with her character you hate to see something done to her.  He basically beats the hell out of her, fortunately she gets payback though. Once again, the cast is great.  I dont recall seeing more than a few no-namers or people i hadnt seen in other films.

They also meet up with an old friend of Clarence's and his roomate turns out to be Brad Pitt. It is pretty hilarious to see Brad Pitt acting like a burned out stoner before he really hit the big time. He is also great in Kalifornia by the way.

","I used to think ""True Romance"" was pretty cool, now I just think it's dross. Tony Scott's high concept direction seems to be the film's most notable flaw. He's an earnest filmmaker and what this film needed was some tongue-in-cheek attitude enabling it to conquer the incongruity inherent in the narrative. The only high-point in the film, a film marred by too many brain-dead violent sequences, is the scene involving Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. It's the closest the film comes to anything like decent acting. Arquette's tits are pretty respectable too. The allusions to Malick's ""Badlands"" are singularly farfetched and this film doesn't even deserve to exist in the shadow of Malick's masterpiece. Very disappointing all round."

However, a Tarantino film, this is far from 'once upon a time' and 'happily ever after', with every scenerio possible.

Almost all of the 'big name extra' type characters are excellent, especially Pitt, Hopper and Walken, it's just a pity that individually none of them had much screen time.

Most of the time, action movies bore me to tears.  Not in this case. When you're not on the floor, in stitches from the hilarious script, you will be mesmerized by the abundance of big name actors.  I swear, half of Hollywood stops by and says ""hi"" in this one. Be it Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Samuel L.

Not because it was done with a frantic sense of style, but because I liked the characters.  Even the bad guys were fun to watch and I really cared about the two leads.

","This film is very fun and cute. The only two problems are, 1, All of the big stars only have about 2 scenes. Example, Oldman 2, Walken 1, Pitt 3, Kilmer's face isn't even exposed but otherwise only two scenes. Those were some really interesting characters who disappeared so fast. 2, Hans Zimmer's score is maybe the worst score I have ever heard in my life! He plays two different beats the entire movie, he pretty much only used one which is so bad sounding. The action good but sometimes most of it should've been implied. Great performances by everyone. The Walken and Hopper scene is great. I highly recommend this."

","This is my favorite movie.  The first 10 minutes are a bit corny but they just serve to set up the story.  The rest of the movie is non-stop action with appearances from by some of the coolest actors around! Would you just look at the cast!! Excellent, world class performances by all!  Patricia Arquette is HOT!!!"
"Rich B","8","0","1","12 August 2001"," Strong, stylish and extremely fun. Unusually you'll feel for the leads.
","Good performances all round on this film, but particular credit goes, as always, to Christopher Walken who shines as the gangster. Gary Oldman's character is by far the strangest of his career. A very funny but dark tale with some quiet tough and violent scenes. Not at all what I expected, a genuine start to a story that just seems to keep ""upping the ante"" until everything is out of the main characters control. Slow tension build up throughout, and you'll suddenly find yourself really caring about the leads without thinking."
"Vincent-5","10","0","2","28 October 1998"," The closest thing to Pulp Fiction.
","This movie is definitely the classiest Tarantino movie behind Pulp Fiction. As all of his movies, the cast reads as who is who of acting talent. It never ceases to amaze me how Tarantino brings out the best in actors, reviving a few careers along  the way. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette define  the word cool just by being themselves. The film revels in its own environment, the world it creates, and those who will like it will absolutley love it. There's a lot of violence, yet the violence is the most interesting and meaningful it can be."
"Physicalpresence","10","0","3","11 July 2001"," Reservoir Dogs-GOOD Pulp Fiction-GREAT True Romance-EXCELLENT
","This perfect cast takes you on a rollercoaster ride from start to finish. From the small roles of Samuel L Jackson, the then UNKNOWNS Tom Sizemore&James Gandolfini, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt and Gary Oldman (Kim Basinger received a best supporting  actress award for her tiny role in LA CONFIDENTIAL, so how come Oldman didn't get a supporting actor award  for this film, he was AWESOME)to the main characters, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, this movie doesn't miss a single beat. The dialogue is superb, going from hilarious to gutwrenching and vice versa in a split second. This movie has it all, and if it sounds like I am saying it doesn't get any better than ""True Romance"" than you would be right, it doesn't...."
"mattgorman","Null","0","2","19 September 2002"," New Double DVD is fantastic
","I got a slightly advanced copy of the 2-set dvd.  And I just wanted everyone to know that it is fantastic.  This is my favorite movie of all time, and the special features on the dvd supplement it perfectly.  The behind the scenes footage, as well as the selected scene commentaries with Dennis Hopper, Micheal Rappaport, Val Kilmer & Brad Pitt add a great deal to the experience of the movie.  Most notably those of Pitt & Rappaport."

","one of the most detailed and well scripted movies of the 90's. slater, and arquette give their best performances ever. the all star cast with brad pitt in only a support roll gives the movie serious legitimacy. a cult movie for those of us who grew up in the 90's."

","The best movie ever. It is the epitome of the perfect movie experience. It Has everything. It was perfectly cast, perfectly acted, perfectly shot, and perfectly told. Its a love story, comedy, and action film that keeps you entertained."
"whiplash","Null","0","2","28 April 2001"," Plain and simple a marvellous movie!
","This is just a fantastic movie. It's constantly amusing, and combines beautiful, compact violence with an incredible love story, which engages the viewer to the max. True Romance evolves quickly thoroughly the whole movie. In a matter of minutes, Clarence Worley and Alabama are married. The turning points are made with excellent precision. The music, the cast, and the atmosphere that True Romance delivers, is just a breakthrough for any modern love story committed to the screen today. Patricia Arquette, Christian Slater, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini and Dennis Hopper are all highly worth seeing.<br/><br/>Recommended to anyone with a taste for a wicked, wild, entertaining love story. 8/10"
"wiggy3056","8","0","2","24 April 2001"," Walken and Hopper,GREAT!!!
","The scene between Walken and Hopper is awesome. Explaining to Walken,knowing he was going to die about the Moors invading Sicily was priceless,And basically telling him he`s part black and he`s knows he isn`t lying was great theater! Scenes in the hotel shootout awesome. This is an overlooked movie. GO see or rent it!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Mr Blonde666","8","0","1","17 April 2001"," You're So Cool
","This movie is very good. Tarantino shows that he's always had the gift which shines in RD and PF wit this semi-autobiographical screenplay (emphasis on the semi, ie the character played by Slater loosely resembles tarantino). If you're a fan of Scott or even just movies in general, then rent this. If you're a fan of QT, buy it. It doesnt compare to Reservoir Dogs, but what does?"
