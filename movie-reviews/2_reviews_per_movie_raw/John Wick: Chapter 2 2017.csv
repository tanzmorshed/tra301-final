","In this 2nd installment of John Wick, the stylish visual and hard core action returns twice the level of the first film. So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie."
"jtab-10108","2","126","194","31 May 2019"," Huh?
","Where to start... Apparently everyone is an Assassin, yet cannot shoot to save their lives. Only John Wick can shoot people like that. In the head. At will. The movie also gives off this weird James Bond vibe with all the different guns and suits John Wick can have just for asking for them. And I guess there are no police or anything around EVER when literally 100's of people are getting shot and killed with impunity. And people are just walking around like that's totally normal. Way far fetched, and waaaaay too over the top for words. Ridiculous."
"offers-99264","3","814","1361","12 February 2017"," Nobody fears John Wick anymore...
","Sin 1: Tossing out established canon.<br/><br/>The coolest bit of lore about the first movie is completely lost in the sequel. That alone is a sin you cannot redeem yourself for. In the original, it was established canon that John Wick was not a man to mess with. Even the main villain, respected and feared his abilities.<br/><br/>In John Wick 2, however, all of that is gone. Nobody fears John Wick. Nobody is afraid to take him on. His past deeds and reputation mean absolutely squat.<br/><br/>The new villain, never thinks twice about double crossing Wick. Every hit-man on the planet, and according to this movie they are every where, has no qualms about trying to take Wick out.<br/><br/>Sin 2: No main character growth In the first movie, we travel along with Wick as he avenges his dog and in the end moves forward with his grief. The video of his wife tells him to get up and move on. In John Wick 2, there is zero character growth. He is no different at the end of the movie as he is when it starts. Sure his circumstances have been altered, but as a character he has overcome nothing. That makes for a boring story.<br/><br/>Sin 3: Weak plot The original movie had a simple, but strong plot. Revenge. The plot of the sequel is weak, even by action movie standards. Wick has been called into service to kill a criminal, if he refuses he dies... but wait if he accepts, he also dies. The whole movie could have started and ended with the original premise of refusing the contract. It would have made more sense to refuse the contract and fight off the baddies coming to enforce the blood oath.<br/><br/>Sin 4: Video Game Bad Guys Wow. There is evidently a plethora of John Wick cannon fodder. They just keep coming, and there really is no logical reason why they do. The body count is so high that it becomes comical. The original had a big body count, but it was divided among 5 big action scenes and, for an action movie, seemed plausible. This one doubles the body count but there are so many, the coolness of each kill is lost in an over abundance of victims.<br/><br/>Sin 5: Invincible Superhero Hit by two cars, stabbed and shot numerous times and he just keeps on going. Must be seeing the doctor and getting pain pills, right? Nope no doctors in this one. That kind of logical realism may interfere with the killing of cardboard bad guys. At one point a fellow assassin, holds a pistol point blank in Wick's abdomen and fires a couple shots through him. No biggie Wick has another 42 bad guys to kill.<br/><br/>Sin 6: James Bond Gadgets I love the Continental, don't get me wrong, but the secret underground hit-man hosting hotel just goes too far in this one. Bulletproof suit coats that can be held up like Batman's cape to shield yourself from bullets? Silencers so quiet that two adversaries can have a shootout in a subway between bystanders and nobody knows even though bullet holes are being blasted into the walls around them? <br/><br/>Sin 7: Shallow Villains Yes there are the 140 plus cardboard video game baddies, but in the first John Wick, the main villain had a moral dilemma: turn over his son to save his own butt. The bad guys in Wick 2 have no interesting character motivation or dilemmas. The closest you get is Common's desire for revenge after Wick kills his client. And that was the most interesting bad guy on the screen. It is hard to believe the two movies were written by the same folks.<br/><br/>Sin 8: Soundtrack John Wick 1 had an unbelievable soundtrack that actually set the mood as he moved through the action scenes and the emotional scenes. This soundtrack just plain sucks. There is nothing memorable in it, and it does little to impart any emotion on a given scene.<br/><br/>Sin 9: Pacing Even the big action scenes in this movie are too long. In their desire to up the body count they went with longer action sequences. It really messes with the pace of the film. The first movie did a great job of dividing the action and keeping the viewer engaged. The longer these scenes go, the less believable they became which pulls the audience out of the moment.<br/><br/>Sin 10: Rehashing things that worked in the first movie There are some great scenes in the first Wick, and the director knew that so they tried to repeat them. This is a classic sequel mistake and unfortunately Wick 2 falls victim to this trope. You liked the interaction with Jimmy? We will get another one in there. Like the reload and kill? We will put a twist on that one also. It was great to see the pencil kills, that is how it should be done. Don't show us the same thing but different. Show us new, that may have been mentioned previously.<br/><br/>Making the next sequel look better then this one. The end of this movie sets up a very interesting plot for a third movie and almost everyone that walked out was excited to see it. That is wonderful, except when that movie actually sounds more interesting then the one you just watched. You should have just made that movie instead.<br/><br/>All in all Wick 2 falls short of the first one. Once again we are treated to an amazing movie whose sequel just doesn't capture the magic of the first one. I'm looking at you Red 2, Donnie Darko 2, Matrix 2, etc..."
"crytoy","10","487","861","1 February 2017"," A Masterpiece !
","To put it simply, the movie is fascinating, exciting and fantastic. The dialog, the fight choreography, the way the story moves, the characters charisma, all and much more are combined together to deliver this masterpiece. Such an amazing flow, providing a fusion between the 90s and the new century, it's like the assassins are living in another world, with another mindset, without people understanding it. Just one advice for you though: Don't build an expectation of what you want to watch in this movie, if you do, then you will ruin it. This movie has it's own flow and movement, so watch it with a clear mind, and have fun."
"cscd-745-377606","10","419","750","9 February 2017"," One of the best action movies I ever seen
","I am retired at 41 years old and watch movies all day and night. I take my action films very serious.. From Die Hard to District 13, from First Blood to Taken... John Wick 2 is one of the best action movies I've seen. Simply put.. on a scale of the good old 80's red blooded American action films, John Wick 1 will draw you in and make you a fan, John Wick 2 will satisfy your soul with the 2017 evolution of 80's action with a feeling of have hit the gritty lotto. <br/><br/>This is a man's man film that should be enjoyed after a hearty steak dinner (as I did tonight). <br/><br/>I may have to go see this again."
"jmichael3387","2","483","886","28 February 2017"," Mindless repetitive action...no story, no drama, he can kill 100 guys at the same time...
","And all of this equals boredom. 2 hours of the same thing over and over. A movie for young teens who judge movies as they do video games; the more kills, the better. After the 30th guy got his head blown off, it became totally boring to me. John Wick gets hit by a car 6 times, gets thrown down a flight of stairs 10 times, gets punched and kicked 500 times...and yet he keeps fighting. He fights 30 guys at the same time, with a gun or without, and he always wins. There is zero plot, zero character development, zero drama...it's all mindless action. And repetitive. Fistfights, guns, and cars. Nothing else. Nothing creative. Well they tried to be creative a couple times...like wasting 15 minutes with a woman doing an elaborate yet gross suicide...and for no reason other than to slap something 'original' up on the screen. It was completely pointless. How this movie is rated highly is beyond me. Like I say, it must be young teens who judge movies on number of kills. PS - I'm not exaggerating. The main bad guy simply puts a message into his phone, and within 3 minutes, literally the entire city is out to kill John Wick. So he has to fight 30 guys at a time, killing 500 guys within 20 minutes or so. Mind-numbingly stupid and boring."
"DVR_Brale","5","289","521","25 February 2017"," Generic, repetitive and forgettable
","Don't believe the hype. John Wick: Chapter 2 is not as nearly as good as almost everyone is portraying it to be. It's a generic movie with a dumb story line. Action is very repetitive - I got full-fed with it after seeing first two action scenes. <br/><br/>Best this movie has to offer is close combat, toe-to-toe fight. John employs a lot of jujitsu. Of course he can handle fifty heavy armed marksman with only a pistol. Imagine living in a world without police and emotional guilt of any kind. That's a John Wick's world; a dream-world of any teenager. Nobody in John Wick 2 displays any other emotion other than desire to kill. This makes acting non-impressive, characters forgettable and generic.<br/><br/>And why does almost every location look like a pagan temple? Why does every character look like a brainwashed pagan high-priest? Soundtrack doesn't help it neither; it makes everything feel more unnatural. This is an R rated movie made for 10 year old's.<br/><br/>If you've already seen the original, you won't see anything you haven't seen before. If you haven't seen it, ignore the second part and see the original."
"Geckomaniac3","8","200","355","7 February 2017"," ""Tell them.... Who ever comes..... I'll kill them all""....... ""Of course you will"" (Spoiler free Review)
","I have to say after seeing ""John Wick"" in the cinema almost 3 years ago I had high expectations on the sequel. I have watched the first part about three more times now and it never became boring. My fear for this sequel was that they couldn't get a good start into the new story. With a few similarities that chapter 2 shared with first one this could have been a huge let down. But god damn... this movie started strong and oddly enough it started in a way that I didn't even think about. I wouldn't say that the scenes were predictable just because they were so different from all the other action movies I have seen. This movie remains serious, whilst brilliantly combining dry humor with extreme graphic and violent images. If you have watched this movie you will remember this one scene... this one scene that you just can not get out of your head sheer to it's immense (and freaking awesome) brutality. ""John Wick Chapter 2"" is like a ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" that even though being funny, manages to stay serious throughout the entire 2 hours. It doesn't seem too long nor too short and strikes a good balance between action sequences and story telling. In comparison to the first one though Chapter 2 does not seem as realistic. John Wick was a killer I thought could actually exist in real life after watching the first movie. That was the reason I and I think many other loved that film so much. Chapter 2 does lose some of it's credibility due to a few action sequences. Remember, I am not talking about a Fast and Furious like action scene here. This is criticism on a whole new level. ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" went beyond my expectations and is in my opinion better than the first one. Go watch this movie in the cinema if you liked the part one. If you haven't seen the prequel I would recommend you to catch up just because it's so good. Though it is not actually necessary to follow and enjoy the story of Chapter 2. I hope this review was helpful to some of you who couldn't decide whether to watch this film in the cinema or wait for the Blu-Ray and DVD release. Go to the cinema your money will be spend wisely. 8/10"
"badmanlykme","10","254","459","31 January 2017"," John Wick is coming for you with his gun and pencil
","John Wick 2 is a great sequel that wasn't underwhelming it produced great action scenes great performances and there wasn't a dull moment in sight, its more fast paced than the first but all in good favor, Keanu Reeves gives it his all and adds a lot to these movies I'm hopeful that this continues on to be a great franchise, we got are first peek into the mob underworld in the first movie and in this movie its more fleshed and we get to know more about wick as the story progresses as I said it adds more to the story in every aspect which is to be praised. <br/><br/>I also believe that the action set pieces in this movie topped its predecessor with stunts where you tilt your head in amazement. Only negatives sometimes the movie doesn't take time to stop and let you have a breather but otherwise its a very impressive movie with great acting, story and action sequences. JOHN WICK YOUR NOT VERY GOOD AT RETIRING!!"
"skullhead739","3","64","107","25 May 2019"," No story, No plot, but a whole lot of boring gun scenes!
","I absolutely love action movies, like Rambo, Alien, and taken. But this is a absolute disaster of an action movie...<br/><br/>Short review:
This movie has a terrible plot, dialog, characterization and doesn't come close to how good the 1st john wick is. This is basically just a set up for the 3rd movie and is just filled with gun scene after gun scene and becomes extremely boring and pointless. Save your time because even a hardcore action movie fanboy like me absolutely hated this movie."
"trublu215","5","219","417","9 February 2017"," Kick-ass, entertaining and relentless throughout. This is what every sequel should aspire to be.
","John Wick Chapter 2 pits Keanu Reeves' titular character against the mean and nefarious of the criminal underworld. Once again, Reeves proves that he is a force to be reckoned with in this ridiculous, over-the-top sequel that is every bit as fun as the original. These types of films are rarely known for their artistic value but John Wick: Chapter 2 sets the bar pretty high, not only in its action, but in it's set design and camera work. This is pure escapist entertainment and couldn't have come at a better time. Those wanting to take a break from watching the Oscar nominees, this film is exactly what you're looking for.<br/><br/>The look and feel of the film is very much in line with the first. It is nice, vibrant colors that compliment the violence and chaos. The sound is absolutely amazing with each gun sounding the way they should instead of using the stock machine gun or pistol sound which is something the original was guilty of at times. The performances are awesome, even if Common is rehashing his Run All Night character even down to his wardrobe. And the direction of the action sequences is beyond impressive. This is a bigger John Wick and one that does a nice job at expanding on this guy's world. It really becomes a pulpy and interesting world that I'm sure we'll all enjoy a third time around. The only issue that the film may have depends on your taste in action films. This is considerably longer than the original (almost by 20 minutes) but it moves so fluidly and so frenetic that it barely feels like it. <br/><br/>Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 is one hell of a sequel. It has everything a sequel should have and definitely doesn't disappoint. If you loved the first one then you're probably going to love this one. It is a straight up, balls to the wall thrill ride that is more than worth the price of admission."

","I watched this movie last week, and boy did I want to walk out of the theater, I have seen both movies for john wick and to tell you they are both very bad. The whole entire movie its just john wick carrying a gun and shooting people. What made me mad at first is that john wick never runs out of ammo and he never gets shot, like from all the people he killed not one gut could'eve shot him, i find that hard to believe. These john wick movies they do not have a good story its just a man who carries a gun and shoots people, I mean yea it did have some good action in it but it wasn't a good story, its like if call of duty were to have a movie, except the call of duty story modes are better than john wick, so yea i really did not like this movie its a waste of time please do not watch this joke."
"MichaelNontonMulu","9","149","289","8 February 2017"," Great Action Movie!
","Wow, this is one of the best action movies that I have seen in quite some time. It is really what I was hoping for in a good old fashion action movie that was done entirely on hand to hand combat and gun shootings. This is a wonderful kick-ass movie where the killings were done so brutally with lots of bloody scenes. It also kind of remind me of the various one man army movies in the 80s played by Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger. If you have seen John Wick the original (which I hope you have seen it before you see this one), then you will be amazed with this sequel. It was bloodier, more fighting, more assassins trying to kill John and longer running time. What I can say is this is an even better version than the original movie. Although in term of story, there is a bit of a more complexity in the sequel as opposed to the simplicity of the original movie.<br/><br/>All the fighting scenes were choreographed wonderfully according to my opinion. The guns shooting scenes were entirely cool. I loved all of them and there were no fighting scenes that took too long to finish. Keanu Reeves' portrayal of a retired hit-man who had no choice but to come back was really spot on. There were also some minor characters from the original movie who appeared in this sequel and also new character played by Laurence Fishburne whom I believed would play a large part in chapter 3. Yes, there would definitely be another sequel based on the ending of this movie, which really made me so excited and cannot wait for it to be released.<br/><br/>Aside from the very cool amazing action sequence, the sound effects of this movie was very good such as the sound of cars screeching, guns blazing and the voices of John and Cassian's heavy fight which I thought sounded very original. My recommendation if you want to watch this movie, it should be watched in a theater with good sound system. <br/><br/>Since there were many bloody brutal killing scenes (including 1 suicide scene), the Indonesian censorship body had given 21 years above rating. So yeah, this movie is definitely not for kids. For those of you who want to enjoy a pure action movie with Keanu Reeves as the main star, this one should not be missed. Don't forget to watch the original movie first so you would understand the story line. But for those who do not really enjoy this kind of movie (or cannot stand the bloody fight scenes), then this might not be suitable for you. <br/><br/>This is one heck of a movie and I for one truly enjoyed it and would recommend this movie to any fans of action movie.<br/><br/>for my complete review, pls see michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"
"quincytheodore","9","131","253","8 February 2017"," Love letter for action genre written by bold bloody hallmark, and a pencil.
","If there's an equivalent of classical orchestra for untamed unapologetically brutal carnage, there's no doubt it'd be John Wick. Dancing through hail of bullets, horde of assassins straight from video game, oozing noir style from each drop of blood, John Wick: Chapter 2 is nothing short of an artistic spectacle.<br/><br/>John Wick (Keanu Reeves) returns to the killing business begrudgingly as one of his old acquaintances asks for a morbid favor. The cloak-and-dagger scheme soon flies into multiple directions, partially towards the back of few characters and the rest goes straight to the chest. There's an air of familiarity as the movie visits previous characters while introducing an array of new ludicrous ones.<br/><br/>It keeps the formula nearly identical, adding more to its melee and shootout fun. There's everything one loved from the first, now pouring abundantly. Combat is arguably the best action choreography one could possibly ask for. Punches, kicks, submission holds, and even dirty pokes are delivered with sheer primal vexation and the finesse of ballet performance.<br/><br/>Both the anti-hero and his rivals press forward in locomotive of mayhem, any fans of action movies and combat sports will be gleefully entertained. In fact, such simple concept of ""one versus many"" is ageless and universal, it worked since Bruce Lee's time and now told by razor-sharp spectacular visual, John Wick is the finest action of modern time."

Doesn't seem like a meticulous professional. And what a waste of bullets, shooting every goon's head 3-4 times. And pressing the trigger of an ...empty gun in numerous occasions. Can't he tell his gun is empty? I thought counting bullets was a must skill for professional killers...<br/><br/>As a movie is full of clichÃ©s. Another ""secret"" society of killers, with ""rules"" (meant to be broken) and pseudo-wise characters willing to share their ridiculous wisdom with others. Not to mention the ancient movie tradition where the evil guy doesn't kill the hero when he has the chance, but instead ties him in ...a chair ...in an old warehouse making it so easy for him to escape, while explaining his evil plans.<br/><br/>Yet it seems that the movie has a small but loyal audience. The stuntman director tries to capture some brutal violent moves up close. Long sequences of Reeves shooting foes at point blank is somehow a new trend.<br/><br/>Overall: The otherwise sympathetic Keanu Reeves seems miscasted here. His old pal from the Matrix days Chad Stahelski serves as the director of this typical in premise yet somehow original in the shooting sequences action movie. Not much substance, just stylized action scenes."

The action scenes are well choreographed, but highly repetitive, monotonous and unengaging. Not a single head shot compares to the impact of ones in The Town or The Departed for example. Its like watching a kid play a video game. The bits between are flat, hypnotically boring, and border on the absolute stupid in places. Its often like watching a weird dream, like The Neon Demon if written by morons. <br/><br/>The first had heart and soul, and was likable and engaging for that reason. The sequel doesn't.

","I felt the brilliance of the first film was found in the under lying mythology of the Continental Hotel, the coins, the laws/culture between the Reeves and some of the smaller parts (police official / bartender etc). As such I hoped that in the second film this would be continued; I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>The film continues from the first film with a great level of balance. Respecting the first film and allowing a 2-hour film to have its own identity without dragging was a challenge that was met well. The Laurence Fishburne element and the subsequent ending allow a great opening for another film.<br/><br/>Another strength of the movie is that the John Wicks character (like Neo i) is so well suited to Keanu Reeves. He is the strong-silent type and it feels Chad Stahelski, the Director, glorifies this and uses it to move the story forward. He gives you the same in an enhanced but similar format.<br/><br/>Loved : Lance Reddick as the Hotel Manager / Ruby Rose and the signing stuff Note: If you don't like people being shot in films – this is not the film for you!"

","A film with more head-shots than words spoken, John Wick: Chapter 2 is just about the most violent film I've seen in quite some time. But it knows exactly what it wants to do, and succeeds immensely.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves isn't one of the best actors working today, and I don't think he would disagree with that statement. But he's no doubt one of the most committed actors out there. There's no more than a few pages of total spoken dialogue throughout 'Chapter 2', and Reeves has probably a maximum of 30 lines, all of which aren't necessarily delivered as well as they should be. But it doesn't ultimately matter. Sure, John Wick could be a better franchise if the scripts were of the same caliber as say a Bond or a Bourne movie, but that's not really why you go see one of these movies. You go to see Keanu Reeves kick some butt amidst some of the best choreographed action in cinema.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 picks up not too long after the first film ends as Wick is somewhat enjoying his life as a ""retired"" assassin. If the first film was about him coming back to seek revenge, this film is Wick reluctantly coming back because he owes a debt to another assassin. I don't think the filmmakers truly could have imagined this would be a franchise off the bat, but it's sure shaping up to be quite the intriguing universe. The one thing that has always struck me as appealing in this series is the way they portray the world Wick lives in. Yes, it's present day, but the world that surrounds Wick is heightened to make for more exciting action (it's essentially a world full of super assassins). But at the same time, the films are incredibly grounded with reality. It's that balance that so few films can accomplish to this particular level.<br/><br/>Taking the famous Liam Neeson line ""I will kill you"" to a whole new level, Wick claims ""I will kill them all"". And that's pretty much your movie. Wick doesn't want to come back, he owes a debt and is forced to return for one more kill, and then the bounty on his head reaches just about everyone linked to The Continental's database. The rest of the movie is Wick delivering killing blows to just about anyone who stands in his way in the most creative ways possible. Isn't it about time people leave this guy alone? Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 promised visceral action (all impressively in camera- yeah, I'm looking at you Resident Evil) and we got just that. Even if the dialogue can be clunky and the performances are over the top, it doesn't really matter. What matters is this series continues to be a pleasant surprise in an age where great action movies are too few and far between.<br/><br/>+Insanely well-done action<br/><br/>+Tops the first film's scope<br/><br/>+The universe Derek Kolstad has built<br/><br/>-Some dialogue is bland and even lazy<br/><br/>8.6/10"
"kastenmeier-andreas","5","30","56","1 March 2017"," What's the point of this movie?
","The first John Wick came out of nowhere and i quite enjoyed it for what it was. It had a pretty great neon style and a unique way of portraying the world of a community of assassins. So i didn't have high expectations for the second part, but was nevertheless curious where they would take the story next.<br/><br/>Sadly there isn't much of a story and the self-aware, ironic tone of the first one is also absent. Only in the first few scenes it's shining through. From there on it's pretty much John Wick shooting it's way among Rome and New York. Some Plotpoints are even ridiculous (Watch out for the doves and microchips).<br/><br/>Okay, i hear many of you saying, it's an action movie, what are you expecting. So to my next point. The only action you get in this movie is Keanu Reeves shooting guys in the head and sometimes into the foot. After the sixth or seventh dude sneaking around a corner and getting a head shot, everything kinda blurred out for me.<br/><br/>Although, there are two positive things to mention about this movie. Firstly, Keanu Reeves is really enjoying himself in this role and you can see that he put some effort into it. And secondly, the neon style of the first movie was translated into this movie and there were some cool settings.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is fine for a boring Sunday afternoon and some time to kill. But if you like something special or even a kind of story, keep away from this movie."
"catamok","2","87","185","13 February 2017"," Crap
","I'm as much a fan of action as anyone, but this is spam - and I use that word to get pass the profanity filter. This was clearly written/directed by a Matrix fanboy ... oh, look, it's Matrix stunt double Chad Stahelski directing this tripe. When Laurence Fishburne shows up in a throwaway role I had to be physically restrained from yelling, ""Welcome to the desert of the real!"" and ""My name is Neo!"" Fishburne's contribution to the movie: A handgun. Gag me with a spoon. ""There is no spoon.""<br/><br/>John Wick (Keanu Reaves) gets a visit from the movie's antagonist, and is presented with a promissory note - a marker. John refuses it, knowing full well that he's going to be forced to accede to the demands later, but gives antagonist Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) the opportunity to blow up John's home. John responds by ... doing what the antagonist originally asked him to do. ""That is the sound of inevitability.""<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes are set-up. He gets a pair of bullet-proof dress suits, a wine course of weaponry (as foreshadowed in the trailer), maps upon maps of the impossible mission that he needs to complete, and keys to open the antique locks that bar the way. Like, you're kidding me, they have no fewer than 70 mob minions for him to kill on the way out, but the evil overlords can't afford some Craftsman combination locks? ""They are guarding all the doors, they are holding all the keys.""<br/><br/>The action scenes are well choreographed, except for the ridiculous fact that both Wick and his many opponents miss with striking frequency, whenever it's useful for the continuation of the story. World class assassins miss short-range no-cover head-shots constantly. I give this a 2 star fully for the acting of supporting actor rapper Common and for the one-handed thumb-less cocking of a 1911 by Wick (forgetting that there was no reason to one-handedly cock the 1911, but it was cool).<br/><br/>Ares (Ruby Rose with the trademark short hair) is an androgynous master bodyguard. She plays the whole movie, poised like a lethal weapon ready to strike. The whole movie. I kept on thinking it was Justin Bieber, and I wanted her to get her ass kicked. She's so good that nothing could possible best her, except for John in about 20 seconds. What an anticlimax.<br/><br/>John says to Santino, ""it's impossible,"" and makes his contract kill with ridiculous ease. He does it so easily that the target offs herself rather than take the bullet. Do the same for yourself. Save yourself from this tripe and rent Mel Gibson's Payback.<br/><br/>When CinemaSins does ""Everything wrong with John Wick 2"" on Youtube, it's going to set a record for sins."

","A non existing story line, Bad acting, stiff fighting scenes for two hours. Yes this movie got it all. I saw the original John Wick and thought it was pretty brain-dead but this takes it up a notch, your intelligence needs to be below 80 to truly enjoy this movie. This is for dumb teenagers who needs bad cgi to like a movie. This movie is for people who had a hard time understanding Fast and the Furious movies. People who thought that story line was too hard to follow. Hollywood has actually managed to dumb down a movie to a new record low. If it's violence you want why don't you just surf clips on YouTube instead? John Wick 2 has a a story line that remind me of a porno without the nudity. It' just people flying in the air in different positions.<br/><br/>Keanu Reaves is one of Hollywood's worst actors, he had some success with Speed and The Matrix movies but the guy is really one of the worst actors of our time and it is all on display here, the dry dumbed down one liners and people flying and being shot in the face one after another.<br/><br/>Why should one care about this movie? It's total brain dead and highly meaningless action. This might be the worst movie I've seen in years, despite having an insanely high rating here on IMDb.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie is actually John Wick's dog, the best actor in the whole movie unfortunately. The acting is terrible and there is no progression of the characters. They are all dumb murderers and even if John Wick faces tons of hired killers in this movie, he kills them one after another while the viewer tries not to fall asleep.<br/><br/>The worst movie I've seen since Godzilla."
"samueldshearer","8","30","58","11 February 2017"," Builds on the original really well and becomes almost a character tragedy
","John Wick 2 picks up right where the first one left off; he steals his car back in a really good opening chase scene. This is a good way to connect the two films together, but from here on out the story takes a much different turn. Basically, in order to ""get out"" the first time to be with his wife, John Wick made an oath with a ""marker"" that puts him in debt with a very powerful man in the crime world. And now it's time to repay that debt. So we have John Wick, against his will and better judgment, going back in again.<br/><br/>First of all, of course the action is good. Was anyone expecting less? The gunplay, hand- to-hand choreography, everything is done in beautiful steady cam. Also, shout-out to the cinematographer, the use of color in the film is fantastic. Lots of neon pinks and blues.<br/><br/>What I really want to praise the film for, though, is how the plot works with the world building so well. We have a much more complex plot than the original here, involving intrigue, power plays, bounties, things of the like. And throughout the movie uses this as a way to introduce more lore to this universe where everyone seems to be part of the connected web of crime. There is a ""high council"" which plays a background role in the film(and I expect they will be a much bigger deal in the third one). The rules of the Continental hotel are played with a bit more, and we see an entire network of assassins later in the film. All this adds layers to the John Wick universe and it's really great how they use the plot to do that.<br/><br/>The characters are all good and the movie is well-acted. Keanu Reeves is good for this role, where he has minimal dialogue and his emoting his restrained. This is a man who is basically empty inside at this point. Common and Laurence Fishburne's characters also really stood out to me; Common and Keanu have two extended fight scenes with really appropriately balanced intensity and humor. Laurence Fishburne isn't in the movie much but he was really fun to watch. <br/><br/>Everyone is praising the surface-level stuff this film offers up and I can't blame them. But I just want to point out that this film is basically a tragedy. It ends with John Wick homeless, unable to return to the hotel, running from basically everyone in New York who wants to kill him for 14 million dollars. Throughout the film, you get the sense that John doesn't want to be here,killing people, and the use of reflection shots throughout the film really punctuates the theme of past choices. It's depressingly ironic that the ""marker"" John Wick used to get out the first time is the very thing that brings him back in, for possibly the rest of his life. The final action scene is entirely set in an art exhibit called ""Reflection of the Soul"" which is basically a Hall of Mirrors. This makes for an interesting action sequence but also for a very interesting thematic moment. John Wick is actually a very tragic character. I really hope he gets the redemption he deserves in the third movie.<br/><br/>The flaws I have are basically that the action is a little too repetitive at times, and that the assassin girl who speaks in sign language, who is built up throughout the film, gets taken out in about forty seconds. After seeing Common hold is own against Wick for two whole fights, this was disappointing. <br/><br/>Did I mention that the dog in this film is a REALLY good boy???"
"paul-allaer","8","14","24","13 February 2017"," The rare sequel that is better than the original movie
","""John Wick: Chapter 2"" (2017 release; 122 min.) continues the 'adventures' of former (?) hit man John Wick. As the movie opens, we are immediately thrown in the middle of a car vs. bike chase, and next thing we know, we find our man retrieving his beloved Mustang from a chop shop in NYC, but not without cars flying about, and dozens of dead or wounded bodies. And that's all in the pre-opening credits! As the story unfolds, Wick, who wants ""out, is nevertheless forced back ""in"" when an Italian baddie calls in a favor and Wick has no choice but to accept. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: director (and former stunt man) Chad Stahelski returns at the helm following the surprise success of the first John Wick movie, and once again delivers a highly stylish and ultra- violent action movie. When you watch the opening car chases (yes, in plural), it's like watching a synchronized ballet performance. I would not go as far to say that the story line doesn't matter, it does to a degree, but let's be honest: the reason we are there is to watch the car chases and the shoot-outs and the almost cartoonish level of violence that is so over the top, you can't help but laugh at it. Stahelski's thinking must have been: ""when in doubt, (i) throw more bodies at it, and (ii) keep the focus on Keanu Reeves"". Reeves is cold as ice in the best possible way, and it suits him perfectly in the film. Laurence Fishburn plays a small role (as another baddie) and the scenes where Reeves and Fishburn appear together are their first joint scenes ever since the Matrix Trilogy, if you can believe it. I couldn't believe how quickly these 2 hours flew by and I'm not spoiling anything when I tell you that the movie's ending sets it up nicely for a Chapter 3 in a couple of years. Count me in!<br/><br/>The movie opened wide this past weekend, and the Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at was absolutely jam-packed, somewhat to my surprise. Did I mention this movie is ultra-violent? And that it's rated R for good reason? I was outright dismayed to see how many small kids were in the theater. In the very row in front of me, there was a couple with three small girls, I'm guessing ages 5 to 7. What are these people thinking?!? Meanwhile, for us grown-ups, if you liked the first John Wick, you are more than going to like this sequel, you are going to LOVE it, be it at the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu- ray. ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a WINNER."
"rrosewater","10","36","72","11 February 2017"," Excellent sequel!
","When I heard that a sequel was being filmed i didn't believe it at first but then a few pictures where released and it got me super pumped for this movie. With the experience I've had with other action movie sequels, i believed that this would not be nearly as good as the first john wick movie but it surprisingly was! in fact, this is the first action movie sequel I've seen which is better than the original movie! now that's a big deal to be honest. I love how they didn't reveal the plot of the movie whatsoever and actually experiencing the plot unveil little by little was pretty mesmerizing. another thing that they achieved in the movie which was awesome was the world building. Oh and the action sequences were just exquisite! you could look at keanu reeves in the eye and tell that he's doing 90% of the action and stunts. The camera was still and you could see who's getting hit and who's getting killed unlike other action movies (cough taken cough) where the cameras are all shaky and they try to hide the stunt doubles in between the shots. personally, i wanted to know more about the secret assassins world they have and learn more about it and that was EXACTLY what they did in this movie. In short : john wick chapter 2 is a great movie and i recommended it to everyone. If you liked the first one, you'll love this one. 10/10"
"CANpatbuck3664","9","43","88","8 February 2017"," John Wick: Chapter 2 Completely Lives Up to the Original
","I was able to catch an advanced screening of John Wick: Chapter 2. The original John Wick was a great surprise. It really blew most of the movie going public away, concentrating on tight action and creating a cool world to explore. I was looking forward to this because the original was so kick-ass but I would also have been okay if it had been a standalone. This movie could have been completely derivative and they could have just followed the formula again but they weren't satisfied just doing that. They delivered the bone-cracking action, some more cool characters and they expanded on their universe wonderfully.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We pick up soon after the original John Wick, the local Russian mafia chapter is hurrying to pack up their operation. Their leader Abram (Peter Stormare) is eager to bail but his employees are confused as to why. Abram fills them in that the villains of the first movie were his nephew Iosef and his brother Viggo and they were killed by John for revenge. He tells his employees about Baba Yaga (The Boogeyman aka John Wick) as John Wick (Keanu Reeves) stealthily takes out his security. John's there for his Mustang and he won't leave without it. He out-drives and beats up most of Abram's staff until he makes his way to Abram's office. Instead of killing him, he toasts Abram and proposes peace. Abram accepts and John leaves.<br/><br/>The next day, after John spends the day recuperating and playing with his dog (who he picked up at the end of the original), there's a knock at the door. Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) has shown up uninvited and is there for a favour. He wants control of his family operation but the problem is that his father gifted control to his sister. John owes him a marker (a favour promised by blood-oath) and he's collecting on it by making John kill his sister. John refuses but is aware that he could face consequences, breaking this pact is no small matter. Santino and his security force led by Ares (Ruby Rose) start to leave until Santino unloads a grenade launcher and blows up John's house. Now that he's homeless, John heads toward the city with his dog to plan his next move.<br/><br/>The plot of the first John Wick wasn't complicated, it was a man on a mission for revenge. This movie's plot is best described as lean. It's not that deep and the motive is similar. But I think that's fine for this movie, nobody expects Oscar calibre writing from an action flick. Instead of introducing a completely new story line, they do a great job expanding on this universe that was one of my favourite parts of the first movie. They bring you into this secret world where dangerous killers interact but they have strong moral codes. The idea of the Continental Hotel was awesome in John Wick and they build on that in the sequel. They introduce memorable new characters and they brought back some of the best supporting characters from the original. The creative team did a good job figuring out what worked and what didn't in the original and while I wouldn't describe this movie as complex, it provides enough of a story to help string together the fantastic action set-pieces.<br/><br/>John Wick is a character that's well suited to Keanu Reeves. He's the strong-silent type, he's an unstoppable force one moment and pretty vulnerable in the next. Keanu slips into this role again and delivers some more solid work. I actually liked Riccardo better than the villain in the original John Wick, his character makes some questionable decisions but I found Riccardo to be more menacing and collected in his role. I was happy to see Common in a role which gave him the chance to shine. He's not given much backstory or dialogue but he's very intimidating as Cassius and his fights with Keanu are great. Ruby Rose was also really good. She fits into this genre excellently and she also shined in her reserved yet physical role. Laurence Fishburne seemed to be so happy to be there, he looked like the cat who swallowed the canary and he was chewing the scenery the whole time. I really liked that they brought actors back from the first one like Lance Reddick and Ian McShane. They helped sell the mystery surrounding the world of John Wick and they helped the concept grow here.<br/><br/>The biggest reason to go see John Wick: Chapter 2 is the jaw-dropping action. There was no drop in the quality of the action set-pieces and they even improved upon them in some ways. The choreography was tight, the gunfire was loud and explosive and fighting packed the requisite punch. The cinematography was pretty interesting and the locations they picked accented those scenes perfectly. The action bits were also well balanced, they were gory when they needed to be and they were fun to watch. I continue to be impressed by director Chad Stahelski, he knows how to shoot the hell out of a gunfight.<br/><br/>I love a good action movie and this movie was a superior one. Instead of resting on their previous laurels, John Wick: Chapter 2 ups the ante and furthers an excellent franchise. I think this movie will be widely appreciated by action movie junkies (I'm a member of that group) and for that crowd I can't recommend this high enough. You won't find a better movie of this type in the theatre right now and for the adults out there who appreciate this material, it will provide a memorable experience."

"kraytdragon-sean","10","36","73","10 February 2017"," Masterclass Action Sequel
","John Wick: Chapter 2 is an action film that seldom misfires. For quick context, John Wick came as a surprise return to form for Keanu Reeves in 2014. Two elements stood out to separate John Wick from the rest of the action pack. The first is in the excellent casting of the protagonist. The quite actor transformed his usual persona into a role of one who, instead, takes extreme action. In extra- textual awareness, loss seemingly haunts the misunderstood actor. The solemn introspective nature of Reeves gives the character of Wick a believable sense of unchained rage. Frankly, John Wick fits Keanu like a glove. A second unique feature of the original is in how the film introduced audiences to the vague world of assassins. John Wick 2 continues the process of world building without conceding a sense of mystery. The film flirts with its own idiosyncrasies knowing full well maintaining the atmosphere is what makes the franchise unique. For example, rules are cited without explaining the full body of the source. Odd artifacts localized to a high ranking assassin will find the camera's attention. In addition, the sequel is a far more cinematically complex film over the first in the series. John Wick: Chapter 2 explores the dichotomy of agency against the externalities in life. Wick constantly conforms to the rules of the assassin world despite a desire to break free. The dangers of breaking free are made explicitly known to the audience and Wick. As a result, the film's plot is the rare action film which focuses on the awareness of limitations in one's environment. The story constantly finds humor in the juxtaposition of action to dialogue/scenario. An intense fight will cease in due part to some odd universal assassin code. A shootout occurs during a concert at one point early in the film. Wick shoots an adversary in the head to an ignorant audience's entertainment. The cited moment gives the viewer a meta moment to ponder their attraction to extreme violent imagery. Speaking of universal codes, the film often uses noir elements to heighten emotions or reflect states of danger. Soft blue and red lighting clash throughout the film. Red often illuminates the screen during the more intense shootouts of the film. Conversely, the color blue offers Wick precious few moments to cool down and collect himself. The depth of the assassin world adds a heightened sense of danger to our protagonist. Wick ceases being able to recognize fellow assassins from civilians among the throngs of New York. (Minor spoiler) The entire environment literally turns against John during the final surprisingly unnerving moments of the film. The action is top notch and will satisfy anyone who simply wants to witness masterfully executed action. The hand to hand combat does get a bit stale during the final fights of the movie. Ultimately, John Wick: Chapter 2 is the cinephiles fun action romp."

Bullets do not harm him, nor do endless blows and stabs to every part of his body. He is sort of like you combined Bruce Lee with Superman....except with guns....and endless choreographed fight scenes that feel more like dancing than fighting. I guess it is OK that Wick is invulnerable, but it makes kind of a boring movie. You know that no matter what odds are stacked against him, he will still come out on top. And he does.

The woman playing a violin in the subway station: assassin. All backed by some ancient assassins network that uses blood markers to guarantee assassinations. Kept in a binder with some rich guy in New York. If you stop for just a moment and think of how implausibly dumb this plot is, you begin to understand this is more of a comedy than an action flick. Let's kill people, then leave our DNA on a marker associated with the person who wanted them killed (which also happened to be our fingerprint), then let's hire women to run an operator exchange to send out text messages to thousands of stranger's phones with information on the inevitable murder of someone. Sounds legit! Even past the terribly implausible plot, the acting is just horrible. Reeves barely speaks 2 words when he talks. They come off sounding exactly the same. Quiet and awkward. Like, is he on Xanax the entire film cause he sounds like he's stoned. Then, occasionally, he'll speak a foreign language. Does it sound like he's fluent? No. It sounds like he's regurgitating his rehearsed lines. Just a weird way for the director to try and make it seem like John Wick is this insanely talented, worldly hit man. Wick thrusts a knife into a guy's heart and tells him it's stuck in his aorta. If he removes it, he'll bleed to death. To think anyone aside from, say, Terminator, would know exactly where you stabbed someone or where inside of their body the knife ended up down to the centimeter -- is pathetically stupid. It's implausible, as is the rest of the movie. Lastly, the fight scenes (although also implausible) are halfway decent. The only problem I have with them is Reeves is not cut out for being a talented mixed martial artist. He doesn't have the build. His hips are too wide and his shoulders not enough. He honestly looks a little clumsy."
"scottmannen1","10","14","25","19 February 2017"," Outstanding, gripping, violent and dark
","This sequel is the best movie I have seen in a few years. My wife asked me if it was better than the first Bourne movie and I said yes. John Wick the original wasn't as good as the Bourne Identity, but this sequel was! From start to finish this movie was gripping, violent and dark with a few bits of humour injected for good taste.<br/><br/>This sequel continues immediately after the first movie and has excellent music, sound and even cinematography. I found few downsides to this movie at all. Perhaps some of the action sequences extended a bit too long, but beyond that this movie was adeptly made and will be an instant classic that puts John Wick right up there with Jason Bourne and James Bond. See this one in The theatres and do yourself a favour! This is not to be missed."
"RJBrez","10","26","52","11 February 2017"," Best Action Movie in years
","John Wick surpassed expectations in 2014 with a simple plot. Revenge. It left many doors open for a sequel, and wow did Chapter 2 really impress. Keanu Reeves is perfect for this role, and he was surrounded by an excellent supporting cast (Ian Mcshane, Ruby Rose, Common, Lance Reddick, Laurence Fishbourne). <br/><br/>Chad Stahelski knows how to make an action movie matter. Every scene was meaningful. Every character was understood. I could almost feel every punch, and take every shot. Stahelski used a perfect combination of lighting and a great score for his downright brutal action scenes. <br/><br/>Chapter 2 was almost exclusively focused on the 'underground assassins' world and it did not disappoint. It was amazing to watch how these larger than life super killers can blend into society so easily. I like how this society has two very important and non negotiable rules that seem to always keep things in order. Which is hard to do. <br/><br/>I feel like I could write for hours about this movie, but I do not want to give any spoilers. Please go and enjoy. Several times. And let us all hope for Chapter 3 very soon."
"CowherPowerForever","9","22","43","11 February 2017"," Yeah, I'm thinking' I'm back.
","John Wick is back for another all out action go around. If you enjoyed the first movie as most people did, this is without a doubt a must see right away. Very few sequels in general can get close to the original, but John Wick Chapter 2 may even exceed the first movie in my opinion. The following is my review of John Wick: Chapter 2.<br/><br/>Chad Stahelski is once again back to director this action packed sequel to his 2014 surprise hit both critically and box office wise. Stahelski really came out of nowhere with the success of the first film, as before that movie he was really only known for stunt work, even working with the star of these two films, Keanu Reeves on the Matrix films. The best parts of the first film are Stahelski's vision to make a true classic action film that not only featured amazing gun scenes, but also featured hand to hand combat scenes that were mind blowing. This sequel ramps up both of those areas in this film. The goal of an action sequel is to even more action packed, and surprisingly this film does that. The action is real, and very little CG is noticeable in the film. It is corny to say a film is packed with action from start to finish, but this film literally is. Stahelski proved three years ago he was capable of directing an all out action film, and now he has proved he can continue that great success with a sequel that delivers even more so than the original in many regards.<br/><br/>Derek Kolstad is back to write the John Wick sequel. Similar to director Chad Stahelski, Kolstad is pretty much an unknown, having only wrote low budget films starring Dolph Lundgren, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Steven Austin. The story however for the John Wick series is pretty easy to write, but there are some good one liners that needed to be placed perfectly in the film, and Kolstad does another excellent job there. So even though the plot is thin, the great acting and action take center stage of the thin plot.<br/><br/>Tyler Bates(John Wick, 300, and Guardians of the Galaxy) and Joel J. Richard(John Wick and The Bourne Identity) are back to compose the score for this action film. Both composers have an excellent track record, more so for Bates, but both of these guys already delivered a fantastic score in the film movie, and the score is just as memorable this time around. If you are someone like myself who appreciates a good score in the heated moments of the fight scenes, you will truly enjoy this.<br/><br/>Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a must see action film, and a must see for those who really enjoyed the first film. The action is even more intense, and the scenes don't look fake like many films in this genre tend to these days. The cast is truly magnificent, and even though the downtime in the film seems like it drags a bit too much, the acting makes it worth the wait.<br/><br/>9/10"
"jameslindsay93","10","25","50","11 February 2017"," Twice as good as the first... and that says a lot.
","Not many action films can make you genuinely laugh without having to resort to using cheap comic relief. This movie had everyone in the theater gripping to their seats from the intensity and laughing at parts that defined a new type of humour. The fight sequences and overall action was unique and smooth like butter throughout. Seriously a great film. Although, one could think that the plot was forced (as many revenge stories are) the unique action that followed from turning points in the plot filled in the needed gaps. The scenes in the subway station were so violent it will likely set the bar for the future action films, especially when it comes to the use of pencils."
"yadavj-41280","10","31","64","9 February 2017"," the best sequel ever
","This is the best sequel Keanu Reeves has ever been a part of, or will ever be a part of. Yes, I know that The Matrix sequels were the only time he actually revisited a franchise, but at this point in his career, I can't see him starting up another franchise like this. John Wick was a blast to see on the big screen, but that's honestly just an appetizer. Thanks to the critical reception and enough word- of- mouth, making its box office return enough to warrant a sequel, John Wick: Chapter 2 was made possible. It's very rare that a sequel can top its predecessor. Sure, the arguments of Aliens over Alien or T2: Judgment Day over The Terminator are made on a daily basis, but most franchises fizzle out after the original, say for a few. Happily, John Wick: Chapter 2 can very safely be added to those few. Here is why this film is not only a great sequel, but an even better film that the first. Literally the first frame of this film gets you right back into the action that you loved about the first film, which also leads me up to the first complaint I have about John Wick: Chapter 2. After a solid ten minute action sequence, the following 30 minutes seem to go by at a snails pace in comparison, but the film does shut you up from feeling bored, to say the least. Once again following John as the main protagonist after he has lost yet another portion of his life, a man from his past returns to remind his that he owes him a debt. After fulfilling that debt, a price is put on his head, leaving him nearly defenseless. Having said that, no number of people can take this man down, and the action never lets up from there. Once the film begins to deliver fans what they came to this film for in the first place, it literally seems like one drawn-out action sequence for about an hour straight. I found myself completely zoned into the screen throughout the second half of this film, which is superbly directed and some of the most fun I've had at the movies in a while. You can't help but chuckle at the fact that our titular character is able to get out of certain scenarios, because there is just no possible way that one man can take down this many men with guns and walk away alive. That being said, if you can buy into superhero films as serious dramas in today's day and age, then you can forgive a few ridiculous moments in John Wick: Chapter 2. Just like the first film, you shouldn't be going into a film like this hoping for Oscar-worthy screen writing. I have to critique this, because from the villain plot line, which is fleshed out enough, to the dumb one line conversations that certain characters exchange, there are aspects in John Wick: Chapter 2 that you just have grin at and shrug off. Having said that, as by the number as the villain sub plot is, there is much more depth to this story than what the first film delivered, but don't even get me started on the way the film ends. Let's just say that if John Wick: Chapter 3 picks up right where this film leaves off, it will be one pretty ridiculous film, even by the already set standards. In the end, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a film that picks up right where its predecessor leaves off, which absolutely requires you to see the first film, but let's be honest, if you are going to see this film in theaters, you've probably seen the first. Due to its incredibly violent nature, there are many viewers who will easily be turned off by this film, but for straight-up shoot- em-up films, you can't get much more fun than this nowadays. With great direction, a cheesy and fun screenplay, action that is far superior than the original, and a set-up for a third that will have you itching for more, John Wick: Chapter 2 is just one big gift for action fans. It's in no way perfect, but it was an absolute joy to see on the big screen. My only warning is the fact that it's overly violent. If you can't stomach an excess of death on-screen, then this film definitely isn't for you."

","I have never seen anything so dumb in my life.. It starts with a preposterous disjointed chase scene in which the motorcycle being chased (far faster than the car in the first place) somehow runs into the car chasing him.. and then the title of the film and then it gets worse.. Even Keanu Reeves, the ultimate bad guy, is not bulked up.. just a scrawny beard and a scowl.. If you want to see a film where everyone Keanu meets, he kills, this is for you.. The reverberation in the theater that makes the gun shots sound real is about all that is good.. but with people mowing each other down in real life, I can't for the life of me imagine why someone would make this type of film or glorify killing. That people liked this film is even worse.. Stupid dumb movie.. And for those who think I should have seen the whole film before commenting.. yea right.. The movie never even remotely got better.. and the acting and directing and editing.. Everyone must have been on something.. I saw it the Fri night it came out because of the 9.0 rating!

"paulijcalderon","8","12","21","24 February 2017"," A blast with pitch perfect action and scenery
","Stunning! I liked it more than the first one. Loved the Italy setting and the way it expanded the world. The scenes in the museums and art galleries are a feast to the eye with all the rich colors and amazing scenery. This movie looks beautiful.<br/><br/>I have a lot of respect for Keanu Reeves. I remember watching ""The Matrix"" when I was young and that was something that I took inspiration from whenever I tried to film my own action movies. The way Reeves handled all of that choreography and stunt-work in those movies was inspiring. He is perfect as John Wick, there's nobody else for that role. What he does with the action here in this one is extraordinary. Hats off to everyone involved with the stunts because I can tell how much hard work went into it. The rest of the cast is great. Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, Franco Nero, Peter Stormare etc. Lots of respect to them all. Everyone has a very welcomed presence.<br/><br/>The calmer scenes are nice too. I could actually watch an entire movie about just a normal calm day with Keanu and the dog. Their friendship is touching to me. I don't know, there's something very humble and beautiful whenever we see them living a quiet life before all the action starts. This movie is not completely serious either, it has many funny moments as well. Especially at a part involving a walk to the subway. Oh, and there's this moment with a water fountain which I really liked. The locations they used here are pitch perfect by the way. I mean, I'd like to visit many of them now.<br/><br/>This movie is an experience. I had a blast. Hats off again to the filmmakers. If you have a hard time watching films with a lot of violence or action, then you should probably not watch it. But, to any fan of the genre: it's a must see."
"dothancore","10","33","69","10 February 2017"," One of the best (action) films ... EVER !
","I am a big fan of the first John Wick film and Reeves ever since the Matrix movie. To me, the John Wick character is tailor made for him - a man with brilliant fighting skills, and a shade of sadness (in strange a way parallel his personal life in the real world). <br/><br/>Before watching Chapter 2, I was a bit nervous that the 2nd installment would be a let-down, not rising up to the level of the first film ... man I was wrong!! Chapter 2 is in many ways an EVEN BETTER film than the first one. <br/><br/>EVERYTHING about it is about right - from the brutal fighting scene (yes, more body count, and more ways to kill, including using a pencil), to the more intrigued (but believable) plot, to the dialogue (which is remarkably good even for a non-action film), and the music – yes, music, which reminded me of the tense music seen in a Denis Villeneuve film (Sicario, Arrival), and Game of the Thrones - it helps elevate the intensity of the fighting scenes to a level that made me almost jumped out my seat a couple of times in the course of two hours. And the choreography - yes, choreography is the right word for this action film, the lighting, the setting (whether it is under tunnel of ancient Rome, or subway in NYC, or an art museum), and action sequence ... everything is done brilliantly. The film feels like a poem, an art movie, a Chopin Waltz, which is really stunning considering it is an action film and all the cold killings and blood shed... yet it lets the audience identify themselves with the main character, feel justice is served towards the end. <br/><br/>The way they ended the film, I can only hope Chapter 3 is coming along soon!<br/><br/>By the way I rarely write reviews for film, but this time is different, this movie is different."

We got to learn more about John Wick and how strategic and deadly he truly is. There are a couple of scenes that slightly reminded me of The Matrix trilogy, which internally kind of made me laugh.<br/><br/>There is some slight humor to this movie but it has perfect time and is very well done. It's not cheesy or corny at all. It fits the movie style.<br/><br/>I seriously hope they make a 3rd John Wick.<br/><br/>I am definitely going to watch this movie again, next weekend."
"roomanamir","10","24","48","11 February 2017"," Wick goes off again and even more explosively!
","John Wick: Chapter 2<br/><br/>The first one grabbed the audiences by throat. It was in your face on how to innovate and capture the dance of Gun-fu. But what made the first one captivating was its presentation of the crime and assassins' world, their code of conduct, their hangouts, the hotels they stay- in, etc. It seems that Chad Stahelski knew what made the first one so fascinating and did a commendable effort in creating a further depth in this world. John Wick seems like a book cover only versus the Chapter 2, which comes across like a whole dossier on this underworld's crime kingpins and how the hired killers operate across the globe. I am still wondering who is the managing the accounts opening department. Guess this is another point very successfully developed in the movie and by the end of it, you want to know more about the operations of this underworld. And this need for knowing further left you wanting more Chapters.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 start with a usual chase scene. Its robust, skillful, too long but ends unexpectedly. It reminded me of another movie, Blade II. which was 2nd in series, had exactly same way starting with a chase in continuation from the first movie. But as the movie progressed, you realized that how amazing the story line and much bigger and bolder are the action scenes. Chapter 2 is audacious and has enough action to fulfill Adrenalin and video game junkies. It doesn't have any character that are there just there for the need of the scene. I will look forward to return of that henchman in Chapter 3 that was left on the train with a blade in his heart.<br/><br/>Having discussed the greatness of this movie, I still find bit difficult to believe that smart man as John Wick agrees to do one last job to free himself from the oath. The kind of a job which is self- explanatory that there will be consequences after this hit. So why even accept it and not kill the one who burned your house. However, by the end, the movie is bit heavy handed in dealing with the psychological pressure that John Wick faces as he sits with his nameless dog in his burned house and mourns the loss of his life, his beloved wife and the emptiness of his heart. Its takes a rare risk to show how this undefeatable anti-hero will face the same fate as anyone who breaks the rules of the house. I love when movie makers are willing to take chances to show that even the mighty ones have a limit and powerless of their fate. Above all like us they are extremely flawed driven by their primitive need to fulfill their immediate hunger.<br/><br/>John Wick Chapter 2, like its predecessor is one the best action movies in its specific category. It works like a video game during the shootout scenes but from time to time it slows down for hand to hand combat and giving you a glimpse of grit and resolve the characters have. It always a pleasure to see that besides the main protagonist, other players are also as skill full, intelligent and as fierce as John Wick.<br/><br/>This time also, the wick goes off and creates an explosive experience. In the memory of my favorite movie citric Roger Ebert, I would like to say that this movie is two thumbs up and way up. 4 out of 4 stars."

I think the start of the film was pretty rocky if you ask me. Wick goes to retrieve his car yet doesn't seem to even care to much if it gets demolished. I'm wondering what even the point of the beginning was? I feel that they could've included that part into the last movie, probably would have flowed better.<br/><br/>And if I'm being honest, Keanu Reeves didn't do that great in acting for this sequel.<br/><br/>There wasn't any character development or really any story line, just a ton of killing over and over."

After seeing a preview screening of this I was blown away away by the sheer amount of extreme, non-stop faced paced, gory, gun blazing action sequences this film delivered! I just loved it!<br/><br/>The story starts with John Wick making peace with a Mafia boss which he had dealings with in the previous film, which queues the title sequence, followed on by the main story for the sequel. After John refuses a fellow client of a assignment, he gets his his blown to bits via a grenade launcher, only for John to travel to New York to inquire about what happened, he then agrees to do the assignment only to be set up by the client himself who then puts a hit out on John with nearly every hit-man getting the top pound for assassinating john with also a former arch enemy from the previous film also after him in tail for killing the clients target!<br/><br/>I found the film to be very enjoyable from start to finish! The action sequences where truly epic & crisp, not to mention the bloody killings & brutal attacks which added to the edgy grittiness of the film! The story-line was good also & the film as a whole, to be so entertaining you were just waiting for something to happen, hell you thought if it wasn't going to end with nearly every scene being pure hard cold action from around every corner!

It's kinda like they wanted to show you what John Wick could do in the first movie but did not have the money so they just told you, and now that they have the money they'll show you, and they do a beautiful job of it. The cinematography and the art direction perfectly contradict the graphic details of the killing business Wick is so good at.<br/><br/>And Keanu man! What is this like his forth comeback? John Wick is literally catered to this man's style of acting. Not much in the words, says a lot with very little and says even more with his action. It's like a John Wayne Clint Eastwood deal with John Wick being this seasoned outlaw who wants to be left alone but comes from a world where that's impossible because he's so great in this element.<br/><br/>Herd somewhere that the production team for John Wick is made out of the Stunt team for the Matrix, and they most likely have been talking about producing this on camera stunt extravaganza for years, and they made it perfect.

"cruise01","10","24","51","9 February 2017"," John Wick is pure awesome with impressive action set pieces.
","John Wick does what no sequel can ever accomplish for this action thriller that lives up to the original. It's bigger and spectacle with impressive gun shoot outs and fight choreography. John Wick: Chapter 2 is awesome for those who liked the first movie or love action films. I found this film to be an improvement over the last installment when it came to the non stop action sequences, more strategic gun shoot outs, and a thrilling car chase. <br/><br/>The plot follows not to distant from the first film. John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is contracted to go back to his old ways of being an assassin. Santino (Riccardo Scamarcio) sends him a target of killing his sister. Well, not every thing falls into plan when she has her body guard Cassian (Common) that will play cat and mouse with nonstop shootouts. And John Wick gets a high priced bounty on his head with every assassin trying to hunt him down. <br/><br/>Director Chad Stahelski does what worked the first time around and tries to expand this world of assassins and continental hotels, where it's a safe haven for assassins with rules they have to play by. The plot is just straightforward and simple, which the film just uses to put every fight sequence in play. It would sometimes feel like a video game seeing John Wick fight against countless bad guys in every set piece in a creative way and on easy mode, which makes him look unstoppable. Chad Stahelski second film is starting to put him in line for making entertaining action films. Cause these types of films could have been flawed with repetitive shoot outs and no cares on what happens next. Unlike this second installment, every set piece tries to top the other. There was a subway sequence when John and Cassian were both trying to take each other out with silenced pistols in a crowded station while remaining covered from the public. Or a climax that takes place in a museum art shot in hallways with lighting mirror effect which makes these guys fighting each other difficult to find out were the gun is aiming at. <br/><br/>The direction is well done in keeping a fast paced, loud gun shootouts and chases. The cinematography was well maintained in capturing impressive shots during the shootouts and the fight choreography. Keanu Reeves is back in action and he does not hold back. So far doing really well with these films. Then, we have Common, who plays a character that can be on the same league with John Wick's skills. Ruby Rose is stunning as ever as the fierce silent Assassin Ares. It is nice to see her doing more films, after seeing her in a brief appearance in Resident Evil: The Final Chapter or xXx 3. Hope to see her back in action in more movies. <br/><br/>John Wick is an exciting joy ride for action fans and hopes to see more from this. I recommend seeing it, which you would not be disappointed."

John Wick Chapter 2 maintains all the exquisitely-choreographed action scenes and gripping story elements you could ever ask for. <br/><br/>Not that surprising, since director Chad Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad both return to collaborate on the film. <br/><br/>(Possible Spoilers Ahead) Chapter 2 begins shortly after the events of the first film, with Wick tracking down his sexy Mustang (A plot hole I was concerned about after the events of John Wick). After that, everything kicks in to even higher gear. (End Spoilers)<br/><br/>The story is excellent. Without spoiling anything, I can say that it expands the mythology of the film's world to great effect, something that I found incredibly exciting as a fan. I can also safely say that the plot is much more interesting than I expected it to be. <br/><br/>The action scenes are also excellent. Said scenes are choreographed within an inch of their life and most of them are shot in single-take wide shots with very little editing which allows the audience to enjoy the action without being bombarded by constant edits and headache- inducing sound effects. I appreciate this quite a lot, as action bits in several other films over the last few years have suffered from these afflictions. This is a trend that John Wick ignores in favor of showing off the skill of the choreographers and stunt people. <br/><br/>(More possible spoilers) The last bit of the film is also quite gripping and manages to set up a third film without feeling ham-fisted or awkward in any way. If there is to be a sequel, I simply cannot wait. (End spoilers)<br/><br/>All in all, John Wick Chapter 2 is about as perfect as a sequel fans could hope for. If you liked the first, then the second will please you just as much, if not more, than the original. <br/><br/>Fans of John Wick and fans of action in general will be pleased. <br/><br/>10/10"

","I know this has polled (somehow) 8.3 on the IMDb Richter scale but I don't believe it. I also don't believe the amazingly positive review that's on the lead page, from Johhny Someone in Indonesia. I think that's industry hype. Where's the plot? This is a mashup of the Davinci Code, Raid 2 and Enter the Dragon - Markers? What markers? Where did they come from without explanation? OK, so in the first movie they kill his dog and fair enough, he gets upset and takes them all out, but this? He does a job he doesn't want to do because of the 'markers' - whatever and then they double cross him? What's the point of some stupid 'honour' system if it can be so easily countermanded? The point is to justify the excessive violence of the action scenes - and leave you with a cliffhanger just in case they think they can milk a third instalment out of the franchise. How many brains do you need to blow out in an action scene? Then I phone the special 'contract killers agency' with all the old fashioned secretaries doing the admin and then send text messages to all their handy agents. What a lot of contract killers New York has sitting around on the streets waiting for work and our wounded and somewhat tired hero suddenly is transported from Rome to New York and wanders around taking hits from all sides and yet still manages to take out all his assailants. It's not an action movie, it's a body count movie. Do we think for one minute that our hero is going to fail after seeing how many times his magic underwear protects him in Rome? This is the most ludicrous drivel that I have ever seen. It reminds me of that rubbish Salt when the super powered, anorexic, Angelina Jolie goes throughout the movie performing acts of the most incredible physical endurance which is exactly what anorexics are known for... Now let's talk about Keannu's acting or rather lack of it. Wooden would be an injustice to trees. You might think Ben Afflik is a bad actor but Keannu manages to make John Wayne look versatile, his weird, stilted delivery is apparently deliberate, but to what end? You can throw a million Lawrence Fishburns at a movie like this but you are not going to save it. So no humour, no suspense, just a whole load of set pieces that barely hang together, no character development, no nothing. You can see traces of the set pieces from the first Avengers movie as well. Some nice cinematography, congratulations to the art department, nice white, back lit subways, nice white and blue set pieces, nice classical music (like the first Avengers) to set the scene. Written and directed by men with the mental and emotional age of nine this movie will sink into the abyss and end up on the slag heap of movie history right next to Salt - where it justly belongs."

","""The man. The myth. The legend. John Wick. You are not very good at retiring.""<br/><br/>Thank god John Wick is not good at retiring. He is back, and obliterates every action movie made in the last 10 years, out of the park. Hollywood history has proved bigger is not necessarily better, but John Wick is one of the few exceptions. 2X bigger budget, but 4X the fun as compared to the original.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the movie starts 5 days after the first movie ended, with Wick tracking down his trusty Mustang at yet another Tarasov's. A brutal fight follows that seems pointless as it ends in a peace offering, but it is not quite pointless- it sets up John Wick's character for the uninitiated. That he is focused, commitment, has sheer fu***ng will, and all the stories about him are watered down versions of actual events. And that is the excellent thing about the characters in John Wick 2. They help grow the mystery around the main character, keep adding to his legend. Because as far as the plot goes, it can be summed up in one line- handguns, shotguns, assault rifles, pencils, knives or hands- Wick will kill lots of people in the most inventive ways possible.<br/><br/>""You stabbed the devil in the back. To him this isn't vengeance, this is justice""<br/><br/>While director Chad Stahelski might have been a stuntman, but John Wick 2 is not all action. It is funny too, like horror movie funny. Incredible action pieces are followed up by tense, yet funny moments. Think Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2 rolled in one. Keanu Reeves is again perfect as the unkillable assassin, dispatching 128 people in the movie, in elaborately choreographed style, yet seeming lovable and hopeless romantic at the same time. Apparently ex-Special Forces folks trained him and that shows in his physical performance. In current form, close quarter armed or unarmed, he might even take on Bond, Reacher, Hunt and Bourne, all together, and make it out alive. All the while looking way better than those guys.<br/><br/>""Tailor: Is this a formal event or a social affair? John Wick: Social. Tailor: How many buttons? John Wick: Two. Tailor: And what style? John Wick: Tactical...""<br/><br/>While Wick is stylish, his style has both art and purpose. His impeccably tailored suit serves as his body armor. His moves have a dance like feel. The criminal world he belongs to has the same kind of resources that Bond has access to, yet crazily, has a code of honor. By the time the movie is over, you might be left wondering if there is a thing called ""too much."" <br/><br/>Spoiler- The climax doffs its hat to another cult classic action flick- Enter the Dragon.

"darryl-42069","9","19","40","11 February 2017"," Definitely beats it's competitors... with a pencil.
","Il'l just get straight to the point.<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest action movie I've seen in recent years. The story is simple: Someone asked John to assassinate someone. He refuses, his house got blown up, and later goes out for a revenge after getting framed for it. The movie is not just your average popcorn flick, it's a action movie with intense gunfights, fast- paced choreography, and a lot of dead bodies. Obiously no one can replace Keanu Reeves as the 'Babayaga', because he is John Wick. Other cast members, especially Ian McShane, Common, Ruby Rose (She's on a frenzy! First is the new Triple X (XXX), then Resident Evil, now this!!!) delivers a fine performance as Winston, Cassian, and Ares respectively. Even the minor characters like the arms dealer with a classic British-like voice, the hotel guy, Jimmy the Cop (one of the smartest cops in movie history), and the tailor, all delivers a fine performance. Lawrence Fishburne, appears as The Bowery King and his scenes are definitely one of the best (talking about The Matrix reunion here...).<br/><br/>One of the best aspects in the movie is the world that the director Chad Stahelski is building. John Wick 1 gives us a glimpse of the unique world. This time, the movie takes us further into it, which is good since many people wants to know deeper about the lore. It's innovative, creative, and amazing to the point that make me think a what if scenario where this assassin world is actually real and exists. Another great aspects in this movie is the non-stop action that it delivers. The action goes is a larger scale, yet it don't loses the magic touch that makes the action in the first movie enjoyable. There's more blood and gore in this movie, and the movie takes brutal to a whole new level (all those head shots and pencil scene tho... ). The movie also builds up the events of the (possibly) upcoming Chapter 3, which makes me wonder how writer Derek Kolstad can make a great conclusion since John Wick is set to be a trilogy.<br/><br/>Sadly, the movie is somehow more inferior to it's predecessor. The pace is noticeably much more slower, and there's no music that could bring as much impact as the club scene in the first movie. I was also disappointed with the fact that some of the fight scenes, especially against characters like Cassian and Ares were short. Take Ares (Ruby Rose) as example: From what I see from her, she has a fighter style, hard to defeat character. However in this movie, she was defeated quite easily, which is kinda disappointing since I had expect a epic fight between them. The ending is also kinda rushed and anticlimactic, which is a disappointment.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a heaven to all action movie lovers. It has everything action lovers want, and definitely beats the competition, with a pencil.(calling It now, it will beat Fifty Shades of Whatever). If you like John Wick 1, you definitely love this movie. If you are a crazy action lover, well.. this is your holy grail."

","Having seen the first showing of the first day and leaving the theatre feeling exhausted from the action and upbeat from the ending...knowing chapter 3 should ensue, I felt this movie sets its own bar as Keanu and co. have created the perfect action-fantasy film...somewhat like Pulp Fiction. Perhaps we are left to ponder if the John Wick character is a winner who's going to lose, or a looser who's going to win...regardless, we can't look away and leave wanting more. I don't believe it is necessary to see the first film to get into, and enjoy this offering - which I believe is made firstly, for the big screen, viewing it on TV, later, will dilute the intensity and flavor somewhat.

"quinimdb","8","16","33","10 February 2017"," John Wick 2
","With the plethora of terrible and unnecessary sequels these days, recently ""Inferno"", ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"", and ""Independence Day: Resurgence"", ""John Wick 2"" is a welcome and refreshing surprise.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, the film starts with a chase, and it rarely lets up. After this opening chase, which concludes with John getting his car back, he is confronted by Santino, a man that he made a sacred oath with in order to escape the underworld of hit men was involved in. Since he came back to that world in the first film (and the beginning of this one), he has broken this oath. He is now brought back in to (supposedly) do one last favor for the man that he owes.<br/><br/>The character of John Wick himself is actually quite a troubled one. As you know if you've seen the first one (which you should watch if you plan to watch this one), John Wick had a wife that died, and now all he has left from that time in his life is his dog and his car. He is first forcefully brought back into the hit-man lifestyle, but it is possible that he enjoys his rampages and fits of vengeance, because without a wife or a home, it is all he has. At the same time, he clearly feels guilt and regret for much of what he's done, and what he's lost because of his actions. John is lonely, and his loneliness twists him throughout the story.<br/><br/>While John Wick may be surprisingly layered for an action hero, the film is also incredibly efficient in the information we are given and how it is given to us. John Wick is the strong, silent type, and most of what we know about him is shown through the editing and the acting, which bluntly conveys exactly what it should, with a very physical performance from Keanu Reeves. The many other performances in the film are fantastic as well, especially Ian Mcshane and the short cameo by Laurence Fishburn. The world building is also impressively done, with most of it just being shown to us, and only what needs to be explained being explained to us, such as the two rules of this business. Sometimes, character and world building is woven into the action. Oh, and what incredible action. This has - hands down - some of the best action scenes in this decade, and probably even in subsequent decades before it. Chases, hand to hand combat, shootouts, you name it; it's all here, and it is all fantastically shot and edited, perfectly choreographed, and consistently creative and intense. The frame is wide and the shots each last long enough to have a clear view of the brutal and precisely choreographed action, unlike many action scenes in modern Hollywood. There were several moments where my jaw was literally dropping at how intense and consistently original all of the action was. Even though John takes out hundreds of people, there is always a genuine sense of struggle in each fight, and each encounter is unpredictable, with a constant sense that a fight could break out at almost any moment.<br/><br/>The constantly vibrant color palette, the stylized subtitles, and the sense of humor throughout the film also all show that the film isn't taking itself too seriously. It knows that it is over the top, and it realizes the absurdity of the situations, and often makes comedy out of it. It is self aware about the crazy 80's-style action shclockiness; it knows exactly what it is, which is a non-stop, full force, fun action film, with just enough time in between to give context, characters, and motivations that you understand. It is the rare sequel that surpasses its predecessor, and one of the best action films I've seen in ages."
"abisio","9","18","38","12 February 2017"," Almost perfect
","The first John Wick was such an original and perfectly crafted movie that 10 out of 10 seems only fair. The sequel lacks the originality of the first one but carries I higher level of dark humor.<br/><br/>The end however is so sad that I only hope Chapter Three takes less than than three years to arrive. The sad ending (which is perfect by the way but humanizes the character perhaps too much) is the only reason I gave 9 out of 10 stars. <br/><br/>Chad Stahelski the stuntman turned director of this one and the first; knows a few things about action movies and overused clichés. The stunt sequences are impressive and clichés are used as dark jokes between the impossible to follow body count. Almost everybody in the theater was laughing and/or gasping with every scene change. <br/><br/>The prologue of the movie where Peter Stormare (usually a very bad guy which always dies) gives the finest comedy moments of his career in during a maelstrom of killings and car crashes and as a final touch his life is spared.<br/><br/>After that hyper-active beginning the movie slows down for a few minutes (it needs some story line to justify what comes next) and re-start with a higher level of violence but dialog to a minimum (""He does not like to waste words"" a character states).<br/><br/>In brief; more violent and with more humor than the first one; so do not think; just go an see it once or twice at least."

Chapter 2 takes the story, action- choreography, the dialogue and the whole world around John Wick to a new and higher level. I love the etiquette between the people involved, even when they despise each other they still act courteous to each other. The cast is brilliant, and I love the fact that they speak the different dialogues which contain foreign tongues like they should, which is in that particular language and present it subbed. It makes the atmosphere even better and it adds to the production-value and the credibility of the situation at hand. I didn't think it was possible, but they made a masterpiece of a movie.

The movie shows more about assassins life and about their rules and that was awesome to see I am glad that director listened to the fans. Because of this deeper insight in assassins, better visual looking, awesome action sequences its safe to say that this was better than the first one of course the first one was good also I gave it 7 and this one gets 8.After all I really recommend you to watch this is one of the better movies this year so far."

"RforFilm","8","11","21","14 February 2017"," John Wick: Chapter 2 continues it's faced paced, neo-noir story of our assassin
","In 2014, a Keanu Reeves revenge thriller John Wick became a surprise hit. I originally skipped out on the film as I felt that the trailers only showed an assassin story that I felt I've seen before. As far as I'm concerned, I made a big mistake. Before seeing the sequel, I felt it was important to watch the first one. I rented it on Amazon Prime and I was shock by what I saw; a dark, stylish, and fun action movie that is doing it's own thing. Though I've seen plenty stories about revenge (The Count of Monte Cristo and Moby Dick being the prime examples), I can't recall one over someone's pet being murdered. <br/><br/>I've always liked Keanu Reeves as an actor whether he's a metelhead from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, a SWAT officer in Speed, or ""a chosen one"" from The Matrix franchise. He has a more reserved, yet intriguing way of adapting that to his characters. Under a good direction, this can create a strong character. This has worked for John Wick, which reminds me of an older James Bond-type if the movie was more of a noir. I was happy to sit and watch John Wick: Chapter 2.<br/><br/>After a great opening where he finishes his mission from the first movie to collect his stolen car, John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves) returns home with his new dog to try and find peace with his retirement and death of his wife from before. Like a lot of typical spy movies, John gets visited by Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio (played by Riccardo Scamarcio)who asks him to come out of retirement. Santino asks to have his sister assassinated so that her brother can have her seat at a table of mafia heads. When John refuses despite making a blood oath years ago, Santino has the assassins home destroyed.<br/><br/>John accepts the job knowing that saying no would only put his life in danger. In Rome, he finds the sister Gianna at a party, but she commits suicide rather then allowing an assassin to get her. On his way out, John finds himself double-crossed by Santino who has sent some of his weaponed goons lead by the mute Ares (played by Ruby Rose). Though John escapes and makes it back to New York, Santino has put out a seven million dollar contract on our hero to cover all the tracks. <br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2 manages to pull off a really good sequel. Not only does it expand the John Wick universe more, but the stakes feel bigger and the villains seem more threatening. Now that I have seen the first movie, I can see how tough it would be to follow up on a pretty good action movie. Unlike the Taken sequels which simply repeated the formula over and over again, John Wick: Chapter 2 still feels fresh thanks to it's plot which honestly kept me guessing on how things were going to move forward. <br/><br/>Do I think it's a higher rated movie then before? No, simply because if it does have any faults, it's that it feels a bit long. Not the segment in Rome, but when John returns to New York. It's quick pace suddenly halts when he visits a friend. Though the scene is okay, I feel like they could have cut it in favor have keeping up with John's mysterious background. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is still the perfect choice as John Wick. You can tell this man wants to be happy, but understand that with his connection to the crime world, is unlikely to happen. This is enough to keep me hyped for another John Wick movie.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight grey pitbulls out of ten. If you liked the first movie, you'll definitely like the sequel. John Wick has plenty of action waiting to burst, so I can only say love your dog and go see this sequel."

","Great action movie, true fiction and fun. No it's not believable, nor was the Matrix or Lord of the Rings for example. That being said, it was amazingly choreographed, the actors and stunt men were exceptional, you could tell the work the actors put into making the fight scenes were visceral and alive. I have always liked Keanu Reeves, he has made many of my favorite movies, and I respect the work, effort, and training that he and the other actors, put into the movie. It really shows. Ian McShane in my honest opinion, is one of the finest actors of our age. I always look forward to any part he plays.

","The Boogeyman has had a lot of different forms over the years from grotesque features, grossly deformed into the vision of nightmares to a man with slicked back hair and a depressed look on his face? No, I'm not delirious my friends, but the reference I made is to the codename of John Wick, the legendary assassin of 2014. After a thrilling, and complete conclusion, one may have thought Wick's journey ended there. Obviously, Hollywood did not think so and thus comes Chapter 2 of the action adventure and whatever, random target that is assigned. Robbie K here, and today we take a look at John Wick: Chapter 2. Let's get started!<br/><br/>Likes:  Dry sense of humor  Visuals and special effects  Stable camera work  Lots of action and excitement<br/><br/>Summary: There isn't much in regards to John Wick, so finding a like outside of action, but one component is the dry sense of humor this film has. Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a man of few words, but the few he speaks are worth a good laugh. The writers win points for a dialogue that is both pun filled and classy, timing them at key points to maximize laughs while sticking to the stoic nature of our players. <br/><br/>Yet the humor is just an added bonus to what is John Wick's strongest feature, the action. All the reviews are in agreement that Wick is back with more action than ever imagined, as this one-man army unleashes a storm of well-placed bullets, knife slashing (and sometimes pencil) stand offs, and Marshal Arts punches. Wick's skills with a pistol (among other weaponry) are intense displays of choreography, proving that you can coordinate extras dying to imaginary wounds in an exciting way. The hand-to-hand combat also gets points, not quite as developed as the 70s and 80s movies, but still an enjoyable element to mix things up. Helping support all the action is impressive special effects, which adds the extra flare and touch that gets our hearts pumping (e.g. explosions, crashes, and comic book bashing sounds). You can guess there is plenty of blood to go around too (for you gore seeking fans), which adds more to the chaos and violence at hand that somehow adds a bit of satisfaction to the mix. But even better, is the entire film has stable camera work that keeps you scoped on the action without making you vomit due to vertigo. Overall, this exciting package gets two thumbs up in its etiquette, design, and impressive work on the action. <br/><br/>Dislikes:  Keanu's acting (at times)  Simplistic story  Overstepping boundaries at times  Some fights a bit blocky  Unorthodox presentation  Slower parts a bittoo slow<br/><br/>Summary: While we never expected an academy for this performance, there are times where Keanu's acting is a bit too lax. His lines are meant to be serious, but come out awkward, effortless, and sometimes bored at the unoriginal dialogue. While this certainly isn't a big weakness, there are moments where this acting took away Wick's awesome factor, or made me chuckle unintentionally. <br/><br/>Acting aside, the story is another limiting factor that Wick really needs some fine tuning on. Yes, I know story isn't the main theme of this series (hence why I make a genre rating people), but movie overall this film's plot is a little less put together than its predecessor. A random guy shows up, tells a vague back story to establish a weak connection, and then becomes another revengeful chase across two cities. All the convoluted (shallowly explained) relationships and teases did nothing but make more targets for Wick and did nothing to add to the story for me. <br/><br/>Finally, while the action is indeed awesome and well done, there are still a few limitations that hit this quality. First, those who aren't fans of repetitive gun play and headshots, need to skip this filmbecause that is a majority of the action. But outside of repetition, the action sometimes oversteps the boundaries of realism. A car mercilessly being smashed (and smashing) yet still running, a number of injuries that magically heal, and the inaccuracy of other assassins are just some of the eye-rolling moments of this film. In addition, some of the fist fights get very blocky, have awkward pauses, or lack the edge (music and sound effects) that make the fighting less exciting and more we just extending screen time. Another component I didn't like was how they reduced Wick's fighting of other assassins to a messy set of montages that seemed out of place and were lackluster compared to Wick fighting off nameless extras. Such missed potential for memorable rivalries, and more diverse fights. And even more missed potential, was the slower parts not taking time to advance a story, or establish better character dynamics, which made for some dragged out moments.<br/><br/>The Verdict:<br/><br/>Wick's journey of revenge and killing is certainly more exciting than his last ordeal. The emphasis is on the action, with a majority of the film geared towards the stunts, effects, and violence, so adrenaline junkies strap up and hit the theater. However, if you are looking for the complete package of story, dynamics, and balance, then this film isn't the right one for you. Wick still lacks a lot of other qualities in the movie overall category. Worth a trip to theater? Yes, as the special effects and excitement are made for the theater. But if you can't handle extreme violence then skip!<br/><br/>My scores: Action/Crime/Thriller: 8 (for the action) Movie Overall: 5"

But soon the mobster Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) visits him to show Wick's marker and tells that he needs to help. John Wicks refuses since he is retired and Santino blows-up his house. John Wick meets the owner of the Continental hotel in New York City, Winston (Ian McShane), and he tells that Wick cannot violate the Mafia rules and shall honor the marker. Santino asks John Wick to kill his sister Gianna D'Antonio (Claudia Gerini) in Rome so that he can sit on the High Table of the criminal organizations. When John Wicks accomplishes his assignment, Santino puts a seven-million dollar contract on him attracting professional killers from everywhere. But Wick promises to kill Santino that is not protected by his marker anymore. <br/><br/>""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a great sequel of the first film and the beginning of a promising franchise. The film is full of action and every viewer is certainly looking forward to the next sequel. Keanu Reeves is excellent in the role of John Wick. My vote is eight.

"manuel-m6995","10","19","41","11 February 2017"," One of the best sequels and most action packed movies I've ever seen
","The first John Wick film was a great surprise. The story was simple and pure, the action and choreography were top notch and the hint at world building was very intriguing. When I heard that a second movie was in the works, I was worried that it would fail to live up to the original (as most movie lovers are). All I can say is that John Wick Chapter 2 is sensational. I watched the first film 3 days before watching the second, and my god was the action in Chapter 2 better than the first. Seeing the actual actor do most of these scenes really makes you believe that this character is real and that he's a force to be reckoned with. I loved the shootout scenes but my favorite are the hand to hand combat he does with higher level assassins like himself. The story isn't as simple as the first, but it really fleshes out the underground world of assassins in this universe. It introduces us to new characters, places and systems to really give us the sense that these are things that go on in secret all over the world. I like to give movies ratings based off what they're trying to achieve. This is an action movie, and as action movies go, John Wick Chapter 2 is one of the best action movies I've ever experienced and a truly worthy sequel to the first."
"Quinoa1984","8","15","31","9 February 2017"," As with most things when it comes to modern (unoriginal in plot) films, it's all in the (ahem, straightens tie) execution.
","This movie takes a little while to really get started - by this I mean the first half of the movie is going through the motions as far as story goes, with the set-up being that Wick owes one of those 'blood oaths' to a criminal scumbag and, after the guy sets his house on fire (as if he expects a smile to come from Wick with this task), he has him go kill his sister in Italy, who sits on some worldwide-criminal-council thing - but once it does, and it really does about 35/40 minutes in (and even more-so once Wick comes back from Rome to NYC), it's a violent pot of fun.<br/><br/>There's not much to intellectualize with this kind of filmmaking - like in the first movie, you get what it advertises, as Reeves kills a lot of people. I think what carries it over from being potentially boring or dreadful is that the execution is excellent. Chad Stahelski, who co-directed the first bone-crunching/guns-firing-knives-stabbing extravaganza, returns as solo director working from what must have been a thin script from Derek Kolstad. By this I mean not just in dialog, though Wick is a decidedly 'talk-less-action-and-looking-listening-more' kind of action anti-hero, but also that the director, who was a stunt-man for years, set out to craft this film completely during the shooting, with some minimal editing. What sets it apart from other action drek is Reeves as a formidable presence (the less he does, too, the better for us all), and how the director and his DP choose to shoot it, favoring comparatively to today long(er) takes and a flow to the action that is kinetic without being overly so.<br/><br/>In other words, if you somehow dragged yourself out to Jason Bourne last summer and left with a migraine headache, then this is the opposite of that. Once the action gets to New York, and the villain character fully puts his set-up of Wick into motion (how Wick didn't see it coming is a flaw, but I'll let that go for now on this viewing), everyone is out to get Wick and the intensity comes from all of the staging. I can't stress enough that if you love action direction that has clarity and UMPH to it, this is your kind of movie. Not to mention there's the added bonus of having Laurence Fishburne as some pigeon-cooper type who also has his own underground homeless(!) criminal element going on. I wished there was more of him, as he plays this character with a perverse joy to everything (even how he wears a robe), but hopefully there's more to see in part 3 - and yes, there will be a part 3, I can assure you.<br/><br/>The highlight I must mention before I wrap this up: a sequence involving mirrors at a museum. Oh goodness is this spectacular work! Again, there's not exactly ""story"" here, but there is a progression of events and how the characters move in this environment feels less like a rip-off of a, I dunno, Enter the Dragon style climax than a part homage and then partly doing something else (at times the way the director uses color is absorbing too, like out of the best parts of Skyfall). I could watch this sequence over and over for how assured the staging is, how we always know where the characters are or, if we don't, it's not for too long, and how visceral the action is maintained in this setting. I could recommend the movie on this scene alone - that there are other set pieces that come close to its virtuosity makes it almost a must see.<br/><br/>To close, I don't want to rate this TOO highly; at the end of the day, John Wick Chapter Two is action junk, a comic book with little on its mind but to get its guns-and-punches audience frothing at the mouth. But it keeps being an intriguing comic-book for adults, and it builds just enough from the first movie's quasi-mythology (once again Ian McShane is the ""manager"" of this hotel that is exclusively for hit men and criminals it would seem). This is a world that is not entirely meant to be in a reality, but creating its own, and that kept me interested despite the familiar beats."
"Fedoics","4","20","44","16 February 2017"," Action>Story
","The first John Wick was a bit of a revolutionary when it came to action films. It brought interesting and dynamic action and did for guns what samurai movies did for swords. The 'gun play' in that movie was never boring.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about John Wick: Chapter 2<br/><br/>I'll start with the good parts of this movie.<br/><br/>A lot of the technical parts of this movie were fantastic. The lighting in each scene brought a stylized look and feel to the movie. The sound design is great, making each punch and gun shot ever the more powerful. The choreography is A+, which is expected from a John Wick film. You can really tell they put a lot of time and effort into making sure every action scene has great choreography. <br/><br/>The acting from Keanu Reeves was pretty good, he has what I call the 'Schwarzenegger effect'. He was able to take cheesy lines, and there were a lot, and deliver them in a not so cheesy way. He was very devoted to making sure every stunt looked good, doing all of his own stunts.<br/><br/>Onto the bad parts.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure what happened, the first John Wick had a decent story, giving our main character a good motivation throughout and leaving a good payoff for the audience. John Wick: Chapter 2 has none of this.<br/><br/>While I can't give away too much without getting into spoiler territory, I'll say this. John Wick's motivation in this film is very bad. In the first film he had the motivation of, ""You killed my dog my late wife gave to me and stole my car"". In this film it's less believable and way too convoluted.<br/><br/>John Wick is the only memorable character in this entire film because the film is about him. The villain is the typical villain you'd expect in any action film with his/her typical henchmen. Even the villain's motivation is a bit dodgy. I'm not quite sure why Laurence Fishburne is in this movie, he has two scenes and talks like Negan from The Walking Dead the entire time. He provides no real story other than some background information. The end of this film started an interesting idea within the universe but cut it short for the third movie.<br/><br/>The music in this movie is pretty awful. It's your typical dubstep in each and every action scene, which gets annoying over a long period of time. <br/><br/>Sadly, even the action got boring after about an hour. Every single action scene is, ""let me use my fists then go behind a corner, grab a gun, shoot for a bit, reload, shoot for a bit, go behind another corner, grab a bigger gun, shoot for a bit, reload, shoot for a bit, go behind yet another corner and grab a bigger gun, shoot for a bit, reload, and shoot for some more"". I just described an entire action scene from this film.<br/><br/>The payoff for this film was so quick and had no impact on the audience. Heck, the scene that had the most impact on the audience was John Wick, two baddies, and a pencil.<br/><br/>Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 has some great technical things going for it that they improved since the first film. The acting was pretty solid from Reeves but with his character being the only memorable one. The story quality has significantly decreased since the first film with characters motivations being convoluted and, at times, a bit silly. If you're with a couple of friends and you feel like turning off your brain for a while, you'll have fun with John Wick: Chapter 2."

"NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954","8","12","24","15 February 2017"," Reasons Why John Wick: Chapter 2 is a Rare Kind of Sequel
","The opening to this movie is completely bonkers, brutal, and bash*t crazy. From the opening scene, I can tell you that this is one of the best action scenes of the year already. Everything from the stunts, style, and editing are tremendously well done. If you are an action movie fanboy or fangirl, get out your tissues, baby wipes, or whatever and get ready to clean up, because this action packed opening scene is orgasmic to anyone who is a fan of action films. <br/><br/>You can really tell the director Chad Stahelski is truly someone who knows about action films. I actually heard that he was a stunt double on the Keanu Reeves The Matrix film. Therefore, he is someone who knows the art of action. One of my personal biggest problems with action movies today are the stunts and editing. In John Wick: Chapter 2, Reeves looks like he is doing a majority of the stunts. Also, the fight scenes aren't annoying, trendy, and lazy shaky camera work. You can tell what is happening, who is being hit, the location, and how well everything is choreographed. I have not seen action scenes filmed this well since one of my favorite action films, 2014s The Raid 2. <br/><br/>Accordingly, the people who are a part of this crime organization are very cool, stylish, and at times I thought would be a cool world to be a part of. These criminals, and assassins, stay hidden in this deep dark crime filled society. So the film does a fantastic job at expanding on this universe. It really is the rule of narrative, where it is showing us and not telling us, which is a key factor in storytelling. Everything in this world unfolds in action, dialogue, and scenes throughout the film. <br/><br/>Common (Luv, Barbershop: The Next Cut) and Reeves have the best fight scene in the movie. It looks like it was all done in one take. Amazing scene, and once again Common plays a terrific bad guy.<br/><br/>In addition, Ruby Rose (xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter) is slowing starting to become one of my favorite female action stars. I believe she can actually make a career in cinema as a female action star. <br/><br/>I know we are talking about a world of death, assassins, and criminals. But one thing I have to discuss is how this is a very diverse movie. We get men, women, different races of people, different cultures, Ruby Rose has proudly come out as a lesbian, and this is the type of cast be should be seeing in 2017 and beyond. <br/><br/>Action movie fans will love it. Common and Reeves have the best fight in the movie. In addition, Rose and Reeves have a fight in a hall of mirrors. That reminded me of the movie Enter the Dragon, so there is a lot of throwback sequences to older action films. This world they created is stylish, fun, has mind blowing stunt work, unlike the first film no animals were harmed in the making of the movie, and is everything a sequel should be. Is it better than the first film? I believe they are both equally brilliant. I believe John Wick: Chapter 2 earns a<br/><br/>8 out of 10! <br/><br/>Thank you all for reading, and or viewing, I hope you all have an amazing day as always, and remember don't just get down, but get Boogie. :)<br/><br/>Review written by - Nile Fortner"
"Aaron1375","9","12","24","13 February 2017"," I think I would pass on the chance to take out John Wick...
","I did not see the first John Wick until well after it had come out. The trailer just did not do it justice and I was unable to discern what it was about as it almost seemed a sequel to something. However, I would get around to seeing it when quite a number of people told me it was a really good action/revenge film. So, this time around, I was not going to miss my chance to go see the film on the big screen and I am happy to report it is a very cool action film and almost as good as the first. Not quite, mind you, as I do think a lot of the emotional impact from the first is gone, but on the plus side here, you get to delve deeper into this world of crime bosses and assassins that was established in the first film. So as I said it is almost as good as the first, just not quite there. More characters are introduced and there are a number from the first film that make their return to this one as well. The action is frequent and often as you get thrust right into the chaos of Wick's world and through you get to see a number of shootouts, fist fights, knife fights and pencil fights! So yeah, you could say that John Wick is back! <br/><br/>The story has John Wick picking up his car to finish up the business he had in the first film. Afterwards, he has officially retired and seems like he will be content living alone with his dog. Unfortunately, peace does not seem to be in his cards as a crime boss named Santino needs Wick to do a job for him. Wick wants to refuse; however, Santino did Wick a favor and now Wick owes him a marker. If he refuses he is dead, if kills Santino he is dead and if he runs he is dead. So he takes on the job after Santino destroys Wick's home to motivate him and Wick is on the job which is to kill Santino's sister! Things kick complicated and soon a lot of assassins are out to kill John Wick and there seems to be little he can do to get out of the predicament other than kill everyone! <br/><br/>I like Keanu Reeves, I find him to be an enjoyable actor. I know a lot of people do not care for him, but I like his work. I, myself, cannot stomach Mark Wahlberg so each person has their own tastes. I like that they brought back Ian McShane as his character is very interesting and I like the whole world that they set up in these films. It almost seems like these characters are part of some established world, like a series of graphic novels or something they way that the two films have played out. There is definitely an opening for a third film and I hope it gets made as if it does not, we fans of the two films will really be kept hanging! <br/><br/>So, yes, this film was very enjoyable. I think the first one had the more emotional impact as we got to see a terrible thing done to him and him returning to his deadly past, but this one kind of shows you how his job probably was before he decide to settle down and get married. Almost an equal trade off. The movie is definitely a sequel and feels like it is in the flow of the first film. There have been a few sequels in the past that have kind of felt off. A couple of examples I can think of off the top of my head is the two Ghost Rider films, though the second film did not feel off so much as it was like a completely different world all together and the two Thor films. This one had plenty of action and featured a lot of bloodshed. It did do some computer blood, which I wish they did not do as practical effects as far as blood goes looks a lot better. Did not look bad, but you can tell it was computer generated. Overall, though, my complaints are few and far between while my praise is early and often. I also know that if I was an assassin in this world and I saw John Wick as the hit, I would text back, ""No amount of money is enough!"""
"socrates99","9","12","24","13 February 2017"," A great movie for those of us frustrated with the political scene
","This movie has pretty much perfected the cinematic kill shot. Keanu goes on a killing spree and every shot seems like it was worked out in detail. You look closely and you would swear he was aiming his weapon exactly as needed to produce the blood and brain splatter so skillfully and repeatedly displayed. It's almost a solo dance he does and he has to be given credit for doing it with the grace and precision of a Fred Astaire.<br/><br/>In contrast the first Wick movie seemed a bit tentative though you could see what was intended and feel it was worth attempting. This movie is more complete and fun, and there's no hesitation in execution at all. There's a dreamy sensibility in full bloom aided by Keanu's peculiarly emotionless approach.<br/><br/>There's no confusing all this with real violence though it's believable enough. I think those decrying its violence are way off base. All men have at some point wished they could make some certain people be permanently gone. But what would that even look like? Here's the answer produced skillfully and rather uniquely in a style others will have trouble trying to duplicate. But as a prelude to real violence it's about as useful Animal House was to going to college.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you just want to vent your frustrations, this movie can work better than a punching bag."
"monstermayhem32","9","12","24","11 February 2017"," John wick is back
","In the first film, former hit man John wick wanted revenge after his 1969 Camaro was taken from him and also his dog daisy was killed by Russian mobsters. This time around, John is lured by into his former ways when an old friend named santino wants him to do a favor for him by killing his sister Gianna in order to gain a seat on the high chair council, when John refuses, his home is torched and also discovers a seven million bounty on his head by a bunch of ruthless assassins. I will say that the sequel was fantastic since it goes into more depth over the assassin life that John used to be a part of and Keanu reeves delivers in the role."
"dave-mcclain","8","12","24","11 February 2017"," ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an enjoyable, stylish and action-packed thrill ride.
","In Hawaiian, the native language of Keanu Reeves' biological father, his first name means ""cool breeze over the mountains"". Sounds peaceful, right? Well, early in his career, Reeves played pretty peaceful characters in 1988's ""Dangerous Liaisons"", 1989's ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" and, in 1991, ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"", ""Parenthood"" and as an FBI agent pretending to be a surfer in ""Point Break"". That last role also marked the beginning of Reeves' transition to more intense and even tormented characters, like in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992), ""Speed"" (1994) and ""The Devil's Advocate"" (1997). Although the man with the peaceful-sounding first name still sprinkled in some sweet and peaceful roles (e.g., ""Sweet November"", ""A Walk in the Clouds"", ""The Lake House"" and a voice-over as a kitten named after him in 2016's ""Keanu""), most of the parts Reeves played in the late 1990s and early 2000s have been decidedly un-peaceful – in movies like ""Johnny Mnemonic"", ""The Matrix"" (and its two sequels), ""Constantine"", ""Street Kings"", ""Man of Tai Chi"" (which he also directed), ""47 Ronin"" – plus ""John Wick"" and its sequel ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" (R, 2:02). Peaceful? Not hardly! Entertaining? You betcha! ""Chapter 2"" is a very appropriate phrase to include in this movie's title, for a couple of reasons. The action picks up right after the events of 2014's ""John Wick"". Having come out of hit-man retirement to avenge the murder of his puppy and defend his own life by dispatching scores of bad guys, he now comes for his stolen car, knocking off a few more thugs in the process, and then calls it even with the boss (Peter Stormare) of what's left of the crime family which John has decimated. He calls a mechanic friend (John Leguizamo) to repair what's left of his souped-up Mustang, reburies his weaponry in the floor of his house (under concrete which he lays down himself), looks wistfully at a picture of his late wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan), takes care of his new dog (which he has not yet named) and, to quote the 1980's singer known as Rockwell, John might say, ""All I want is to be left alone in my average home, but I always feel like someone's watching me."" He has good reasons for thinking and feeling all of that.<br/><br/>Since Wick (aka ""The Boogeyman"") came out of retirement (albeit for very good and personal reasons), the international organization of assassins of which he was a part now considers him un-retired. (After all, John himself said in the previous film, ""People keep asking if I'm back. Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back."") Italian assassin Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), a member of one of the families represented at ""The High Table"" of assassins shows up to hand his old friend an amulet with John's bloody thumb print inside, a token of what Santino says is a blood oath which was reinstated when John came out of retirement. John is now obligated to fulfill a ""request"" by Santino or he himself will be killed.<br/><br/>Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of New York's Continental Hotel (a kind of safe house and DMZ for international assassins), reaffirms to John that those are the rules and there is no other way, so John heads to Rome to do his job. John proceeds with his trademark classiness as he plans to execute his responsibility. Of course, nothing will be easy, even for John Wick, and he'll eventually have to defend himself against a number of deadly agents, including one played by Common, and another by Ruby Rose, but he also gets help from ""The Sommelier"" (Peter Sarafinowicz), who deals in a lot more than wine, Charon (Lance Reddick), the classy and extraordinarily helpful concierge at The Continental Hotel – and a blast from Keanu Reeves' own cinematic past (a cool cameo which I don't want to spoil).<br/><br/>""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an enjoyable, stylish and action-packed thrill ride. As good as the original film was, this one keeps what worked so well the first time, takes the plot deeper into the main character's world and adds several interesting new characters. It's an intense action shoot-'em-up, but it's not just the guys who get to have all the fun. (Beware of mute female henchmen, lady violinists on the subway and women who would rather slit their own wrists than become a hit-man's victim.) Besides its many colorful characters, this sequel keeps audiences engaged with its general air of sophistication, its stylized action sequences and visually sumptuous set pieces that are to die for. If you don't mind a high body count and a few vagaries in its plot points, this is everything an action sequel should be – including setting the stage very well for ""Chapter 3"". For now, I'll close this ""John Wick"" chapter with an ""A-""."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","9","6","10","21 May 2018"," Somehow, it matches the quality of the first; beautifully brutal.
","'John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017)' is one of the rare sequels that matches the quality of the first. I don't think it's better, but it's at the same level and that alone is an achievement. It is a highly entertaining film with amazing fast-paced action that's perfectly choreographed and beautifully brutal. It manages to raise the stakes in a natural, if predictably and unavoidably slightly contrived, way while maintaining a unique narrative and story structure. The action set-pieces find new ways to keep fresh even when they don't need to and its ability to open the world while also deepening it is impressive. The character is at the heart of the piece still and it is also notable that they manage to keep him feeling suitably 'legendary' while being markedly human. There are some crowd-pleasing moments, too, and some slightly outlandish segments that shouldn't work but just do. Lawrence Fishburne is especially charismatic in his slightly smaller role and keeps things delightfully fresh just when they threaten to perhaps become not so. Plus, the piece keeps you on your toes with a few fairly genuine surprises. It keeps you smiling just like the first and also promises a third entry that has the potential to truly excel, whilst also standing on its own feet as a staple of modern action cinema. 9/10"

","The original 'John Wick' was such a giant success that it was always going to get a sequel, whether it was pre-planned or not. In fact before 'John Wick: Chapter 2' was even made this was planned to be a trilogy with each movie following on almost immediately from the previous one. So what makes the 'John Wick' movies so great? For me, it's that they've found a very unique and effective style. In a world of very little originality, it's actually very hard to pinpoint a film that is like 'John Wick'. So many actions films today are just trying to be imitations of other successful franchises. 'John Wick' feels like it is very much going in its own direction. I like that fact a lot.<br/><br/>'John Wick: Chapter 2' is one hell of an action packed film. It's almost overwhelming at times. In fact it nearly gets to the point where it is a downfall of the movie. You can only shoot so many people before it becomes a little tedious to watch. The action sequences are at their best when they are being creative. There is a lot of that, but it can get a little lost amongst all the constant chaos and killing.<br/><br/>The story is very simple when you stop and think about it, however that's probably a strength of the film in a way. It's impossible to get confused because there really is nothing to be confused about. All that leaves is for the audience to sit back and have a good time. And a good time they will have with this film I suspect. As far as straight up action films go, this is about as good as they come today."

","Picking up shortly after the events of the first movie, we see John retrieving his beloved car from Russian mob boss Peter Stormare in an opening sequence that gives James Bond a run for his money. Using nothing but his car and his Kung-Fu, he beats through a countless barrage of thugs. He uses his gun once on a big guy (Raiders of the Lost Ark style!) John seeks to stay retired now he's found his car but he's then forced to take a job by sleazy Italian gangster Santino, which involves him going to Italy. Once Wick suits up and gets he's arsenal of weapons he checks into the Rome branch of The Continental, run by original Django actor Franco Nero.<br/><br/>While in Rome, he bumps into old acquaintances, some of them friendly some.. not so friendly.

All of their scenes together are fun; one amusing scene where they take silenced shots at each other in a crowded train station gets a good laugh, and that's just one of many confrontations between the two.<br/><br/>The bass has been raised literally since the last film in one sequence that includes a Techno-Rave where John butchers countless henchmen. This is easily the best sequence that tops the nightclub scene from the last film. Like the last film he also takes some nasty hits throughout, he gets stabbed, shot, body slammed the lot! It makes you wonder if he will survive to the end. But just as you think he'll throw in the towel, he pulls off more inventive kill streaks each one more deadlier than the last.<br/><br/>Overall it balances it's comedic elements and dark elements very well. However it does get a little goofy at times, one scene involving a Sumo Wrestler is hit and miss and another scene including Lawrence Fishbourne and his crew feels completely unnecessary. Nitpicking aside, if you enjoyed the first film, then chances are you will enjoy Chapter 2 a lot more as it's more of the same but with a bigger budget and more action set pieces. Its very well directed in terms of action and never short on thrills. Keanu is on top form and you can easily see his commitment to the role. From his Matrix days and the last Wick movie. He certainly knows Kung-Fu or in this case Gun-Fu/Car-Fu. He won't be in an Expendables film any time soon as I sense he will be busy making more original action movies and of course more exciting John Wick chapters."

","Chapter 2 is a perfect sequel. The story line builds on the first one and the action is taken to an even higher level. John Wick is an absolute legend. The director has done an amazing job. I loved the first John Wick but Chapter 2 is even better! John Wick series is so creative and original. I just love what the writers and directors have done with these two movies. I hope they continue to make more John Wick movies. Keanu Reeves might end up being more loved as John Wick than Neo when his career is over. He is just perfect for this role.

","There are a ton of ""positive"" reviews about this movie I thought I'd share with you some of the things about this movie that I feel could have been done better. Don't get me wrong here for I ABSOLUTELY loved the movie. It was awesome. 1. Ruby Rose character was dry and boring. She was apparently deaf or at least a mute in this movie for she never spoke a word. I felt her character failed at trying to be ""badass"", if you will. 2. For the most part, all of the hand-to-hand combat fight scenes were well executed. However, I felt there was a lack of realism in them. There was a definitely a feel of choreographed fight moves in many of the scenes. That choreographed look really left out a sense of realism to the fighting. 3. Keanu Reeves John Wick character is played well. However, to me he just seems a little to dry and unreal. Hard to explain, I guess. Like I wish he just acted more human and spoke more.<br/><br/>Aside from those mentioned above the movie was totally awesome. I'm ready to go see it again!"
"DarkVulcan29","9","11","22","13 February 2017"," Just when he thought he was out, they pull him back in.
","John Wick wants to live in peace, and leave the life of a hit-man behind him, but because he is such a legend in the business, and not many professional killers can top him, Wick finds himself pulled back in. I don't want to give anything away, but let me tell you'll get your moneys worth.<br/><br/>John Wick 2 does everything that a sequel should do, it ups the intensity from the first film, and puts Wicks situation into a non survival thing. Keanu Reeves really owns the role of John Wick, it clearly shows he loves the playing the role. And also Common and Ruby Rose are also good has other killers here. And not to mention an awesome cameo by Laurence Fishburne, yeah it's a matrix reunion here. Although the main villain does not really give off much here, unlike in the first film. But I'm really hoping for a third film, it ends with you wanting more."

","When I saw the first JOHN WICK film, I thought, ""I want take another trip into this Universe and unlock some more of it's secrets"".<br/><br/>I am pleased to report that JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2 opens up that world in a welcome way, building on the previous film whilst simultaneously refreshing the audience about what in the first film delighted us so much.<br/><br/>If you don't know what the charm of the JOHN WICK films are, let me help you - action, interesting settings, Action, good characters, Action, interesting plot developments and Action, ACTION, ACTION!<br/><br/>JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2 delivers on all these fronts.<br/><br/>Let's start with the interesting settings.  While the film brings you back into the secret assassins underworld (through the Commodore Hotel and the wonderfully mysterious and always interesting Lance Reddick as the Concierge), this film opens up the world to bring us into the Italian version of this place.  While the great Ian McShane is the proprietor of the NYC version of the Commodore, Director Chad Stahelski trots out good ol' Franco Nero as the proprietor of the Italian Commodore and the underworld lying beneath.  The audience also gets a hint that there are many of these ""hotels"" throughout the world and the assassins utilizing these services are bound by a code that is harsh to those that break it.<br/><br/>As far as interesting characters, any movie would be happy with the interesting characters that the aforementioned McShane, Nero and Reddick bring to the screen, but they are accompanied by John Leguizamo (repeating - albeit briefly - his auto repair maestro from the first film), Peter Stormare (as - what else - a mob boss), Giannia D'Antonio (as the leader of the Italian underground) and Lawrence Fishburne as ""the Bowery King"" (need I say more).<br/><br/>I haven't even mentioned the strong turns both Common and the up- and-coming Ruby Rose put forth as fellow assassins gunning (quite literally) for John Wick.<br/><br/>And, of course, there is good ol' Keanu Reeves as the titular character.  Stoic, silent, short on words and long on action.  This character fits him like a glove and Keanu flexes this glove over and over again in an enjoyable and winning performance that has the audience rooting for the underdog, anti-hero of this film.<br/><br/>But, make no mistake, the real star of this film is the many, many action scenes.  Starting with an assault on a NYC ""chop-shop"" to a fight in the catacombs under Italy to the extremely interesting final battle set in an Art Museum that is showing an exhibit on mirrors (it's as trippy as it sounds), the action comes at you quickly and decisively and so very satisfyingly.  There is so much of it, that there is a danger of becoming numb to it, but Director Stahelski (who also helmed the first JOHN WICK film) smartly pulls back in time to give the action time to settle in before revving it back up again.<br/><br/>This film, clearly, is the 2nd film of a trilogy.  The opening scene starts right after the previous film ends and the film finishes with an ending that is greatly open-ended pointing to what one can expect from JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 3.  It will be interesting to revisit this film once the ""trilogy"" concludes to see if the events in this film are enhanced (or forgotten).<br/><br/>Go for the action, stay for the stunts, the characters, the settings, the costumes.  It is a feast for the eyes and ears.  It is VERY violent, so not for everyone, but that's okay with me, I was expecting it and was greatly rewarded.<br/><br/>Letter Grade A-<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
"krds-54415","8","9","18","13 February 2017"," Amazing Movie
","An ardent fan of Keanu Reeves, I can only say that it is another amazing and a very watchable movie. It contains very few glitches and cliché. I wish I could give all stars!, alas! Here goes the habit. Chad Stahelski and all, not revealing the story line until my friends see this. Watch this in movie theatres for the action scenes to take full effect. Mesmerizing, villainous acts and dialogues, the new movie meets the expectations. To score well in a sequel takes quite courage, skill and experience and the director has shown them all. I would say the first movie was even better, but this one is also good.A must see for action fans, just as well shot and choreographed as the first one.The plot is equally intriguing and frustrating. We get to see more into the underground crime world that exists in this universe, but a lot of rules and character's actions are vague and hard to encrypt.Still if you want to see a lot of people shot, you'll be satisfied.The movie breaks new ground with its stunt team going bigger and better with its action sequences. The world expands well with the help of sleek shots and score. Moreover, it is a good story telling with a cliffhanger ending. If you the man/woman of action film this movie is for you. Just go to theatre and enjoy it- a rush of Adrenalin from start to finish."
"ReelLifeReviews","8","9","18","12 February 2017"," Great action and beautifully shot
","There are a couple crazy things about this movie, not the least of which is the fact that Keanu Reeves is FIFTY-TWO! Can I please look that good in a suit when I'm his age? The other thing on my mind is what my top three favorite elements ended up being: lighting, sound, and score. I definitely did not expect any of those to even be on my radar after seeing an action film sequel. Now, you can take that as a slight against the rest of the movie, but I certainly don't. Each scene is beautifully and creatively lit, no matter the location. The sound design is probably the best I've experienced in the genre. And the score is diverse and perfectly paired with the tone of each scene. <br/><br/>This follow up expands on the hierarchy and rules set up by the original, with some occasional retread. Laurence Fishburne shares the screen with Keanu once more, but wasn't utilized very well. In his introductory scene he ends up explaining a past encounter that is far more intriguing than anything we see him do. In addition, he's explaining that scenario to the very person that was present at the time, making for some heavy-handed exposition. While I'm not usually a fan of the practice, I think a flashback would have been the better route to go.<br/><br/>I'm not usually a fan of Common, but he did better than I expected. I'm still trying to figure out if he was supposed to have an accent, though. There was a deaf and/or mute character that brought something new to the table. It also added to the Rosetta Stone-like ability of John Wick to understand not just multiple spoken languages, but sign-language as well. <br/><br/>Overall it was a worthy sequel. It's always a tall order to surpass the original, but this one comes close."

If you're looking for story and depth then this isn't your movie. If you're looking for non stop action and where the body count is too high to keep count, then this is your movie. It was a lot of fun. The movie is gritty but it also knows how to keep things light. Reeves shows no signs of slowing down as he unleashes his arsenal of weaponry and hand to hand combat on anyone who gets in his way. It was also cool to see him and Fishburne share the screen together again. I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the genre.<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmsS_UV3TIE"
"harrytasker-78307","10","10","21","12 February 2017"," The Perfect Sequel
","John Wick Chapter 2 is the perfect sequel. In chapter 2 they do an amazing job of building on the first film. They go deeper into the mythology of the assassin world. John Wick is the most bad ass action character I have ever seen. The action choreography is so detailed and so mind blowing. It is incredible how the talented the director is at shooting all of these action scenes. They make your jaw drop every time. There are more hand to hand fighting scenes in chapter 2 than the first film which was awesome! The GUN-FU is just as great in chapter 2 as it was in the first film possibly even better. John Wick is killing every body just like in the first film but the best part of chapter 2 is that there is more of a story build up that helps explain the world he lives in and it is fascinating to see how the whole world works. I could go on and on about this film but I do not want to give to much away. Keanu Reeves is a real life black belt and he trains extensively with guns which is why he is able to almost all of his own stunts and his hard work definitely shows up in the film. Although chapter 2 is not as personal and emotional as the first film I believe it is just as good if not better because it still has the same style of action and humor as the first film while going into a more detailed story line. I believe the director Chad Stahelski has set a new standard for action films. He has became my new favorite director. He should inspire more stuntmen to become directors. I am a huge action movie fan and the first John Wick is one of my favorite movies of all time so I had very high expectations for the second film and I got exactly what I wanted to see. John Wick Chapter 2 is a 10 out of 10! I cant wait to see it again and eventually add it to my blu ray collection."

"christophercfox","10","6","11","10 April 2018"," Non-stop action and great set design
","This movie is based on a simple premise - John Wick is an unstoppable killer with a desire to escape his profession. The action is almost constant with short breaks that add flavor to this world. The killers are very polite and refined in their social actions outside of the actual killing. The rules show a desire to have a sophisticated approach to a very ugly environment. These rules end up trapping John in a Catch-22 that requires a lot of ammo to escape. I love the details in the sets - the Italian ceremony scene shows candles in glass grape holders, the catacombs are ancient with modern lighting and the museum makes an amazing set piece. For those people who see the movie as beyond belief - it is my secret hope that the John Wick world turns out to be a level in the Matrix that recast the main players in new roles - this would explain how John is impossible to kill."

The plot was simple, but it worked. But the style is what made the movie. It was the most comic-booky movie that year that wasn't even based on a comic book. It's the same case here. The plot isn't much, actually it was even better in the first one, but the style is what makes this movie stand out. I tend to be very forgiving on style over substance, but it's not like there's no substance at all. The story is in it's place (except for one surprise cameo of a certain actor I'm not gonna mention since it's a bit spoilerish, but it feels kinda shoehorned in) and it gives us more. It shows us more of this world in a more detailed way. Something every sequel should do. But again this movie isn't so praised for its substance. It's praised for its style. And it has every right to be. What you saw in the first one (especially the club scene from the first one) was just a taste of what you will see in this one.<br/><br/>This is a perfect example of what a great sequel should be. Upgrade upon the first one, go bigger and better, while not turning into a mess. Now I hope the third one is also as great as the first two and this will be one of my favorite trilogies ever."

It features some of the greatest, most intense fighting scenes I've ever seen, and I had an absolute blast. And yet, the reason why it's such a perfect action movie is because the story and the characters are compelling enough to keep the audience invested in what's happening, thus creating better tension and excitement during these exquisite action scenes. And even more, the movie builds upon the world that the original set up, making it just that much deeper and more interesting. <br/><br/>Overall John Wick: Chapter 2 is everything an action movie should be. This is a short review, I know, but there isn't much to talk about in all honesty. It's an action movie where the action really is the best part. It's not a deep, plot-driven drama, nor is it an intelligent science fiction story. It's an action movie, which tends to be judged on a scale all it's own. This was a complete blast at the movies, but it wasn't just dumb fun. It's a near perfect action movie, and I can't wait for Chapter 3. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie."

","Ever since I watched the first movie, I was totally hooked to the whole concept of an underground assassin world and a legendary assassin(John Wick) who manages to get out but eventually gets drawn back in.

The protagonist would get hurt plenty of times so it wasn't always the bad guys taking the hits.

John wick managed to wrap up his problems in the first one and now wants to say bye-bye to the assassin business for good. But his past, which happens even before the first movie, revisits him and he is again forced to come back. What follows is some serious ass-kicking. Car chases, gun fights, close quarter martial combat...you name it. The fight scenes have been given incredible attention to detail. Hats off to the director and stunt coordinators. Apart from the action, the overall charisma of the movie, especially the way John dresses up in lean black suits, the music and the sound, the actors and the dialogues are all a treat.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie entertained me like no other and has totally surpassed my expectations. It is a fitting sequel and I can't wait for the third chapter and I know for sure that the third would be better than the second.

"zardoz-13","9","6","11","18 February 2017"," ""Wick 2"" Is 2 Wicked!!!
","Hollywood makes out two types of sequels. First, those sequels that aren't as good as their forerunners. Second, those sequels that surpass their predecessors. Basically, sequels are either better or worse than what spawned them. ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" belongs to the second category. Stunt double Chad Stahelski and scenarist Derek Kolstad respectively return as director and writer for the bullet-riddled bloodbath ""John Wick 2,"" and Keanu Reeves reprises his role as the invincible, sharp-shooting assassin who doesn't aim to please. No, Wick's new pet pooch doesn't die in this installment. Moreover, no other animals are harmed. Anybody who saw the original ""John Wick"" knows the villains spoke in awe about John Wick's lethal use of pencils. Appropriately enough, Stahelski stages a pencil scene for the sequel, and you will have an entirely new respect for yellow number two pencils. We'll have to see if something like this doesn't ultimately winds up as merchandise to advertise the franchise. This unbreakable pencil preserves its point throughout a slam-bang combat encounter that would shatter a regular pencil. Audaciously preposterous, hopelessly predictable, but thoroughly captivating nonsense, ""John Wick 2"" pushes everything to the limit except the number of lines uttered by Keanu Reeves. Tired of gun shy, shoot'em ups that confine their mortality rates to single digits? ""John Wick 2"" boasts a triple-digit body count with an alarming number of head shots. Typically, our bruised and battered hero pumps two slugs into an adversary's torso and then polishes them off with one in the noggin. When he exhausts his ammo, he resorts to battlefield salvage and appropriates another man's weapon so he can keep on killing. Meaning, if you require discretion in the depiction of violence, you may have complaints about this exciting, atmospheric, and elegantly lensed action thriller with lots of colorfully illuminated settings. Incidentally, ""John Wick 2"" reunites Reeves and ""Matrix"" co-star Laurence Fishburne for a couple of scenes. Were it little more than the original, ""John Wick 2"" wouldn't be as memorable, but it is something more with some imaginative tweaks that its predecessor lacked.<br/><br/>""John Wick: Chapter 2"" picks up where the previous epic ended. Since Wick has acquired a new dog, he searches now for the car that his enemies stole, and the film opens with an over-the-top, car-smashing, body-crashing encounter in a rival mobster's garage with our hero relying on wits, fists, and martial arts. Like a respectable sequel, ""John Wick 2"" reminds us what was at stake in the first film as well as the character of our hero. A relative of the mobsters who shot Wick's puppy dog and then beat him senseless, Abram (Peter Stormare of ""22 Jump Street"") is preparing to clear out since he fears Wick is coming after him next. While Wick dispatches Abram's army of thugs and mechanics, Abram's eyes bulge with abject terror, and Stormare gives a great performance by his reactions to the arrival of his adversary. When they finally meet after our hero has cleared a gauntlet of killers, Wick pours Abram a drink and proposes peace with a toast. The two gulp their liquor and forge an armistice. Abram bids Wick a happy retirement. Naturally, however, nothing of the sort is going to happen either for Wick or the audience. In a bit of backstory, we learn that John Wick indebted himself to a treacherous, high-ranking mobster, Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio of ""Loose Cannons""), with a blood oath marker so he could retire and live peacefully with his wife Helen. Now, after wrapping up his revenge, Wick discovers to his chagrin that Santino is calling in that marker! Although Wick is in no position to refuse an assignment from Santino, he refuses to accommodate Santino because he is weary of all the shooting and killing. A disappointed Santino leaves Wick's house and then shoulders an awesome incendiary weapon and fire-bombs our hero's house, blasting Wick off the premises but not killing his dog. Resigned to his fate, Wick sits down with Santino and agrees to carry out one final mission. The evil Santino wants the seat on an international crime council that his late father willed to his older sister, Gianna D'Antonio (Claudia Gerini of ""Deceit""), and he stipulates that our hero must ice her. Off to Rome flies Wick where he acquires an arsenal that James Bond would envy, a dark tailor-made, bullet-proof suit, and the blueprints to infiltrate Gianna's inner sanctum and surprise her. What Wick doesn't plan for adequately is Gianna's steadfast bodyguard Cassian (Common of ""American Gangster""), and these two titans tangle in a blood and guts tango that ends abruptly after they crash into the sacred Continental Hotel in Rome, run by Julius (Franco Nero of ""Django""), where mobsters must cease and desist because it represents the equivalent of a gangland church that grants amnesty. At this point, Wick realizes that the scheming Santino has double-crossed him. Santino points out he wouldn't be much of a brother if he didn't avenge the murder of his sister. When his own gunmen cannot liquidate Wick, Santino offers a $7-million-dollar bounty, and hit men from every corner of the globe swarm after our resilient hero.<br/><br/>Aside from Keanu Reeves' typically stoic performance, ""John Wick: Chapter Two"" features a sturdy cast, with Ian McShane reprising his role as Winston, the manager of the New York City Continental Hotel--where mobsters are prohibited from fighting with their adversaries, and Lance Reddick as the accommodating desk clerk Charon. John Leguizamo appears briefly as the body shop repairman who helped Wick locate his Mustang, and Bridget Moynahan appears in a flashback as Wick's late wife Helen. Director Chad Stahelski, who once earned his living as Keanu Reeve's stunt double, need never look back. Slated to helm the new ""Highlander"" reboot, Stahelski keeps things thumping throughout this two-hour plus neo-noir thriller. The hall of mirrors scene where Wick stalks Santino rivals the original scene in Orson Welles' iconic thriller ""The Lady from Shanghai"" (1947)."

Many of which were promisingly good, some were quite bad and others in-between were mediocre to say the least. But out of all these characters he's been in none that have fit him more like a glove than the title character in 2014s John Wick, the hirsute assassin who was enjoying life in retirement with his new puppy, until he had to get revenge etc. The film spawned a whole new genre of action: the geriaction thriller (cheekily, Reeves was just about to turn 50 at the time he couldn't be considered as a geriatric) because at the time there were a few other films with older protagonists sharing the multiplex, such as Denzel Washington in The Equalizer, Kevin Costner in 3 Days to Kill and the granddaddy of them all Liam Neeson in Taken 3. <br/><br/>Even though he was a lot older than he was in the first Matrix he did a bloody (emphasis high on bloody) good job at ass-kicking, or sharp shooting criminals out of his home. He ended up killing a lot of people, there was a lot of action to enjoy. At this point you may be asking yourself what's on offer the second time-round? From the start of John Wick: Chapter 2 there is a lot to take in we are immediately transferred into a car chase it's indeed the main improvement over its predecessor which didn't have much of a story, there was just a lot of action a huge body count and a lot of blood a simple dog revenge thriller. For a while through this it riffs the same thing, there is a lot of action, a lot of blood and a huge body count – there are, however, two differences, an entirely new plot which riffs on an entirely new revenge story this time it's Wick's life on the line after he entered in a wager with a ruthless killer (Riccardo Scamarcio) and the dog (a Staffie with no name). <br/><br/>The title Chapter 2, also indicates there will be a larger series to behold here seemingly perhaps he may come back for the third movie (if it happens) we'll see. Director Chad Stahelski's material here is - in one word spectacular there is plenty here to enjoy, it's one of those movies that if it's done well then you'll enjoy it, now on the second-time-round the message is certainly correct. The action throughout is cool, the car chases are ruthlessly fun, and finally it's completely on edge from start to finish and with Reeves on top form what's not to like for this second time? Kicking off just a few hours after the ending of John Wick our protagonist (Reeves) is bruised, bloodied and quite frankly fatigued after fighting for hours on end. <br/><br/>He's tied in with another plot for revenge with a killer and his duo of assassins (Common, Ruby Rose); he receives info from his trusted hotel manager (McShane) that he is under attack. He must end a wager, to do this he has to fight for his life in a bullet ballet rampage; he must kill someone to somewhat end it, Wick here uses his skills and his wits through this barrage of bullets in the catacombs. Here there is an entertaining montage when he gears up for – perhaps his biggest battle, containing a brilliant cameo from Peter Serafinowicz who helps gear up Wick with an arsenal of weapons, along with his bullet-proof suit. There is also a knife fight on train slightly hinting at The Raid 2. Perhaps this is the message Stahelski is sending to us that he can make a bloody action thriller with a lot of enjoyable moments. <br/><br/>Wick then joins forces with the homeless network run by Laurence Fishburne's Bowery King, though instead of showing down to a Matrix-fu brawl, Bowery gives him a favour for saving his life many years before there is even a chance to his maniacal laugh, and for him to prove he's smarter again by riffing famous lines. This is when the film becomes slightly rubbery it loses its footing slightly, as it drags out a bit more. But when the action unfolds again it's immediately back to its home.<br/><br/>Stahelski's style isn't limited or indeed of short-supply because there is plenty here to enjoy it's completely ruthless from the opening moments to the stunning Hall of Mirrors set-piece there is a lot of action for any action movie buff to enjoy. Reeves may not be the greatest actor of our generation, nor, indeed is he the worst but he hits every mark with clarity throughout he's brilliant when it comes to the action. Despite the elasticised third act, as the story takes a while to step in. John Wick: Chapter 2 is slightly better than its predecessor it's an adrenaline-fuelled, action-packed ride with a lot of bodies, blood, plenty of material and is downright good fun from start to finish, it's an absolute blast. <br/><br/>VERDICT: A bruisingly, brilliant action-packed bullet ballet of a sequel. This is an absolute bloody blast and with Reeves on top form, what's not to love?"
"peefyn","7","8","16","21 February 2017"," Good action in an increasingly absurd setting
","Just as the previous movie in what appears to becoming a franchise, this movie delivers solid action sequences that are a blast to watch, and probably just as much fun to make. The action in this film makes it feel like a video game come to life, and in a good way. I'm sure people will look to this the next time they try to make a movie like Max Payne.<br/><br/>Like the previous film, this is not much beyond an action film - but it does seem like they're intent on establishing a quite unique world. Just how far they are willing to go with it, time will tell, but right now it seems like half the population of this world is involved in an assassin underground, while the other half is utterly clueless. The fact that Laurence Fishborne and Keanu Reeves appear together is no the only parallel to the Matrix.<br/><br/>It's also a movie that doesn't shy away from having a little fun instead of keeping to any sort of realism. And because the world the movie is set in is kind of silly, it works well enough. I think it went a bit too far when the characters seemed willing to shoot passersby (like in the fountain scene), but mostly they try to keep them within the strange moral universe they have established."

","'JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Sequel to the 2014 action hit 'JOHN WICK', starring Keanu Reeves (once again) as the title character. The story revolves around Wick, a retired hit-man, who's once again forced to go back into his former world of violence, when a bounty is placed on his head. The movie is also once again directed by Chad Stahelski, and it's once again written by Derek Kolstad as well. Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, Lance Reddick and Bridget Moynahan (briefly) also all reprise their roles from the first film; while Riccardo Scamarcio, Ruby Rose, Common and Laurence Fishburne (Reeves' former 'MATRIX' trilogy costar) also play supporting roles in this sequel. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and fans alike, and it's also a hit at the Box Office too. I also really enjoyed it (just like I did the first film).<br/><br/>The movie begins right where the first one left off, with John Wick (Reeves) tracking down his stolen car, at a chop shop, and getting revenge on those that stole it. He's then approached, at his home, by a crime lord named Santino D'Antonio (Scamarcio). The crime boss wants him to assassinate his sister (Claudia Gerini), so he can take her place at a council for crime lords. Wick initially rejects the assignment, but he soon learns that the bloody crime world, which he so desperately wants to leave, won't let him retire.<br/><br/>The film is once again nonstop action, and very bloody (and excessively violent) action as well. If you're a fan of the first movie, I'm sure you'll love it; especially if you're a fan of Keanu Reeves. I'm a big fan of Reeves as a person, and I like him as an actor, in certain roles too; but he sucks in a lot of roles as well. John Wick is definitely one of his best parts. The character is becoming a classic badass action hero, and the series is now becoming a classic action movie franchise. I can't wait to see what the third movie brings!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc"

I love telling people that story because I actually asked him to give me some life advice and he simply said ""Follow your dreams"" and got into his Porche and drove off into the night! HA! Well, this movie is freaking amazing! John Wick was great! but Chapter 2 is awesome! I love this movie for its action and locations! Keanu Reeves rocks as John Wick!

"stevorino0","9","8","16","16 February 2017"," Methodical gun-play, dystopian assassin society, bold colors...Great flick
","To kill so many people, if you think about it, is a logistics nightmare. The amount of guns and ammo needed, the skills and timing required, the machine-like efficiency, the sheer luck...<br/><br/>John Wick 2 lets us relish in these finer points of killing. Wick picks apart his enemies with such an optimized precision, that you cannot help but applaud the mastery of his ""work."" There are shades of ""Equilibrium"" here, and gun kata, with the optimization of gun fighting being taken to a whole new level, almost as an art. Every move made must be one to put his enemies in position to be shot, preferably in the head. The close quarters combat scenes avoid the standard Hollywood gimmicks such as guns being conveniently kicked out of hands, or fights devolving into two men taking turns punching each other. Wick uses a variety of Judo grappling techniques, and Jiu-Jitsu ground work, to create brief separation from his enemy -- just enough to shoot them in the head. And boy is he good at that...<br/><br/>The plot is vaguely about Wick trying to start a new life, but itself is not as interesting as the surreal world that Wick lives in. This is a dystopian society where the tendrils of a high-powered underground community reach into the far sectors of every day life. Janitors, musicians, clerks, even hobos...Just about anyone could be on-call with the secret society. There is a growing implied influence of this Illumanti-esque group which is a pleasure to discover. And at the grand hotel, where the players and assassins spend their nights, there is an odd calm and serenity. <br/><br/>Wick's very name strikes morbid fear in everyone who hears it. One of the movie's treats is seeing the reactions of people as they realize they have John Wick coming after them. It's a gift that keeps on giving. It is simply understood, in this world, that John Wick is a death sentence...""Death's very emissary"" one sad soul points out (correctly). <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, mainly for the detailed and clinical killing scenes, and for the atmosphere of a fleshed out assassin universe. Wick 2 has a flare of style throughout as well, back dropping operatic violence with eerie music and bold colors. Many striking set- pieces, which by themselves could be contrived, but together pull the whole movie in the art-house direction (a la Drive), which I welcomed gladly."
"elale-573-971300","9","8","16","15 February 2017"," a feature length fight scene occasionally interrupted by brief dialogue and pigeons
","Lots of great fighting. Not much else. Except there is a dog in it. See it if you want to watch a feature length fight scene occasionally interrupted by brief dialogue and pigeons. <br/><br/>So, kind of like Matrix 2. Except with pigeons instead of a sex scene. There's even a bit of reflection on the nature of reality. Sort of. Or else it's a comment on how modern art is a funhouse mirror to real art. And makes a nice sparkly tinkly sound when you shoot it.<br/><br/>Also, we get to see the pencil thing. There's really quite a lot of good fighting, with guns, with fists, with knives, and yes, even with a pencil. And did I mention there is great fighting? <br/><br/>The plot is very basic and straightforward, but since it's easy to follow and does what it needs to do to move the fighting-- er, I mean to move the story forwards-- that's fine for this kind of movie. <br/><br/>It's an almost perfect example of its genre. I took a point off for AGAIN mispronouncing Baba Yaga. Filmmakers, you have had 3 years to think about it, are you sure you don't want to go with saying it how it's spelled? How it's spelled in Cyrillic letters, I mean. You know written Russian is phonetic, right? One letter, one sound, one kill. Er, that is-- anyway kudos for being OK with having a totally badass male character go by a nickname that means granny witch."
"kaanb-56699","10","8","16","13 February 2017"," Great Movie
","This movie was probably one of the best action movies of all time. I was surprised to see that this movie was better than the first which doesn't happen very often. It contained good comedy and amazing shots (both camera and John Wick's accuracy) that most action movies in the past five years haven't really done. The story this time was captivating and brought a lot of tension throughout. I watched it with almost a full seating capacity at the movies and it bad the movie ten times better. Also, the cameo from Laurence Fishburne worked perfectly as he brought comedy and a little pressure on John Wick. I recommend going with friends to make the movie better, but going by yourself would not change a thing of how great the movie is. I would purchase the trilogy in the future and watch it again in the theater."
"deltajvliet","8","8","16","10 February 2017"," The Matrix Reloaded to The Matrix
","Very very good, maybe great, but not quite the original. The first was so fresh, and good as this one is the relentless auto-aim headshots get to be fatiguing and monotonous. It's a small complaint but seems to be a common reaction.<br/><br/>Stahelski elaborates more on the world created by the first, but some of the universe building comes off as gratuitous or even, oddly enough, mundane. A good example - when we're first introduced to the coins in the last movie, their implications are fascinating. There's a whole currency for this underground world of assassins? How much are they worth? How do you get them? In Chapter 2, there's a brief scene where John approaches Winston as he's inspecting new coins from a man who presumably mints them. Winston says, ""Exquisite work, put them into circulation."" It's a fun nod, but there's something about it that takes away from the world's mythos and turns it into boring matter-of-fact hit-man logistics.<br/><br/>The first movie's action mostly took place at night, and the same is true here. But while that was surprisingly clean and crisp visually, I found this entry to have more motion blur. Looking it up, both movies use the Arri Alexa, and I've noticed digital cinematography seems more prone to that problem, but it was just a minor disappointment, minor being the operative word. It's still miles ahead of the 10-cuts-a-second shaky cam epidemic plaguing modern action cinema.<br/><br/>Last small complaint. While John Wick suffers from the John McClane ""real but still invincible"" action hero dilemma, he's also a superhuman weapons handling expert to a fault. For example, every time Wick reloads and racks his gun, he does a secondary press check to ensure there's a bullet in the chamber. In the middle of a heated and fast paced shootout, this step seems excessive, time consuming, and unnecessary. It looks cool, I guess, but it didn't need to be done every time. A small case of tactical trumping practical.<br/><br/>I'm nitpicking. I know that, and the movie was very good. Sometimes it's just easier to list a few things wrong than everything right, and there is a lot right here. It's not the masterpiece the original was, and ends on a maddeningly inconclusive cliffhanger, but it absolutely beats out 98% of action movies from the last decade.<br/><br/>John Wick - 9.5/10 John Wick: Chapter 2 - 8/10"
"aji4u4ever","8","8","16","9 February 2017"," Blood, Blood And More Blood
","I was planned to watch the FDFS from the day they announced the sequel coz i was totally addicted to the Introduction movie of John Wick. I went to the movie with sky high expectations. This time the story revolves around John Wick, who wanted to clear his debt from the past ending that to become a fugitive in the underworld. He had to survive at any cost where the whole assassins are looking for him to claim the bounty.<br/><br/>The movie is bloody, gore, violent and absolute treat for the action loving cinema-goers. The story was pretty good, filled with adrenaline pumped action sequences but most of the moves are repeating and was tiring for me. But couple of action scenes were top notch and you can see the brilliance of action choreo turned director Chad Stahelski. The background score added the toppings. The dialogues were good. The camera-work was exceptional and convincing. The VFX did a good part in the action scenes especially with the car chase and action in the beginning. But movie has got the lag in between which will ruin your appetite. Some of the action scenes were illogical, making the hero as immortal and fatigue free.. Keanu Reeves was totally amazing in the movie with his ice cold mannerisms, dialogue delivery and of course, action. Lawrence Fishburne did a cameo and am expecting him in a full role for the next installment. Rest of the crew including the cast from the First installment were there and did a good job.<br/><br/>From my point of view, this didn't meet my expectations and falls just behind the first installment. For Me, JW 1 is better than this.<br/><br/>I would go out with 7.2 on 10"
"kaysersoze-04910","1","11","24","8 April 2017"," Worst movie I've ever seen
","No plot whatsoever, no script, the dialogue was just awful most of the time, Keanu Reeves just cant act at all. The whole ""movie"" its just him doing a killing spree from Rome to New York, how can you call it a thriller when Reeves just keep head-shot his opponents? OH he got hit by a car full speed on? Doesn't matter give him 2 seconds and he'll already kill the driver. No connection to the characters, they're just there, come and go with no reason at all. Total waste of 2 hours, really wanted it to end."
"pointman73111","3","16","38","15 February 2017"," Huge let down
","This John Wick sequel had more in common with The Matrix than the first film. Wick is supposed to be this amazing badass that is known worldwide for his tenacity and skill, but is very sloppy in execution. Some of the fight scenes are over choreographed and too long, remember The Matrix movies? It was interesting to see how the cast was widely multi ethnic and international. The ridiculously vast network of hit men was nothing more than ridiculous. Really? A whole network of hit men staged as homeless? At least I enjoyed the movie from the beginning to the middle. The garage scene was fairly entertaining.<br/><br/>There is a major issue with the organization structure of the storyline in how D'Antonio puts out a contract on his sister, one that holds a chair on this committee, and then puts out a contract on Wick. How would any organization let this happen? The false honor among these clowns is laughable.<br/><br/>The deaf hit woman was enough of a reach, because all these movies just HAVE to cast some ""badass chick"", like it's a real thing. The level of douchebags with short hair and big beards was annoying.<br/><br/>Don't waste time spending money on this one."

","TLDR: save your time and watch the first John Wick again. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first John Wick. It was modern, slick, and had a great pace. But not so Chapter 2: after half an hour I felt bored. The movie has no climax just more faceless enemies. The story is overly constructed, the action scenes repetitive and boring. You are forced to see the same defense moves and head shots on lookalike enemies over and over again. In the end the movie has a higher body count than a loud PayDay 2 mission(video game) which says it all. More enemies != more entertainment. Also the movie features almost no civilians. Everyone is literally a gangster, assassin, or mercenary. But not all is bad: the movie has a nice side-cast, some rare but good jokes, and the 1-on-1 fighting with the Italian ward is very enjoyable. But that's not enough to save this movie. <br/><br/>So save your money and enjoy the first one again instead."

"Xiialphaiiixx","4","14","33","11 February 2017"," Too much with Too Little
","I had been pretty excited to see John Wick 2. The first movie was incredibly refreshing. It was a nitty gritty, original story. It explained only what the story needed to make sense. While we do not know much of Mr. Wicks past, The story line of ""John Wick"" was linear. It gave a reason why and gave resolutions to the events while maintaining a good and elegant ambiguity. I felt as if I didn't need to know more in order to understand who Mr. Wick was yet I felt like I knew the universal Why.<br/><br/>Now, we come to John Wick 2. The movie starts out with a bang. It was full force. It had a little bit of extra closure, which is always a good thing. It helped instill the image of how dangerous and brutal Mr. Wick really is. A man of conviction. Excellent.<br/><br/>After this the new story begins. It was explained but there was no Definitive reason. Simply, When Mr. Wick got out someone helped him. Now he must repay that debt, once it is paid off, he is free. While this is a reason, I felt as if it wasn't concrete. To add to the reason of the movie, his house is blown up after he refuses to complete the blood debt. Fueling Mr. Wick to complete the debt knowing full well that Mr. Wick will certainly deal with the extortion at some point during the film but the reason was much weaker this time around. They almost condemned themselves by creating such a moving and powerful catalyst in ""John Wick."" I am not saying I wanted to see another dog die but this story line for lack of a better phrase was ""meh"". Then the new story takes off, yet I felt as if the flow of the movie was very rough, I almost felt bored at certain times. Then during the action scenes, I felt as if it was a bit over the top, exaggerated. During the first movie, things were kept in the realm of possibility. Keanu Reeves made me believe he was able to do the things that he did partly because he did. The training and effort he put into this role was outstanding and was truly inspiring. ""John Wick"" was great because he wasn't invincible, in fact they made it very clear he was vulnerable yet he was a determined man fighting with great motivation. I felt as if they went away from that during ""John Wick 2."" There were to many bad guys, in unrealistic settings. I believe it could be possible for a trained hit man to defend his home from 12 men. But I find it much harder to believe anyone could go into a museum and kill that many men. Or even survive a dark tunnel system against that many men virtually unharmed. At one point, I felt as if half the people in New York city were hit men or worked for this secret empire.<br/><br/>There were a concession of fight scenes in broad public even on a subway cart with people just sitting in the back. No reaction from them, no one trying to really flee ( even though the doors say do not enter, they do open up, people do it all time.) Some of which were flat out ruined by the Previews. I did not need or want to see the pencil in the preview.<br/><br/>I could on, and pick the movie apart, But I will not. Most of the movie felt unbalanced, at times, even weird as if they were trying to add an unneeded deep substance to it and failed. (the scene with Gianna D'Antonio. I felt like it was shot for the Blu-ray Cover, it felt phony almost.) As if they were forcefully trying to slow things down then come roaring in with over the top action scenes. It did not have the same flow as ""John Wick."" Nor did it have the same elegance to it. It maintain the same ambiguity that I loved in the first movie but for some reason I felt as if kept asking why. I feel as if the title of the film had been something like ""John Wick, The Continental Demise Part 1."" I would have been more open to the lack of absolution in this film. While the odd linear story line of this film had actually been completed, this was not a movie in its self. It was a only part of a bigger story, not a stand alone movie yet was named and filmed as if it was trying to be. I was disappointed by this film. While the acting for the most part was superb expect for Mr. Wick and Sommelier. They tried to force the same relationship that Mr. Wick had with Charon. For some reason I felt as if Charon and Mr. Wick had a deeper respect for one another then most of the other characters. They had a bond. They tried to force that same feel, the same bond it seemed."

","John Wick 2 isn't an bad ass action movie like you are all saying, trying to explain the lack of anything in it but shooting. Here's what happened ... writer is on the internet pressed with a deadline to create an action movie script. He is watching stupid YouTube videos and comes upon some kids playing some action video game. There are a lot of those videos on YouTube, where kids record themselves playing some shooting game and for some stupid reason a lot of other kids watch that. So the writer probably thought, well fu**, if those YouTube channels with recorded shooting games are so popular, why not just make a movie that is basically a shooting game scenario. And so he did. I mean come on, one guy kills like a 100 people (somebody actually needs to do a body count, because I think Arnolds Commando could be taken from the throne - and that movie was made fun of because of such a body count freakin 30 years ago ... and 30 years later we are giving this an 8 on IMDb ... wtf ??? ). I mean of course the good guy is going to kill a bunch of bad guys in an action movie... but this is just ridiculous. And the whole world is having problems with morons from some 4th world country that are blowing themselves up among innocent people .... just send freakin john wick and problem solved in 1 day.

","I just don't get reviews anymore. I used to agree with many and my taste was kind of in the mainstream. Movies like this though that have an 8 rating and really, are pretty terrible in every way, I just don't get.<br/><br/>The action is okay if you are into impossible fight scenes where the hero seems more like terminator than human. The ridiculous ways in which the hero survives each attack are way over the top. To add insult to injury each scene is dragged the f out until it seems like forever, including the scenes where he should just walk in and pop someone. Nooooooooo. He holds an 8 minute dialogue with them. How is that good, especially when it is Keanu and some other no talent actor or actress on screen with bad lines thrown in to boot? It's frickin torture. The acting is excruciatingly horrific. Not one of the actors made it seem real. The lines are just laughable but not in a good way. The only thing positive is the dog. <br/><br/>The movie honestly felt like it had been written by a ten year old or as if someone came through and dumbed it down, way down for its target audience (which judging from most of the reviews, it seems to have reached). Picture this (and no, it doesn't count as a spoiler because I'm paraphrasing): you have guy 1 talking to Wick and asking: ""You're going after Santino Gregorio Mariano D'Antonio?"" *overly shocked face*. Santino D'Antonio? Really? His sister by the way is G'ianna D'Antonio. Ridiculous names which someone thought would sound badass and cool. I bring it up, because that's the entire premise of the movie. A bunch of scenes taken from your favorite movies in the past, tweaked a little and thrown back in, in a comicy, hokey fashion. The only person who acted a little more naturally and seemed to deliver their lines (or maybe just had better lines) with some reality was Laurence Fishburne. He just seemed to be having fun with the whole thing as in WTH am I doing and aw, just go with it. <br/><br/>Again, the only thing that was worth seeing was the dog, oh, and Lance Reddick's toned down performance. Always perfection. Other than that, I really don't get what all the hubbub is about because it was just plain dumb.<br/><br/>John Wick 1 was immensely better."

Chapter 2, or how to ruin a self-standing movie with an irrelevant sequel that requires a third chapter to tie loose ends (sort of what happened with The Matrix).<br/><br/>In this chapter, John is once more forced out of ""retirement"" to fulfill his debt of honor with Italian mobster D'Antonio. But Italians being notoriously double-crossing cowards, Wick ends up in deep s**t.<br/><br/>However, Wick is now the superhuman anti-hero.

Not only that, but he manages to kill enemies by the hundreds, while none of his adversaries seems able to aim or to just get a gun instead of engaging in body contact. Whatever little ""realism' was in chapter 1, it's completely gone here.<br/><br/>We also discover that the ""underworld"" is run as if we were in the 50s, apart from excessive tattooing, and that there is honor among some thieves - and if you believe that, you'll believe anything. <br/><br/>But the capital sin of chapter 2 is that despite ultra violence, silly premises, car chasing and fights, it is boring as a video game, rather than cool as a superhero cartoon. After each fight, Wick gets a few moments to recharge an then starts again. I would give it one point for the photography and one because I like Keanu Reeves, but I shall deduct one point, because all the assassins wearing black is really TOO cliché....<br/><br/>PS the opening scene is a total rip off of Bond movies: action sequence almost unrelated to the rest of the plot; the taylor scene is a rip off of Kingsmen; Wick himself is a rip off of Neo, minus leather coat and sunglasses, but still mainly dressed in black."

To that end, the Ares character played by Ruby Rose was too shallow and was poorly acted. They could have cut her out entirely. There were one or two other weak elements that I wished they'd have worked harder on.<br/><br/>That said, the first two-thirds of the flick was decent and lived up to the original.

"Jared_Andrews","4","11","25","16 July 2017"," A complete lack of effort from Keanu and everyone involved
","I'd love to feed you one of those tired clichés along the lines of, ""if you liked John Wick, you'll love John Wick 2!"" or ""even better than the first!"" But those would be dirty, rotten lies.<br/><br/>The truth is that John Wick 2 falls far short of the first, which I consider a fun, albeit mostly mindless, action romp. I can sum up John Wick 1 in 11 words: A retired hit-man unleashes vengeance on those who killed his dog. It's simple, which is fine. Its quality doesn't come from its premise; it comes from cool sequences of Keanu Reeves shooting and kicking and punching people.<br/><br/>John Wick 2 makes zero effort to create anything unique from the original. The story is the exact same except this time John Wick is seeking vengeance on someone who blew up his house. I think. There seemed to be some other motivation for John Wick, which involved a guy asking him to kill someone, John Wick refusing, the guy blowing up his house with a bazooka, then John Wick trying to kill that guy and also kill a lot of other guys.<br/><br/>It didn't make any sense to me that John Wick refused to kill one single person, but willingly killed dozens of others a short time later. However, it did make sense me that John Wick wanted to kill someone who just blew up his house with a bazooka because if a guy blew up my house with a bazooka, I would probably want to kill him too. So, I chose to accept that as his motivation.<br/><br/>You might be thinking, ""well what made you dislike John Wick 2 so much if you liked John Wick 1? They sound eerily similar."" Rest easy, voice that asks me questions in the form of a convenient segue. I'm about to cover that.<br/><br/>I put a huge heaping pile of blame on Keanu for this one. His lifelessness exceeded even his own personal record for lifelessness in this performance. His lifelessness baffled scientists by reaching levels of lifelessness previously believed to be only reachable by those who are actually without life.<br/><br/>Keanu delivered each line with the enthusiasm of moody teenager talking to his parents about math class. Not only did he seem disinterested in what he said, he also sounded a little angry and confused every time he spoke. I'm not sure if that was an ill-conceived character choice or just terrible acting. Either way, his speaking moments made me cringe.<br/><br/>Since I'm piling on, I'll mention Keanu's walk. I'm not sure if that's how he thinks a badass walks, or if he thinks that's how a beat up person walks, or if that's just Keanu's normal walking style, but I found it distracting. No one walks like that. Except for possibly Keanu if that is indeed his normal walking style. The incompetent aspects of the movie that I wouldn't blame on Keanu all come down to the ineptitude of his enemies. I'm not a hit-man, nor a gun expert, nor have I received anything resembling training in combat. I haven't even played Halo or Call of Duty. But even I know about the thing where you lean close to the wall then peak around the corner before sprinting out in the open. John Wick probably amassed 15 easy kills simply due to his enemies never once checking corners properly.<br/><br/>If John Wick's enemies' only shortcomings were their corner checking failures, they may have been palatable. Unfortunately, they also had the worst aim in the history of terrible aim bad guys in movies. John Wick must have landed 30 headshots, yet the other guys landed zero. They also committed unconscionably stupid errors, such as attempting to kill John Wick with their fists rather than shooting him. They also hit him with their car then stepped out of the car to fight him rather than hitting him with their car again. By the way, John Wick shot all those guys.<br/><br/>The one part of the movie that I enjoyed came when John Wick shot guys in that cool mirrored set of rooms. Kudos to whoever designed that place and whoever staged the scenes in there. The mesmerizing optics in that sequence made me forget all my other gripes with the movie for a while.<br/><br/>I will hold out hope that John Wick 3 manages to instill that level of creativity and visual brilliance with greater frequency. If not, I'll be right back here, writing another scathing review for an action movie beloved by many."

","A woeful reprise of Reeves' role in The Matrix but without the long black robes and 'somersaulting' from scene to scene. The long black robes are replaced with cheap knock-off Italian suits, phony accents and to-ing and fro-ing between ill-thought out continuity scenes. The stereotypical film noir stereotypes still exist in the film's depiction of a weirdly familiar parallel universe of a lawless society completely devoid of awareness from passers-by and law enforcement officers. The wanton depiction of destruction of numerous automobiles is indicative of a society that values free movement but without the moral imperative to pay for it while the horrible depiction of middle-aged women choosing death at their own hand is a savage indictment of Hollywood at its nadir."

"lavatch","Null","5","9","18 June 2017"," Vapid Characters & Way Too Much Violence
","""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is closer to a video game or a pinball machine than a feature film. Lasting in excess of two hours, the violence is nonstop, and the character development is non-existent.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves plays the role of John Wick, who, apparently, can speak Russian, Italian, ESL, and, to a lesser degree, the English language. His character is a robotic killer, who has a change of heart and wants to get out of the game. But Santino D'Antonio calls in his marker, torches Wick's house, and forces him to assassinate Santino's sister.<br/><br/>The action moves from New York to Rome, where Wick is linked up by the Camorra organization for the necessary wardrobe and killing implements. He then goes on a journey through the catacombs to locate and murder Gianna D'Antonio. In the most gruesome scene of the film, Gianna slashes her wrists before she is shot in the head by Wick. In what follows for an interminable period, there is a killing spree as Wick makes his escape from the catacombs.<br/><br/>The balance of the film is Wick on the run after Santino places a contract on his head in the amount of $7 million. There is no evidence of any law authorities either in New York or Rome, only the occasional sign in a subway that alerts bystanders to be on the lookout for any ""suspicious activity."" The suspicious activity takes the form of the sequence that is repeated over and over in the film: Wick mowing down groups of armed assailants who are hunting him. The only redeeming relationship in the film is that of Wick and his dog. But, sadly, the dog does not even have a name."

"BrianKitt","3","17","43","11 February 2017"," Too much, too close, too silly
","Apparently I saw a different movie than the other people that have reviewed this movie, I can't see how anyone could have given this a good review.<br/><br/>In the movie I saw, the camera work was often so close, that all you could see was blurs or confusion. You just saw mashing of clothing, the camera was sometimes so close you couldn't make out who you were seeing. At times, you couldn't even make out what was happening, and sometimes just had to wait for aftermath to try to figure out what had happened in the prior scene. Panning out the camera would have improved the movie greatly. Closeups do not always improve the action, and this movie proves it.<br/><br/>In the movie I saw they would have you believe that almost every person in New York was secretly a hit-man, including an entire band of homeless people living on the street who were both homeless and hit men. To me, this was so goofy that it really ruined the story line, and I started laughing at how stupid this was. Of course, every single hit-man in New York, including all of the homeless hit men, all knew John Wick on a first name basis.<br/><br/>In the movie I saw, they would have you believe that there are networks of secret hotels, and secret armories and secret suppliers all over the world that hit men use. Well, I guess if every person in New York is a hit-man, then this is necessary. But it just comes off as stupid.<br/><br/>The plot, is that John MUST perform a task, which everyone knows will make him the most wanted man in the world, and if he doesn't perform this task, then he will be the most wanted man in the world. Kind of a really stupid plot.<br/><br/>In the movie I saw, John Wick killed nearly ever person with a a single shot or single hit, EXCEPT, Cassain. John couldn't kill Cassain no matter what he did, and these two just kept shooting each other. But don't worry, John had a bullet proof suit that he bought at one of these hit-man stores. But, he is the only one that can afford these suits. Even though this store appears to do enough business that they have a full time staff making bullet proof suits, no one else has them. Nearly every other person dies with a single shot, so they clearly are not wearing these suits. <br/><br/>Then there was the large Asian man comic relief, who takes a shot directly into the brain, and that doesn't kill him, he keeps on coming. Hmmm.<br/><br/>To me, they took the best of John Wick 1, the best of Bourne, combined it with Doom, supersized it, and ruined it. Less is more guys.<br/><br/>I went to this movie with high hopes and was extremely disappointed, mostly at how goofy they made the story line."
"CyberRax","5","8","17","5 March 2017"," ""John Wick The Invincible"" aka ""Meh""
","Maybe I was having too high hopes for this movie, or maybe it's because I liked the original a lot and only recently re-watched it on DVD, but this movie was a let down.<br/><br/>So, let's count the negative.<br/><br/>1) John is invincible, which kills all suspense.<br/><br/>In the first ""John Wick"" we had a bad-ass guy who was an excellent shot, was very fast and had quite a lot of luck (and good friends). But when he got shot once, or was stabbed, he bled and had a doctor take a look at it.<br/><br/>How did the screenwriter turn him even more ""bad-ass"" in this sequel? He gave him a bulletproof jacket, had him get hit multiple times with cars, and take a rain of direct bullet hits without as much as blinking an eye. There's not a single scene in the whole movie where you'd think that John might not make it out alive.<br/><br/>2) faceless goons keep on coming, so killing them gets boring.<br/><br/>The beginning scene in the garage, and the long escape scene in Rome felt like a video game - one henchman, kill it, another henchman, kill it, another henchman, kill it, another henchman, kill it. on more henchman, kill it. And so on and so on. No imagination, no suspense.<br/><br/>3) pacing was way off.<br/><br/>The first movie nicely interleaved exposition and flashback scenes with intense action. Not so much here - we have a drawn out action scene in the beginning, then 30 minutes of exposition, then another badly overdrawn action scene, then some more exposition.<br/><br/>4) the ""mythology"" was not interesting, nor helpful.<br/><br/>In the first movie we had a a quiet assassin who worked with the Russian mafia, had made a number of connections during this time, tended to pay with special coins and knew a shady hotel which was used by criminals to get a good night's sleep. The second movie turns this setup into a full-blown ""association of gangsters"", who have unlimited resources, a council, their own underground messaging system, dedicated housing if several cities, presumably hundreds - if not thousands - of members (of which several dozen are professional assassins and, from the looks of it, have non-criminal day jobs) and random rules which have to be followed. Why do we need this?<br/><br/>5) revenge for revenge's sake. We have enough B-grade movies with that logic.<br/><br/>OK, so the first movie had this ridiculous premise of avenging a dead dog. Even the characters in the movie acknowledged that it was ridiculous. But a deeper meaning was attached to John's rampage and it made sense. It was about punishment for done deeds, not about whom those deeds had been done to. No so much in the current movie. It's just another generic ""he tried to kill me, now I'll kill him"" film.<br/><br/>6) it sort-of ruins the character of John Wick.<br/><br/>The first episode gave us a solitary elite assassin who wouldn't kill on the hotel's premise (contrary to ms. Perkins), most likely wouldn't kill his friends (unlike Dafoe's character, who seemingly would) and had pulled off an ""impossible task"" to gain his freedom. This sequel reveals that Wick will kill in the Continental if his grudge is big enough, will kill people he considers friends, the ""impossible task"" wasn't all his doing and that he's simply one of many-many-many gunmen who roam the land looking for a quick buck...<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: <br/><br/>All-in-all I'd sadly the movie is a weak rehash of the original and offered nothing that would explain the hype it's getting.<br/><br/>I'll most likely give it another shot when it comes out on DVD, but until then John Wick of 2014 gets my vote over John Wick of 2016."

I guess that's why John Wick's name is known by all and feared by most of them. <br/><br/>Other than that, I loved the film and can't wait to see what they do with Chapter 3.

Also the shots aren't anything special.<br/><br/>Some action scenes are dark and a little unclear to what's going on, just like many Hollywood movies. It's not a big problem, but since Keanu does a lot of the scenes, the choreography of the fights isn't a big deal, it does have some cool fights. Some shooting scenes are nice.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the action in the movie is nothing spectacular, the jokes are bad.

Basically, once they introduce the magic bulletproof suit, the film descends into ridiculousness and the action just becomes repetitive, lacking any kind of real consequence for the protagonist. <br/><br/>However, the biggest issue for me was John Wick's motivation. In the 1st film it was very clear; he wanted revenge for the killing of his puppy. This was a motivation I could get behind and I rooted for his success. In this film, his motivations never felt very compelling, so it was hard to get behind Wick's actions. Not having a strong, identifiable reason for Wick to spring into action I think misses the point of the 1st film entirely.<br/><br/>I've got to recommend, no matter how much you like the original film, just skip this one or wait until it hits Netflix."

","God. The one person you want to listen to and not p|ss off is John Wick. Well, I guess broken rules and burned bridges are Common amongst the baddies.<br/><br/>Like the first one? Personally, I loved it. This 'Chapter 2' is one of those rare direct sequels that doesn't necessarily improve on the first one, but beautifully continues the saga of a Man and His Dogs.<br/><br/>Previously on John Wick, after briefly mourning his dead wife and getting his car stolen and dog murdered, John returns for his car for ""old time's sake"" and is immediately and unwillingly thrust back into the life of the kill from a promise – a marker. <br/><br/>""First rule of assassination: Kill the assassins,"" said Captain James T. Kirk in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. So, here, there wouldn't be a movie if John just paid back his marker.<br/><br/>While the first movie was great, it was simple. This one is definitely more complex and yet it is seamless in the universe John resides in. It's hard to compare or state which one was better as they're both different and yet, both a perfect companion piece.<br/><br/>On a deeper level, I do love the character of John Wick. Part Super- Villain with a heart/Part Super-Killer with a low tolerance level. He also has some Super-Powers that surely would've killed him 10 minutes into his career had he been based on a real person. The fun part of this fiction is how balanced his human-side is with his indestructability on the playground.<br/><br/>As for his human-side, I love how awkward John's steps are, how he fumbles getting out of his cars. As much as everyone builds him up as The Boogeyman, or ""the man you send to kill The Boogeyman,"" he's very clumsy at times. Don't get me wrong; the hype around his legend is warranted and I believe it in the stories about him. <br/><br/>That said, and as much of a Bourne fan I am, John Wick seems to be much more ferocious and effective in the slaying game. And those falls he takes – just one small example: the three layers of stairs – I have no idea how the real actors pulled those off and lived. Well done. If nothing else, these actors must be honored for what they put their bodies through for entertainment and the director and crew should also be praised for their extreme ability to showcase such brutality in the fight/killing scenes. Bravo! <br/><br/>This is one of those movies you can't skip the previous chapter and frankly, why should you? These are perfect together. Just send the kiddies to bed, get the popcorn and know you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Pleasemake this a trilogy. I have an idea how it would end and I don't want to see that ending, but this definitely needs another Chapter. Only, and I never thought I'd say this, I feel bad for Keanu. These movies HAVE to hurt him bad. At least, in the bruising department."

","not much substance. Mind you, it was really well done, but, that doesn't make for a classic. It was like watching one of those video games movies play out in entirety.<br/><br/>This kind of action flick was far better done by Michael Mann in Collateral. But, of course, you can't have two Collaterals, another Mendes/Craig James Bond. or Matrix trilogy, for that matter.<br/><br/>And, IMO, John Wick is just under those. Almost all action and not much dialogue. At least, Matrix trilogy had some plot twists and a much better soundtrack. And, Wick 2 was far better than Mad Max Fury Road, by the way.<br/><br/>Maybe if I were in my teens, I'd be calling this a masterpiece but, in late 40s, I am not anxiously awaiting a sequel which should be even more action and less dialogue, Shrug."
"bluetanker_07","9","6","12","19 February 2017"," The legend about THE PENCIL is true!! (SPOILERS!)
","John ""The Man. The Myth. The Legend."" Wick, Chapter 2. From simple yet intriguing story of it's first movie, they were able to do a grander plot and wider approach for it's sequel. And because of this, John Wick will become a very successful franchise.<br/><br/>Keannu Reeves is really fitted to be John Wick. The character's persona, the way he moves, the way he talks, all these make John Wick, John Wick.<br/><br/>Full of action, and blood. This movie will bring you to the edge of your seat. It has improved from the first movie. This is what a sequel should be. They have doubled the fun, doubled the action, and I am very excited to what the third movie will be.<br/><br/>I will rate this, 9/10. It would have been 10/10 but since John was being stupid, I will take 1 point from it. Still a great movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS.<br/><br/>One of the best parts of the movie, was when John is showing his mad skill of killing a person with a pencil. With a FREAKING pencil. The legend is true. <br/><br/>Here's my summary below.<br/><br/>The Baba Yaga continues his story with unleashing vengeance to who killed his dog and had his car. He is set to take back his car who is now under the inventory of Viggo's brother--who is also very afraid of The Boogeyman. The boogeyman did arrive, and wrecked havoc to their place and got his car back. Unfortunately, after all the car chase and fighting, his car was in total wrecked. Aurelio was having hard time believing to what had happened to the car, as he knew that John loved the car. He jokingly said that he can fixed the car by Christmas...of 2030.<br/><br/>Since John felt that his vengeance was complete, he reburied his golds and weapons back underground. Later the night, he received an unexpected visit from his past. Santino D'Antonio, to whom John owes a debt. A blood mark, where he must do what Santino wishes, to pay his debt. John declines, as he no longer was the man he used to be, even though he haven't known what the mission is yet. Santino said the he need the old John Wick, the Boogeyman, and gave the marked coin to John. John stands with his decision and returned the coin.<br/><br/>Santino bid goodbye, and said that John has very beautiful home. From afar, Santino blew John's house, with him inside.<br/><br/>Furious John, went to the Continental and looked for Santino, so he can get his revenge. Winston, asked him to calm down and advised him to follow the rule. He must do what Santino wants, as this is part of the blood mark.<br/><br/>John left with no choice, went to Santino, and spoke to him about his mission. The mission is to kill Santino's sister, so he can take over a seat from the High table, that was given by his father to her sister. High table is like a council of top crime lords.<br/><br/>John went to Rome, and planned his mission. He purchased awesome guns and knives, he was fitted for new suits. Later that night, John went with his plan, there he saw Gianna and his men. John confronted Gianna but Gianna committed a suicide saying she will her own way. John saw Cassian, Gianna's bodyguard, and asked if John is working again. As he understood that Gianna was his target, firefight began and John was attacked by Gianna's men. John fought and killed every man that comes his way. <br/><br/>John saw Ares, Santino's bodyguard. John understood that she was there to kill him, tying loose ends. So, another firefight happen and John killed all of them, except Ares.<br/><br/>After the firefight, a car hit John. It was Cassian, then they went to a fight until they have reached the continental. There they were stopped as there should be no blood and no business must happen inside the continental grounds. They went to the bar, and talked to why John did it. Cassian understood, but said that since John killed his ward, he will kill him too.<br/><br/>Since assassination attempt of John did not happen, Santino placed an open contract to kill John for $7,000,000.00. John, who is coming back from Rome, had to fight and kill every assassin who comes his way. John showed his legendary pencil-killing moves. Cassian, spotted John and they fought each other. John decided to spare Cassians life, as a professional courtesy.<br/><br/>But lacking out of options, John asked help from an underground Crime Lord (Laurence Fishburne), so he can safely get to where Santino was. John arrived at the museum and killed all of Santino's men, including Ares.<br/><br/>Santino, went to the Continental to get a safe asylum, as there can be no killings inside the grounds of the Continental. John arrived with a gun, and found Santino eating. Winston, asked John to calm down, and requested not to what he wanted to do. John still decided to kill Santino in the head, breaking the rule.<br/><br/>Winston met with John, and told him that the High Table doubled his bounty and it has gone international. Winston delayed it for an hour to allow John to escape. He gave him a marker (I think this will be useful in Chapter 3). John fled with his dog, under the watchful eyes of the assassins."
"blackmamba99971","10","6","12","18 February 2017"," Again with his pencil
","John Wick. Otherwise known as the Ghost among assassins around the planet. He is brought back in to do one last job of killing an underworld boss by the order of the boss's brother played by Ricardo Scamacio. Yet wick knows full well that even if he did accomplish his job his own life would be forfeit by the strict assassin rules, and rituals for killing Santino's kin. In many ways it was a catch 22 situation any way a person looked at it. Betrayed, hunted, and submerged deeper than he has ever gone before John must now juggle his own life as his mentor Winston, (Ian Mcshane) warns him that to kill within the safe zone would result in his total ex-communication from the assassins guild.<br/><br/>I thought this was a great ending to the series. Not only does john have to run for his life but every assassin on earth is called in with a one hour window to take him out including his chop shop buddy Aurelio, played by John Leguizamo. Armed with his wits, and k-nine companion they must escape destiny so that John can take out the conglomerate who hired Santino in the first place. Wonderful action with a nice dose of hand to hand combat along with precise gun fights. Although high octane filled the story could have used more of Winston through out. If he was John's benefactor it would see to reason to defend John. Alas that was not the case.<br/><br/>Still the story held true meaning that Santino broke the rules except for John taking it too far by killing his employer inside of the safe house which is of course a death sentence. You can sense a strange camaraderie between Winston, and John simply because both knew the guidelines. To break them meant expediting your life except now John is on a crusade to breaking more rules in order to stop the Camarilla conglomerate from taking over New York. Incredible speedy violence with wonderful location spots such as Rome, Brooklyn, New Hampshire, and so on. It should have had extra car chases to top off this movie a bit more, but I was fully satisfied with the end result. If they do make a third instalment there should be that one rogue assassin who decides that John's life is worth a lot more than what the guild is portraying.<br/><br/>Perhaps throw in a few policemen who do not know of the guild or who they all represent, which could add more plot to the story. From political bodies, to seedy back door deals from state officials. However it goes John Wick will remain one of my favourite silent lone wolf heroes."

","John wick was one of the most surprising films I have ever seen, so I was looking forward to chapter 2, this does not disappoint, fantastic film making. We get action films now that are so badly filmed with shaky cam (i hate shaky cam), this film is brilliantly directed and the action is amazing. Don't think tho it's all guns blazing, this film actually has a good story and great characters, it also creates a great world that we are introduced to. I would also like to give credit to keanu reeves, if you watch the video of him training for this role you will see the dedication he gives. To finish i can say this is the best action film I've seen in a while. I'm glad films like this are being made."
"alindsay-al","9","6","12","18 February 2017"," A fantastic sequel that keeps the action up full notch
","John Wick is one of my favourite action films of recent memory so I was so excited for this film and I am happy to tell you that I loved this film. The premise of this film sees it start a few days after the last film where Wick has to repay a debt to an old friend and get dragged back into the criminal life. Keannu Reeves once again plays John Wick and he is truly amazing in this film, he is perfect in the action scenes doing the majority of the stunts himself and adding amazing realism to the awesome action scenes in this film. Yes sometimes his delivery of dialogue is a little wooden but I thought he had charisma to him and a coolness that sold me on his character once again. Ian Mcshane is back for this film in a larger role and he is great in this film, i loved his and Reeves chemistry in the film and I thought his character had more depth in this film 'then the first. I did like the guy wick has to work for in this film, he had a mix of charisma and intimidation that i bought him in the role. Common plays a guard for wick's target and he does a good job in the film once again in the action scenes that he does a great job in. My only problem with the cast is Ruby Rose, after her performance in XXX I was hoping for better in this film but she is really overacting in this film and I found her character very cheesy. The plot in this film is okay with wick having to go to different locations and show his true survival instinct in the film. I also really liked how this film expands on the universe that was established in the first film. However, this film's narrative has nowhere near the emotional impact that the first did and you feel like John doesn't really want to go on this mission so why should you. The script has some pretty decent dramatic dialogue that maybe isn't extraordinary but I thought it worked for this film. There is also a bit more humour in this film and it is handled well. The style of this film is absolutely amazing, it has allot more vibrant colours in the film and the action scenes are absolutely out of this world. Long takes of the most creative, devastating action scenes I think I have ever seen and huge credit has to go to Reeves and the stunt team for there amazing commitment to their roles. Overall even though I slightly preferred the first film, I think this is one of the best action sequels of all time and must be seen if you are an action fan or a fan of great movies."

After dispatching Tarasov's men in a violent fight that heavily damages his retrieved car, John spares Tarasov under the auspices of ""peace"" and returns home. He then calls on Aurelio (John Leguizamo) to repair his car.<br/><br/>Later, John is visited by Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio). It is revealed that years ago, to complete his ""impossible task"", retire and get married, John asked D'Antonio for help to permanently leave the assassins secret society. John is then forced to offer an oath to D'Antonio as payment for the debt. The debt is signified by a ""Blood Oath Marker,"" which is pledged when the person offering the unbreakable promise presses a bloody thumb to the right half of a circular device.[4] This is a commitment of blood, meaning the debtor is swearing to fulfill the oath which D'Antonio now plans to collect, claiming John has come out of retirement. John subsequently refuses to honor his debt, intending to retire for good, but Santino in retaliation for John breaking his oath, destroys and burns down his home using a grenade launcher as a warning."
"burlesonjesse5","8","6","12","16 February 2017"," VIEWS ON FILM review of John Wick: Chapter 2
","His name is Johnathan ""John"" Wick and yup, he's back! John Wick: Chapter 2 (my latest review) is a movie that lives in a world all its own. It's that underground world filled with lustrous images, hidden crime, and 50's-style telephone operators. ""Chapter 2"" also cements Keanu Reeves as one of the best action stars on the planet. He's up there with Liam Neeson, Denzel Washington and my personal favorite, Mel Gibson. I remember seeing ""The One"" in 1991's Point Break and wondering if he could take on the role of action hero and veritable butt kicker. I haven't wondered for some time for he's done it in a steadily manner over the past 26 years.<br/><br/>So OK, Keanu's martial arts moves in The Matrix were a little stiff. And yes, he's not exactly the acting caliber of Daniel Day-Lewis. No matter. It's a whole new spiel now. Reeves using minimal dialogue and beholding a overly seething screen presence, is almost synonymous with intimidating dudes you don't wanna mess with. In ""Chapter 2"" he dons a slick suit and spotty beard, loads and reloads a P30 faster than a jack rabbit, and eliminates gun-toting baddies like a champ. His John Wick: Chapter 2 is an exercise in style and its violence is like ballet, poetry, or birds in flight. Oh yeah, this ""wick"" burns through and through.<br/><br/>Now in 2014, I did give the first John Wick a mixed review. I said that it didn't add anything fresh to the action thriller genre. With John Wick: Chapter 2, I almost went the same route until I viewed ""Chapter 2's"" final shootout sequence. Heck, I don't know director Chad Stahelski from Adam but I'm pretty sure he paid homage to Bruce Lee and Lee's mirror fight scene from Enter the Dragon. Stahelski's interpretation of the last ten minutes of ""Chapter 2"", is a real humdinger. It single- handedly makes for a superior sequel which is a rare thing.<br/><br/>As for John Wick: Chapter 2's diegesis, well it's different from what transpired in the original John Wick. This time, it's not about Keanu's trouper getting revenge on some Russian gangsters who kill his dog and take his kick ass ride (a Boss 429 Mustang). And this time, the proceedings are even more violent, more bloody, and more smash-mouth. ""Chapter 2's"" story involves Jonathan being coerced back into the hit-man life. First, he has to assassinate an Italian crime lord's sister and then, Wick has to dodge every other professional killer because he's got a $7 million dollar contract on his head. Be on the lookout for more tantalizing subtitles (from the first installment) and Stahelski's standard and forthright camera-work. He may be the antithetical Paul Greengrass. Also, look for a couple of scenes where Keanu Reeves is reunited with his wise old co-star from The Matrix Trilogy (Mr. Laurence Fishburne). Aw, it feels so good.<br/><br/>All in all, I honestly don't think plot matters in glitzy, neo-noir flicks such as John Wick: Chapter 2. It's more about the bullets flying, the techno music in the background, the hand-to-hand combat, and director Chad Stahelski using white background colors (in a subway station) to show an audience what real blood spattering looks like. As ""Chapter 2"" concludes, the film clearly leaves the door open for a third go-around. Keanu's Wick quips in future tense, ""whoever comes, I'll kill them all."" Dang, I can't wait. Rating: 3 and a half stars."
"Screen_Blitz","8","6","12","16 February 2017"," John Wick returns for another ride of visceral action sequences with higher stakes
","If John Wick proved anything upon its release in the fall of 2014, it is not only that the action genre is still far from its deathbed but also that Keanu Reeves still holds his action adrenaline muscle he boasted during his years in the 'Matrix' trilogy. To say the least, it was a hyper-kinetic thrill ride that truly delivered. With Chad Stahelski returning to the director's seat, this film continues this story of the title character with a solid blend of frenetic action sequences and visual style. Similarly to the first film, this one delivers a heavy load of brooding action set pieces that mostly play roles in propelling the plot but nonetheless vend the thrills moviegoers deserve. However, it is Keanu Reeves that stands as the driving force for this action-packed vehicle. While the improvement upon the predecessor is rather thin to spot out, this film nevertheless gets the job done. Reeves reprises the role of John Wick who has shed away his gun, hoping to fully retire from his life as an assassin. However, when he is paid a visit by an Italian mobster Santino D'Antonio (played by Riccardo Scamarcio) who forcibly extorts him into doing one last mission, Wick is suddenly pulled into a crime underworld where he must travel to Rome to take out crime syndicate D'Antonio's sister (played by Claudia Gerini). He is appointed by the orders of a Continental Hotel owner and crime boss Winston (played by Ian McShane).<br/><br/>This film doesn't quite improve upon the previous film beyond its action sequences and maybe a slightly more constructed plot. Overall, director Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves still successfully breath life into this continuation of the predecessor. The stakes are higher, the gunfights are bloodier, and the plot is perhaps on a bigger scale. The film opens with the title character already on the streets mowing down the bad guys, and the scene progresses into an intense car chase sequence punctuated with brutal hand-to-hand combat and countless gunshots to the head. This scene however, only marks the beginning of the lead character's gun-blazing rampage -- and there is quite a lot of it here. The plot takes on a globe-trotting journey to Rome where a good portion of the action sets stone, and from there John Wick comes face-to-face with some ruthless villains. Before too long, what evolves from a wild ""trust no one"" mission turns into a violent, bloody showdown where gunfire fills the screen almost non-stop and tensions are sky high. And shall I mention the amazing cinematography done by Dan Laustsen who captures the striking visual beauty of both the action and the light-soaked environment of the downtown areas. As for the performances, Keanu Reeves is still strong and pulse-pounding as ever in the titular role; especially when showing off his action-charged testosterone. Riccardo Scamarcio does quite well and breaths plenty of life into the antagonist. As for Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, and John Leguizamo who are stranded in more minor roles, they each certainly do their part for better or worse.<br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2 is an entertaining action thrill ride packed with a hodgepodge of exhilarating action sequences, and striking thrills, and at best makes a worthy sequel for the 2014 surprise hit. It doesn't quite blow the first film out of the water as it stands rather neck-and-neck in terms of quality. But still, there is plenty of entertainment to be handed here. Among the films release in this early (and predictably lackluster) quarter of the year, this one stands out quite well."

","The pistol-wielding rampage continues as John Wick (Keanu Reeves) returns with a new mission and a new reason to take vengeance. The film begins with Wick on a quest to recover his car that was stolen from him in the previous film, he uses the vehicle, pistols, and his hand-held combat skills to take out a whole crowd of gangsters in a chop shop then sues for peace with the leader. Wick desires only to return home and properly grieve for his lost wife. He has adopted a new dog and reburied his weapons and suit. Just as he thinks he's about to get out, circumstances drag back into the violent life of an assassin. <br/><br/>Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) knocks on Wick's door and demands repayment for a debt that Wick acquired when he needed help making his exit from the assassin life. The debt is symbolized by a marker, a round disc that has Wick's bloody thumbprint, a rule that means he must help D'Antonio or risk death by the Continental assassin guild. Enforcing these laws is Winston (Ian McShane) who also restricts violence in his hotel across the world. Wick refuses D'Antonio's demand and has his house burned down as punishment. Forced to concede, Wick goes along with D'Antonio's mission to kill his sister, Gianna D'Antonio (Claudia Gerini).<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
"petdav","8","6","12","11 February 2017"," Excellently Choreographed, Well Filmed
","I don't think I'm saying anything revelatory when I say that the John Wick series isn't about plot. Sure, the universe is compelling and interesting - a pervasive, underground crime community with strict rules and mortal punishment for breaking them - but these movies don't bring a lot to the table in terms of pithy story-line or stunning character portrayal. John Wick is about seeing Keanu Reeves effortlessly walk through one bad guy after another, coming out limping on the other side, bloodied, but ready to keep fighting. <br/><br/>I'm happy to say that this movie delivers on that front. The choreography was fantastic, and the relatively wide camera angles and long shots do an excellent job of showing it off. <br/><br/>There did come a point for me where the level of violence started to feel excessive. Whether I had reached my personal limit or whether the violence really was over the top, I'll leave up to you. <br/><br/>One thing I particularly liked about this movie was the sense that the rest of the world didn't exist. Where other movies get bogged down trying to explain how action heroes manage to exist within the rest of society and avoid the law, John Wick simply ignores the rest of society. It embraces its purpose, and excludes any elements that don't serve the goal of creating really gnarly action sequences. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is, and I appreciate that. <br/><br/>I didn't like it as much as the first movie, but I highly recommend it. I will happily watch it again when it's available to watch at home, and it wouldn't take much convincing to get me to see it again in theaters."
"Oberrated","8","6","12","11 February 2017"," Pulse-pounding non-stop action. Exactly what I wanted.
","I have heard many criticisms on 'John Wick: Chapter 2' in the time that it has been out. Most very positive, very few negative. Some criticism I heard was that this is the best action sequel that was seen in all time, that the action in this is unrivaled, or that this is some of the smartest gun-play presented in an action film, ever. Well that was other people, forget them, what about Oberrated? 'John Wick: Chapter 2' brought insane energy and picked up exactly where it left off from the first one. High-octane action, hilariously and purposefully short dialogue, and a plot that is simply fueled off of revenge and survival... The highlight of this film is without a doubt the action choreography that lasts almost quite literally, the entire duration of the film. My friend said himself and put quite well, ""Normally I sit and wait for action scenes to begin but with this, I am sitting here waiting for a dialogue piece to begin."" Yes my friends, there is that much action in this movie and I loved every moment of it... Honestly, there was very little I found a problem with in this film for the sheer fact I knew what I was getting into. It was an entertaining piece of action to be remembered just like the first one.<br/><br/>There is nothing much else to say about it. This is a pulse-pounding action film for the ages.

","If there ever was a great videogame movie, it'd be John Wick. Its everything a gamer would love in a movie: a paper-thin plot where you don't have to exert your brain, a motive to kick ass and then kick ass like there's no tomorrow; all leading to a satisfying conclusion. John Wick did just that and excelled at it. Its not everyday you get to see a man hell bent on seeking revenge coz someone killed his dog. In a day and age where audiences are slapped and saturated with a superhero movie almost every second month, the directors had also crafted an enjoyable action flick.<br/><br/>Sequels are always at the receiving end of biting criticism and with good reason too. Sequels, be it to a good movie, a game or a book, they try hard to up the ante, top its predecessor by doing the same crap again & again (Quote Einstein here) and fails miserably at it. There are only a handful of movie sequels which actually bested its first outing. Chapter Two of John Wick's saga picks up exactly where the first left off and there on its another fight to the finish. Emphasis on FIGHT to the FINISH. The movie wastes no time to put you into the thick of action and boy, does it feel good to see John playing an orchestra with those guns.<br/><br/>Where Chapter Two wins is it knows exactly what to do to please its audience. People who loved the original will definitely feel right at home, people who wants more are obviously served more plot, more action and more characters and people who wants a great ending are also satisfied to a certain extent. Chapter Two recycles the best elements of John Wick and adds a bit more depth and a lot more action and never forgets where it belongs. While John Wick's premise was laughably good, Chapter 2 let's you go indepth into the organization Wick works for. It ain't anything groundbreaking but the organizations's rules and mechanisms are put into good use and serves for a good plot device.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves had been the butt of memes and jokes for a while now. While he wasn't always known for his acting prowess, he was always known for his style. I was a fan and I am still a fan. There are pitfalls in any actor's career and he's gone through hell of a lot. John Wick was a well deserved break for the guy. He'd put in a lot of effort in the role and it showed. And its no different here, Chapter 2. The supporting cast were pretty good too starting from Ian McShane as Winston, the seemingly innocent owner of the Continental hotel and Lance Reddick as the all-welcoming receptionist of the same. Ruby Rose as Ares, a mute femme fatale and the same goes for Common as Cassian both out for planting a bullet in Wick's head. Reeves' old 'mentor' returns in Chapter Two, yep, Lawrence Fishburne returns as an eccentric, semi-preaching crime lord but does the job well for his meagre screen time. My only disappointment was Santino D'Antonio as the lead antagonist, he did give Wick a hard time but the guy just didn't cut it for me neither was he an intimidating villain.<br/><br/>Dan Laustsen is a name I haven't heard much prior to Chapter Two, but he does a decent job in bringing out Rome as well as New York to life. The total standout is the score from Tyler Bates and it just blew me away. I never paid attention to the score in John Wick, but in this one, the themes are much more apt syncing perfectly with the scenes and it definitely stands out.Try listening 'John Wick Reckoning' and tell me you didnt love it. Chances are that if you loved the movie, you're gonna love the score too.<br/><br/>If I had to discuss flaws it would be the complete disregard of the open violence that was happening on screen. I do believe the justification would be so that these are trained assassins and they can be super silent killers. Chapter Two also lacks a bit of emotion which was what visibly motivating John Wick in the first movie.<br/><br/>While it disheartens me to see a man running and gunning around for his life, unable to mourn for his dead wife and to get some peace, John Wick and Chapter Two has set a perfect example how to create a good old school action movie. Chapter Two's action was fluid and less of that motion-blur nonsense. Its well choreographed and packs a punch, the gun play felt orgasmic and there were some melee sequences that made me cringe. Calling it 'Hyper-violent' would be an understatement coz while John Wick actually laid ground to a violent action movie, Chapter 2 takes it to whole new level and believe me it just feels badass. Its definitely not GREAT, but John Wick franchise proves that you don't need superheroes to have an enjoyable action flick."

","A follow-up to the 2014 sleeper hit, John Wick, the second installment in this newfound franchise exceeds expectations by delivering on action, character, world building, and an engaging plot. Director Chad Stahelski returned to direct the sequel (thankfully) and managed to craft beautifully dynamic and intricate action sequences that feel as if they were lifted right out of a classic Bruce Lee action flick! Smooth cinematography and pleasing wide shots throughout, with little to no edits, make the action and fight choreography feel realistically grounded, and are absolutely jaw dropping to watch unfold. John Wick: Chapter 2 is a non-stop action riot that proves American action films don't always have to feel and look like studio processed schlock. 4.5 out of 5 stars (9/10)."

","""John Wick - Chapter 2"" is an impressive action movie, both as a sequel and as a stand-alone movie. John (Keanu) continues his quest(and thirst) for revenge after being ""re-ignited"" by a don. The action in this movie is devilishly-lovable. Each action sequence has been creatively thought out and coordinated.<br/><br/>One particular action scene is quite outstanding ; the scene in which Keanu has to battle with his former African friend. The martial arts style of fight in this scene is almost perfect. When their fight is interrupted by the hotel ""manager"", the two end up having drinks together. Another scene worth mentioning is the one in which John (Keanu) orders his tailor-made suits, guns, shoes, and other accessories. It is a very sophisticated yet totally lovable type of scene.<br/><br/>Once again, Keanu shines as the menacing, dangerous hit-man who is also known as ""The Boogey-Man"". I am looking forward to ""Chapter 3"" of John Wick, because the ending of Chapter 2 was definitely incomplete."

","I rarely write a review about a film. In fact, in fact, I think it is my first time here. I'm doing it to let you know how dumb and dull this film is: a complete waste of time. The only good thing I can point out is: few easy jokes, the guy is a tough one and does not like to talk much, but the film is so dull that makes one of the characters say it, maybe expecting the audience to be even duller. Ah, the John guy is though but he is also very sweet side, not covered to much in order to look appealing to the female audience: kills a bunch of people to get back a photograph of his lost love (was in his stolen car) and has a puppy, but since he is a tough guy the puppy has no name (way to keep an emotional distance, I think...). Really, nothing in this movie makes sense. Lots of good actors but no substance at all. So it is all for nothing."
"jimbo-53-186511","4","4","7","8 July 2017"," The action sequences are great, but it lacks the heart of the first film and the story is also messy and muddled
","John Wick is reluctantly forced out of retirement to take on a job on behalf of Santino D'Antonio (Riccardio Scamarcio). Wick is tasked with killing D'Antonio's sister so that D'Antonio can take her place at the high table. Wick's acceptance of this task is merely the tip of the iceberg and it seems that D'Antonio has other plans in mind for Wick...<br/><br/>Despite the fact that it was derivative, clichéd and a tad predictable I did actually enjoy the first John Wick film. It had a very basic story, but one with heart and some emotion to it and despite the familiarity it was an easy film to get lost and swept up in. Regrettably, the same cannot be said for the sequel...<br/><br/>Perhaps the filmmakers felt that the first film was a tad too simplistic and therefore they may have decided to give several layers to the narrative, but the layered approach that is employed here just doesn't work...<br/><br/>First of all, Wick is tasked with killing D'Antonio's sister, but when he reaches her she kills herself with Wick merely 'finishing the job off.' This aspect of the plot is dealt with after about 45 minutes so the next hour and a bit focuses on Wick trying to escape some bad guys and D'Antonio putting out a $7,000,000 contract out on Wick which means that every mercenary, hit-man/woman and contract killer comes out of the woodwork to get their hands on the $7,000,000 bounty. This in itself raises a few questions; 1) How do all these contract killers manage to find John Wick so quickly?? 2) How is John Wick able to identify all of them before they even make a move on him? 3) If D'Antonio wanted his sister dead then why not just pay someone to kill his sister and then put a separate bounty on John Wick? Why get John Wick to kill her and then send every contract killer after him?? None of this made sense to me.<br/><br/>The messy and muddled story mean that this sequel doesn't have the same flow about it as the first film and it actually adds as a distraction in this film. It doesn't help that the sequel has no heart to it (Wick had lost his wife and thugs killed his dog in the first film meaning it was easier to become emotionally invested in). It's impossible to get invested in Wick or his cause in this film due to the way the story is set up which clearly becomes a big failing.<br/><br/>Reeves isn't a brilliant actor but I thought he put in a decent turn in the first film, but in retrospect that's probably because he had more to work with in the first film. Here, he looks bored and generally doesn't seem interested - he was probably more interested in his pay cheque. This extends to the film itself which strikes of laziness and has the feel of a film that has been made purely for money more than anything else.Peter Stormare is the best thing about this film, but he's only in the film for about the first 10 minutes.<br/><br/>The action sequences are the saving grace and are on a par with those that we witnessed in the first film - although they do seem to come more infrequently. All in all, it's a disappointing follow-up which is only redeemed slightly by some of its impressive action scenes."

","Ever wondered what a shitty version of Equaliser or Jack Reacher is? If not, then you may try John Wick 2. This movie is your typical Hollywood shitty and predictable movie, you can probably foresee the ending by just reading the synopsis and sparing 1 and a half hours. John Wick gets invited to join the mafia/group/ that he was once a part of, he refuses, so they shoot his house up to hell and stupidly leave him alive. The cops, nurses, hotel concierge and traffic controllers all know John Wick has been up to no good and understand his situation. He decides to unearth his weapons by hitting some foam blocks resembling concrete. He then proceeds to wreck havoc across half the country by killing multiple men with/without weapons. John Wick is untouchable, invincible and he cannot be killed, but the mafia keep throwing mindless thugs at him in the hopes one of them can calm him down, it obviously all fails for them and he gets what he wants in the end."

""John Wick: Chapter 2"" has almost no story and no dialogue. The longest dialogue is with the sommelier, which actually is quite funny. Unfortunately this scene is the highlight of the film.

"stevenrotherforth","8","7","15","1 March 2017"," Repetition could get on your Wick!
","John Wick Chapter 2<br/><br/>This movie was on my list of most anticipated movies of 2017 and with good reason. JW Chapter 1 was an absolute blast. An adrenaline shot straight to the heart. A refreshing change from the shaky cam action movies Hollywood continually churns out these days. The first movie had a simple storyline with well choreographed action scenes and a hero the audience could root for. We felt his pain, we got behind him and supported his motive. JW Chapter 2 is a more complex affair. A film that stumbles in its quest to expand its character and the universe he dwells in by giving the audience too much for their money. The simplicity that made the original so good is lost here. As is the reason to truly root for him. By no means is JW2 a bad movie. In fact I enjoyed it immensely but at the same time it felt like a very large helping of my favourite food. I was outfaced by gorging on repetition. However great the action scenes are I couldn't help but feel a little full with over indulgence. There's only so many times you can see a man thrown over the shoulder of another man, have his arm snapped and then shot in the head. Keanu Reeves is a man of commitment and this is apparent in every action scene. At fifty two years of age he really does still kick ass and I almost feel like an ungrateful kid at Christmas. A giant buffet of action to feast on. What am I complaining for? Reeves and the crew have gone to extraordinary lengths to bring each kick, punch and gunshot to life and here I am griping. The opening sequence of action is thrilling but by two thirds of the way into the movie I'm almost as weary as JW himself. So the story this time around is that John must honour a marker he made many years ago. Failure to do so will result in serious consequences (as John learns the hard way). By honouring the said marker he then has every assassin and his dog after him. I'll not go into too many reasons why as following the actual storyline does give you a rest from the repetition. A friend of mine summed it up perfectly. Same action scene, different location. Don't get me wrong people there is a good time to be had here, with some memorable scenes too. A particular one with a pencil springs to mind! (yes a f**king pencil!) The problem is that the film is overlong. Unlike the original, a lean mean movie. JW Chapter 2 tries hard to cram in two much. Expanding the world John lives in is intriguing but it bulks out an already over bulky movie. Maybe thirty mins less of a run time would have left me a little less fatigued by the end of the movie. Still JW2 is one of the better movies of this genre that has been produced lately and I will definitely go see the inevitable JW Chapter 3. Only please make that one a smaller portion."

","Whatever was fun about the first movie is totally lost and forever forgotten in this one. I am okay with a certain amount of ""stylized violence"" and but that was not why I enjoyed the first John Wick. I enjoyed the first because it didn't take itself seriously. These types of movies can't afford to be serious, because when they are their terrible. And so it the problem with John Wick Chapter 2, it takes itself way too seriously, including its over the top, ridiculous, crude violence. Such violence just turns everyone off. <br/><br/>If I disliked it so much I guess people will wonder why I gave it a ""3"".

","Sequels have a tough time. In order to repeat commercial success of the first part, they need to keep exploiting the same elements or develop a story. Only sequels that manage to develop a story are truly interesting in my opinion. In case of John Wick only innovative element was new gun-fu tactics which looked cool. Sequel should have been all about developing the story. Instead they decided to blow up repetitive gun-fu moves out of proportion and triple the ridiculousness which is not saved merely by suspending disbelief. John Wick 2 is like too sweet cake which produces nausea and bloating instead of feeling of pleasant satiety. 5/10 for eye candy, 3/10 as a sequel."

The movie reminded me of the crappy video games kids love where the main character runs around shooting everything in sight. To make the movie worse, the same techniques were used over and over by John Wick - wrap legs around bad guy, flip him around a few times, spin him on the ground and then shoot him in the head.

The whole plot was incoherent and the story line was a bit messed up. <br/><br/>Some of the messed up plots: 1. The whole point of trying to get the car back at the beginning of the movie was lost when he didn't even really seem to care about the car. 2. Killing his target? John Wick is supposed to be a legend and yet he openly walks out after ""killing"" his first target. Makes no sense. 3. There is also a scene where they fight on a train and Wick is stabbed in the thigh but it looks like the filmmakers forgot about it because he seems to be alright right after getting off the train. 4. John Wick breaks a rule of the continental hotel? 5. I can find numerous issues with the film but I don't want to go on a rant! <br/><br/>All in all, it is a complete waste of 2 hours. Good action? Yes. Everything else? No. Keanu Reeves reminded me of Steven Segal in this film. He (Keanu Reeves) had so many expressions in this film; all of them looked exactly the same!<br/><br/>For those of you who want to watch just action scenes without any story or good acting involved, this movie may be okay. For those who want to see some actual acting and a good plot, don't waste your money on this one, just wait till it plays on the TV and even then I wouldn't recommend it! <br/><br/>3 out of 10 just because the action scenes were bearable in some instances."

Tens of enemies run towards John Wick just to be shot, whereas the hero can withstand any amount of damage.

There is no twist that you could accidentally leak to potential viewers. It is too simple. Full-of-himself-Mobster pisses of John Wick. John Wick kills the mob and then the mobster, breaking the rules of the mob. Walks (ok, runs) into the sunset. Chapter 3 to see more mobster shooting and killing. And btw. the cities are filled with contract killers. They are everywhere. Literally everywhere. And they all got old (aka ""burner"") phones. There must be a retro-phone factory just to serve the contract killer community. Lots of retro style - but not quite as cool as in ""Wanted"". Character development? Ahhhhh, let's pass on that one. The mobster is just as 2 dimensional as his female body guard played by Ruby Rose. What a loss. Just to think what a talented screenwriter could have done with those characters... The acting suffers from the little opportunity to actually interact in any kind of meaningful dialogue. They all are just moving targets for the bullets fired by John Wick.

Beautiful scenery,locations, great action scenes that you can follow along and are not all shaky camera and choppy. The world of John Wick is breathtaking and amazing. You're dragged right back in the opening shot of the first scene. I love the fact that he actually takes time to reload the gun and he gets his butt kicks a lot and still fights. He's not a superhuman like Tom Cruise in MI movies or the Fast and Furious franchise. I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. The climax of course was seeing Morpheus and Neo reuniting on screen for the first time in nearly 20 years on the rooftop scene. I feel so bad for John wanting a simple life and being forced back into this world. There's one scene in the movie where John shouts that you wanted be back and now I'm back. And I wondered was that John talking to the antagonist or 50 something year old Keanu breaking the fourth wall and talking to us, the audience, for wanting this sequel so bad. And my goodness, Keanu, the writers, the directors, and the studio heard our prayers and created a movie that lived up to the hype of the original and complemented it perfectly. It wasn't too big or too small. It was just right and I think that a lot of times that successful movies sometimes forget the magic formula that made the original so special and overdo it in the second movie.The directors of JW2 did it exactly right. Can't wait until John Wick Chapter 3 is released so that we can give this man some peace. Definitely recommend."

Limping more than ever, and looking as if he's about to turn into wood any second, he's still inexplicably unkillable and wondrously fatal. So fatal that sometimes his victims prefer to kill themselves, simply to grant themselves the luxury of dying their own way.<br/><br/>This movie upped the stakes style- and execution-wise, that's for certain. And even though the plot is ridiculously thin and the action as repetitive as an FPS game, one could not deny John Wick: Chapter 2 a certain charm. However, just like Mr Wick's magical ability to withstand death, that charm is an artificially crafted gizmo delivered by the hands of many unnamed (or not so much) characters put everywhere for the entourage. The entourage that gets viciously exploited by Keanu Reeves wearing the same single face everywhere and saying his wooden lines like an animated corpse. Without Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, Lawrence Fushburne, Common, that equally hot and deadly mute girl, even without Riccardo Scamarcio and his character, John Wick is just a bogeyman: a ghost of a scary story which can only frighten little kids but loses its potency once they grow up a bit."

Some of the ""boogeyman"" lines are re-hashed verbatim in this movie without a hint of irony, and it feels like lazy writing. The dialogue is stiff and lost the charisma and depth the first movie had.

"go_titans","4","7","16","25 May 2017"," John Wick...in God Mode
","I love Keanu Reeves, I love action films, and I love intelligent scenes and story-lines. Unfortunately, this movie is seriously lacking in the latter department, and I will explain why.<br/><br/>First, the format is so predictable it becomes instantly pointless and boring. Bad guys spend 5 minutes talking up John Wick until he sounds like a super being, then we spend the next 10 minutes watching Keanu in God Mode. To explain what I mean by this: he starts the film out by getting slammed by cars left and right and yet always manages to get up in time to kick the next bad guy in the head (any normal person would have sustained broken bones and spinal injuries), and then about a third of the way through the film he buys a suit that is literally able to stop bullets. The action that then follows looks like nothing more than a computer game where you walk down corridors shooting bad guys in the head over and over again to get a high score...only you're in God Mode cos in John Wick 2 you can't really get hurt. Then the bad guys talk Wick up again for another 5 minutes, followed by another round of action where our God Mode hero survives another endless hail of bullets while he himself does enough killing that would have even Satan gasping in shock.<br/><br/>The overall result is a completely pointless movie from start to finish. We know John Wick can't get hurt, and we know he's going to kill and keep on killing until the final credits roll. The bad guys seem to have a total inability to shoot Wick in the head, despite him showing them about 200 times how it is done. No amount of punishment from cars, bullets, knives or fists seems to slow him down. Sure, they have him walk with a limp after a while, but he seems to forget about it very quickly once the action starts back up again.<br/><br/>To sum up, this film can only be pleasing if you switch your brain off and stare mindlessly at the endless action until drool starts running from your mouth. If, on the other hand, you keep your brain switched on while viewing, you will instantly recognise the film for what it is: a gamester's wet dream of non-stop killing with no chance of the hero getting hurt. I defy you to watch the shooting scenes and not see the heavy resemblance between them and a computer game. Even the lack of a story line ends up resembling a game format. It's pathetic.<br/><br/>I like Keanu and a number of the other characters, but the rest of what I have described drags the film down to a 4/10...sorry."

Ian is sort of the keeper and enforcer of the hit man rules that all hit men have to follow. He lets people know about safe havens too, where no violence is allowed at all, under penalty of expulsion from the International Hit Man Club and it usually ends in death for the person, too. Riccardo wants Keanu to kill someone for him-he has a marker on Keanu and if Keanu does the hit, then Keanu will be a free man. Of course, things get more complicated, more violent, more guns blazing, well, you get the idea. Common is the bodyguard of the person that Keanu is supposed to take out and Laurence is the head of a group of hit men that disguise themselves as street people-like homeless people or street beggars. At one point, there is an open contract on Keanu for 7 million dollars and other assassins come at him from every angle. The stunts and fights are fantastic and I don't see how some of the stunt men weren't seriously hurt during the filming. It is not for everyone-Keanu kills several opponents using only an ordinary pencil-but it is my kind of movie; stylish and gruesome. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and some brief nudity and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes. I loved it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

This is much like with ""hooks"" (catchy sequences) in music that keep you stimulated. If you ask me why they do that, it's because, after you see beyond the action, you realize that there is nothing there. It is hollow. This makes me angry, because it started off as a promising trilogy and ""Chapter One"" whetted my appetite for this one. What makes me even more angry is that the filmmakers must think their audiences are stupid and they will buy into any piece of crap they are served. I have given this movie two stars firstly, because of presentation of the action scenes themselves which are pleasant to watch (however implausible they are, like, e.g. taking cover behind the jacket one is wearing, walking out of point-blank shots unscathed).

I can't find anything original in the screenplay (in my opinion it is a mass!).

Nothing new. And the poor actors can't help.<br/><br/>The technically realization is at standard level, I think.<br/><br/>Beside my point of view, somehow this film finds its audience. Well, alright.

The first one was awful too, but I never expected the sequel to be this awful. Lets talk about the technical aspects of the first film, it had competent cinematography and action sequences. Here, it feels like the director wanted a long fish lens to use to show the action more wide, but all it does was create unnecessary on screen space that turns the action scenes into dull art. The colors are much more vibrant than its predecessor, but there was no reason to do so. John Wick's world is supposed to look dark and ominous. It isn't supposed to look like a world full of rainbows. The cinematography just destroys the tone of the world that was competently created in the first film. The fight choreography and stunts are very mediocre and unimpressive. It's slow and it's so fake that you could easily tear it apart. There's tons of continuity errors where ADR does not match or the scene before doesn't match up with the continuity of the next scene. The sound design is too loud and it's obnoxious to listen to. The music is bloated as if Hans Zimmer composed it. There were times where I noticed the camera man had a difficult time following the action sequences, it was very annoying and laughable considering that they used a wider lens for this. There is an abundance of shaky cam and it's not intense at all, it's lazy. This is an overall lazy sequel that doesn't deserve its rating. Keanu Reeves may have pumped up the training for this, but the directors obviously told him to lay low.

"MovieAddict2016","8","7","17","12 February 2017"," Yeah, I'm thinking he's back!
","""John Wick"" was one of my favorite films of 2014 - a simple revenge movie with no pretensions, expertly directed and choreographed, perfectly cast, and creatively designed (from its seemingly dated and yet entirely appropriate Marilyn Manson soundtrack to its very unique usage of captions during foreign-language dialogue). It was at once a throwback to revenge-based action thrillers of the '70s and a kind of neo-noir genre piece. I loved it.<br/><br/>The film didn't do crazy business at the box office, but it had strong weekly holds which indicated positive word of mouth, and it was Lionsgate's third best-selling title of all time on home video (directly behind a Hunger Games movie). The growing reaction was palpable enough to inspire faith in a sequel.<br/><br/>And this is where it gets tricky, because ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" looked like a sure-fire dud on paper. Often times movies of this ilk have trouble replicating the successes of their predecessors - opting for a rushed ""been there, done that"" routine - but director Chad Stahelski and co. have wisely built upon some of the mythology inherent in the original film and found a way to make it work, expanding the universe in a way that feels organic. The movie's budget is twice as much as the original's, and yet it's still a fraction of most Marvel blockbusters ($40 mil as per trade reports), and so in tone it feels more grand and sleek without necessarily feeling bloated or carefree. (You'll notice there's very, very little CGI employed in the film.) This is one of those rare, beloved action films - much like the original - where you can see every punch thrown, every kick delivered, without the camera cutting so incessantly that it's unintelligible mayhem. There's a fluidity and art to the carnage here that is quite impressive. <br/><br/>A few qualms: I think the story of the first film, as a revenge picture, works much better. It also put us more firmly on John Wick's side, justifying his murders. This man is, after all, a legendary hit-man -- but the first movie showed Wick post-transformation, as we are led to believe that his departed wife helped rescue him from a sinister lifestyle and brought him resolution. The reason he goes on a killing rampage is because a few thugs beat him and kill his dog. The original movie was a revenge flick, and audiences love revenge - enough so that we're willing to ignore the fact that Wick killed fairly innocent henchmen in the process of exacting his retribution.<br/><br/>The only serious problem I had with ""Chapter 2"" is that Wick is brought back to the hit-man game (albeit reluctantly) and ends up quite brutally murdering well over 100 people in the process. Yes, these scenes are beautifully choreographed and at times darkly funny. I enjoyed them -- and yet it disturbed me a bit at times to think that these nameless henchmen being massacred by Wick are essentially just doing their jobs, and the scenes are framed in such a way as to suggest they deserve their brutal slaughters. Does it say more about me, as a person, that I'm OK with Wick killing people as revenge for his dog? Perhaps. But it was a bit of an issue I had with the movie, which is that it's much easier to root for the hero's killing when he's on a revenge mission versus just fulfilling a job requirement.<br/><br/>The other issue I had is that the film lost a bit of the original's idiosyncratic flair (e.g. the aforementioned Marilyn Manson tunes, and the kind of grungy Gothic vibe -- all that kind of early 2000s throwback stuff is gone, and the movie feels more modern and polished). <br/><br/>These are fairly minor qualms. Whatever the movie lost in terms of its soundtrack or tone, or its questionable murder scenes, it certainly made up for in its expansion of the Wickiverse (can we call it that?), with the Continental - briefly glimpsed in the first film - really evolving and becoming a main point of the sequel. They are doing very interesting things with this aspect of the storyline, and the movie ends in such a way as to suggest that Wick's story is far from finished. <br/><br/>Count me in for opening day of ""John Wick: Chapter 3."""

","It pains me to write this review. After the brilliant surprise hit of the first film, i was highly anticipating where the series would go next. Instead i found John Wick chapter 2 to be Incredibly disappointing. This film is a shining example that more doesn't equate to being better.<br/><br/>Despite the multiple amounts of gun fights and action sequences, they all blend from one set piece to another. There's no real fluidity or stand out moments except for the pencil scene, but even that felt more like fan service then originality. This is an Issue that crops up multiple times in the film. The action scenes in this film are again well shot and choreographed. They're also edited better then most action films of the last decade. Chad Stahelski and his stunt team deserve credit for delivering a competent, well shot action film.<br/><br/>The problem however is that it's nothing we haven't all ready seen from the first film. There's not a whole lot of difference other then the fact there are far too many action sequences that felt over the top in this film. They were so frequent the audience is barley given any time to process the moment. Whereas The first film had three main set pieces which all felt unique, with the first film building itself up to the central set piece of the film, the nightclub scene which was exhilarating and a joy to watch. There aren't any moments like that in this film, it just moves from one action scene to the next, and most action scenes aren't as engaging or given any payoff. The film also retains none of the humour or levity from it's predecessor, instead the film felt nastier and cynical.<br/><br/>The biggest complaint i have with this film though, was there was too much plot exposition and focus on the underworld element. The fact that nearly everyone in the city is somehow connected with the underworld was bordering on the ludicrous. This was a really cool element in the first film because it was kept in the background. The underworld felt mysterious and somewhat alluring, in this film it takes centre stage and takes a lot of focus away from the characterisation of John Wick.<br/><br/>The film was also missing any form of emotional attachment to John Wick. In the first film we were given a clear and precise emotional hook, that allowed the audience to feel guilt free and root for John, when he goes on his murderous quest for vengeance. In this film he's given no choice by the main antagonist that is played by Riccardo Scamarcio. Who's given no character development and felt incredibly dull. The side characters in the film, Ares(Ruby Rose) and Cassian(Common) are given more to do, and do a better job feeling like an actual threat to John. They both give terrific physical performances, and the film would of benefited far more if they were made the primary antagonists.<br/><br/>I went into this film with a lot of excitement after being blown away by how much fun i had with the first film. Unfortunately the director was unable to catch lightning in a bottle twice. There are good sequences in the film. Overall the film felt too self-indulgent. Whilst i respect the films ambition to be more then the sum of it parts, and blossom into a franchise that can go in many different directions with It's underworld development. This film felt too much of a set up for future films, TV series, spin-offs etc."

The film is a direct sequel to the original, taking place only hours later.

You don't really care about our main character because you don't know hardly anything about him and he is no longer driven by anger. And he isn't trying to fight his way out of an impossible situation, that is, until the second half. The biggest problems for me reside in the first hour of this film. Where we are left with nothing to care about or to be invested in.<br/><br/>It begins with a mindless action scene that is completely pointless to this film that lasts for nearly twenty minutes. This is shortly followed by nearly forty minutes of nothing. A character sits down with John, tells him general exposition that he already knows, and then moves onto the next person who does the same thing. It's nothing. The first hour of this film is about as close to nothing as an action film can get.<br/><br/>What's worse is that nearly thirty minutes of this first hour is literally worthless. There are countless scenes that go on for twice the length they should. Which mainly stems from characters just blatantly explaining things to the audience. Not only is it more interesting to tell a story through visuals but it's also less time consuming, but it actually takes some amount of effort.<br/><br/>I guess this film decided that the easy route was the best route because the film is nothing but sitting around and explaining everything. Each and every detail is spelled out for the audience, drawing the run time out thirty minutes too long. And when the action finally hits, it's dull. This is the final blow that the film dealt me before I gave up. There is an extended scene that takes place in an underground catacomb that is so poorly lit, it's actually impossible to see anything.<br/><br/>There is dust flying every which way, people running about, endless headshots, and it's all lit by a single light on the floor. It wasn't until some other assassin's tried to kill our hero that the film became interesting. From the point where Wick gets hit with a $7,000,000 contract on, the film is exactly what it should've been. A well lit, endless action scene that doesn't try to overstate things. And, guess what? We actually have a reason to care!<br/><br/>The moment Wick gets double crossed is the moment that we get invested in things. We like punishments to reflect actions. So when our main character gets double-crossed/stabbed in the back, we want to see justice served. Boom, a conflict we can care about. While the second half has its share of issues it's significantly improved just by giving us a reason to care. And, outside of the catacombs sequence, the action in the film is great. <br/><br/>It's everything you could reasonably expect. Well choreographed, shot in nice wides, and cut together with a decent sense of rhythm. The action just has a natural flow and brutality to it that it's hard not to praise. If there's only one thing to see the film for, it would be for the action. Specifically the last hour of said action. If you exclude the dull, lifeless, ugly first half (which you shouldn't) the film is a well-made action movie that delivers everything you could ever want. It just takes a while to get to that point."
"dmitryym","6","4","8","21 February 2017"," Great disappointment of a sequel
","Like most of the sequels, this one falls short on almost everything, except violence and body count.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first movie and honestly didn't expect any sequel at all until I saw its advertising on Facebook. Ever since I saw it I was excited and worried at the same time, since there is literally nothing to tell about in the sequel. I know how modern movie industry likes making money out of thin air and unfortunately I was right.<br/><br/>Just like with two Matrix sequels, this one is nothing like a moneymaker, thanks to its successful original movie. I went to watch because of that. No story, no characters, no sense in anything happening on the screen, except happy producers looking to feed us another junk in John Wick: Chapter three, where John will nuke the world.<br/><br/>First movie had a very simple story, which made sense. Despite the violence, it gave that weird satisfaction when bad guys were punished for thinking that they are untouchable and can take whatever they want, whenever they want. Similar to the first ""kick ass"" scene in ""Equalizer"" with Denzel Washington. John Wick just had to give them a lesson.<br/><br/>The second movie is nothing like it. Story just doesn't hold, Wick's refusal to fulfill his blood oath just doesn't make sense, like the rest of the movie. Too badÂ…<br/><br/>Action scenes look great, but far from being real. I would say that orcs are more real than John Wick's super suites that reflect EVERYTHING. There is no spoon Neo, it is all MatrixÂ… As I understand, there will be a third movie and I will watch it, just to see what they will come up with to make more money."
"fung0","5","5","11","10 June 2017"," Lame and Empty
","I really wanted to like this movie. I expected to like it. I actually did like a lot of things about it. But overall, I found it unimaginative, lifeless and boring. ""Non-stop action"" is simply not very exciting without a proper dramatic underpinning.<br/><br/>The framework is great. The mysterious criminal organization, the neutral zones where no combat is allowed, the gold coins that magically buy just about anything, the marker that forces Wick out of retirement (again), the Italian suit with a Kevlar lining... and, of course, Wick himself, the stone-faced, unkillable James Bond of the underworld.<br/><br/>And there are a few great scenes: the terse conversations between Wick and Ian McShane (who is always a pleasure to watch); the sepulchral confrontation between Wick and the lady mobster; Laurence Fishburn chewing up the scenery and clearly having a ball...<br/><br/>So much for about 15 minutes of the movie. The rest is incredibly tedious action, action, action. Action with no point, very little style and absolutely zero creativity.<br/><br/>The settings do vary, to be sure: a rock concert in an Italian ruin; dusty catacombs; a subway station and subway train; a highly improbable house-of-mirrors museum exhibit... But the action itself is both mindless and unforgivably repetitive. I started ticking off a handful of standard moves: Wick dropping to the floor; Wick grabbing an attacker's arm and using it to shoot another attacker; Wick somersaulting through a hail of bullets and then unerringly pegging an entire wave of attackers...<br/><br/>It IS possible to do a pure action-ballet type of movie - in the Hong Kong, John Woo mode - but the action has to be really, really GOOD. In Wick 2, the action is well-staged, but appallingly choreographed. It's also not rooted in any actual drama, so after a while it's very hard to care about yet another butchered bad guy.<br/><br/>Even the film's opening sequence is all wrong - about ten minutes of pure action with absolutely no dramatic justification. Classic car chases are rooted in characterization: The French Connection, Bullit, The Seven-Ups... What's the point of watching vehicles crash into each other before we even know who's driving them, or why?<br/><br/>Keanu Reaves and the supporting cast are all good. The camera work is fine. But there's no actual movie here. Recommendation: find something else to do with your two hours."
"imdb2-5","6","5","11","26 February 2017"," All style, no substance, no brains, yet watchable
","The fact that this movie has hit the IMDb's Top 250 shows what a joke film ratings have become. Let's be honest as to what this is - it's a wet dream for those into comic book like murder and violence. The story doesn't have to make sense. All that is required is a high body count, enough fast car chases and plenty of over the top weaponry.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple. Reeves is a former hit man who is retired. The man who is a ghost, unseen when he wants and has a will to survive that surpasses all. No one can stop him. In enters someone powerful who requires him to come out of retirement to make a hit. The problem is that he's dead if he says no and he's dead if he does the hit as he'll become a revenge target.<br/><br/>Problem that is not really a spoiler: Now if John Wick can be the Mechanic (Jason Statham) then no one need know Wick did the killing. And even if Wick does assassinate the victim, there is no need to leave a calling card. But this movie wouldn't continue in its plot unless a stupid twist is entered so that a massive shootout can occur and carry the movie to its next set of scenes.<br/><br/>I will admit that the film is completely watchable and far better than it could have been. But most of the lines are comic book stupid, the action is so over the top that it's clearly comic book fantasy and the body count goes into ludicrous mode - as does Wick's ability to nurse injuries that would have felled lesser Greek gods.<br/><br/>There is zero repeat value for this film. The actors all play their parts well. The sets are all that there are in this film, with very detailed choreographed fights, a stunning end set piece, eye popping saturated colors and imagery during the film and some style points. But this is a brain dead film. Don't say you weren't prepared going in."

","Sometimes I felt like I'm watching cutscenes from a first person shooter. Problem is, I played FPS games with better story. There are parts where I was like, ""wow, this is going to end up pretty bad very soon"". Well, John Wick seemed to ignore these signs, which makes him the world's dumbest assassin. He makes amateur mistakes without reason, he might do them on purpose, maybe he hates himself and he enjoys suffering subconciously. Or maybe the writers were simply terrible. After the hype train I expected the John Wick movies to be better than most vengeance films. Well, they are actually worse. It's killing, shooting, fighting all the way through, without any meaningful parts.

"Holt344","10","2","3","12 May 2019"," A worthy sequel that expands the storytelling and gives us a superb action movie
","A worthy sequel to one of my favorite action movies, the movie does everything as great as the predecessor but improves in the storytelling with a deeper look into the world of the Assassins and such. With John Wick being an assassin again we get to see him truly in action, from getting the equipment, planning and executing the plan, it's remarkable. Chad Stahelski's stunt and kung-fu background truly makes his vision and directing great as he knows what he is doing and with Derek Kolstad as the writer once again they helped to deliver an even greater movie in a much bigger scale and also keeping the same tone as the previous movie. This movie was a lot better the second time after I watched the first movie the day before I saw this one and I believe it's supposed to be watched that way.<br/><br/>The locations are stunning and just flows so good into the story and choreography, thinking mostly about the Rome sequence as that's some quality action sequence mixing suspense with crazy gun fu choreography.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast has many returning actors, everyone doing great work but the actors that stand out are Keanu Reeves, Riccardo Scamarcio, Ian McShane, Claudia Gerini and Common. The characters are just so well written, interesting and memorable and the actors plays them perfectly. Keanu Reeves is once again remarkable in the stunt section of the movie, doing 95% of the stunts and its amazing how talented he is."
"algernon-72259","3","2","3","23 March 2019"," For those who expect more than bloody killing, I do not recommend this movie.
","Keanu is as wooden as he always is, in addition to his stiff acting there is plenty of chases, plenty of bloody death scenes and ...
well, there is no more.
It can be watched but when you get bored with another bloody death (number 123 or 124) you can easily go to the kitchen and wash the dishes because when you come back after fifteen minutes the action will be in the same place i.e. - another bloody scene.
Summarising the movie is about the band of continuous bloody murders and it becomes boring, terribly boring very soon.
Besides, no one knows exactly why these murders are taking place.
I like brutal movies, but they must have sens, in this movie, there is no sense and logic.
Instead, there is a lot of shooting, killing and cutting off various body parts.
If one is passionate about such things, let's watch.
For those who expect more than this, I do not recommend this movie."
"chessnthisgalaxy","3","2","3","10 February 2019"," All Show, No Substance
","This movie aspires to be a video game. It shows a man trying to get from point A to point B while killing any person who stands in his way. In this regard, it mimics the features of an assassin video game very well. If that's your thing, you'll probably enjoy this movie. You'll enjoy the photography, the props, the sets, the lighting and the action sequences.<br/><br/>But as a narrative film, the Wick films are some of the worst drivel to ever make it through the production process. The scenarios are cartoonishly detached from any social logic, characters are one-dimensional puppets, and almost every line of dialogue is cringe-worthy nonsense. The word ""preposterous"" doesn't quite capture just how absurd these films are.<br/><br/>The success of these films is a puzzle fit for an oracle. There are media more appropriate for the Wick murder rituals, like video game platforms. Who knows, maybe ""horrible film"" is now a kind of post-millennial genre."
"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","2","3","8 February 2019"," The quintessential pure bad-ass action sequel ever made one of my personal favorite action movies
","What can I say about the movie that was already said I had a pleasure to watching this movie on Blu-ray disc again. It is a quintessential pure bad-ass action sequel ever made in my opinion. I love the first original movie but John Wick Chapter 2 I love to death more than the first one. I would put this movie right with The Raid 2: Berandal. John Wick Chapter 2 is my personal favorite action sequel of all time, that I love it more than the original. This a fast paced entertaining action packed sequel. I am big fan of Keanu Reeves I Love, Love, Love this film to death. It is an entertaining one man army against of all assassins. The film made 40 million budget and 92 million dollars in the US. improvement over the first movie<br/><br/>Chad Stahelski returned to direct this action packed film and he directed well both of the films I enjoy and love. Keanu Reeves returns as John Wick and the role is written on his skin. Keanu Reeves is excellent as John Wick his best character he ever played who is written on his skin. I think it is Keanu's best performance since The Matrix, Speed, Constantine and Street Kings (John Wick is a new action kick-ass bad-ass action hero.) Like is said I would put John Wick 1 and 2 with The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, The Raid 1 and 2 and Rambo movies because those 2 John Wick movies are my favorite action films of all time.<br/><br/>I love this film I love one man army movies and this is one man-army movie easily my personal favorite film in 2017 and I don't understand the criticism and the hate for this film or the first one. Today we don't see such a good action movies like we had in 80's and 90's. It is rated R most bloody action film there are body's every where. Bad-ass martial arts in the film bad-ass action ever.<br/><br/>Here are the reasons to watch this film: A female violinist in the subway pulls out a gun from the violin and tries to kill John, but he subdues her and breaks her neck. A heavyset Asian man goes after John and gets his brains blown out. Two men in the subway try to get in on it, and John brutally kills them with a PENCIL. Cassian finds John as he gets on the subway and fights him in the train. John stabs Cassian and pushes the knife into his aorta. He tells Cassian that if he pulls the knife out, he will bleed to death. John leaves Cassian on the subway. Those are my favorite scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>I love John Wick's dog more in the first film than the first one, yes I am an animal lover and Keanu said the dog was trained to obey everything Keanu said. I have a 6 year old white dog Rick at home who I love very much and yes it is a she and she obeys me very much. I love the bond between John Wick and his new dog I love those two on the end running together.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves, Common, Laurence Fishburne, Riccardo Scamarcio, Ruby Rose, John Leguizamo, Peter Stormare, Claudia Gerini and Ian McShane did all a good job in the movie. I care about this characters more than I did in the first one.<br/><br/>Why I love this film? Because you have a bad-ass elite of assassins trying to kill John Wick: A female violinist, A heavyset Asian man who looks like sumo wrestler, Cassian and of course Ares (Ruby Rose) the bodyguard and top assassin of Santino D'Antonio. I am not going to say that Ruby Rose was better assassin than Adrianne Palicki I disagree I love Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins more than Ares Ruby Rose that is my opinion. Santino D'Antonio (Ian McShane) was a memorable bad guy.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves, Common and Laurence Fishburne all reunited again for this sequel. Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne co-started together in The Matrix Trilogy and Keanu Reeves and Common co-started in Street Kings.<br/><br/>John Wick Chapter 2 is a quintessential pure bad-ass action sequel ever made and satisfying action movie an absolute must-watch for all action fans."

","Thought i should watch it because everyone knows john wick, but i never saw one of his movies.
Its definetly well made but the plot is just a bit too much. Basically no one can kill John Wick and even if they have the chance to just kill him, they rather do some unnecassary stuff that leads to John escaping or killing them. There are no consequences such as police or something so he can do what ever he wants like killing many people without anyone caring. No one can shoot straight, easy to hit bullets besides john wick and even he sometimes decides to not use his gun and get in long unnecessary fights instead of just shooting them. The whole time there is no threat for him cause everyone besides him cant aim straight.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is just super boring to watch because he is basically invincible."

","John Wick Chapter 2 is one of those rare sequels that might just top the first. Where many sequels fail by trying to do too much and losing the very elements that made the original loved, Chapter 2 succeeds by taking those elements and fine tuning them into a visual feast for the eyes. Every single shot is thought out to the finest detail and it shows because this film is downright beautiful, despite the dark and violent overtones. We get thrown a bit deeper into the fascinating underworld of the Continental and its crew of assassins and this second installment does answer a few questions from the original, but also poses even more leaving the potential for sequels and spinoffs wide open. Much like the first, Chapter 2 is a film where the dialogue is minimal but effective. The few words that are said perfectly convey the mysterious tone of the movie and move the story along. This is a world I would not mind seeing a lot more of. Assuming, of course, that it is handled with the care and precision that director Chad Stahelski has graced this entry with."

If something (be it movies/shows/books) doesn't grab me straight off - I just move on to something else. Life is too short to be bothered with slow/boring stuff in my opinion although there ARE good slow stuff too, like incredibly enough I quite like the bbc show Vera (u may disagree) and the excellent Shetland and also Hinterland all of which I love. But I think there are loads of bad AND boring but also STUPID stuff being made today in 2019. Slow/boring/stupid is different for everyone I imagine. Anyhoo.
I have watched John Wick 2 like 4 times since it came out. And it just blows me away every time I see it. OF COURSE its cheesy and exaggerated and BLISSFULLY unrealistic. But its beautifully made. And the action is pumping, AND - INTERESTING - dont know why - it just is. The people making this movie just knows their stuff. Keanu is PERFECT in the role. MANY times have I thaught in recent films that THAT guy/gal is wrongly cast for a role.. example: Miss Peregrine & her home for peculiar children. Samuel L Jackson as the villain ?? That just almost killed that film for me (not to mention him as Nick Fury ?? - I have read marvel comics since I was a toddler....fyi - Nick Fury was a white guy) - oh that and the music when they fight the pirates... omg. Apart from these two flaws that movie was magical and awesome. Love almost all Tim Burton films.
Anyway - I,m getting sidetracked. sorry. John Wick2 is like a really cool adventure - just a guy - getting into stuff and killing people. And the assassin-hotel thing is just COOL. The ending of the movie ?? In my humble opinion the most perfect ending EVER. A film I will enjoy from time to time - and thats AWESOME, because this IS a film one can watch over and over again, and THAT is a cool thing indeed. Love it !"

The fighting choreography is done very well becoz it is not very choppy like in other films it is shown in a continuous tone.

","Although seeing John Wick #1 isn't essential, it'll probably be helpful to the viewer. Wick, a retired hitman, is called back to service to exact revenge for the theft of his car and the killing of his new puppy. In the sequel, he finds that a bounty has been placed on his head and that he owes a Bad Guy for assistance rendered in the past. This leads Mr. Wick into another flurry of murderous rage. As with its predecessor, the plot is pretty easy to follow, and some familiar characters appear. As usual, it's the fight choreography that's the main draw, with a lot of terrific action sequences involving not just gunplay but plenty of hand-to-hand combat. John Wick #2 might not pack the emotional punch of the original, but it makes up for it with some fine supporting performances by Laurence Fishburne, Common, and Ian McShane. You might feel a little punchy yourself after watching what poor Mr. Wick goes through."
"kluseba","7","1","1","28 February 2019"," Hitman on steroids
","John Wick: Chapter 2 is both one of the few action movies that actually has a reason to exist and that can compete with its predecessor. The former is confirmed since the titular main character has killed so many criminals in the predecessor that he has become public enemy number one which is the central plot element of this film. The latter is underlined by this film's similarly straight pace, pitiless action sequences and cool acting performances which make the transition between the two films very smooth. I would actually recommend watching the entire trilogy back to back since the films take place over a few days in the life of professional assassin John Wick.<br/><br/>Just like its predecessor, this movie obviously doesn't feature an intriguing plot. However, it expands the universe of John Wick as well as his associates and competitors. It gives us more details about the lead character's impressive reputation and explores his life before his initial retirement. The film adds a few new characters such as a shady crime lord played by Riccardo Scamarcio and an enigmatic underground cult figure who controls a large network of homeless gangsters incarnated by Laurence Fishburne. The film also introduces new spectacular locations such as a stealthy infiltration sequence to assassinate a powerful woman at the heart of Rome.<br/><br/>To keep it short, this sequel is as good as its predecessor and offers a whopping two hours of passionate action with spectacular locations, cool characters and some interesting background stories. This approach makes me think of a fast-paced video game like Hitman on steroids. The John Wick franchise doesn't reinvent its genre but offers unpretentious fun for fans of gritty action films for adults."
"classicsoncall","7","1","1","14 September 2018"," ""No one gets out and comes back without repercussions.""
","No doubt about it, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a slick action thriller, but man, oh man, how can any one person absorb that kind of punishment? John (Keanu Reeves) gets shot, stabbed and hit by cars multiple times and postures a limp now and then to indicate he might have gotten just a little bit hurt. Besides that, he almost never makes a wrong move when hunted by dozens of assassins all at the same time. Okay, I get it, Reeves is the star of the picture and has to come out on top, but I'd like a little more credibility put into these kinds of stories. But I guess that's the whole point, suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with all of the over the top action the film makers can put together.<br/><br/>I do have to say that the opening scene of the brightly lit downtown Manhattan cityscape was about the finest cinematography you can hope to come up with just about anywhere. The picture maintained that same high level of consistency with the sleek settings and the richly detailed environs of The Continental. I also like the entire idea of this particular mob having a code that's inviolate, even for someone like Wick who crossed the line by taking out Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) on Continental grounds. Ian McShane's Winston had a nice way of putting things in perspective for Wick to show him that the repercussions weren't going to be personal. After all, rules are rules.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was the hit on Gianna D'Antonio (Claudia Gerini), not so much for the bullet to her head, but for the way she took control to demonstrate she would die on her own terms and not her brother's. That was really quite a remarkable and original scene that makes the film more memorable for me than it otherwise might have been. <br/><br/>Anyway, for a film with a cast of thousands who are either hit men or getting killed themselves, this is quite the adrenaline rush. Again, I emphasize that if that's what you want when you come to a picture like this, then Wick Two delivers in spades. And with the unequivocal ending, Wick 3 ought to escalate the body count exponentially."

What I fail to understand was the unneeded femme fatale character like in the first Wick movie that has no character build-up or back story. Who is she? All I could gauge was she's a smartass with the intimidating physical attributes of a 13- year old child and yet we wait through her hiding behind every other bad guy he could possibly fight/kill to die first for the ending and for her to be taken out as easily as well...fighting a child should take.<br/><br/>At least they didn't make it as painful as it could have been and had her actually give him a real scare for his life like everyone with clue knew would be more fantasy than him killing a guy with a pencil through the back of the head. Why is it these movie always have to have a character like this who after dealing with real imposing and capable bad asses the whole time, being giving either a chauffeured villain who's been pampered his whole life and who's blood is half crème fraîche, or a 85 lb sexy hot (but with attitude of course) woman who even if her ninja like, cat quick reflexes were all that, couldn't kill a fly with a round house kick to it's cranium, to fight?<br/><br/>I mean; I realize all of it is fantasy and Wick realistically should have died 5 minutes into the first movie, and having a tough gal with a great ass is somehow mandatory now for flicks like this anymore, but my intelligence would have been less insulted if the movie was about a dwarf woman who wanted to play Inside LB for the Bears and got the start after she proved she could get to the QB and chew on his calf with her wicked smarts and hard to catch elusiveness that her pet ferret taught her. Enough already. If they simply must (new SAG law) have to employ a woman in the role of ""tougher than 99% of the men"" in flicks like this, can they at least make her somewhat believable physically?"

"LongLiveTheNewFlesh27","6","1","1","27 August 2017"," A bit disappointing
","I was excited for John Wick: Chapter 2. The first 2014 film was a action film for people who don't like action films, or at least what they've turned into in recent years. The story was reminiscent of a Clint Eastwood western: A man has something taken from him by some bad men, and now it's time for him to take something from them (probably their lives). It was stripped down and minimalistic, while also managing to pull off some epic, bone-crunching action scenes that were, mercifully, spared of the shaky cam treatment. John Wick: Chapter 2 has many of these things. The action scenes are arguably better. Keanu Reeves brings the same energy and force that made him the perfect protagonist in the first film. The stylistic influences range from the films of Jean Pierre Melville to Westerns to Enter the Dragon and even Buster Keaton (a couple of frames into the film you'll understand what I mean). All of this and yet it's so much more disjointed. The first film knew what it was. It was a lean, mean, stylish, gritty action thriller. The world building wasn't heaped on. It didn't feel necessary to the plot but instead it felt like the icing on an already tasty cake. Chapter 2 takes the world of John Wick and makes expanding on it one of the key issues of the film. Admittedly, the world is pretty interesting (but do I really need to know where John Wick gets his suits tailored, though?), but the story is lacking because of it. In the first film, no spoilers here, but anybody who saw that movie knows that John had a clear motivation for doing what he was doing. In Chapter 2, the motivation feels lackluster. Therefore, even if the action sequences are the reason why the word ""epic"" was invented, you feel less involved in his revenge. One of the first things a revenge film has to do is get you on the side of the avenger. With the added problem of a weak villain, John Wick: Chapter 2 has a rough time doing that. The film's other major problem is a lack of character drive. Wick seems to be stumbling through the scenarios, figuratively of course (he could eat a bowl of Fruit Loops and make it look slick), but we never see a clear vision of what he wants and what inside of him he's fighting against to get there. We see the external problems: he's being roped into something he doesn't want to do under threat of death, Common is gunning for him, he needs to convince Laurence Fishburne and his hobo-assassin league to help him. But we don't have that same drive from the first movie. He doesn't want to get out of retirement, but he has to have his revenge, and in the end, does he really want to be retired? In a way, Chapter 2, as over-bloated as it is, is more stripped down the the first film, as Wick barely grapples with any of the internal dilemmas that were the undercurrent to his character in the first film. In the end, Chapter 2 is a stylish and entertaining film, and comparatively with most sequels, it's more than we could have possibly wished for. Just be aware, it works almost entirely on the surface level. Imagine Bret Easton Ellis and John Woo teamed up to make a James Bond film and somehow it turned out to be a sequel to John Wick. Fun, but no so much fun."
"johnmkirby","3","1","1","7 August 2017"," Ruined by unrealistic fight (gun) scenes
","The movie is certainly fast-paced with lots of action. But the movie completely lost me when John Wick just kept shooting the bad guys at will. The bad guys could not aim, and moreover they just sort of moved like zombies, allowing Wick to easily shoot, punch, stab, kick them one-by-one. All they had to do was to attack Wick simultaneously, or to simply lay in wait (rather than wobbling out in front of Wick in slow-motion saying ""please shoot me in the head""). This was taken to the extreme in this movie. And then there is the fact that Wick is unfazed by a stab-wound, getting hit by a car etc. He does not even take time to heal before moving onto the next killing spree. Movies don't have to match the real world -- but they should have some vague similarity to it."
"msbreviews","6","1","1","6 August 2017"," Rating: B-
","When someone spells the word ""sequel"" my body starts shaking. I have so many problems with this type of movies that only exist to make money and not to actually be a good movie. Even if John Wick: Chapter 2 started as one of these films, it's able to break the curse and become a fairly good sequel.<br/><br/>There's twice the action of the first one and it's twice as good. The hand-to-hand combat is amazing and if you've seen the behind- the-scenes videos that went viral, then you know how happy I was watching those one-take masterpieces. Keanu Reeves might be the best actor alive to actually do his own stunts. Even the cheesy script works for him because ... Well, he's f*cking Keanu Reeves!<br/><br/>I also loved the exploration of the assassin's institution. Throughout the second act, it's shown several ""safe houses"" and rules by which the killers live by. The pacing drops down, which is a problem, but it's mostly fine since the story is interesting enough for us to be captivated. Just not enough for a whole second act about it.<br/><br/>However, the first film is far better than this one. John Wick was a big surprise in 2014, no one thought it would be any good, so a lot of the scenes were great because we're not expecting them. John Wick: Chapter 2 has those same scenes and it doesn't have the same impact (it made me yawn at some points).<br/><br/>The motivation for John Wick to go back to business is forced and not emotional (as it was in the first film), which I can accept ... Until the end. The ending doesn't make any sense to me, it's only done this way in order to have a trilogy. Keanu Reeves' character changes his personality and his whole attachment to emotions because ... Well, because the studio wants three movies.<br/><br/>The script is super cheesy and it could have ruined the movie if not for Keanu Reeves' brilliant acting. The work that he puts into this character shows up on the screen and I felt it. He carried this whole thing. The rest of the cast did their job pretty well, with major praise to Laurence Fishburne, he's just great.<br/><br/>Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a good movie. It has those brutal, man-to-man one-take action scenes that blow my mind every single time. The story around the institution is interesting to some point, but the slow pacing throughout it took me off a little. The script is cheesy, but Keanu Reeves' makes it work. I don't buy the ending, it's only that way in order to have a trilogy and John Wick's motivations to come back are too forced and not as emotional as the first time, which contradicts the character's personality.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"
"Wikingking","4","1","1","20 July 2017"," I felt nothing...
","John Wick 1 wasn't my favourite film, even though I have an unhealthy attachment to nice kills on-screen more so if those kills are head-shots. :) But it did the trick and although I've only seen it once, it was still good enough to bring me to it's sequel, Chapter 2.<br/><br/>Well, this movie surely won't get me to a possible 3rd act. This is a mess, really. Only the first sequence of the movie is worthy of the hype around JW and his character. That was nice. But the rest is dumb, boring, repetitive and is without any kind of excitement or whatsoever.<br/><br/>John Wick gets hit, stabbed, ran over, punched, kicked, thrown so many times I lost counting around mid-time of the movie. I just can't take it seriously and that is OK, but only if the film makes it up on another field. For example I truly don't care about such things while watching Fast and Furious or a new Mission Impossible movie. But in John Wick it is really the only redeeming factor that there are many, a lot of, I mean a huge number of kills. That's that. It's a one trick pony. And while flicks like Shoot 'em up! did such a great job to make it entertaining this is like a conveyor belt of head-shots. Enemies just keep coming as if it was some kind of lame arcade video game. No tactics, nothing. John is immortal. Also, no one cares about anything anymore, although theoretically he still has that ""devil incarnate"" kind of reputation, but everyone try their luck anyways.<br/><br/>John Wick 2 is like the 2nd Matrix or PotC movie (but it's a long list): head-shots and style sold the first movie so the production team tried to put twice as many into this movie, but it all became dumb, dull and fake. This movie is like a fake Chinese (sorry...) copy of the first, where the casing and the looks are pretty much the same, but efficiency and reliability is much worse.<br/><br/>Also, I'm quite fed up with immortal, god-like leads. Can Hollywood come up with anything else other than these guys, where any lack of logic or reason are being 'explained' by him being inhumanly good and no one can make harm to them. Jason Bourne, the Transporter, John Wick and countless others since Rambo and John Matrix. And every new guy has less and less personality and originality..."

John Wick kills a couple of guys with a pencil . It's brilliant , especially the fights"" <br/><br/>I did reply that I'd seen the previous film which featured an over the top fight sequence in a nightclub <br/><br/>""It's just like that Theo , except it's like that all the way through. The whole film"" <br/><br/>Sarah interceded and said it was a good film and I should watch it first chance I get. It is somewhat dubious recommending a movie to someone due to the high body count including a couple of deaths via pencil but Scorsese can get away with it and anything is better than the recent Iranian New Wave cinema I've been watching recently. On top of that the first thing I did when I got home was collapse on to the couch for a couple hours . When people show you such hospitality the least you can do is catch up on movie recommendations <br/><br/>!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!! <br/><br/>This sequel builds up the backstory hinted at in the first film . Apparently there's a criminal Illuminati and these people don't take no for an answer . They also don't take ""I've retired"" when an oath is given so when John Wick says ""No thank you I've retired"" that leads to a cashflow problem amongst other things <br/><br/>As was described to me this is a very violent OTT thriller. Everything is magnified and the nightclub shoot-out in the first film is a pillow fight compared to this one and Keanu Reeves is in full blown THE MATRIX mode. It's all good clean fun because the Illuminati are keeping it to themselves and the action is so overdone that despite it being fairly graphic with headshots etc there is little reality to this <br/><br/>Despite this there's scenes that don't make the slightest bit of sense from a logical point of view. Pitched gunbattles take place with bodies piling up yet no police appear and people walk nonchalantly by a few yards away. This is summed up by a scene in a tube station where two characters surreptitously fire pistols with silencers amongst a crowd and no one notices what is going on <br/><br/>The story builds up in such away that it's difficult to believe that the illogical mechanics of the plot turns aren't deliberate . Then when the film reaches its climax involving a dialogue scene between Wick and Winston there's a scene that will have you gasping ""How would that happen in real life ?"" That's because I find it impossible to believe it is taking place in the real world and the third film in the trilogy will reveal itself to be either a meta-fictional movie commentating on cinema violence or it's set in a virtual world similar to THE MATRIX. In fact there's so many references to THE MATRIX it might actually be a reboot/remake and the studio have delayed announcing this until after JW3 is released. That's my prediction"

"bob the moo","Null","4","10","1 July 2017"," Slick, but I was detached in a way I wasn't in the first film
","The first John Wick film took me by surprise; it was a cartoonish action film that was surprisingly brutal in its content, cruel in its delivery, and had a real punch to it. All of it existed inside a world that convinced in its own logic, even if it was clearly fantasy. John Wick 2 doesn't have the ability to sneak up on me unannounced, which does work against it, but this is not what hurts it the most.<br/><br/>The second chapter of what at least looks like being a trilogy, is slick and very well put together. The locations are brilliant (whether a roof garden or a larger location), the fight scenes have great choreography, and after a slow first 20 minutes it does have a great pace. But yet I found myself watching it much more passively than I had with the first film. This sense of being detached came from a couple of places. The first was that the plot did not seem as organic as the first – the violence that draws Wick deeper seems to occur just for the sake of making the film happen (which is of course true, but it doesn't try to hide it). This reduces the investment and stakes, so rather than being drawn in, I just sort of accepted it because I know where it was going.<br/><br/>The second thing that kept me out of it was related to this lack of investment – which is that the film's lack of realism is all the stark. I do not mean that the film needed to be a kitchen-sink drama, but rather that the film cannot sell this world to the viewer. In the first I could go with this shadowy world on the edges of ours, with the idea that it developed its own rules and norms; here though it seems everyone is a hired killer, and those in charge have total power and huge organizational skills. The use of this doesn't seem worth the cost of doing such things – for instance suggesting everyone in a massive crowd is in the employment of one person and can act with the slightest nod just seemed silly and not to add value. This excess infects the action – it is overblown but could have been strong enough to engage had it not been that the majority of the film is so silly in how it works. I read Theo Robertson's user comment on this one and I think he nailed it when he said that the film could easily be in the Matrix universe – at least this would make the nonsense here ring true.<br/><br/>This limits the film, but doesn't stop it being enjoyable. The action is slick and consistent, the style and gloss of all the moments are enjoyable, and the starry cast are mostly pretty good. Reeves is good value and does great physical work, and the supporting cast has plenty of famous faces – although some of them are distracted by their volume, or by virtue of not being well used (Fishburne is probably the one that we could have done without). So JW2 is a slick action flick, but not as good as the first film, nor as good as everyone tells you it is. The ending suggests the third film will be on an even bigger scale, with Wick literally taking on the whole world, which will probably only serve to remind me how good the first one was when it was one man seeking revenge on another for the death of his dog."

","Keanu Reeves's tragedy-stricken, stoic, ruthless ex-hit-man John Wick returns after decimating the world of organised Russian crime in 2014's 'John Wick' with a sequel that takes everything that made the first film such a surprise hit and expands upon it in gleeful fashion. The film follows the precise expert as he navigates through various reactions to his exploits in the first film, and retains the realistic-feeling, expertly-choreographed action that so benefited the first.<br/><br/>The film is essentially the definition of 'turn your brain off' entertainment, and is sure to be the standard for low-maintenance action films that people can turn on and enjoy without engaging themselves too much. This is of course what made the original film so good, and the proposed sequels now have a good formula to build upon, combined with an interesting world of hit men and a reliable main character.<br/><br/>Overall there is nothing incredibly special about John Wick 2, and nor would there ever be.

You get to see how a man could be killed by just a pencil. How one could kill member of high table with just seven rounds. Zillions of assassinations. <br/><br/>The dialogues are just freaking awesome. Didn't waste a single word for nonsense. It shows how actions could speak louder than words.

","After all that has happened in the previous movie John's car is a wreck. Not to worry a friend of his will get it fixed by Christmas 2030? Meanwhile John gets an offer he should not refuse.

Yeah you guessed he is out for revenge, AGAIN. Expectations were low.<br/><br/>This time however the action gets bizarre and it works in the movie's favor. No nudity but this woman (House wrecker's sister, John Wick's contract) wanted to die in her own way of her own choosing. She strips and gets in a Jacuzzi. She cuts her arteries or veins, whatever but John shoots her anyway. He wanted the credit though he did not want to do any killing to begin with. Her bodyguard (Common) tries to avenge her. <br/><br/>AGAIN they get caught fighting in the Continental but you know the rules. NO FIGHTING in the Continental.

","Many say that John Wick revived the Career of one Keanu Reeves, but I beg to differ. Reeves star has never waned since he went on an excellent adventure with Alex Winter (remember him?).<br/><br/>Reeves is a bonafide movie star, and like To, Cruise and Tom Hanks, he could star in as many bombs he liked, his name will always attract attention and interest.<br/><br/>John Wick revived the action genre, and ironically assassinated the plethora of those awful watered down 12a/pg-13 movies that were slew around the cinemas, and then released as a harder extended cut to accumulate more money from people who want that extra two minutes of a knife going into a leg.<br/><br/>JW 2 starts as it means to go on, it's an unbelievable film, with action choreography that an eighties John Woo would be envious. There were times during some of the amazing set pieces were I was thinking to myself 'I bet Reeves is cream crackered!' But no he's like the energiser bunny in this.<br/><br/>The plot is your perfunctory of the best wanting to get out of the game, nut he has one last job. Something happens and Wick ends up with a contract of his own.<br/><br/>And this is a genius move from the film makers.<br/><br/>There are times when the film feels like Invasion Of The Body Snatchers for Wick, because there is an instant where he begins to suspect literally everybody in the scene, and it's quite the intense moment.<br/><br/>Reeves is fantastic, he's a great physical actor, and though many feel that he isn't the best actor in the world, he holds the screen, and you realise just how much work and effort he's put into this film.<br/><br/>The support is great, there are references The Matrix, Enter The Dragon (if you've seen that, you'll know exactly the scene I'm referring to), and it's just so beautifully lit, like the scene in Skyfall where Bond follows the assassin into the skyscraper, almost making the film psychedelia mixed with a little Kubrickian nod whenever Wick is in the hotel, especially when he's buying his guns.<br/><br/>There is also one amazing scene where Common is following Wick, and they are taking silenced pot shots at each other in a busy tube station. The camera work is wonderful, it's almost as if De Palma was called in for a couple of shots<br/><br/>My gripe is that the film is slightly too long, but there are just so many positives in this sequel, you really can't complain that much.<br/><br/>Roll on Chapter 3"

","John Wick Chapter 2 is a film with many flaws: uninteresting, uncharismatic villains; a lumbering story; been there, done that shootouts; a boringly picturesque backdrop (Rome).

","Living in Australia, it was greatly delayed here and almost sent straight to DVD, so I was very happy when I heard it was being released in cinemas here. I loved the first John Wick, for me it was a film that came out of nowhere and brought with it great Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, shooting and driving action, a main character with driving force, and a universe that I wanted to know more about (from the Continental to the gold coins used as currency). <br/><br/>This is where John Wick: Chapter 2 came in. For me, it was a sequel that surpassed the first film by taking the things from the first film and making them greater. Villains still fear his name, John drives, shoots, Jiu-Jitsu's and Judo's his way from A to B whilst giving us an expanding glimpse into the John Wick underworld. A deeper look into the Continental, The High Table & the introduction of The Bowery King (making me particularly excited being a Matrix fan and seeing the reunification of Reeves and Fishburne).<br/><br/>All this and the fact that Keanu was virtually trained like one of the stunt men for this film, doing most of the stunts aside from a select few, John Wick: Chapter 2 is an enjoyable ride from beginning to end. I more than look forward to the third and what I presume to be the final chapter in the John Wick franchise. I have high hopes for the final film of this killer franchise."

","I love me a bit of the old ultra-violence, but I also like a plot of some kind to go with all of the gunfire, blood and broken bones. Failing that, the gory mayhem had better be something special - something that breaks new ground in terms of action cinema. John Wick Chapter 2 is relentlessly violent, Keanu Reeves' eponymous hitman laying waste to almost everyone he crosses paths with, once again finishing most victims with a shot to the head, but the action is simply more of the same, director Chad Stahelski bringing nothing new to the table.<br/><br/>This sequel sees Wick being forced out of retirement to honour a 'marker', criminal Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) calling upon the quasi-mythical hitman to repay his debt by assassinating his sister Gianna D'Antonio. Wick refuses, which results in his house being burnt down and his life being put on the line. Realising that he will only ever have peace if he agrees to Santino's request, Wick kills Gianna, and massacres her henchmen; however, in order to tie up any loose ends, Santino double-crosses John, putting out a contract on him. Now Wick has to battle lots of other hitmen and women. Luckily for him, they're all rubbish and easily killed. Miffed at being betrayed, John goes after Santino, meaning that he has to fight even more gunmen, but they're all a bit rubbish too. Wick gets shot in the gut and stabbed in the leg in the process, but is able to shrug off the pain, continuing to cut a bloody swathe through the bad guys to get to his target.<br/><br/>If kick, punch, blam, blam, blam is all you want for 2 hours, with very little variation in style, lots of CGI blood, and nothing to tax the brain, then have at it - it's not unwatchable, just unremarkable. To his credit, Stahelski ends the film well by nicely setting up things for a third film. I just hope he doesn't give us the same thing all over again (Chapter 2 even repeats the novelty subtitles that I found so irritating in the first film)."

","I just finished watch John Wick Chapter 3 - Parabellum and decided to look at the reviews for that movie on IMDb. It seems a lot of people on here loved Chapters 1 and 2 but said that this one had too much bland action and not enough story, and the story that is there seems contrived and just pointless. Now, let's just clear this up. All 3 movies had a very simple and contrived story that were just an excuse to watch John Wick kill a bunch of people. It's very obvious and I really had no problem with that. What I loved so much about the first one was how much John Wick was respected and revered. Even the mob boss whose son John was trying to kill had a lot of respect and fear of John Wick. None of that is here. Everyone in this underground world of hitmen has no problem trying to take on John Wick. No one is afraid of him. Also, I'm kind of on the fence about the action in both chapters 1 and 2. A lot of the action in all 3 movies seems a bit farfetched but at least in chapter 1 it was somewhat believable. Chapters 2 and 3 suffered from the same issue. There are scenes where John is surrounded by enemies, a lot of times enemies holding guns, yet he manages to kill every last one of them without getting shot or killed. There are times in this movie and especially in Chapter 3 where you can clearly see ""bad guys"" standing there waiting for John to finish fighting one of their comrades before they decide to try and shoot at him or try to kill him when, obviously in the real world, they would attack him while he's distracted by someone else. It just makes it really hard to believe and breaks the immersion. Overall, I think chapters 2 and 3 are entertaining but not very immersive."

","Review:
'John Wick: Chapter 2' is a neo-noir action film directed by Chad Stahelski. It is the second installment in the 'John Wick' film series.
A film with more headshots than words spoken, John Wick: Chapter 2 is just about the most violent film I've seen in quite some time. But it knows exactly what it wants to do and succeeds immensely.
The plot follows hitman John Wick (Keanu Reeves), who goes on the run after a bounty is placed on him.
Keanu Reeves isn't the best of actors working today, and I don't think he would disagree with that statement. But he's without a doubt one of the most committed actors out there. There's no more than a few pages of total spoken dialogue throughout the movie, and Reeves has probably a maximum of 30 lines, all of which aren't necessarily delivered as well as they should be. But it doesn't ultimately matter. He still does what he sets out to do.
It was bloodier, more fighting, more assassins and longer run time. What I can say is this is an even better version than the original movie. Although in term of story, there is a bit of a more complexity in the sequel as opposed to the simplicity of the original movie.
Overall, this movie didn't have a good of a story as the first film. However, the action sequences were breathtaking and very well choreographed.
3.5/5"
"ronakkotian","8","0","0","4 January 2020"," It gets more intense and brutal
","I love the first John Wick. It had such a simple premise and presented itself better than majority of the action films nowadays. John Wick: Chapter 2 expands on its universe which pushes the boundary of realism.<br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2 continues the story of John Wick who is forced to pay a debt that leads to a bounty put on his head.<br/><br/>What really stood out in the first installment was the presentation of its action. Never have I seen action this well choreographed and shot in an action film before and Chapter 2 builds on the action and stunts further to make this as enjoyable as the first one. The action in this film is as entertaining as it is violent. This is one of the bloodiest films in the last few years but at the same time it gets your blood pumping. The testosterone part of me just gets excited whenever I see John Wick fight. Whilst the story could be improved, the action is practically perfect.<br/><br/>Aside from the action, the first John Wick had a story with depth to it and a great motivation for John Wick to come out of his retirement. This one focuses more on the world John Wick takes place in and once you learn more about how this assassins-filled world works, the film becomes more intense and fascinating to watch. However, Derek Kolstad went a bit too far as the universe seems too unrealistic. At the end it's shown how a lot of people are involved with this system and I personally found it hard to believe that this many people were assassins.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is practically John Wick at this point. You simply can't deny this man's commitment towards the action scenes. All the other cast members like Ian McShane, Riccado Scamarcio and Laurence Fishburne are also fun to watch.<br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2 manages to increase the intensity with phenomenal action scenes and unveiling a world that keeps your interest piqued. Despite the universe's unrealistic nature, this is a strong action film that any action lover would not turn down."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2 is an action movie that premiered in 2017. The movie is the sequel to 2014's John Wick. The movie is directed by Chad Stahelski, produced by Basil Iwanyk, and Erica Lee, written by Derek Kolstad, and stars Keanu Reeves. The movie takes place a few days after the end of John Wick and continues following the story.<br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2 is a strong follow-up to the first John Wick movie. There is more of the same awesome set-pieces and action moments in this movie that were present in the first movie. The pieces are overall improved and even nicer to look at from a production view. The movie is also much better directed than the first movie with the movie being gorgeous to see during the set pieces. If audiences watch John Wick: Chapter 2 for only the action, they will be excited to see how every single action scene plays out.<br/><br/>The sequel is also much improved on the story and world. The second chapter in the John Wick franchise actually expands more on the culture and world of the assassins. The traditions that were discovered by the audience in the first movie continue here and overall it creates a consistent experience for the viewer. This world does come into play in this movie and it forces John Wick to act. One of the ways the movie is propelled by Santino D'Antonio utilizing a blood marker to get John Wick back into the game. This puts the entire events of the movie into motion as John Wick is forced to execute Santino's orders until the blood marker is fulfilled.<br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2's faults may lie entirely in its plot. John Wick is forced to act completely at the whim of Santino D'Antonio. The plot can feel incredibly forced after the ending of John Wick since the story only continues without any lingering plot threads. Chapter 2 has enough to get people interested in the world to be interested in the movie. There is more mention of the assassin's organization and how deep the entire organization goes. The movie does get more unbelievable towards the end when John Wick becomes excommunicated. John Wick is suddenly surrounded by assassins that want his contract. The ending is a grand spectacle, but it seems unlikely that so many people are assassins.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'John Wick: Chapter 2'. The movie is a solid follow-up to John Wick.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","No trait is more justified than revenge in the right time and place. - Meir Kahane<br/><br/>As the late singer Jim Croce said, ""You don't tug on Superman's cape, you don't spit into the wind, you don't pull the mask off the old Lone Ranger, and you don't kill John Wick's puppy and steal his vintage car."" Actually, I don't think he said the last part, but it's definitely true if you value your life.<br/><br/>John Wick, written by Derek Kolstad and directed by Chad Stahelski, was a great action film which brought Keanu Reeves back into the fold as a leading man and a box office draw. Not since Speed or The Matrix (the original) has Keanu succeeded as a true action hero. The movie, about a retired assassin (Reeves) going back to the work he does best (killing) after members of a Russian gang murder his dog and steal his car, was a critical and box office success. So John Wick: Chapter 2 was just a matter of time.<br/><br/>The sequel picks up where the first film ends with Wick aka The Boogeyman tracking down his stolen car and taking it back. Like the pre-credit opening sequences in the James Bond franchise, the action, pacing and bloodshed is non-stop. Reeves appears to be in great shape and at the top of his game (he trained four months for the first film; probably more for this one). Given just enough time to bury his money and his weapons, he is pulled out of retirement yet again. This time because he owes a marker to Italian crime boss Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio). The marker is a debt owed that is symbolized by gold medallion. When the medallion is opened, Wick's bloody thumb print is seen instead of a selfie - a blood oath.<br/><br/>In the original John Wick, there was only one rule that all assassins had to abide by - blood could not be spilled in the Continental Hotel which was run by Winston (Ian McShane). It functioned as a Switzerland of sorts, where killers could seek haven and not be harmed. Apparently a second mandatory rule was added to the sequel - a blood oath is a contract that must be honored on pain of death. Who says there's no honor among thieves? So with a bit of arm twisting (D'Antonio burns John Wick's house down to the ground with a grenade launcher), Wick agrees to fulfill D'Antonio's marker. (At least the dog wasn't hurt in this one.)<br/><br/>D'Antonio doesn't want a lot, just to have his sister Gianna D'Antonio (Claudia Gerini) assassinated so that he can take her seat on the ""High Table"" of crime lords. So Wick is off to Italy to do the deed (no wonder the sequel's budget was double the first one). Without giving too much away, the marker is redeemed, but at a terrible price for Wick: D'Antonio puts an open contract for seven million dollars on his head to avenge his sister's death. Now everyone in New York is out to get Wick from the incognito homeless assassin on Fifth Avenue to the incognito fiddle player assassin in the subway (trying to kill Wick becomes a more popular game than Powerball or Mega Millions). The situation is compounded by Gianna's loyal bodyguard (played by the rapper Common) who tracks Wick to New York hell bent on revenge. Wick becomes a literal moving target for just about the entire population of New York City who turn out to be undercover assassins. (That explains a lot about the operations of NYC.) Wick must get to D'Antonio before everybody and their grandmother gets to him.<br/><br/>The action and body count is double the first one - as a good action sequel should be. Both films pay homage to John Woo, martial arts films in general and even Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns. In fact, in one article Director Stahelski noted that Sergio Leone's 1966 The Good, The Bad and The Ugly was a heavy influence on the nature and style of the John Wick films as was Akira Kurosawa, William Friedkin, Sam Peckinpah and even Steve McQueen. What was especially cool was the amount of Gun fu battles present in both films, but especially the sequel. Gun fu - essentially kung fu but with weapons - is relied on heavily in the Hong Kong action films and used to great effect in the Wick franchise.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Reeves, who always has had somewhat of an aloof Steve McQueen-ish aura about him, particularly in his action films, has created and defined the John Wick ruthless persona. Yet, his versatility as an actor also allows us to see glimpses of an underlying, vulnerable core such as is seen in flashbacks with his deceased wife or his interchanges with his dog. (It's interesting to note that the original character of John Wick envisioned in earlier drafts was in his mid-sixties - there's hope for me yet.) Veteran actor Ian McShane is wonderfully mysterious and charismatic as Winston, the head of the Hotel Continental (in the same way that Ricardo Montalban was mysterious as Mr. Roarke in the television series, Fantasy Island.) The rapper Common shows that he can act as well as sing and can jump and kick with the best of them. His fight scenes with Reeves were simply awesome and set a new standard for cinematic hand-to-hand combat. Riccardo Scamarcio, an experienced actor from Italian cinema, hits just the right note as the whiny, sniveling crime lord who puts a contract out on his own sister. Australian actress Ruby Rose was pitch-perfect (no pun intended) as D'Antonio's mute bodyguard. Her portrayal harkens back to the evil villainess Rosa Klebb in the James Bond film From Russia with Love. By far the biggest casting surprise, however, was reuniting Reeves with Lawrence Fishburne, his old mentor from The Matrix movies. It was nice seeing Neo and Morpheus together again, even if they are different characters in a different movie.<br/><br/>Even if you try to put a fancy tag on it like a ""neo-noir action thriller,"" in the final analysis it is what it is - a revenge movie and, as such, is thoroughly engaging and satisfying. Whether it's John Wick or films like The Revenant, Payback, Man on Fire, High Plains Drifter, Death Wish, or even The Godfather, well-constructed revenge films appeal to our sense of justice and strike a vicarious chord with all of us. I cannot wait for the next chapter in John Wick's life - I just hope they don't hurt the dog."

","This is better than most comedies. So funny. I liked seeing small funny things like sarcasm, extremes, and talk. Like driving broken car, shooting secretly each other in public places, and acting like nothing happened even worst things happen, and crying over emotional things, yet not after being physically hurt. Also funny how people have culture in their talk, even during biggest revenges. Some parts are better than 1st sequel, if not whole movie. High quality acting, actors, sounds, locations, video. Bit unreal at the ending like all people listening order of only one person, like they are not accidentally on strees, ordinary passengers. Liked seeing John Abbruzzi from Prison Break series. Similar to Taken (2008) and its sequels, just bit more action and fun, and less emotions and mystery."

","After the events from the first film, John Wick successfully gets his car back and decides to seal up his guns and suit in his basement. Then he gets called back to the world he worked so hard to leave, by a marker, which is a blood oath to help the person bearing the marker. Wick gets the job done, which would usually mean that he can peacefully retire but the bearer of the marker double crosses him and tries to kill him. This pisses him off, of course and Wick is set onto a path with many challenges and worthy opponents.<br/><br/>I find this better than the first film because viewers get to see John Wick in fight scenes where he struggles to have the upper hand and he's being pushed into a corner and he has to kill anyone in his way to get out. We see John Wick getting desperate to survive so he can exact his revenge on the marker bearer who put a hit on him. We see John Wick really angry in this one because he's been royally screwed over, that he stepped into the Continental with the intention to kill, thus breaking one of the cardinal rules of their world: No conducting business on Continental grounds.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves excels during the fight scenes. There's something satisfying about watching John Wick kill all his enemies with accurate shots and calculated moves. Honestly, this movie has some of the best action and fight scenes and viewers won't be disappointed."

","John Wick buries his suit and guns in his basement and seals them up. Then he gets a visit from a man bearing a marker, forcing him to return to the world he fought so hard to leave. And from there, well. Basically, hits the fan for Wick because the marker-bearing man betrays his word and tries to kill him.<br/><br/>I find that this movie's better than the first because we see Wick facing some real challenges such as opponents that match his level of expertise and gives him a run for his money. We see Wick asking for help from people he has tried to kill as help is hard to come by. He's all alone in this world full of people trying to kill him for money.<br/><br/>Personally, this movie showed the many dimensions of Wick. He's desperate and being pushed into a corner. Therefore, it's no surprise that he would break a cardinal rule: No business on the Continental."

"kikoydaba3","7","0","0","3 November 2019"," bigger action, scope, slightly improved story, and more Keanu Reeves badassery
","Building on its predecessor, John Wick: Chapter 2 expands the mythos of its titular protagonist with bigger action, scope, slightly improved story, and more Keanu Reeves badassery.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 follows John Wick in the wake of the consequences in the original's story. The Russian Mafia Wick battled is but a member of a large group of a connected mob, with their own rules and code. Wick is once again forcibly drawn back to his previous profession when he is tasked by an influential mob boss to kill his sister.<br/><br/>Like the original, themes of brotherhood, loyalty, greed, and power are explored. Many of the hinted aspects of the criminal underworld Wick is a part of is expanded. A larger group called High Table makes decisions every mob and bosses follow. The High Table is composed of mob bosses themselves.<br/><br/>Wick is drawn to the task because he swore a blood oath, an unbreakable pact that must be honored. The mob boss, Santino D'Antonio, is driven by greed and greater power because his sister, Gianna D'Antonio, is a member of the High Table and he is not. Gianna commits suicide when confronted by Wick to end her life in her own terms. Before Gianna could kill herself, she poses Wick a dilemma that by killing her, a woman, wouldn't he remember the memory of his deceased wife. Wick proceeds anyway, but not before she committed suicide. Upon completing the task, to deflect any suspicion, Santino has Wick assassinated, with a hefty bounty, to no avail. Failing to assassinate Wick, Santino becomes the prey. The chase lands both Wick and Santino at New York Continental Grounds which prohibits ""business"" within hotel grounds. Wick violates the oath and kills Santino, rendering him excommunicado not just in Continental but the entire criminal enterprise. The bounty on his head is doubled and becomes international, but not before Winston gave him a 1-hour head start of distance. The killing of Santino signifies Wick's full return into his old profession but as a lone wolf.<br/><br/>Compared to its predecessor, Chapter 2 has a slight improvement in character development, but not enough to be considered emotionally fulfilling. There is a jarring tonal shift between the film's two halves wherein the first is mainly about Wick's loss and the assassination job while the second half is him on the run. The world-building is really impressive, presenting how big the criminal enterprise Wick lives in. The fight scenes are spectacular. One standout, in particular, is the hall of mirrors fight, which is inspired by Sam Mendes' Skyfall. The amount of car crashes Wick survives in this particular film shows what a legend he is. His reputation as an assassin extends beyond New York. Keanu Reeves is great once again showing some real acting chops by performing different languages, both verbal and sign. The direction is sleeker. Somehow, Chad Stahelski manages to improve Chapter 2 in spectacle and direction while remaining faithful to the original.<br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2 is a very good follow-up but one where the sequel may improve upon with better writing.<br/><br/>7/10"

When 2014 movie ""John Wick"" became a smash hit, expect that a sequel is coming, for sure. But the filmmakers expand the clandestine assassin society, engaging the audiences into the subtle world-building. We see a Harry Potter-like universe without the wands but with guns!

"jadavix","6","0","0","2 October 2019"," Underwhelming
","I think the first John Wick movie struck a chord with audiences because it was a back-to-basics action movie without a superhero anywhere to be found. The superhero/comic book genre seems to have subsumed action films. If you want to see stuff blown up real good, that's where you go: not to Schwarzenegger or Stallone or Van Damme or Lundgren or Snipes. Standard action flicks don't have the budget to impress you with special effects any more; in fact, they mostly go straight to the shelf these days, bypassing the cinema.<br/><br/>What's funny is that ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is barely any different to those movies that are comic books brought to life. Watching it, I often felt like I was looking at ""A Scanner Darkly"" from all those years ago, so stylized are the movie's visuals and of course, here's Keanu Reeves again, nobody's idea of a realistic actor.<br/><br/>He's also basically a superhero. At one point in this movie, he takes a bullet to the gut, and apparently keeps it there for the rest of the story. He accumulates scratches on his face, but seems to come through without any lasting damage regardless. Obviously, action movie heroes are always superhuman when played by Arnie and Sly. But going back to the '70s, we had movies like ""The French Connection"" and ""Dirty Harry"" that really made you feel what the characters felt, precisely because they weren't indestructible. Perhaps it's not a relief from superhero movies that fans of the John Wick series are after, but just something that purports to be.<br/><br/>It's a pretty good time, but also kind of underwhelming. There's lots of martial arts in the film, with people tangling their legs around each other and flopping this way and that - but Reeves isn't a gifted martial artist like Iko Uwais. The fighting scenes pale in comparison to any of the movies coming out of Indonesia in recent years.<br/><br/>The movie also has a role call of amazing character actors, so many that I'm sure I'll forget a few. In fact, I'll forget some because they're not utilised well. I was unimpressed by their casting of Lance Reddick (of ""The Wire"" fame) as a hotel porter in the previous film. He's back again, and gets a little more to do. But what about John Leguizamo, Peter Stormare, Franco Nero? They're barely given anything to do. Common could have been a memorable rival assassin, but the movie doesn't give him too many memorable moments."

"sheldonnylander","7","0","0","21 September 2019"," Bigger and Badder (the Good Kind), But It Comes at a Cost
","Picking almost right where the previous film ended, ""John Wick Chapter 2"" deals with the consequences of Wick's return to the assassin life and how he got out to begin with.<br/><br/>As expected, it expands on the mythology hinted at in the first movie, with the revelation that there's a high council of sorts, other Continental hotels around the world, and a very widespread network of assassins.<br/><br/>Also as expected, it ups the ante with bigger action sequences, and a much higher body count. We get to know more about some rival assassins played quite brilliantly by Common and Ruby Rose (whose character communicates solely through sign language; in many cases, this kind of thing is used as a gimmick to make the audience remember a character when they have nothing else to distinguish them, but it's not the case here and is used only as an aspect of the character; smartly done). Keanu Reeves...let's the Reeves of old come through a couple times, with a couple of bizarre and inappropriate inflections. Ian McShane's Winston expands a little bit, although he still refers to John as Jonathan, which is just wrong. If it's supposed to be some kind of an in-joke with them, they don't reveal anything about it. Again, I think there's more going on with Lance Reddick's hotel manager than they're letting on. And I was a little disappointed that Peter Stormare wasn't in more of the film, as he's always fun.<br/><br/>Again, the world is very wide, and almost seems like everyone is involved with this underworld. There is an indication that that's not the case here and there, but we never get to meet anyone who doesn't know what's going on, which keeps some of that suspicion up.<br/><br/>The plot follows a pretty basic structure. Actually, it follows a pretty rigid structure. In a two hour movie, it can be broken down almost exactly into half-hour sequences, something that struck me as a little odd. There are some minor plot twist. Nothing major or out of the blue, but at least there was an attempt.<br/><br/>So now we come down to it. Is it better or worse than the first movie? Well, I would have to say ""yes"". It definitely ups the ante and is a much bigger film than the first movie, expanding on the mythology and the characters. At the same time, it falls into the trap that a lot of these bigger, badder sequels fall into, which is that with the bigger scope, it feels like they have to use a bigger yoke on everything in order to keep in reined in and from going off the rails on its own. In fact, they may have expanded the world too quickly, going from a city in the first movie to the entire globe in the second. That rapid expansion makes that bigger yoke much more percpetible and, while the ambition is admirable, at times I wondered if they may have bitten off more than they could chew.<br/><br/>Still an enjoyable action film, and if you liked the first film, you'll most likely enjoy this one."

Be prepared for some stunning visuals, too - like the mirror house and Catacombs scenes!

","I'm a HUGE fan of the John wick franchise and I have to say this one is good. I think the first one is a bit better but this one is really good. One part the I kept watching over and over again was the concert shootout. The part was INSANE. Then he goes in the tunnel then that was when the real action happened. It was CRAZY with how much kills he got. He got like around 160 or 120 kill in this movie. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT. I did a review on John wick 3 and gave it 10/10 because it was so good. You can read that if you want. And also the train station place part. That was really cool too. ESPECIALLY THE PENCIL KILLS. That's was CRAZY. Then there's the final one at the art gallery. This one was really good. That one didn't focus on the brutality more on the kill count. The first one probably has more shootouts and fights. But this one focuses on how much kills they get in the infrequent shootouts/fight scenes. The movie was really good and I recommend it to all action movie fans.

"Wizard-8","Null","0","0","8 July 2017"," Action compensates for some genuine weaknesses
","I enjoyed the original ""John Wick"" movie, and in my IMDb review I said that I would return for the sequel if start Keanu Reeves and director Chad Stahelski returned for it. Well, both things happened, so I was sure to rent the Blu-ray when it came out. <br/><br/>Like the first movie, this sequel seems to have split people - either you like it, or you hate it. I did like it, though I will freely admit that it isn't perfect. The complaint that it doesn't have much in the way of character development is true to a degree. It is hard to get into the head of the title character (or any other character). John Wick is more or less just portrayed as an extreme killing machine, and a few scenes of him looking at photos of his departed sweetheart don't really do anything.<br/><br/>The movie is more a vehicle to showcase hardcore action. But if you are just in the mood to see a lot of action, the movie does deliver the goods... eventually. After the opening action-packed ten minutes of the movie, you have to wait forty five minutes or so for the action to start coming again. But when it does, it's worth the wait. Gunplay, martial arts, the movie has it all when it comes to action, and it's very well staged (and very violent.)<br/><br/>I know this movie isn't for everybody. If you didn't like the first movie, you certainly won't like this sequel. But if you liked the first movie and simply want to sit back and have some non-think kind of entertainment, the movie does reasonably entertain for a couple of hours. I went into the movie with that frame of mind, and I was entertained. If Reeves and Stahelski return for part 3, I will definitely give it a look."

","""I'm not that guy anymore. You are always that guy, John.""<br/><br/>Once again I couldn't withhold myself from watching a sequel, although I knew it probably would be a watered down version of the original. And yet I could not resist it. And after re-reading my review of the first movie ""John Wick"", I can only conclude that I was right about that. The final sentence I wrote was as follows: ""I admire Reeves that he's still capable to portray a character as Wick at his age of 50 and bring this kind of personage to a higher level, but I'm afraid that this sequel will be a weak carbon copy from the original."" . Unfortunately, I was right.<br/><br/>The only difference with the first movie is the amount of fake blood they've used. Again, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) acts with extreme effrontery and he leaves a pile of bodies behind. The fight scenes, with lots of onrushing guards being killed with a well-aimed head shot, are bloodier than in the previous movie. As for the rest, the structure of the story is the same. This time it's not stealing Wick's car and killing his puppy that starts off an unprecedented revenge action. Nope, the retired assassin is required to perform a task commissioned by Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio). A task he can't refuse because of an old code among assassins. The initial refusal is the cause for a drastic revenge, after which Wick is forced to carry it out anyway. The asked execution has such a negative impact on Wick's surroundings and gives rise to even more over the top violence and action packed moments.<br/><br/>Obviously the emphasis in this second movie is focused on the action segments. Once again, the story itself is pretty thin and the lack of depth when talking about the characters is omnipresent. But ultimately, this lack is just an advantage. This way they could focus completely on the well-choreographed action-scenes that follow each other at a fast pace. I am convinced that the number of eliminations is a lot higher here. It was a prudent attempt to further deepen the story about the assassination syndicate and the neutral area in the shape of the Continental Hotel. Interesting? Yes. Necessary? No not really. You know what the movie ""John Wick"" stands for and that's what you want to see. Sheer brutality, violence and a lot of action. And fortunately, they were very successful in that respect.<br/><br/>I wasn't particularly impressed by it this time. Even though they moved Wick's work-space to a more imaginative location and the images from Rome are more eye-catching than those of New York, I got the impression that this movie simply exploited the success of the first part shamelessly. Even Keanu Reeves didn't have to do his utter best. Granted. The man is very suitable for this role. John Wick's cool-blooded, stoic gaze and the limited use of dialogues are characteristics which are tailor-made for Keanu Reeves. ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a logical sequel to the unexpected success of the first movie. If you are a lover of the better action-movie, this is definitely is something to watch. Now you'll also see how the myth John Wick can kill someone with a pencil. Personally, I think it's time Wick starts to think about his retirement!<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc"
"CountJonnie","6","0","0","19 June 2017"," One long enjoyable action scene, but adds nothing else
","The 1st John Wick was and still is a gem. Not too much story, and lots of action without burying it beneath over the top acting or (sub)stories.<br/><br/>Part 2 does the same thing, in a good way. The most brilliant move is to make Reeves a tormented man with not too much lines. He indeed is the silent boogeyman in every shadow, who hates what he does, but also does it best.<br/><br/>The acting and lines are left to others who carry it better, such as Ian McShane, Lance Reddick and Peter Stormare. But at the moment they introduce Laurence Fishburne, the movie falls flat. It's exactly than and there where Fishburne performs a piece of overacting that was so well avoided in part 1 and the 1st half of part 2.<br/><br/>John Wick is a man who wants out, but the only way to do that is to get in. Which is the same way the movie ends and promises us a part 3. At this moment, the movie becomes on long fight scene and for me that was the moment to realise it should've ended after part 1. Enjoyable, fun, great ride and unnecessairy."

But is bigger better? I'm... not sure. It's fun to watch the dazzling close quarter Gun-Fu and director Chad Stahelsky manages to keep the carnage fresh, but I can't help but think there's a tradeoff similar to that of seeing a band in a small venue vs. a large arena."

","They made a big deal about following the ""business"" rules in a gentlemen like manner to keep the security/assassins from killing each other and the important people they protect. The security/assassins know the rules. If someone calls in a marker then the order is to be followed. If they disobey then they are killed by other assassins. John Wick 2 goes back and forth whether if he wants to follow these rules.<br/><br/>The audience needs to suspend belief that a marker can be placed on a current member of the ruling board. No Way. That would mean everyone on the ruling board could be killed every day. No stability. MANURE. That would make all ""rules"" meaningless and it would defeat the intent of having a crook ruling board since they would be killed often. Order breeds stability and safety.<br/><br/>The non-stop action was weak. The movie made it seem as if there were 1000s of henchmen ready and waiting to engage in the fight. Come on. <br/><br/>I gauge a movie based on how much I wanted all of the main characters to die. If I want them all to die then the movie is a ZERO. I wanted every character in John Wick 2 to die.

If I'm to devote two hrs of my time to sit and watch to bad actors, in a shoot em up bang bang, I'm a one man killing machine, then I'm going to point the obvious about Reeves. He simply can't act. It's a reason why every scene is with him fighting and no real dialogue. Him and Common are only good in fight scenes.Common has no range of depth whatsoever and watching Common act let's me know that only one thing, if you want a real good black actor, go and get a rapper(sarcasm).Personally I think that all rappers suck at acting.

John Wick 2 is one of the best action movies I've seen. Best action movie is John Wick chapter 2.<br/><br/>In the movie, John is visited by Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio. D'Antonio presents the medallion to demand services from John, but John refuses, claiming that he is ""retired"". In retaliation, D'Antonio destroys John's house with a grenade launcher.<br/><br/>Winston, the owner of the Continental hotel in New York City, reminds John that if he rejects the Marker, he will be violating one of the two unbreakable rules of the underworld: no killing on Continental grounds, and Markers must be honored. John accepts his commitment and meets with D'Antonio, who tasks him with assassinating his sister Gianna D'Antonio so he can claim her seat on the ""High Table"", a council of high-level crime lords. D'Antonio sends Ares, his personal bodyguard, to follow and keep an eye on John.<br/><br/>In Rome, John infiltrates Gianna's celebratory party and confronts her. After Gianna know about John come to kill her, Gianna chooses to commit suicide. While retreating, John is ambushed by D'Antonio's men, who intend to kill John for destroy the killing order of Santino D'Antonio. After killing most of them, John is pursued by Gianna's bodyguard Cassian. Their brutal fight is halted when they crash into the reception area of the Rome Continental. As the two reluctantly share a drink, Cassian vows revenge for Gianna's death.<br/><br/>After John returns to New York City, D'Antonio opens a $7 million contract for John's death under the guise of avenging his sister, leading numerous assassins to attack him (unsuccessfully). Cassian confronts John once again in the subway. John wins the ensuing fight, but spares Cassian's life out of professional respect. Injured and desperate, John seeks help from the underground crime lord The Bowery King, whose subordinates treat his injuries and guide him to D'Antonio's location. John kills D'Antonio's men and brutally stabs Ares after an intense fight, leaving her immobilized, but D'Antonio is able to escape to the Continental. D'Antonio makes it clear that he intends to seek indefinite refuge there, and John, despite Winston's warning, shoots and kills D'Antonio.<br/><br/>The next day, Winston tells John that, per the High Table, the contract on John has been doubled and offered globally. John is ""excommunicado"" and loses all access and privileges to underworld resources. Winston delays announcing John's excommunication and post of the bounty on him globally by one hour to give him a head start, and provides him with a Marker for future use. Before leaving, John asks Winston to send a message that he will kill anyone who comes after him. John, suspicious of everyone as hit men all across New York set their eyes on him, flees on foot with his dog."

Mr. Wick, outstanding performance from the start - i am just ecstatic as the fact that he is so feared but he does possess to ability to support that belief.

Sometimes I felt like I was missing the joke, like everyone else watching knew that this was actually a comedic satire of the first John Wick film. <br/><br/>I'm now certain that Keanu seriously can't even say one word that sounds like a real actor let alone a real person. He can't even say ""No,"" believably. Only when he says, ""Yeah,"" does he sound like he doesn't have a stick up his butt. But none of that matters really.

The first John Wick was thoroughly enjoyable, but I didn't expect the sequel to be even better. Mind you, the starting is a bit lopsided, trying to connect you to what happened in the first chapter. But this movie really starts after the titles and shoots off from there. One thinks one might get tired of all the shooting and killing and dead bodies in this film, but one doesn't.

Jonathan is back with another dog, other gadgets, and another reason to kill.<br/><br/>Leitch isn't director here, however, thanks to his deafening first movie, has been set to direct ""Deadpool 2"" and thriller war ""Atomic Blonde"". His colleague, Stahelski, is the sole director of ""Chapter 2"", and has signed for ""Highlander,"" a sci-fi film. His years as stuntman were enough to absorb the most magnanimous pieces of knowledge, ideas shining in the hands of Derek Kolstad, an eloquent and congruent screenwriter with the development of his story, which fits together like geometric pieces the star character.<br/><br/>Wick has not concluded the singular self-compensation in the name of his adorable pet, just one item needs to be crossed out in the list of the refrigerator: his car. After ""recovering"" his costly auto, he determines to absolve himself of that Russian mafia and that hotel which tore his life down once and for all, nevertheless, his first free nap is hampered by recent ghosts. Now, Jonathan must go back to his life as a gun killer to finalize a pact that involuntarily reopened. The problem is that he'll have to do it with an auction for 7 million dollars to his back, meaning each assassin in Rome or New York is behind his steps. A cocktail of bullets, blood, neat beauty and action to its maximum expression.<br/><br/>A cult movie wasn't adequately entertained and conscientiously filmed like this one for a long period, which converts it into the best action feature film in recent months, excelling by far to Tom Cruise's, Liam Neeson's or Jason Sthaman's adventures. Its director understands how to build up the frantic scenes with readable shots, static angles, sketched fights and a gleaming visual status quo accompanied by myriad elements convening a great cinematic banquet, where morbidity, injuries, and amorality don't distort behind the PG-13 rating. He knows the legacy which is in his hands, his mission is to keep it up and as one would expect of any sequel, developing better and bigger things, for example: one substitute pet, a new classic scene and foes as complex as realistic strengthening the plot with subtitles on screen, silent shootings into a jam-packed subway or an emblematic final confrontation in the hall of mirrors; a crystal glassware that diffracts danger with blue and red neon lights.<br/><br/>Reeves, a loathed and idolized actor in equal measure returns strengthened to the role which gave back him contemporary glory: John Wick. This time, the man exhibits solid convictions which justify his vindictive ire; actions are savage and remorseless, nonetheless, aftermath are serious enough to continue stirring up his wrath which has held since his spouse's death. Wick may be a killing machine, but in his emotional level stands out his self- awareness. Rome comes with special guests, who supply empathic and outstanding performances, from a fatal mute lady, portrayed by an always excellent Ruby Rose, to malicious and scowling Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), from a violent Cassian (Common) to old well-known Laurence Fishburne, into what seems a brief cameo.<br/><br/>Artistic determinations are equal and even more unusual than narrative ones, in a neo-noir story where the politically incorrect decisions are the first happening, emphasizing in capital letters the unexpected twist (shot) inside the Hotel. It's difficult to see such levels of elegance and repugnance combined in an action movie. Among so many compliments and wise choices, the most remarkable is its amazing mise-en-scène, photography, and staging; they're sublime and imposing, stunning and superb, images exceeding their expression limits together with a soundtrack that points to the audience's heart; a blood ceremony grotesque sensibly as to admire the beauty of human nature. From neon colors to Romanesque streets, from car chases in the rain to shootings in underground caves with heavy music, from nudes to stab-wounds; night or day, city or plain, the filmmakers employed all their tools.<br/><br/>""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is the correct sequel for first installment's eccentricities; the sequences and twist plot don't let down, by the contrary, duplicate the effective results with daring performances, exquisite scenarios and a cinematography that will leave real film lovers astounded. Ironically, the smallest details are which work against it, however, are harmless but visible. Wick ends with a beautiful open ending, which will culminate in a third and possibly last part of the life of a man seeking redemption, revenge, and peace. A cocktail of radiant narrative, artistic and technical decisions. ""Wick"" is the film that any twenty-first-century action motion picture would wish to be. An aggressive, hectic and subversive experience."

","So, we headed out to the theater last night and saw John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017). We've heard the chatter and we did like the first John Wick film so we had to check it out. We did enjoy the movie very much as it was completely action packed as promised and the cast for the film, for the most part, was great; though it did seem a few parts were maybe too much?<br/><br/>Now before I say this I want to say off the bat that I think Ruby Rose is an awesome actress and for the part, she was given she played it very well. My only question about the parts in the film with Ruby Rose is maybe there should've of been more or what this role even needed in the film? I don't want to give away anything about the film as I don't like to share anything that may spoil the film, there are just specific spots in the film that it seem that maybe some of the parts of the movie had been cut out to make it shorter and it made some areas dry? They're several scenes in the movie that sort of seem to be like they were cut off, or maybe they are leaving it for a reminisce in a future film?<br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) isn't an all-star film, but it is a very entertaining film with a lot of potentials and we thoroughly enjoyed it and anticipate maybe a John Wick 3? I do think that in some ways John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) brought a lot more to the table that the first but in some ways, I lean towards part one being the best, but all in all they are both really well made and entertaining films."

","The story might be emptier than the promises of a politician or an alcoholist's liquor bottle, but if you like action movies, it delivers two hours of non-stop action entertainment.<br/><br/>The movie is all in all, very well, set up, where the acting is quite good and the scenes (locations) well chosen and filmed from a cinematography point of view. The fight scenes are tense and well choreographed, but many, many, many things are just quite impossible. And that last thing was really at the limit where, on occasion, it became down right annoying.<br/><br/>After a small epilogue to tie up loose ends in the storyline and also the director's move to set the tone of the movie, John Wick is forced back into the life of a hit-man, against his will. In addition, they blew up his house (remember in the first movie when they stole his car and killed his puppy?) AND set him up at the end of the mission.<br/><br/>Wrong move.<br/><br/>After many fights, where our hero gets a good beating and deals an even better beating and finds very original, out-of-the-crayon-box thinking, ways to kill henchmen and -women left and right (front and back), the net starts to close even on our beloved Mr. Wick.<br/><br/>John Wick Chapter 3 is set up, now we have to wait.<br/><br/>The summary of this review, explains itself. Go see, mind to zero (and just count), entertaining movie."

","I love the 2nd movie even more than the 1st. I am mesmerized with the character. Most of all, I would love to sit down and have a personal conversation with Mr. Reeves. Nothing fancy, nothing personal. I just love the time and work he put into making this person so real and amazing. I have always had an interest in Mr. Reeve's work. I am not looking for anything, just want to talk and get to know him as a person, a human being and find out what drives him. Hope to get that chance some day. Keep up the great work you always deliver. God puts us all here for a purpose and acting is definitely your calling. I don't know who make the decision to pick Mr. Reeves for this role, but dam did he do this character more than justice. I felt the 1st movie ""John Wick"" was a great movie, because of the plot, story line, and the man. But dam! John Wick Chapter 2 - was out this world, the action, moves, was more than what I would have ever expected. Very rarely can you make a part 2 of a movie out shine the 1st one, but it was also the actor you choose for the part, very good home work director. And Mr. Reeves really took the time to read the script, pace himself, rehearse, get into character, I was amazed who really great this movie is. Hope it wins an award, because it most definitely should.<br/><br/>Theresa A. Hayle"

","The most enjoyable killing spree ever. It had a kind of purgatory effect. Mesmerising choreography of fighting scenes, gripping action sequences, perfectly-matching music score. Simply excellent! The acting was well-grounded, the portrayal of the underworld meticulous and to-the-point. Way better than the first movie which was a good one. JW2 is like a fast beating drum, no slacks. Loved every second, kept me on the edge of my seat, I didn't realize it was 122min. Was it really directed by a stuntman? Amazing! A masterpiece of its kind!"

","I was never a big fan of this film's subtitle, Chapter Two. I just thought it sounded stupid. But when you watch this movie, it absolutely makes sense. This one picks up pretty much immediately after the events of the original John Wick, and is undoubtedly the second chapter in this overarching story. So that was a gripe I had from the beginning that was quickly settled. In the same sense that this is the second chapter, it feels like you never left the theater after the first one. While the story does change and new characters are introduced, the aesthetics of Chapter Two are pretty much identical to the original. The color palette, the action choreography, the costume design, the music-- it all feels exactly the same. That kind of continuity is something I look for and appreciate in sequels. John Wick: Chapter Two brings back all the stand-out and important elements that made John Wick what it was, and that was something I was glad to see..."

","As it usually goes the sequel does not live up to the first installment. There are very few instances where the sequel outshines the first. John Wick: Chapter 2 is one of those instances. Things aligned and the result was a sequel that was more satisfying more brutal and greatly expands the world of John Wick so that he can continue killing people and all because a guy didn't know who John Wick was and killed his puppy. Go watch it, the movie is everything an assassin's world movie should be."

"n_e_o70","8","3","8","21 February 2017"," Mr Anderson, Welcome back. We missed you.
","If there is one genre of film that has stood the test of time, it is the ""Action Flick"". There seems to be an unquenchable thirst for these things which the big Hollywood studios have been quick to capitalise on. Back in the 80's and some of the 90's the Action film was literally ""One Guy takes on many people"" and that's it. The studios knew what people wanted. They didn't want character development or a complex story line. They wanted Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone to kill people in imaginative ways. The audience loved it and the hence their menagerie of films have stood the test of time. Since then much has changed. Films like Fast and Furious attempt to put in a pointless story line about ""family"", ""Friends"" and a pathetic endeavour at on screen romance. But John Wick Chapter 2, does what its predecessor did so wonderfully. It takes guidance from the action greats of the past and instead spends most of its time to show you what you have paid to see An orgy of on screen deaths. While on the subject of death, John Wick 2 offers some of the best gun fight sequences ever. Keanu Reeves spent 8 hours every day for 4 months training for his role. This shows throughout the entire film as there are almost no stunt doubles. His efficiency with the weapons and the perfectly executed kills are a visual feast for anyone who loves a good action sequence. And that's exactly what we have come to watch. We don't want a complex story so the film makers don't try to give us one. The atheistic and visceral brutality is the reason why John Wick 2 triumphs over its lacklustre counterparts. The film does well to expand the lore that the first film started. It reveals why John Wick is so feared by almost everyone who knows him. But make no mistake, there is hardly a cohesive story here. The film takes places in a surreal world built upon our very own. There are a few bits of black comedy here and there but the tone is very much noire. One of my issues is that John Wick's character doesn't want to do this but when he is killing people with pencils and disembowels a man from the groin upwards that whole idea goes out of the window. Reeves who plays the character very well doesn't say much throughout the film. But as mentioned before, this isn't a film if you want a story. That aside, John Wick should be enjoyed as it was intended. It is a brutal ballet which is choreographed and filmed to perfection. Keanu Reeves it seems is back and is now the new darling of action purists."

","The new action crime thriller film John Wick: Chapter 2 starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, Ruby Rose, Common, John Leguizamo, Bridget Moynahan, Peter Stormare. In John Wick: Chapter 2 Keanu Reeves' legendary hit-man takes on the world's deadliest killers in this thrill-packed sequel. John Wick (Lebanon born actor Keanu Reeves - The Matrix films, Speed) isn't having much luck staying retired. Now a former associate of the unstoppable hit-man Santino D'Antonio (Italian actor Riccardo Scamarcio - Burnt, Effie Gray) is planning to take over the shadowy international assassins' guild. John is bound by a blood oath to assist him and reluctantly travels to Rome the capital of Italy or Roma as Italians call Rome to fulfil this obligation. Matters are complicated by the fact that someone has 'opened an account' on John himself, which means that every badass on the planet is now closing in! It's not long before the bullets start flying in this explosive sequel to the 2014 hit that reignited Keanu Reeves' action career with the biggest bang imaginable. That stylish spectacle's co-director, former stuntman Chad Stahelski, is back behind the camera for this second magnificent blend of superbly choreographed breathtaking action and witty one-liners. American rapper Common (Terminator Salvation, Selma) as Cassian and Amerian actor Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix films, Event Horizon) as Bowery King are among those joining the cast along with English actor Ian McShane (UK TV Series Lovejoy, US TV Series Deadwood) as Winston, Australian actress Ruby Rose (US TV Series Orange Is The New Black, XXX: Return Of Xander Cage) as Ares who is death and can only communicate by sign language since she can't talk like normal people with subtitles coming up on the screen so that you can understand what she is really saying for anybody out here who doesn't know or understand sign language that well, Italian actress Claudia Gerini (The Passion Of The Christ, Under The Tuscan Sun) as Gianna D'Antonio Santino's sister, American actor Lance Reddick (White House Down, The Guest) as Charon who runs a hotel somewhere in New York, Tobias Segal (The Drop, R.I.P.D.) as Earl, Colombian actor John Leguizamo (Die Hard 2: Die Harder, Kick-Ass 2) as Aurelio a friend of John Wick, American actress Bridget Moynahan (US TV Series Blue Bloods, Coyote Ugly) as Helen Wick John Wick's late wife who is only seen in snippets / flashbacks throughout the film when John Wick is remembering his late wife, American actor Thomas Sadoski (Wild, Loser) as Jimmy, American actor David Patrick Kelly (Flags Of Our Fathers, Commando) as Charlie, Italian actor Franco Nero (Die Hard 2: Die Harder, Django Unchained) as Julius, English actor Peter Serafinowicz (Spy, Guardians Of The Galaxy) as Sommelier, Nigerian actor Chukwudi Iwuji (Exam, Barry) as Akoni, Swedish actor Peter Stormare (8MM, Armageddon) as Abram a Russian mob boss, American actor Wass Stevens (The Wrestler, World Trade Center) as Consiglieri and Ukrainian actor Oleg Prudius who use to wrestle in WWE as The Moscow Mauler Vladimir Kozlov from 2007 until 2011 as a Russian assassin. Filming locations in John Wick: Chapter 2 include places like New York, New Jersey, Rome the capital of Italy in Europe, Montréal, Québec, Canada. Overall John Wick: Chapter 2 is a good action crime thriller film filled with lots of action, shooting, gory violence, people getting shot, stabbed, slashed, killed, murdered, chases on foot and in vehicles like cars and motorbikes, explosions, things getting blown up, wrecked, destroyed, fire, things getting burnt down, subway trains, heavy rain, good shots of New York City at night time with all the bright lights, good shots of Rome and the historic buildings it has that are stunning to look at, nightclubbing, loud music, people partying, drinking, smoking, guns, fighting, incredible fighting scenes that will leave you breathless, fast and furious action, on the edge of your seat stuff, sadness, loyalty, friendship, team work, togetherness, assassins, some funny moments and many other things throughout the film. So I will give John Wick: Chapter 2 an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say John Wick: Chapter 2 is worth seeing if you like action crime thriller films like Run All Night, The Last Stand, Bullet To The Head, the Taken films, the Bad Boys films, Sabotage, Eraser, Commando, The Expendables films, Parker, the Transporter films, the Die Hard films, Face / Off, The Guest, Sicario, Edge Of Tomorrow, Looper amongst others. So if you get the chance to see John Wick: Chapter 2 in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later."

"alex-klein2424","9","3","8","20 February 2017"," The Wick Burns Brighter
","If you saw the first John Wick, then buckle up, because you are about to be in for a ride. This movie improves on the first in almost every way and was a visual spectacle.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 picks up right after the first movie ended with John having to deal with the unfinished business of his car. There is an unnecessary exposition about who John Wick is by the leader of the Russian gang that would only benefit those who are walking into this sequel blind but it is given by a man who was perfectly fit to be a Russian mob boss and who my brother actually thought should have played the boss in the first movie.<br/><br/>After that the movie goes completely into high gear with action around every corner, insane kills, lots of blood, and great cinematography. John and the viewer are thrust into the underworld we so briefly glimpsed in the first movie as he has to deal with some skeletons from his past and create a swath of skeletons in his wake. This movie will make you reconsider Mr. Wick on your totem pole of bad ass hit men and assassins. Every kill is so beautiful and insane and we are even treated to how the legend of him killing multiple people with a pencil came to be. As well as that, the kills are very realistic and blood. Many times I found myself laughing and clapping because of how insane and real they were. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is fantastic as the main character with is very slim dialogue but each word has power. You know John Wick is a kick ass guy when he can just say ""Sure"" in sign language and make it look cool. Common and Ruby Rose both stood out as great assassins to go up against John. As usual, the background and depth put into this underworld and society of assassins with their coins and hotels was flesh out and so interesting. There is a particular scene in Rome where John is sampling wine, er guns, and also getting a suit tailored that is priceless. <br/><br/>Despite a few missteps in dialogue and a gratuitous if arguably unnecessary cameo from Laurence Fishburne who is there mainly to give some winks and comedy to the camera, this movie is fantastic and heart pumping. Without a doubt one of the best action movies we will see this year and by the time you are finished you will want a Chapter 3, which is saying a lot in this day and age of unwanted and unneeded sequels.<br/><br/>The Wick burns brightly in this beautiful and well made sequel. I highly recommend this movie, especially to those who saw the first movie or who are looking for a great action movie. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy, because they don't deserve to see it. I also would not recommend this movie to my mom cause there is a lot of blood."
"HelenMary","7","3","8","20 February 2017"," more of the good stuff
","What can you say about John Wick2? Well Wow. I really enjoyed it. Chapter 2 is still slick, dark and gritty. Keanu is still gorgeous, ovviamente, beaten up and the deadliest thing both sides of the Atlantic (this time) and whilst he is bullet proof he's still barely standing; as it's apparently just a few days after the first one finishes. The story is still simple; people want to kill him, he wants to retire and be maudlin over his wife, and pet his new dog, and so he has to stop them by killing them first. Thing is, in JW2, more people need killing – someone from his past calls in a marker (a promised favour). <br/><br/>I had been itching to see JW2 since the first one left the cinema, and saw it on a Valentine's Day preview and wasn't disappointed. As sequels go, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the first, but it exceeded expectations by a long way. I loved it. Entertaining and exciting, some amazing kills by Reeves and his physicality again proved to be awesome; but whilst it's as good as the first one it doesn't have the emotional element or the more intimate settings and direct threats to his life. I say direct, I should say the whole film is a direct threat to his life but it's not so personal. Somehow. <br/><br/>The body count is like a first person shooter video game. If wall to wall violence isn't your thing, this film isn't for you. Reeves says more, and the scene is changed from NYC to Rome, and there's more story in terms of the ""high table"" underground royalty and the wider net of the Continental Hotel world; the Sommelier (awesome scene with Peter Serafinowitcz) and the Jewish bank vaults, the tailoring service etc as he prepares for his mission, but something of the original's slick noir, graphic novel feel and look is lost. Ian McShane is still wonderful as the Continental NYC ""King"" and Lance Reddick as the Concierge, Charon providing some very dry comic relief, and John Leguizamo puts in a reprise of his actual mechanic character – as opposed to a ""Mechanic"" like John himself. It's less subversive, and whilst watching the first one was like an entrée into a dark world, a clandestine peep, this one feels like it's all in the open and everyone knows about it.<br/><br/>The Italian bit is wonderfully showy and reminded me of the Vampire genre, but you have to contemplate how many hit men/women there are in the world that you can have a monarchy, a seeming government and entire community that large – and the Vatican is in on it – and it would appear that the whole population of NYC are trained assassins. It's more of the spectacle than the first and that was a negative for me. It is John Wick on a bigger scale sequels don't usually manage that (Terminator 2 is clearly the stand out exception) but this really does, but as I've said, it's bigger at a cost. It lost something in translation. <br/><br/>As said, it's bloodier than the first. Some of the splatter in close up kills in the first were shocking, but in Chapter 2 almost unnoticed in the carnage left in John's wake. At one point in the catacombs of Rome I wondered whether it wasn't all CGI as there were so many bodies being dispatched and you barely saw them and I got a bit bored – the scene went on too long and I started thinking it was all getting a bit silly. But then there are a few kills and scenes which were brilliant – and made audience members exclaim – the pencil scene (yes, he does it again with a pencil), the sumo Japanese guy, and the scene on the NYC metro with Common and the ""professional courtesy"" were very good to watch. Actually all Common and Reeves' fight scenes were very good, and the stunt men used were fantastic (I know Reeves does most of his stunts but I'm sure not for the stair falls). <br/><br/>I really enjoyed it. Easily as good as the first but different. Not as good overall, in the same way, but along the same lines. Some may think it better but either way it is very good cinema viewing – it can fill a big screen – and a must see if you like this sort of thing. Direction was good, clever, and trying to capture the artiness of the first, and doing a pretty good job but for me, it was a little too fantastical – stepping over the border from thriller/action to dark-fantasy. As with the first, it doesn't explain anything, you are dropped into the world of Wick and you have to find your own way. It still doesn't explain who he is but there is another shower scene where you see the tattoo hinting at his past. There are even hints to Reeves' career past as well; Laurence Fishburne on set with Reeves for the first time since the Matrix and they exchange a quote from the franchise. I am trying to think whether Reeves and Common (previously in Street Kings) have the same thing ""exigent circumstance"" or something. <br/><br/>I will see it again before it leaves the cinema."

","I hoping you've seen John Wick's 1st instalment. if not, go watch it now. Really, go watch it!<br/><br/>Sequels being better than their predecessor has been an age old debate. Very few live up to the task: The Wrath of Khan. Aliens. The Empire Strikes Back... You can 100% add John Wick: Chapter 2 to that exclusive list.<br/><br/>If John Wick was the starter, then Chapter 2 if most definitely the main course. Bigger and badder must of been the producer's goal.<br/><br/>The video game-esc action is beautifully ridiculous. The adrenaline pumping soundtrack does is job in enhancing the action further.<br/><br/>But, the most enjoying thing about John Wicks 2nd instalment is the story. The filmmakers have managed to open up the world of John Wick and given us enough to paint a very vivid picture of the underworld of a society where killers and assassins thrive. You'll be routing for John from the start to finish.<br/><br/>The 2 hours spent watching this film at my local movieplex were by far the finest time there in recent memory.<br/><br/>A must watch for action fans."
"memanishp","9","3","8","19 February 2017"," Absoute value for your time and money
","If you liked the first one, you would definitely love this one as well...fights are more violent..you get to see him use the pencil as well!!!!!! And the dialogues......don't over think..just watch the man perform and get entertained.. Rest of the lines are just to fill this damn pages All the fighting scenes were choreographed wonderfully according to my opinion. The guns shooting scenes were entirely cool. I loved all of them and there were no fighting scenes that took too long to finish. Keanu Reeves' portrayal of a retired hit-man who had no choice but to come back was really spot on. There were also some minor characters from the original movie who appeared in this sequel and also new character played by Laurence Fishburne whom I believed would play a large part in chapter 3. Yes, there would definitely be another sequel based on the ending of this movie, which really made me so excited and cannot wait for it to be released.<br/><br/>Aside from the very cool amazing action sequence, the sound effects of this movie was very good such as the sound of cars screeching, guns blazing and the voices of John and Cassian's heavy fight which I thought sounded very original. My recommendation if you want to watch this movie, it should be watched in a theater with good sound system. <br/><br/>this movie is definitely not for kids. For those of you who want to enjoy a pure action movie with Keanu Reeves as the main star, this one should not be missed. Don't forget to watch the original movie first so you would understand the story line. But for those who do not really enjoy this kind of movie (or cannot stand the bloody fight scenes), then this might not be suitable for you. <br/><br/>This is one heck of a movie and I for one truly enjoyed it and would recommend this movie to any fans of action movie."
"Carycomic","9","3","8","19 February 2017"," Apparently, they're planning to develop a full-fledged trilogy.
","I don't know if they'll succeed, though. I mean, I went to see this on a Saturday afternoon during Opening Weekend...and there were only about a dozen people there (myself, included)! <br/><br/>Disconcerting? Yes. A guarantor of box office failure? Not necessarily.<br/><br/>I, for one, liked the way it expanded on John Wick's backstory. In the first movie, Nico Tarasov describes to his know-nothing son how John was given a seemingly impossible task to perform in exchange for being allowed to retire and marry his beloved Helen. We now learn, in this sequel, that John successfully accomplished it only because of unspecified help provided by Santino D'Antonio of the Camorra (a real- life Neapolitan version of the more infamous Mafia). <br/><br/>Having learned of John's one-man vendetta against the Tarasovs, Santino uses that opportunity to collect on that debt...in the form of his own sister's assassination. And thus begins a series of ever-escalating fights and shoot-outs. Not only with Gianna D'Antonio's vengeance- seeking bodyguard, Cassian. But, also, the henchmen of the double- crossing Santino...led by a seemingly mute lesbian tomboy. <br/><br/>Needless to say, Santino ultimately pays for his treachery. But, it comes at a tremendous price for John. Namely; permanent disownment by the CEO of the Continental Hotel chain (which provides neutral ground lodging for all globe-trotting hit men and women). Now, personally, I think John did Sir Winston a favor. I mean, if Santino was willing to stoop to having his own sister killed, just to become king of all organized crime in New York City, would he really have stopped there? <br/><br/>I don't think so. An ambitious narcissist, like him, would eventually have strove to become the only one sitting at the High Table. Perhaps, even new and sole owner of the Continental Hotel chain! And I think Sir Winston realized that, too. Why else give John one hour's grace with regard to the internationalizing of the open contract put out on his life by Santino? <br/><br/>At any rate, this cliff-hanger ending sets up the expectation that there will be a third and final chapter. One that will hopefully further expand on the now twice-mentioned ""impossible task."" For example: did it involve the death of Santino and Gianna's father? If so, do either of them have any offspring of their own (legit or otherwise) looking to avenge their deaths at John Wick's expense? Most importantly of all; will John get his beloved Mach 1 Mustang back?<br/><br/>Until that third question is answered ""yes,"" I only give this nine out of ten stars."

","Three years after we were first introduced to the character of John Wick in an action movie that blew audiences away and showed modern day actioners how to deliver stylish and comprehensible action sequences, he's back in John Wick: Chapter 2, and with him he's bringing plenty more action.<br/><br/>Having been dragged out of retirement to exact revenge on a gang that killed his dog and stole his car, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) learns he must repay a debt before he can think about leaving the life he fought so hard to get out of in the first place.<br/><br/>The trouble is, when you're such a legend in the criminal underworld, it's hard to make a return without going unnoticed, leading to a large bounty being put on Wick's head, leading to an onslaught of blood and bullets.<br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2 takes the phrase ""Go big or go home"" and drives it home with extreme amounts of bravado, Derek Kolstad's writing expanding the world of assassins established so well in the first film and Chad Stahelski's confident direction moving the film along at such a blistering pace.<br/><br/>As with the first film, the highlight of this sequel is the action sequences, both choreographed to perfection and gorgeously shot by Dan Laustsen, seamlessly flowing from headshot to headshot. They're as brutal as they were in the first film, including a glorious kill involving a pencil that had the audience flinching that comes in one of the best movie montages of recent years. <br/><br/>This is a serious film but there is certainly a sense of fun when it comes to some of the action sequences, whether it be the etiquette shown by the assassins when on continental grounds or a quite brilliant moment between John Wick and Common's Cassian during their chase through a subway station that had me in stitches. The score from Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard suitably accompanies the action sequences too, the finale in particular set to a more classical theme makes this feel like a ballet of bullets, each hitting their mark with the precision required for such a dance.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, we all know Keanu Reeves is not the greatest actor on the planet but the dedication he shows to a character that has given him such recognition is certainly commendable. I've seen footage of Reeves training for this shoot and his accuracy on the shooting range at such speed is scary to say the least and he well and truly brings it with him to the film, making John Wick such an efficient killing machine. I liked the supporting performances too; Laurence Fishburne in particular hamming it up to the max while both Common and Ruby Rose make for quite formidable enemies to Wick.<br/><br/>With John Wick: Chapter 2, Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves have collaborated again to deliver brutal action aplenty in a pulsating sequel that is worthy to follow the awesome original. Just wait for the final scene, if that doesn't get you excited for the potential of a third John Wick film, what the hell are you doing watching these films?!"
"lewisideson","10","3","8","19 February 2017"," Spectacular
","Chpater 2 deserves credit for being a better film than the amazing first john wick with even more action and different motivations. In this installment we see Wick forced to return to his old life yet again when he must complete a task for the man who helped him leave his assassin life in the first place.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 contains just as much emotion as the first with even more action all of which intense. Like the first there are many gunfights and fist fights and even a car chase straight from the get go as it starts with wick chasing a guy on a bike then attacking the brother of the man he had killed not long before only to let the man live in the name of peace. Throughout Wicks humanity is explored as his motivations change, he lets people live because he's not out for revenge, when he spared cassian I got the sense that there was mutual respect between the two but also couldn't help but wonder if, like the first film, he was out for revenge he would've killed cassian and later on Ares although I'm not sure if the latter actually survived. Speaking of cassian and Ares I really liked both, cassian appeared to have a history with wick and was after him for what the latter had done (Wick kind of killed his ward Gianna) and Ares spoke only with sign language, and as I don't like to speak much I found that really cool. Now this time round I have a clear negative although one that isn't really a negative if you don't let it bother you that negative being the familiarity of some of the fights. The cassian fight was something new another person able to hold his own against Wick but sometimes the fights were just moves we had seen before in the first John Wick still it didn't really affect the experience. John Wick chapter 2 is to John Wick what the empire strikes back is to a new hope, an improvement on a film that was itself brilliant anyway it definitely deserves a 10"

","John Wick: Chapter 2 is the sequel to the incredibly surprising (in a good way) John Wick. It takes place 5 days after the original, and it never slows down. John Wick: Chapter 2 has a lot going for it... whether it is incredibly choreographed action sequences or an awesome Keanu Reeves, you are getting a lot more than what you paid for. I have heard arguments saying that the story of the movie is sub par, but I don't think that the main focus is on the story. I don't think the story is bad for that matter. I do think that an argument can be made that some of the character motivations are flawed, and the action can definitely be in bad taste. However I enjoyed the movie a lot and I respected how great the quality of the movie was. John Wick: Chapter 2 is the best movie that you can see right now (unless family is over) and I suggest that it is the next thing that you see."
"siew_hong","9","3","8","19 February 2017"," Fabulous. Loved it totally...
","I saw the first John Wick on DVD on the recommendation of a friend. I loved it completely. The storyline was simple. In a sense, it is reminiscent of the chop-socky kungfu movies that I grew up with where the principal theme is revenge. Tarantino had taken that and made it his own in Kill Bill. Keanu Reeves was great as the glowering, silent anti-hero. The cinematography was great too, as was the assassin universe that Wick inhabits. <br/><br/>There was an Easter Egg in JW1 that really made the movie for me. There is of course, that (repeated) reference about the pencil. Who does that?? When I heard that line, my mind shifted to Shibumi by Trevanian. I have heard that Keanu Reeves had optioned the rights to that book and I would love to watch the movie IF it ever gets made. I seriously doubt it. I won't go into the plot of Shibumi here but suffice to say it features (another) retired world class hit man who could kill with a pencil. Later on in JW1 - when Wicks was entering the driving practice range, there was a one-second shot of the guard at the gate reading the book. Yes.. he was reading Shibumi. Although I seem to recall that he was holding the book upside down. <br/><br/>Like I said, that made JW1 THE MOVIE for me. John Wick was clearly modelled on/influenced by Nicholas Hel. <br/><br/>Fast forward to 2017. I eagerly waited for JW2 and I was not disappointed. The old friends are back - Aurelio the Mechanic, Jimmy the policeman (working again, John?), Charon the concierge (How good to see you again so soon, Mr Wick) , Winston the manager/owner of the Intercontinental. Everyone is so polite in this uber violent universe. <br/><br/>Of course, there are new characters - Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King, Cassian the bodyguard of the Mafia princess, Ares the silent androgynous sidekick of the bad guy. The assassin universe was enlarged and I want to find out more about it. <br/><br/>What I liked in particular was the other Easter Egg references to other beloved canons. The use of the ductwork in the huge administrative centre was so reminiscent of Brazil. The giant bathtub of the Mafia princess was (to me) another nod to Trevanian as I was instantly reminded of Jonathan Hemlock's bathtub at his home in a converted church on Long Island. Of course, Laurence Fishburne evokes The Matrix. The hall of mirrors brought back Scaramanga's setup in The Man With The Golden Gun. <br/><br/>Others have shared at length about the action and there isn't much more I can say on that count. It was great. The violence was extreme yet economical. I was a fan and I remain a fan. <br/><br/>I am sure there are heaps more Easter Eggs that I have missed. Please share if you spot anything. <br/><br/>I wonder what happened to the teaser set in Scandinavia? Is that for JW3? I can't wait...."

","Reeves at 52 is the undisputed king of the modern ""man's thriller"" and deservedly so.<br/><br/>I recall before the release of Wick 2 catching an interview with Reeves where he assured his many fans that Wick 2 would be even better than Wick 1 because so much time and energy (and money) had gone into the script.<br/><br/>And he was sincere.<br/><br/>Just as sincere as the many mainstream critics who panned Wick 1 but astonishingly have fallen in love with Wick 2...???????? Because at the end of the day, our society is an upside down society and most everything today from geopolitics to finance to film works backwards.<br/><br/>Wick 1 was a great film, the rarest of all things, an unexpected hit. It was a hit because it was pure and simple and the idea of man pining for his lost wife going to war over a car and a dog seemed ... right.<br/><br/>Wick 2 is one of the most contrived and over-written scripts I have ever seen. And Reeves was being completely honest when he said that a great deal of effort had gone into this production. Because, once they had a surprise hit on their hands, the producers moved into ""franchise"" mode and set about building an income stream, a brand, on the corpse of the first film -- which had nothing going for it except sincerity, good intentions, and outright class.<br/><br/>A film reviewer is supposed to help viewers refine their own tastes and see beyond the obvious.<br/><br/>I promise you that in years to come, more people will watch and cherish the first film than this loud and brassy pyrotechnic clone."
"shivamt25","8","3","8","18 February 2017"," Welcome Back, Mr. Wick!
","I've been waiting for this one for I don't even remember how long. Since I watched its John Wick in 2014, I became a fan of this character. John Wick, living a dull life, keeping it to himself and far away from the world. But when you mess with him, he will end you.<br/><br/>First of all, I would like to say that I loved the first movie. I watched it, then I rewind it and watched all the action scenes again. It was classy, smooth, had great background score and most importantly, all the action scenes were so well choreographed that it looked like as if they were dancing.<br/><br/>So naturally, my expectations were too high when I went today to watch Chapter 2 and I must say, it was every bit as awesome as the first movie. It was all there! The attributes of the chapter 1 which made me love it so much. The style, the class, sexy action sequences, the fear that the name 'John Wick' brings upon the faces of the bad guys, the slight humor about his retirement, his (another) dog etc. made it an apt sequel. Chapter 2 is similar to its predecessor on so many levels but still offers so much more. For example, a jaw-dropping ending which left the audience wanting more.<br/><br/>The cinematography is definitely better. As far as the performance goes, Keanu Reeves never disappoints me. I like all of his performances but now I think I will always remember him in this avatar, as John Wick. The supporting cast did their part pretty well. There were some old faces, mostly new. Special credit should be given to Riccardo Scamarcio, who played Santino D'Antonio. Along with that, I liked Ruby Rose as well. She played a silent sexy killer. She was mute, but even she had some kick-ass dialogues, shown translated on screen! <br/><br/>I loved the experience I had watching this movie. The deafening sound of the guns, the flashing lights, the flying bad guys and (a small spoiler :)) the bloody pencils! That is why I suggest you go and watch it in theaters as soon as possible. If you like the first movie, I am sure you will definitely like this one too. <br/><br/>I don't know how long will they take to bring out its third installment but it better be quick."
"matthewssilverhammer","8","3","8","17 February 2017"," Yeah, I'm thinking he's back...again
","Only 2 films in, the ""Wick"" franchise is already a better version of what the Fast / Furious movies aim to be: over-the-top, silly action extravaganzas. Highly stylized, committed and just-self-aware-enough, it walks its bloody-tightrope between parody and sincerity with nearly as much skill as Wick has for killing baddies. While not as qualitatively surprising as its predecessor, Chapter 2 is still a brutally exciting and smartly hilarious romp. We open with Wick tying up some loose-ends from his last vengeance-fueled rampage. A 15-minute barrage of blood and high-stakes bumper cars, it took everything within me not to fist-pump a dozen times right away. As long as he's not trying to emotionally connect with his costars, Reeves is great. He and director Stahelski give us fights and chases that are just so much better than much of what America produces. From the humorous use of random weapons to the quiet nonchalance of a mall shoot-out to the climactic combat in a house-of-mirrors, it won't leave you wanting. From there, we're given a relatively contained narrative about John being dragged back in to this wonderfully mysterious world of suit-cladded, manners-following, rule-abiding assassins. It's a cliché, but the world-building really is great, getting into the minutiae and aftermath of the movie violence we're often immune to. All this made me wonder: maybe THIS is the American answer to Bond. Not Bourne, not Hunt, not Reacher; Wick. He fights with efficiency, he broods with purpose, he's appropriately lauded and feared, and Reeves (while great) doesn't ""own"" the character. And as long as these films stay this insanely fun, I welcome a future spending multiple hours in John Wick's gleefully violent world."
"piotrsarnowski","1","3","9","21 June 2017"," Total waste of time
","Me, I lost approximately 40 minutes on this movie, and it was definitely too much. It even started promising but as quickly let down entirely. In a futile search for any plot I swiftly came to the end of this show to get the ""whole idea"" of what it is all about. This is a pure action film (100% action) with nothing in between. By watching parts of it I came to conclusion that it was addressed to wide/narrow (delete as appropriate) auditorium of people who somehow save some of their computer playing time to check out how others deal (here Keanu Reeves) with the problem of maximizing number of kills in a limited time frame. It was more or less like a recorded Counter Strike computer game or such by some record pursuing computer geek. <br/><br/>Having said that I'm beginning to wonder about the relevance of IMB ratings over the recent years. Hell, the rating this movie actually has is not that far from 250 list. Such masterpiece as ""Heat"" being categorized as similar genre (action, crime, drama) is not far from that worthless garbage (8,2). One may think where the present cinema is heading? Luckily one may find nowadays something worth watching within the range of 5,0-6,5 - something I would have never even been trying to do as far as couple of years back."

","I would say I was a moderate fan of the original John Wick film before seeing this one. However, Chapter 2 really took things to the next level. The film is written well enough to set up all of the pieces in play for the action sequences that take place. Fortunately, the film is unpretentious in what it is aiming to do. The biggest strength it has is its director and cinematographer, both capturing so many great visual details and elements that make the film come to life. From a technical standpoint, the film is dazzling and it's just such a huge joy to watch. Highly recommended for action fans."

","I stumbled upon John Wick 2 while flipping channels. After hearing various humans rave about John Wick 3, I decided to watch #2. Terrible film: 1) Keanu Reeves' offered not a whit of acting. He merely walked around 'trying' to appear menacing. 2) Numerous shootouts and nominal story does not result in a good film. 3) The fight/gun choreography was silly. Dozens of mercenaries with a variety of weaponry, were all incapable of incapacitating Wick. 4) Wick was essentially hurt throughout the movie, yet he was at all times better than his adversaries... ridiculous. 5) Wick is also the stupidest assassin on the planet. He was tasked to eliminate a character who chose to commit suicide in front of him. Yet, he also shot the target when he did not have to. He was under no time pressure (they were engaged in casual banter without urgency), so he could have simply waited to ensure the target was dead and then vanished. A perfect assassination, right? Instead, by shooting the target, he ensured a sense of corruption associated with the death. Further, he could have escaped unseen - as he had arrived - but Wick tried to leave in/among a crowd.

They chose to have the actors walk around with their fingers on the trigger. They chose to make suppressors so quiet people standing in a subway weren't even aware someone was shooting right next to their ear. They chose to put ridiculously tacticool firearms in the movie, with unnecessary tactical reloads, press checks, 3 gun shotshell carrier belts, wild over dramatic 2 handed pistol canting. You name it they did it. I didn't think Hollywood could make gun owners look worse, but they succeeded. <br/><br/>That's not even my main complaint with the movie. My main complaint is Keanu Reeves can't act. Nobody in this movie can act. The plot sucks, and the entire thing feels like a subliminal advertisement for the occult. The suicide scene was disgusting. The music, sets and wardrobe were highly sadistic. Hollyweird isn't even hiding the fact that they're all Satan worshiping human sacrificing perverts anymore. Seriously sick movie. I do not recommend, unless you like being brainwashed into normalizing the occult and Satanic behavior. No, it's not some conspiracy theory, watch for yourself and tell me it isn't disgusting."

I know that this movie is obviously based on an unrealistic world, but the ending really confuses me, what was the whole deal with Winston controlling all those pedestrians? In this review I will try to give some possible reasons as to how he was able to do that:<br/><br/>1) He probably paid all those random people a large sum of money to order them to walk around and surround John Wick (which I think is the most 'realistic' view, but this whole world is unrealistic so who knows).<br/><br/>2) All those pedestrians are actually all working for Winston, so they are all criminals basically.<br/><br/>3) They are actually Androids created and controlled by Winston (which sounds unlikely, but everything about this movie is unlikely).<br/><br/>Also I know that this is a GTA-esque world, but just the fact that literally everybody in NYC is a hit-man is kind of lame.

It was too gut wrenching to watch this knowing the tragedy that unfolded on our TV's all day and the many lives senselessly lost to madmen using religion as a crutch. I know it's not the first movie to have a similar scene, which is unfortunate for Director Chad Stahelski and his cast and crew.

","They should have just called this The Matrix's 20 year reunion. If only because we get to see Reeves and Fishburne share the screen again. Oh wait, there's also Chad Stahelski who was Keanu's stunt double in The Matrix. He now wears the Director's hat in this (wince!) movie and what a mess he makes. After watching and rehashing this movie, I now get it. A Director with a background in stunt work will make a (oh shock) stunt movie! That's what this is from beginning to end. The baddies seem to loathe guns and this is understandable since they are terrible shots anyway. This sets up the scene nicely for some good-old hand-to-hand combat. The fight scenes should have been Stahelski's forte and though refreshing, (it's been a while since we had some good hand to hand fights) brought nothing new to the table. Some of the moves seemed rehashed from the previous Wick movie. Most of these fights seemed a little too choreographed with no spontaneity, not to mention that Keanu pushing 50 plus seemed sluggish in some scenes. Don't get me wrong, his performance was commendable. It's nothing that some good camera work and a little spit and polish editing couldn't have cleaned up. <br/><br/>And now back to the baddies and boy were they legion! Wave after wave of mindless 'lets rush him' mentality that has no root in reality. Why oh why the poor sods chose to run gun in hand towards Keanu's character and only shoot when they are a foot from him is beyond me! What gave me a chuckle though was the video game mentality that was employed throughout the movie. You know what I mean...where when you deal with some of the bad guys on one level (nevermind that a few remain) and proceed to the next level they don't pursue your character. Why baddie No.1 and his henchmen seemed to lose the 'thrill' of the chase and disappear immediately Wick runs into baddie No.2 and his cohorts is a case in point...only for them to reappear after he has dispatched the second lot. Wouldn't that have been a perfect opportunity for the two groups of baddies to come to some arrangement and gang up on him? And don't get me started on Wick's near invincibility. I mean this man was shot at many many times, with one incredible shot from point blank range! He was also stabbed and run over by a car multiple times...but nothing a little bandage and an IV couldn't fix. He was up and about in no time with just a few scratches on his face for his troubles.<br/><br/>Sigh, I could go on and on about the mindlessness of it all but what's the point, I think you get the picture. Suffice it to say that this movie is about the inane violent fight scenes. Suspend disbelief (and intelligence) and forget about an engaging plot line or some emotional attachment to any of the aspects of the movie, characters included. You'll forget it immediately you leave the theater. Which is such a shame considering the stellar cast assembled here and with such a wealth of experience. As the credits roll, I can't help but reminisce about Reeves and Fishburne in 'The Matrix' and wonder what The Wachowski's who directed it would have done with this rough gem of a movie. Ah, if only wishes were horses..."
"ConqueringRuler","8","2","5","24 May 2017"," An action movie how it should be!
","John Wick was a blast and a welcome addition to the action genre, like ""Dredd"" or ""Punisher: Warzone"", it was pure action without much distraction. Chapter 2 follows that path. It starts of kind of slow, but maybe I just expected little too much, you can't do action and acrobatic head shots all the time. But after the stage is set, John Wick is doing what John Wick is doing best. And it's just a hell of a good time to watch him doing that. And the one-liner he delivers are cheesy but still great. Maybe one comparison that comes to mind would be John Woo's ""Hard-Boiled"" or ""The Killer"". It's like a John Woo flick if he wouldn't suck now."
"The-Sarkologist","3","2","5","22 May 2017"," More of the Same
","Maybe it is the case of not judging a film by its movie poster, or maybe it is just another case of me expecting way to much from a film that eventually delivered little. Okay, the first movie was awesome – no doubt about that – but it felt as if a sequel really wasn't warranted. In fact after watching this film I came to realise that it was the case that there probably was no need for there to be a sequel. In a way the film seemed to fall quite flat and in the end it simply seemed to be basically more of the same, which is one of the biggest problems when it comes to sequels. Okay, it could have also been because I was tired, but a good movie does tend to bring me out of that.<br/><br/>The film basically starts after the first one finishes, and the one thing left open was the fact that the Russian Mafia still had his car – so he basically rectifies that. Well, that one door was closed pretty quickly, but it is opened again when we discover that there was a reason why John Wick managed to get out of the industry, and that is because he made a metaphorical deal with the devil, and the devil comes knocking asking for payback, and basically John Wick is obliged (or should I say more than obliged) to help.<br/><br/>The idea is that there is this round table of crime bosses, and the guy that Wick owes the favour to wants a seat at the table. The problem is that his sister has taken the seat, so he is given the order to go and kill her. This is something that Wick doesn't particularly want to do, but he does it anyway. However, he decides that if she can't sit at the table, then he can't either, however like the previous film the antagonist puts a hit out on John, and this one is much, much higher that the price from the previous film.<br/><br/>So, what we have is, as I have suggested, is more of the same. Wick is out to deal with a painful part of his life, and the antagonist basically throws absolutely everything at him, which Wick manages to get through. However, like the previous film, there is a twist at the end (which I won't reveal) that leaves up open for a third, and final, film. Mind you, after having watched two of them, I have pretty much come to the conclusion what the third film is going to be about – every assassin on Earth is gunning for John Wick. However, honestly, I probably won't be able to predict the end because I suspect that there is going to be a bit of a twist as well (he probably dies). Anyway, if you like more of the same, then sure thing, but if you don't then don't bother."

"Troy_Campbell","8","2","5","20 May 2017"," Suave and brutal
","The follow-up to 2014's surprise smash hit is much the same of what came before. And it's brilliant. Completely, unashamedly, couldn't-give-a-damn brilliant. It sticks close to its barebones formula: Wick reluctantly comes out of hit-man retirement, some idiot decides to double cross him, Wick goes on a killing spree that makes Rambo look like a humanitarian. The simplicity of the plot allows director Chad Stahelski—with his extensive background in action choreography—to focus on what is most important; brutal, balletic and innovative set pieces. Combining bruising close quarters combat, methodically stylish gun battles and subwoofer-breaking car carnage, the action sequences are rushes of pure adrenaline. The second act showpiece set in the Colosseum is an early contender for best set piece of the year. What amplifies the awesomeness of the action is the lack of rapid editing and messy cuts, the lengthy, uninterrupted shots showcasing not only the classy choreography but also the immense effort put in by Keanu Reeves to perform majority of the stunts. Reeves has long been known as a dedicated action star ever since his gigantic input into the Matrix trilogy, however, at age 53, his commitment is as astounding as ever. He's crafting John Wick—all stoic heroism and suave ferociousness—into a memorable action hero. John Wick: Chapter 2 offers no surprises narratively or tonally, but delivers all the imaginative, kick-arse action you could ask for in a movie."

"Robyn_Grant","10","2","5","18 May 2017"," Hide the pencils secret assassins, the Boogeyman is back...
","It's only a few hours since he killed every living Russian in New York City but he wants his stolen 1969 Ford Mustang back. Within the first ten minutes of Chapter 2 gun-fu, kung-fu and car-fu ensues with the best ""I'm stealing my own car back from you"" scene E.V.E.R. Seriously excellent car-fu stunt driving and by the end it doesn't really matter that much that the car being retrieved isn't really much of a car anymore. <br/><br/>JW wants to again retire but gets a visit from an Italian assassin who hands him a marker, basically an IOU coin, which JW must honour as this man helped him leave the assassin life 5 years earlier to be with his then living wife, Helen. The Italian wants his sister dead so that he can ascend to the High Table, a group of powerful assassins. JW at first refuses and feels the wrath of the angry Italian but thereafter realises if he doesn't help this Italian that his life will be in danger. JW travels to Rome to kill the Italian's sister. He gets a nice new suit, guns himself up and heads to the nightclub to kill the sister. JW finds the sister and allows her to die the way she wants to die but before leaving the nightclub bumps into the sister's bodyguard, played by rapper/actor/film producer/poet Common and then the kung-fu/gun-fu begins again. The killing was so hectic that I unfortunately forgot to do a body count. But it was full on, action packed and looked bloody convincing to me and the best thing is not one innocent person got shot. Bloody dam near perfect to me. JW and Common chase each other through the crowded streets in Rome but JW manages to make it back to the Continental Hotel (the safe haven) so they can't kill each other. In true assassin code they sit down and have a drink together at the bar and JW tells Common that the Italian ordered him to kill the sister.<br/><br/>When JW heads back to New York the Italian decides to double cross him and puts a $7M bounty on his head. Now everyone in New York City wants to kill John Wick! ""I heard he once killed three men in a bar with a pencil, a f**g PENCIL...!"" Secret assassins from every nook and cranny in New York City come out to try their luck at killing the Boogeyman. JW again bumps into Common, this time on the subway and a fight ensues. An extremely entertaining and stylised gun-fu chase happens with the every day public none the wiser to the attempted killing, either that or they are just too used to that sort of stuff going down... <br/><br/>JW then bumps into an old assassin Morpheus (sorry, I mean Laurence Fishburne). They sit and reminisce about old times and how JW once spared Morpheus' life and that Morpheus should now help Neo (sorry, I mean JW). Morpheus tells Neo where to find the Italian. There is no mention of a red or blue pill...<br/><br/>JW heads off to find the Italian before he takes his place at the High Table of assassins. People die. Lots of people. Brilliant gun-fu chase through a hall of mirrors exhibition in the museum (where the hell did they hide the cameras and production crew for this scene?). Deaf/mute girl (Ruby Rose) who is an assassin associate of the Italian fights JW here. He finally catches up with the Italian at the Continental after every other person in New York City is dead (I'm pretty sure). Winston (who runs the Continental) informs John that the High Table have marked him as ex-communicado and doubled the bounty on his head to $14M - every assassin in the whole wide world will be after him now! Because Winston is JW's mentor he gives him one hour to escape before putting the word out about the new bounty. He runs off into New York City with his unnamed pit bull in tow. This is where the third instalment of John Wick will begin from.<br/><br/>Acting - 5/5 - All characters held up well, were convincing Storyline -5/5 - rather detailed story line, I especially like how they write the dialogue on screen to emphasise it, or to translate it from Italian/Russian, or if it is hard to understand the foreigner's English Action sequences - 5/5 - the pre-movie training involved in the kung-fu, car-fu and gun-fu is outstanding. I especially liked the gun handling skills that JW portrayed in the film Cinematography - 5/5 - the buildings they filmed in, the camera angles used, the lighting (lots of scenes of JW half in/half out of light), the use of colour (or lack of it) in the film People I want to see in the next instalment - John Wick (obviously...), Morpheus, Winston, Helen (they have kept his dead wife so mysterious), unnamed pit bull, the guy that fixes up his car.<br/><br/>The movie showed great insight into the underground workings of the assassin world and in doing so set it up well for a third instalment. The film was directed by Chad Stahelski. Chad was Keanu Reeves stunt double in The Matrix trilogy. For that reason alone, I believe the John Wick movies are THE BEST action films of all time. Realistic and hardcore. John Wick the character, even though he is an assassin, is likable. He only kills the bad dudes. Not one innocent bystander gets hurt. He loved his wife, he loved his puppy and he loves his car. John Wick: Chapter 2 is as good as the first movie and I highly recommend that you see it on the big screen."
"mohamedloai","5","2","5","14 May 2017"," this is not a movie
","first i'm big fan of action movies and watched a lot of this movies and should say this thing what they called it a movie is video game not movie the action and the kill scenes belong to video game not a movie with zero realistic even for movie very sad some people love to watch a lot of blood in the movie and this is their right but they are becoming blind for the movie quality and misjudge it also the story of the movie is weak and stupid this is my opinion"
"AlexFalzon","7","2","5","10 May 2017"," Not quite as good as the first, but still a pleasure to watch.
","John Wick was not the kind of film that needed a sequel. He's a retired hit-man, his wife dies, she leaves him a dog, the dog gets killed, he wants revenge. Cool. Simple. Easy.<br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter Two begins what feels like maybe a week after the end of the first movie. John is called back into service by a ""marker"" from an old acquaintance, which compels him to do one final job under penalty of death. Reluctantly, he returns to the business once more.<br/><br/>Something that is pretty interesting is the world that gets explored a little more than it did in the first. We learn more about this mysterious organisation which accepts and distributes assassination contracts to its members. The markers didn't appear in the first film, and neither did specialist shopkeepers who appear to exist only to equip and cater to these professionals. It also seems to be an almost-socialist operation, as they exchange gold coins for services, regardless of what that service may be. A single coin can get you two drinks or a suite at a hotel. In the first film it buys a man a hotel room and a body-cleanup. It appears that everyone scratches each other's back, and a token is given in exchange for a service. The coins themselves seem to be worth ""one favour"", rather than carrying any intrinsic value.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves does a great job playing Wick, who is a man of few words. He appears to do many of his own stunts and fight- choreography, too, and that was great. Riccardo Scamarcio is believable and enjoyable as Santino D'Antonio (the old friend that calls in Wick's favour), though of course doesn't quite fill the shoes of the last film's Michael Nyqvist (who could?).<br/><br/>As action films go, it's also very good. It's more of the same, but in the best possible way, and you have a great time watching the filmmakers come up with lots of exciting new ways to shoot bad guys at close range. There are a couple of regrettable moments where the bad guys decide to attack Wick one at a time, while the others watch and twiddle their thumbs before taking their turn, which felt a little artificial, but for the most part it really is incredible how unrelenting the violence is. It goes on for so long while remaining exciting. After five or six minutes of nonstop action without a break, you still just do not get bored, which I find incredible.<br/><br/>Part of this obviously lies in the editing, which is fantastic. At one point Wick is attacked by three assassins in a row, but we watch all three attacks at the same time, cutting between them. It's very well done. What did annoy me (and the first film did this, too) are the film's obnoxious subtitles. Often, one word in a sentence will be a different colour for no good reason. It's pretentious and distracting, and it takes away from the scene.<br/><br/>It's a fun film. It's not quite as good as the first, but it was still a pleasure to watch. I would think they'll do at least one more film to bring it to a trilogy, and while I look forward to that, I can't see it improving in quality. The first John Wick didn't need a sequel, and this movie needs one even less.<br/><br/> But I do wish we would've seen a wrap-up or pay-off to Cassian's storyline.<br/><br/>http://alexfalzon.com/ - for other reviews"
"diac228","8","2","5","17 April 2017"," In action, more is good. John Wick Chapter Two is much, much, much more
","Whether you love or hate Matrix Reloaded, the film wrote the modern successful blockbuster sequel rules:<br/><br/>1) Bring back everybody, add a few new faces 2) Jack up the stakes of the conflict 3) Increase the scope 4) Expand the universe and the origin story 5) Go absolutely crazy on the second half 6) Leave the audience asking for more, while promising more<br/><br/>The Matrix Reloaded has more action, more insanity, and more juicy content than the original. It may not be overall superior to the 1999 sci-fi masterpiece, but it wasn't for lack of trying. We were still thrilled (The Highway Scene remains an incredible work of cinema) and were left begging for more from the franchise. Matrix Revolutions was an utter disaster, but that's another story.<br/><br/>Hardly are action sequels better than the original, even the good ones struggle matching up to the film its following. John Wick: Chapter Two however is not only better than the first, but is the best action movie since Mad Max: Fury Road. Chapter Two takes the excellent stuntwork and camera-work of the original and turns it up a few notches with a better budget, larger run time, and oh so much more carnage.<br/><br/>Part of the glee and joy of the original surprise-surprise hit was the intriguing premise being intertwined with well-directed and choreographed action. Assassins having this special code and hidden locations where one can interact and be safely tucked away from violence was a fresh spin on an otherwise stale concept of secret assassins existing all over the world. Chapter Two explores this further by expanding past the United States and digging into foreign locale. Although the scope is larger, the movie actually suffers slightly from having to explain the rules and regulations to its audience before unleashing all the mayhem.<br/><br/>Action movies struggle the most in balancing content and story, because we see action movies not for the story but for what can be delivered within the script. Chapter Two's opening half is entirely plot-driven except for the sequence preceding the opening credits. Take the entertaining car fight away, and you wouldn't get a gun battle until 45 minutes in. But The Raid 2 also has a slow opening third before delivering some of the best action ever put to celluloid, so the ticking time bomb formula works as long as you fully commit to the chaos. Chapter Two is saved because the twist halfway unveils a dilemma that guarantees a relentless outpouring of action. And boy did they deliver.<br/><br/>Once the true conflict actually arises from seemingly out of nowhere, we are treated to a beefy stew of gun fights, hand-to-hand combat, cleverly drawn-out showdowns, and even an Enter the Dragon-like climax towards the end. Just like in the original, Chad Stahelski uses his skills as a stunt coordinator and experience in the action film industry to carve out some killer sequences where the body count is high, the action is easy and clear to see, the sound mixing is top-notch, and lastly the camera-work rivals that of your best sweeping epics. The pacing is consistent, the special effects is kept to a minimum to focus more on stunts, and the violence is gritty and organic. The variety is also great, as we have a concert shootout, a subway battle, a museum chase, and an exchange of bullets and punches in the historical parts of Rome.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves may not win any acting Oscars, but his approach to action movies deserves some mention. In here he does nearly all his own stunts (driving and gun battling included) and garners sympathy as a man that clearly wants to leave his old life while grieving over his loss. Adding to the fun is a good cast of minor characters each with their moment to shine, each with their vital role in the doozy of a flick. Lastly, we are left wanting more, even you though you have to feel for the obviously crappy month John Wick is experiencing.<br/><br/>John Wick Chapter Two won't change cinema like The Raid nor will it set a benchmark like Mad Max: Fury Road. Nonetheless it improves upon the original flaws and all because you get a healthier dosage of action-packed fun that is full of variety, creativity, and superb intense precision. If you like your action bloody and raw like the best we've seen this decade (Raid, Raid 2, Mad Max) then you will not be disappointed in the least bit here. Between this and the upcoming Atomic Blonde, it's good to see American filmmakers finally stepping up on their uncut action skills.<br/><br/>Blog: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/"
"billytyner","3","2","5","2 April 2017"," (Spoilers) Good at first, then turns ridiculous.
","I liked the first movie, and this was interesting until about a third of the way through. Then it just becomes ridiculous. About a hundred assassins follow him into the catacombs and wave after wave just throw themselves at him shooting blindly and never hitting him. These trained assassins are the lousiest shots in the history of movies. Where did they train? Camp Snoopy?? They don't pull out their guns until he's within arm's reach, they let him walk past but don't shoot him from behind, they all wait until he turns around and all their shots miss him, which is insane. He gets shot once by woman in his side and yet he kills hundreds of men alone, by himself. The men have no sense of strategy, they all just rush him to let him shoot them in the head. Bullets fly from a dozen men yet not one hits him, not even countless ricochets .About a dozen times, he could have been easily killed, yet no one actually thinks to kill when he is actually vulnerable. They wait until he starts shooting at them. It's just ludicrous. Without this huge body count, this could have been a decent movie if they made it realistic. Some pull out knives to go one on one with him, which of course he always wins. Just shoot him! The Girl Scouts could kill him sooner than these inept oafs. The ending is a set-up for a third movie which no doubt he will kill by himself hundreds more trained killers who can't actually shoot a gun."

If that doesn't ring a bell, then you will need to refresh your memory and watch again the dialogue between Neo and Morpheus.<br/><br/>This is a great action movie because:<br/><br/>The heart-pounding action starts with an insane car chase scene from the first second of the flick and it barely stops at the very end of the film.<br/><br/>I was totally blown away by the masterfully choreographed fight scenes and by the intensity of the plot.<br/><br/>It grabs you, it puts you right on the edge of your seat and then squeezes you only to leave you breathless and wanting for more.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves trained Jiu Jitsu for four months to prepare for his role and he executes 90% of his stunts. The effect is visible-the character fits him perfectly.<br/><br/>The 53 years old actor is in great shape and shows spectacular weaponry and fighting skills.<br/><br/>His on-screen feud with Common (Cassian) leads to some stunning one on one fights between both characters.

"stepvest","8","2","5","8 March 2017"," sharp, crisp, atmospheric action movie
","This is a very good and entertaining action movie and Keanu Reeves carries it effortlessly. Most of the scenes are done the old-fashioned way (sans-CGI) and the movie is better for it. Plot is simple but mercifully it is in straight line with no deviation from the main goal---get back to fun with imaginative action set pieces. The plot elements are clearly described in the trailer so I will not waste space here. One could argue (nitpicking) that the movies sometimes lacks a genuine tension and if there is a follow- up it would be good to see some of this without changing the general tone. Regardless this is high quality action movie--even for non-action movie lovers!"
"Lewis_Heather787","7","2","5","7 March 2017"," A sequel that lives up to the original film!
","The first John Wick back in 2014 was a huge surprise and a welcome to, it has some of the best action brought to film ever. So inevitably I so really hyped to see the sequel which it really deserved since the original had done such a good job of introducing a character and opening a new world to audiences. However the first film did lack one thing, a compelling and complex story, so that was the one area the sequel had to improve upon.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is 52 for crying out loud, and he still to this day is one of the best action stars around, his performance once again is brilliant and is built upon more in different ways and methods in this film. Instead of solely focusing on the passing of his wife and all the emotion of his past life, this film takes the stance that he wants to try and re-build his life and have no connection with the ""hitman"" world anymore. The ""stabbing in the back"" of the characters story is fantastically portrayed by Reeves and brings a new sophistication to the character that is still so relatable to the audience in a strange way. Its the basic story of a guy just trying to do the right thing, make up for all the wrongs in his life and escape from all the negativity which anyone can relate to really. Reeves is fantastic once again, this franchise has reinvented him as an actor in my opinion!<br/><br/>The story of this film compared to the original is a far more interesting and complex, which is fantastic news considering I personally believe that was the main negative if the first. Getting John to help an old friend to eventually escape the world, only then to be ""stabbed in the back"" by this same person. This sets up John begin the character on the run instead of everyone else, like it sort of was in the original and interesting spin on the story of the character. The different locations that story take us one is also an improvement, rather than just stay in New York, Rome was the perfect choice for a film and character like John Wick. The ending of the film is really interesting for me and personally was really well done, it sets up a third film really nicely and will once again change the dynamic for the character in future films.<br/><br/>The action unfortunately is just terrible.............yeah Im joking, its is beautifully brilliant once again and some how they have improved this as well from the first. It shows a truly brutal nature of violence that Wick is capable of, which makes you wonder how is he going to kill next will it be a head shot, two shots to the chest or a pencil. Fantastic improvisation and out of this world choreography, this film shows the elegance of action at its purest form, every action film now needs to look up to the John Wick films because they are setting a new standard.<br/><br/>Finally there are a couple of negatives with the film, the villain or villains. There not as threatening as the villain in the first film which is a shame, Ruby Rose's character really doesn't work in this film and could of been completely written out of the story. Laurence Fishburne's character is criminal underused and will hopefully make a re-appearance in future films because he needed much more screen time than he got, to fully flesh out his character. All in all this film is as good as the first 75% out of 100, Reeves brilliant again, story more interesting, action out of this world. However the negatives in the film do way it down, hopefully there is a third film in this new franchise because it deserves it, 100% worth a watch thrilling from start to finish!"

","Okay. here's the spoiler. Just scroll past it if you don't want to read it.<br/><br/>The dog lives. The absolutely cherry vintage Mustang pretty much dies.<br/><br/>And then, there's all the people who die, but that's not a spoiler, that's the world of assassins.<br/><br/>Beautifully filmed, editing to telescope two story scenes into one (the tailor and the sommelier, well, he's not selling wine, right?) and to meld fight scenes closer, let me just say this:<br/><br/>Once you're in your seat, you can't leave the theater until it's done. So use the restroom first.<br/><br/>Out of the gate the action is gripping. The story line: okay, how do you sympathize with an assassin? Well, that's what this story is all about. If you've ever been in a no win situation, this story is that times a thousand. Especially when dealing with (spoiler alert) an ex- assassin who is now given even MORE to grieve than after the seminal episode in this series (yes it is!)<br/><br/>Training of all the actors including Keanu Reeves for their fight sequences paid off. Yes, it's bloody. And yes, another spoiler alert: there are assassins EVERYWHERE. All hail the mighty smart phone.<br/><br/>Laurence Fishburne's turn as the Bowery King is a humorous yet suspenseful pause in the relentless fighting. Ian McShane and Franco Nero are both elegant and understated in their respective roles as the hotel managers of the Continental and the Continentale. Ruby Rose is the most intriguing of assassins, Common -- the man who gives, and then is given, professional courtesy. The setting among the catacombs in Rome? Amazing!<br/><br/>And the dog is precious.<br/><br/>See it on the big screen. Then rent it, or buy it. Some of the best martial arts I've seen in movies in years. Kudos to everyone, including Chad for his kick ass directing and editing.<br/><br/>Damn."
"joshteggert","8","2","5","2 March 2017"," A bold and adrenaline-fuelled sequel that expands excellently on the first, setting up what could be one of the greatest action trilogies ever.
","'John Wick Chapter 2' explodes onto the big screen shamelessly loud and exhilarating, opening with Keanu Reeves' John Wick tracking down his stolen 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1, bombarding it out of the chop shop it was stored in, killing a good many goons along the way. This truly does set the tone for the entire film; bigger, more badass, and leaving a longer line of dead bodies after all the turmoil.<br/><br/>These sorts of action films rarely exemplify such artistic flair, but director Chad Stahelski, who co-directed the original with David Leitch, gives us a fantastic spectacle to behold. The experienced stunt director provides some more immensely choreographed car chases, thrilling fight scenes, contrasting with intense sequences of drama with unique style. The inspiration here is more based on martial arts films from the likes of Hong-Kong, intricate yet fluidly flowing between shots, differentiating the Wick franchise from the likes of 'Bourne' or 'Bond'. Additionally, there's an incredible section in the final showdown in a hall of mirrors, which is just visually spectacular. The tension is masterfully sustained, and while this is an aspect that is present throughout, it is remarkably prevalent there, making it one of the most surprisingly gripping set pieces in the film and an absolute joy to watch.<br/><br/>Extraordinarily for this sort of film, it is a wholly justified sequel that doesn't damage the game-changing legacy of the first. Still as hard-hitting, still as intriguing and still as fresh in its approach, 'John Wick Chapter 2' does what the likes of 'Taken' could not, or rather chose not to; it proudly returns embodying the tone and feel of the previous, flowing naturally between the two instalments (which may be down to the fact that this is set only days after the first). For fans of the original, this film serves sufficiently on every front. 'Chapter 2' develops on the premise of the first, delving deeper into the criminal underworld with intriguing outcomes. It introduces some interesting characters, notably combining 'The Matrix' veterans, Reeves and Lawrence Fishburne (who plays the campy crime lord Bowery King), for the first time since 'Revolutions', along with the familiar faces of the first, Ian McShane (as the owner of the New York Continental hotel, Winston) and Lance Reddick as Charon, both with larger and more captivating parts to play.<br/><br/>Like the original film however, 'Chapter 2' requires a substantial deferral of disbelief. But this does not deter from the brilliance of the gracefully streaming narrative, or the awesome impact of the action sequences on the viewing experience.<br/><br/>But at the essence of it all, John Wick is without a doubt the worst retiree ever. Yet I don't expect anyone to complain about that besides him really, and maybe those who attempt to stop him in future. 'Chapter 2' is fantastic escapism entertainment, establishing a franchise that promises to be enticing to the last. Here's to chapter three being just as breathtaking."
"zachmoats","9","2","5","1 March 2017"," Chad Stahelski's direction shines in masterclass in action filmmaking
","I want to talk about Keanu here. I really do, but I didn't think I could pass up the chance to expand upon Stahelski's direction, because it was wonderful in this film. The film opens up the world of John Wick more than the first film did, and Stahelski gets really creative with how and what stunts he films.<br/><br/>From the scene on the train with Common's character Cassian to the finale in the hall of mirrors, Stahelski draws on previous films and filmmakers to create something all his own here. The first film in the series established that the direction was about actual fighting and how grueling it can be. The second film continues that trend. The first time Cassian and John Wick meet up, they get into a brutal hand-to-hand fight that lasts far longer than most directors would allow in action films and certainly with far fewer cuts. It's near exhausting to watch, but that's the point. Fighting isn't always fast and quick and clean (sometimes it is, and for that, we get the gun fu that John Wick does so beautifully), sometimes it's long, with no clear winner, and with no real outcome except pain. Stahelski's direction brings together wonderful performances from Keanu, Common, Ruby Rose, and more. This film is absolutely worth your time, and I cannot wait to see where Stahelski takes us next in the series."
"jrtorres","9","2","5","27 February 2017"," Very good sequel

"markora","10","2","5","27 February 2017"," We are all John Wick
","This movie is an anthem of revenge. John Wick is essentially the character which lies in all of us - The Devil which we suppress in every way possible, The Beast lying within us which awakens when we have been wronged by the world. John Wick is all of us, he is lying in the deepest part of our souls waiting to emerge when he feels the time is right.<br/><br/>The people that hate the movie and the ones that love it are both right. John feels what we all feel on a certain scale - the eternal internal fight between love and hate, which twist into one another and emerges from within us as the world bombards us with experiences.<br/><br/>While God and Devil argue how to punish or reward the ones doing and promoting good or evil in the world, John takes things into his own hands, integrating and transcending them both making the movie an epic concerto where art reaches the highest peaks of expression by exploring the lowest which resides in every man. <br/><br/>After watching this movie, if you really delved into its simple beauty you will feel that perhaps, the world is always equalized by people such as John Wick."
"PetarNeo","9","2","5","24 February 2017"," John Wick Chapter 2 shines
","Once more Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves united and gave us action masterpiece. As we start to go deeper to universe that John Wick is centered and learn more about society that is present in that world movie takes step to higher grounds. After John is being forced to do things that he firstly refuges to do, fighting for his life he turns page and once more being pis*ed more than first time he goes in hunt for everybody that wants him dead and does that in magnificent way. Eventually got himself in even more trouble than before now he starts to show his power and his vulnerability. Greatly choreographed action sequences are even more intimidating than previous and constantly advance to surprise with cleverness but considering that director Chad was stunts coordinator previously he shows real skill in doing such scenes. It was lightness in some scenes that kept movie going with some fun and easier story development but in the end everything goes to Keanu Reeves in his new perfect role and dedication in improving his skills to serious levels. Adding Laurence Fishburne to this world will in future mean a serious business and most definitely he will be able to improve this world even more. John Wick Chapter 2 offers something that not even Raid 2 could offer to Raid: Redemption and that is more story telling and more background to universe without losing a bit of powerful action scenes. 3.5/4"
"aniseprakash","9","2","5","24 February 2017"," A great action entertainer. Don't miss it if you are an action lover.
","John Wick one of the best action movies of the decade is back. Did you love the John Wick Chapter 1 (Prequel) then Chapter 2 will make you go crazy for the franchise. Director Chad Stahelski, a stunt man himself knows the pulse of the audience and adds what is needed. He has given extreme importance to the action scenes and he succeeds as well.<br/><br/>Though the action starts after almost an hour into the movie, the wait is worth. Even the built up for the action sequences are good than the action itself. The initial hour narrates the story and it is better than the prequel (Far better). Chad might be aware that the prequel didn't have depth in the plot.<br/><br/>Keanu reeves has given another mind blowing performance. He is a natural in action scenes, his looks and expressions stands long. He utters only less dialogues which adds up the style as John (Thanks to Chad). After Neo, Keanu has got John to stick in our hearts. Riccardo Scamarcio as Antonio has contributed as much as Keanu (Sequel beats prequel this time). He just make phone calls to execute his plans which is better suited for the villain of John.<br/><br/>It is difficult to take a franchise to new level, we have seen many directors trying some extravagant addition in each installment of their franchise. But Chad doesn't need all those, rather he does what he does the best. He didn't exaggerate or degrade the franchise instead he did the same as the prequel, but this time far better.<br/><br/>John Wick lovers and action lovers will celebrate the movie for sure. The length of the action scenes might feel too much for sure, but I believe it won't be for action lovers. On the whole John Wick Chapter 2 is a great action entertainer. Kudos for the whole team The open ended climax has all possibilities for Chapter 3."

"danielharden","9","2","5","23 February 2017"," Kick Ass Keanu 2
","Keanu Reeves is back as John Wick, An unstoppable retired hit-man now with a new pooch by his side. But, when an old debt must be repaid, John finds himself pulled right back into the criminal underworld he has tried to leave behind. The first John Wick was a great, straight up high concept action film, and arguably won the retired-hit-man-comes-back-out-of-retirement movie clash with Antoine Fuqua's The Equalizer. So I went in with rather high hopes for John Wick: Chapter 2... And thankfully the film does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Say what you will about Keanu Reeves' acting ability. Yes his British accent was terrible in Bram Stoker's Dracula and aside from the stoner/ surfer dude character he plays in films such as; the Bill and Ted series and Point Break, Keanu hasn't really pulled off a great acting performance, and I'm not saying his acting is Oscar worthy here either... But Keanu does have something going for him.... Boy can he do stunts. What makes John Wick: Chapter 2, and the series thus far, so satisfying is that it is obvious to us, the audience, that the lead actor is actually performing his own stunts. Keanu is very gun savvy, and he is very believable as an expert hit-man through his physical acting. All that training on all his action movies throughout his career really shine through in this film.<br/><br/>Speaking of stunts, Oh my god the stunt work in this film is phenomenal. Chapter 2 is directed by, director of the first John Wick film, and long time Keanu Reeves stunt man, Chad Stahelski. This man clearly knows his sh*t as proved by his stunt work for such great films as; The Matrix, Point Break, 300, Spider-Man 2 and The Hunger Games 1 and 2. As well as this, Stahelski has also directed 2 brilliantly choreographed and all round great action films. Not only does the film have fantastic fight choreography, but Stahelski positions the camera, in such a way, so that we can actually see and understand what is happening in these sequences. It's very common for an action film to use shaky hand-held camera and rapid fast editing in their action sequences, and this always makes the sequence hard to follow as well as disorientating for the audience. Stahelski doesn't really use these techniques, he instead has the stunts take place in camera in a long shot, so we see Keanu Reeves fight about 4 or 5 guys in a row all in one take. This is very refreshing to see in an action film and it is obvious that Stahelski knows what is good and bad in stunt choreography as well as presenting that choreography to an audience through his direction. I would also like to applaud the sound guys on this film as a lot of the heart pounding action is attributed to the films earth shattering sound.<br/><br/>The films story is also rather interesting as it unearths the underworld within the John Wick series. This film is a mafia film of sorts, filled with criminal bosses, organised crime on an international scale, and of course, Italy. The film does everything a sequel should do, it expands on the world established in the original Film, while also staying true to what made the original film so good. Chapter 2 tells another high concept, hero-pulled-back-into-their-old-life and revenge story, filled with excellent action sequences, as well as expanding the John Wick universe in the form of a mafia movie. This film just simply does everything expected of it and more.<br/><br/>Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a movie sequel that should go down in history, as it is a perfect example of a sequel doing everything it should do. Brilliantly directed by Chad Stahelski, a well written script by Derek Kolstad, great sound, great stunt work and a decent performance by Keanu Reeves. What more can you ask for? John Wick: Chapter 3 that's what."

High octane sequel to an impressively building franchise with Reeves getting in touch with his inner Charles Bronson/Steve McQueen as the titular attempting-to-retire assassin who this time is seeking peace and quiet but only putting that on hold when his marker is called by nefarious gangland weasel Scamarcio calls his debt to off his sister (bewitching Gerini) to take over the family business. Reeves is a study in pot boiling simmering rage barely contained and when push comes to shove the body count doubles. Slickly photographed by Dan Lausten, pulse-quickeningly edited by Evan Schiff and the returning team of director Chad Stahelski and screenwriter Derek Kolstad ups the ante considerably with globe-trotting (Rome never looked so lethal) and fantastic stunts choreographed fight sequences and chases.

"michinine","9","2","5","22 February 2017"," Bullet Ballet at its finest
","When I saw the first movie, I thought: this is something new. Someone took the real hardcore action movies from the past, where people use handguns like extension of their hands, kill and keep dropping bodies like nothing. Usually, those movies end up to be campy, unbelievable and quite bad, especially on the story and sfx side.<br/><br/>John Wick was the exception in a long time. A tortured soul, who has to do what he has to do, because other force him. And he does it with style and determination. <br/><br/>The second chapter takes the setting from the first one and adds more on everything. Brilliant shot, gorgeously lighted, nice locations. And intense and insane action, where the bullets fly and the main actor performs a ballet of (gun) raw fight sequences you simply have to see. And there is, by all means, even humorous moments where you would least expect it.<br/><br/>In the seemingly endless barrel that is replaceable, cutout superhero action, John Wick is a class of its own. I saw many groups of women without male dates in my packed cinema. Which means that this series delivers more than just action. It delivers an fresh experience, and the second film fixes probably all problems the first had. This is not ordinary.<br/><br/>For quite some time, action fans had troubles to agree ""whats a good action movie?"" if asked. Look at the reviews. This one is easy. Its relentless, its beautiful in its own way - and has an Keanu Reeves, who simply owns the role of an legendary assassin and never lets it go. 9/10. Must see for action fans."

","In the first film, remembering, John Wick seeks revenge on the son of his former boss after he will kill his dog and steal his car, facing the Russian mafia in between. The movie begins in the search of the car where the first one ends.<br/><br/>After this, it is visited by an Italian crime lord that allowed John to retire and marry Helen, as part of a contract symbolized by a 'blood oath' medallion, seeking to John's service as a payback, but he refuses and the crime lord destroy the house. After a conversation with the owner of the Continental hotel reminds him that if he doesn't accepts he would be breaking the rules of The underworld society. Then John accepts.<br/><br/>This movie has improved the choreographed fights, also improve the action scenes with more persecutions, shooting in mirrored and public places. I should also mention that they kept what I liked the most of the first movie, weapon reloading, unlike other action movies that seem to have the infinite ammo skill from the video games. So for those who liked the first film, I doubt they will be disappointed with this sequel and it is also highly recommended for fans of action and thriller films.<br/><br/>Final rating: 7.6 (8), also gives an exciting ending."

A much better movie than the boycotted ratings gave it as this is not nearly the movie the ratings are giving it since it is nearly a repeat of the first movie. That is too bad. Anyways, it was a good sequel but not as good as the original John Wick. More of an extension and in many ways a repeat of the first some. Most of the elements are nearly the same (without giving spoilers) so it is a bit more boring in spots because of it. Plenty of firepower but we expected it after the first one.

","John Wick: Chapter 2 is a very rare movie. It's a sequel to an action film that came out three years ago and Is a sequel that I'm having trouble not enjoying more than the original, for a few reasons. <br/><br/>1. It deepens further into the world that John and his assassin counterparts come from and work out of.<br/><br/>2. It takes all the wonderfully gritty action pieces from the original and cranks it up to beyond what I was expecting.<br/><br/>3. It leaves the writers wide open to write yet another well-choreographed, exciting, and intense sequel, the likes of which are already in talks as I hear.<br/><br/>All in all, I was incredibly happy with this as a sequel. It was well-written, well thought out, well acted, and I'm excited to see where this franchise and its lore will go."

","I did not expect John Wick to have a sequel. The first one started with killing John Wick's puppy which was a gift from his deceased wife, the second, burning down his house and therefore, destroying his truest memories of his late wife. The movie was very unexpected. As an avid movie watcher I always seem to get bored out with the same plot, kill the villain, get the girl, live happily ever after. Yawn. The movie ended perfectly, a contract was put out for Mr. Wick's head at 14m dollars internationally, he was excommunicated from the organization and only given an hour to escape from the world. This movie is the perfect definition of ""So, what is going to happen next?"""

","In John Wick 1, the story unfolds with major tragedy. Wick's wife died. he is in mourning. Then a useless thug kills the dog his dead wife left him. In doing so the writers created an instant, sympathetic connection to the character.<br/><br/>In this sequel, I have absolutely no sympathy for, or connection to any character in the movie. Moreover, to the director, writers, and producer I ask how many times can you show someone shooting people in the head before it gets old?<br/><br/>John Wick 2 is a Groundhog Day action movie. One man with a pistol shooting people in the head over, and over, and over again. I do not consider this statement to be a spoiler because the previews indicate as much. Even action movies require some foundation such as good writing, a compelling story, and a hint of plausibility. This movie is simply a man with a pistol killing a never-ending supply of villains.<br/><br/>What is even more astounding, the never-ending supply of ""professional"" villains are bad shots with poor reflexes. In John Wick 1 he was not invincible, making him more of a more sympathetic character. He was captured and would have been killed had he not been rescued by a fellow assassin. In this version he is basically wearing a red cape and leaping over tall buildings in a single bound.<br/><br/>That said, if you just want to see a bunch of people getting shot in the head time-and-time again, you are going to really love this film. John Wick 1 spent a little time building the characters including the villain. John Wick 2 has chaotic character development, a sloppy plot, and doesn't contain even a grain of plausibility."

This was unfortunate, as it had some potential in the crime-drama stakes. <br/><br/>Even worse, it was action of the perfectly choreographed, first person shooter, high body count, explosions-for-the-sake-of-explosions variety.

I gave it a 5/10.<br/><br/>John Wick Chapter 2 dispenses with the luxury of character depth or a plot, or even pretending to have them, and gets straight to the action scenes.

","(1)John Wick is known as the ghost, the boogeyman and other words but nothing of this sort has been shown in this movie. I haven't seen one scene in this movie that merits any of those titles. they are just a myth as far as i have seen. For reference check out the boat scene in Bourne Identity when he was shot by Wambosi after he failed to kill a man with kids on his laps. that's a ghost. even for killing Neski. that's a ghost. John wick is an earthquake and not a nerve gas..... (2) the movie has trivial scenes that have no bearing. the chasing of the biker in the street just to get his KEY CARD, the getting back of his car just to wreck it, the beating up of gang members just to ask for peace? bull. the blowing up of his house just to lure him in, come on, his obligation to the continental rules were enough, why the duplication. (3) Come on, a car thief broke into Johns house and beat him to a pulp and Santino almost killed him when he blew up his house. Its that easy to kill John. (4) When Santino asks John Wick to kill his sister he tells him that he needs a ghost. Sorry Santino, wrong guy. in his preparation for the job John lets the whole world know of his plans. talk about discretion and being a ghost. John wick is so brainless that he shoots an almost dead woman with a gun which doesn't have a silencer....hmm mm. Oh, here is the punchline. ..then the famous John wick decides to use the front door for his exit. heheheheheheh. (5)so John and Cassian (common) are professionals so why does Cassian take it personal and going after John instead of Santino. (6)So john and Cassian face off and there is a Mexican stand off without Cassian knowing whom John was there to kill. (7) John and Cassian fight is superb. great scene (8)After John completes his Santino given mission a bounty is placed on his head. with his reputation where even cops had given him the license to kill i didn't expect anyone in new York to take the job. but hey, no one is scared of him anymore. (9)what the hell was Lawrence fishburne doing in the movie, trying to give him the red pill? come on. overall if wanna watch John Wick for the story line and espionage skills you will be disappointed. watch it instead for it great action scenes, Johns dedication and good performance from Common. I would watch John wick a hundred times because its brought back the fighting that isn't so computerized and is fresh and eye catching but being a PROFESSIONAL i would be a man without taste to rate it anything above 5."

","First the positive: I liked watching Keanu when he was not fighting, the humble/tired hero he plays is great. <br/><br/>The negative: Plot is ridiculous: He kills hundreds of thugs because of something minor. Now i don't mind a bad or in this case even ironic plot if it serves the purpose of delivering good action. But Keanu is no martial artist, so he shoots about 400 people and does some judo throws on 10% of them. That's basically all the action there is. If you like this kind of gunfire action go watch Shoot'em up with Clive Owen, way better action. The Lore reminds me of the matrix, the movie is clearly inspired by that ""classic"" in the way they present their characters. Lawrence Fishburn is even the same know-it-all guy. But it lacks the depth of the Matrix, here the hidden reality is just some mafia network whose power over the world is not explored at all in the movie."

"Uriah43","7","2","6","20 April 2017"," Almost as Good as Its Predecessor
","This film essentially begins where its predecessor ended with the Russian assassin ""John Wick"" (Keanu Reeves) in the process of locating his stolen Ford Mustang which has been transported to a local garage for resell. As it so happens, the owner of this illegal garage is the brother of the crime lord who John killed in the first film. Not realizing the intense sentimental value John has for this car ""Abram Tarasov"" (Peter Stormare) decides to defend his territory rather than simply giving John his car back. Sure enough, John kills everyone who gets in his way and soon enters Abram's office. To Abram's surprise, rather than just killing him then and there, John offers peace. Naturally, Abram accepts immediately and breathes a sigh of relief as John takes his damaged car and leaves. Unfortunately for John, he soon finds out that he cannot retire and live in peace as another crime lord named ""Santino D'Antonio"" (Riccardo Scamarcio) comes to his house and demands that he honor a marker which John previously swore to uphold whenever it was presented. When John refuses Santino has his house destroyed along with several other valuable keepsakes that John treasured. With no other place to stay John goes to the Continental Hotel and once there the owner named ""Winston"" (Ian McShane) reminds John that he cannot turn down Santino's marker. Although he is extremely reluctant, John finally decides to accept the marker and fulfill the job Santino demands of him. However, as Winston later tells Santino, the decision to force John back into the world he truly wants to quit is going to have severe consequences for everyone involved. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fine sequel which managed to combine an interesting plot with a great amount of action. Having said that, even though I thoroughly enjoyed this film, I don't believe it was quite as good as the first movie. Almost-but not quite. Another thing I would like to mention is that while this film certainly set the stage for another installment, I fear that--like so many movies made during this current time--the third film might degenerate into mindless action completely lacking any realism or imagination whatsoever. I suppose time will tell. In any case, I thought this was a pretty good movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
"Ziya90","6","2","6","15 April 2017"," The first movie was better
","The first John Wick was a flourishing, surprisingly well done and solid action film which was even better than people'd expected. The main character were cool thanks to great Keanu Reeves. The story was mysterious, asking questions. The film was stylistic in a natural manner and had lots of action, a real gem of a film! This second John Wick tries to explain everything like what is what and who is who? A big mistake! The director tries to deepen the story and enriches his universe by adding some new characters and their stories, but it slows the story down. In other words, it makes the story heavier. The first movie was all about questions, this movie is about intrigues like an episode of a serial TV action. The first film was a sincere letter to action genre, but this second installment feels like a pseudo artistic work. The flashy climactic scene frankly proves that. This movie tries to look ""elegant"", but it falls too short. The action is great at times, but even if it is also an action packed film, it feels like boring if we think about the pace of the first movie. I believe that the best scene of the movie is when John Wick (Keanu Reeves) meets Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) and you start to cry! Maybe, John Wick 2 is a more dignified film than the other in some ways, but all those explanations and narrative make it a less entertaining experience, probably because this is an intermediate chapter between the first and the probable third film. By the way, it is sad that Ruby Rose is wasted here. We can never see that expected breaking point happening. We love Keanu Reeves and he is great here again and the action scenes are professional and classy, but the movie is somehow dreary. I hope, in the next chapter, the director can work things out."

","Chad Stahelski brings back the slickest and most dangerous hit-man alive, John Wick in a whole new thrilling and air punching adventure to bring another perfect cinematic action experience.<br/><br/>Following the events of the first film, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) after tying up final loose ends, attempts to retire his highly skilled assassin life, but his past indeed catches up again as he is pulled back into the game when an old acquaintance tries to entice Wick into a debt. However as he is forced back into his dark life, things take more of a turn for the worst as he faces a darker world hit men, vengeance, and sharp suits.<br/><br/>What could be described as slick cool fashion show of suits, guns and cars is actually more then meets the eye. John Wick (2014) was a hidden gem of a film, that really entered a league of its own in the action genre. What the sequel delivers is really more of what its fans love cranked up to 11. Still fuelled with the wonderfully choreographed violence which I like to describe as beautiful. This also again is shot so professionally Dan Laustsen that makes the action so fluent in one shot with really no cuts.<br/><br/>What is the base line in the John Wick universe is the hotel of assassins 'Continental' a very interesting and exciting concept that definitely pulls you in from the first film, and again is a real pleasure to enjoy with Ian McShane being the lead manager of the establishment, and later Lawrence Fishburne chewing up as much scenery as he can gets his hands on. At again Reeves doing more acting with his boy over his voice, which I guess is the heart of Wick's character.<br/><br/>Although the world that John Wick lives is a clearly ridicules world of mad violence looking cool while shooting people in the head, this is what makes the films enjoyable. Chapter 2 really does go a bit more mad though, but it doesn't weaken the films purpose. Of course what should be taken from this experience is the enjoyment. I wouldn't call the first Joh Wick a exploitation ""throw away"" movie, John Wick was real new fun and exciting action experience. But Chapter 2 may push us into this characteristic more but does not steal the spirit that the first film gave us.<br/><br/>It should be understood that viewers who haven't seen the first one may not take hold of what John Wick Chapter 2 offers. People who are fans of the first film will probably enjoy the sequel, but may not be everyone's cup of tea.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 does fail to not quite live up to its predecessor, but still lives up to the fun. Still facing issues with the story and ridiculous suave action Know what your in for John Wick Chapter 2 and don't take very seriously but take it for what it is, because then you can just really enjoy the nonsensical violence of the John Wick world. So if you want to punch the air in fun excitement, which is not provided for you by Fifty Shades Darker, then experience another telling of the impossible legendary hit-man John Wick. 7.8/10"
"svorva","7","2","6","13 February 2017"," Action Flick and Cinema
","After a few months of award season dramas, it's time for a break. I recommend John Wick to a female compatriot citing positive critical reviews. I emphasized this would be a ""pure action"" movie. Evidentially, I did not make my point clear. Companion despised this movie. Hated the absence of plot or reasoning. Fed up with ceaseless violence. ""You hated it too, right?"" Movies should be watched on their own terms. I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>In retrospect, this was not the correct opinion.<br/><br/>I certainly messed up the recommendation. I will not make the mistake again here. There are countless who will find absolutely nothing redeeming among the blood and the beatings in John Wick: Chapter 2. I bear no resentment and wish them pleasant theater going experiences. But I believe anyone who can tolerate pure action will find John Wick a cut above genre competitors. There is no moral justification or handholding. This standard affair is replaced with relentlessness and a brazen confidence where realized characters are presented without explanation. Disclaimer: John Wick is not for everyone, but anyone who enjoyed the original or anything similar, your gonna have fun.<br/><br/>I guess the plot. John Wick (Reeves) is cleaning up some messes that have arisen after his return. After some vicious pacification, John is ready to retire again to his home and new dog. But just when you think your out, they pull you back in. Santino D'Antonio, a kingpin from Johns past, arrives unannounced. Apparently John owes this man a favor, a Mark, a blood compact that is enforced by the shadowy forces that rule the Wickiverse. John initially refuses and gets his house blown up for the trouble. After seeking Winston's (McShane) advice, John accepts he must acknowledge the Mark. To fulfil the compact, John must assassinate Santio's sister, a leader of the high council. However, John is not one assassination away from a clean getaway. He is now a loose end interfering with a newly minted lord. Things are going to get dirty. Shenanigans ensue. Characters from the first chapter return with the appearance of a few fresh faces.<br/><br/>Kudos to Director Chad Stahelski for the technical precision. The former stuntman is clearly aware of the noble Hong Kong action lineage and he was willing to import the talent to the western hemisphere. Hollywood clearly lacks the choreographers, directors, and editors to produce a quality action sequence. Chapter 2 might not be as clean and intense as say, early Jackie Chan or current Indonesian movies, but it's a sure bet that no super hero movie is going to include a comparable fight scene this year.<br/><br/>The underworld backdrop of the original expands in Chapter 2. The shadowy figures in charge of this web, their origins, and rules are taken for granted in the universe just as we take them for granted in the audience. The result is a memorable world with minimal investment. New characters also furthered this motif. I loved under-appreciated actor Ian McShane's performance in the original. His idiosyncrasies (""Johnathan"") and tone just immediately establish him as a denizen of this shadow world and we have a great idea of his role without being explicitly told. The Laurence Fishburne addition is almost too cute given his past history with Keanu, but Franco Nero and Ruby Rose are unforgettable. Nero (of Django fame) plays the Italian equivalent of Winston and the match is so perfect I wanted to laugh. Rose has a more significant role as evil henchman in chief. This forceful mute with a scowl that could launch a thousand ships is preferable to any meat headed muscleman. And yes, John Wick knows sign language. Why wouldn't he? I doubt there are thousands of people out there on the fence on whether they are going to see John Wick Chapter 2. Enjoy your sequel fans. And those for those who would hate John Wick and everything it stands for, take a deep breath and a step back. The filmmaking is on the high end of what we will get this entire year, it would be a shame if you never noticed. John Wick Chapter 2 is both action flick and cinema. A combo I will enjoy every chance I get."

No real surprises, nothing unexpected, just straight forward action.<br/><br/>While this film does rise above its predecessor in narrative aspects, it still retains the same formulaic style. Being unshackled from the necessity of world building gives John Wick 2 the room to flesh out its criminal underworld somewhat, and show us a broader view of his world. That being said however, at its core, John Wick 2 is still a very basic action movie.<br/><br/>Don't go into this expecting complex characters or a compelling story line. But if what you're looking for is some mindless action, this movie will suit your needs just fine."

I'll take Denzel in Man on Fire/equalizer or Spencer Tracy in Bad Day at Black Rock over Wick 2 - style and wit over a mountain of dead extras.

"graeme-n-cameron","8","1","2","11 May 2019"," Let's be honest...
","Is John Wick 2 a Great Film? Of course not, it's as dumb as a box of spanners. You could write the plot on a stamp without upsetting the Queen. Keanu Reeves delivers his lines like he's trying to do hard sums in his head. The baddie's so forgettable that half an hour after watching it, I can't even remember what he looked like. And obviously the whole thing's entirely preposterous and makes literally no sense whatsoever. And now here's why I'm giving it 8/10:<br/><br/>1) Other films are available. I've had a long week and tonight I wanted to watch a big dumb action movie that didn't require any thought or emotional commitment, and this does exactly what it says on the tin.<br/><br/>2) Keanu might act like he can't remember if he left the iron on, but boy is he committed to his craft. If by craft we mean looking angfused whilst being thrown out of windows/down stairs/off balconies and also shooting everyone in the face and/or stabbing them in the balls.<br/><br/>3) It looks beautiful. The location photography is stunning, the colour and lighting are richly layered and, unlike a lot of recent offerings, the action sequences are clear and easy to follow (not to mention crisply choreographed). No Shaky-Hands Cam here.<br/><br/>4) The 15-minute prologue, which answers the glaring unresolved question from the first film, is actually really good.<br/><br/>5) Some of the stunt work is astonishing.<br/><br/>6) It's a full 2 hours long and the fight scenes (of which there are many) get a bit repetitive (ok, you like throwing people over your shoulder before you shoot them in the face and/or stab them, we GET it), but it's relentlessly entertaining.<br/><br/>And that's the point - it's honest about what it is. It doesn't set out to be anything more or less than 2 hours of dumb, fast-moving entertainment, by which measure it admirably succeeds.<br/><br/>So no, it was never going to trouble the BAFTAs, and yes, it is gratuitously violent and hammy and stupid and not even really ABOUT anything - but it does a perfectly admirable job of being a John Wick movie, and in the mood I was in, I found it thoroughly enjoyable."

One of the main rules of the 'underworld' Wick was formerly a part of is that all markers must be honoured so he reluctantly meets with D'Antonio and agrees to the task, but even though he completes his assignment and honours the 'marker', D'Antonio betrays him and puts a $7 million contract out on Wick........
Big mistake!
This is again a spectacular action movie, well acted, directed and with more incredible stunt sequences.
In the first film, we get a glimpse of the organisation Wick was once a part of. In this film, we get to see more of 'The Continental Hotel', the headquarters for this assassins 'mob', and we learn more about the background politics of how it all works, and this is actually a fascinating part of the movie. Ian McShane is back as 'Winston' the owner and manager of the New York hotel and his role in this movie is much larger and far more developed.
I have to say, John Wick: Chapter 2 is brilliant.
The casting again is impeccable. I really believe that this role is Keanu Reeves' best role in any movie he has done. Riccardo Scamarcio is fabulously creepy as D'Antonio, Common is terrifically cold as a rival assassin and Laurence Fishburne plays a supporting role, and it's actually the first time Reeves and Fishburne are reunited since 'The Matrix movies'. The same directors who brought us the first film return and bring us another gripping, all-out action movie and the cinematography in this film is amazing. The fight scene choreography is outstanding, and you can really see Reeves in these sequences and know that he is doing 95% of all his own stunt work. The action-packed car chases and the fight scenes are so 'real', there are no spectacular 'super-hero' type stunts, no leaping from one plane to another, free falling with no parachute etc, they're just gritty and incredible heart-poundingly good.
If I had any niggles about this movie, it's probably the motivation. In the first film Wick's motivation was so clear, it was a very emotional reason behind why he went back into action, in this one though, he's almost forced, he isn't really given a choice, and what I find interesting about characters in movies is the choices they make, and when you have a character that is basically pushed into a situation, the emotional reason for him being there doesn't have the same impact. Also, I'm not a fan of Peter Serafinowicz and his performance in this was ridiculous.
That aside, I found this film had a more focused story than the first, and if you love amazing action, outstanding stunt work and an action film that is exciting and captivating from the start then you will love John Wick: Chapter 2"

","I is the second part of John Wick series and an entertaining one. Keanu Reeves reprise his character of ruthless killer and this time with more perfection. Action is better then the first part. Screenplay is gripping and acting is great. Climax of this movie is better then the first part. A great action movie to watch"
"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","22 March 2019"," Why can't every action film be shot like this?
","Keanu Reeves returns as John Wick, a retired hitman, who is nevertheless pulled back into the world of assassins. The movie picks up only a few days after the events of the original film and we find Wick tying up some loose ends. But then a figure from his past comes to visit, intent on collecting a debt owed to him.<br/><br/>And from there it's pretty much one action scene after another, with some quiet yet intent dialogue scenes thrown in to build the world and move the plot along. Pretty much like the first film. And I have to admit, I'm a huge fan. This is a really cool world they have built here, with clearly established rules, interesting characters and locations, and enough style to make The Godfather films weep.<br/><br/>I also absolutely adore these action scenes. I love the wide takes that allow me to see everything that's happening in a given space. I love the long takes that don't break the harmony of movement. I love how they give each character their own unique feel. I love how John Wick is the epitome of minimization of movement. He kills people almost like it's an afterthought. And it looks so cool.<br/><br/>Seeing a movie like John Wick 2 makes you dislike all the other action movies just a little bit. Because it shows you how well it can be done. And after you've seen it, it's hard to go back to those quick cuts and jittery camera movements.<br/><br/>If you liked the original John Wick, this is more of the same while still feeling like it's continuing the story and being its own thing. If you haven't seen the original, go watch it if you would like to see one of the greatest action films made in the last two decades. And then come back to this one."

","John Wick (2014) was a very good film, amazingly written story with a direct plot. The sequel on the other hand was generic, dull, and seemed rushed. The body count was extremely high but the fight scenes appeared to be to mechanical. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the role and (Reeves) really polarizes it but this film was really vengeance based. The action points were very strong but extremely repetitious. The hand to hand fight scenes were solid but to much ground work in form of judo. <br/><br/>
I was solidly impressed with Ruby Rose as the silent assassin working for the antagonist Di San Antonio. It was in my opinion an ok film and since a third installment has been greenlit it will be a wonder what occurs in the next chapter of this character. I give this a humble 6 out of 10."

","John Wick: Chapter 2 is the 2017 sequel to 2014's John Wick. Now I must admit off the bat, I did not see the original before I saw this film; in fact, as of writing this review I still haven't. There was no problem for me getting into the story, characters, and the world of this movie, without viewing it's predecessor. It stars Keanu Reeves as John Wick, an assassin working for a sort of corporation of killers, and he wants out of it for good. But he is forced to repay a debt and brought in to do a job. What will result is much more than he signed up for, and he will have to kill many, many people if he's to stay alive. <br/><br/>The film is well directed by Chad Stahelski, who also did the original. It has a cast, some known names, others familiar character actors, and a few people that I saw for the first time here, who seem all really well suited for their roles--roles which are dynamic and memorable, if admittedly not very deep (though they don't really need to be). This universe in which these characters exist is committed to by the film in a way that makes you look past its absurdities, and sometimes even feels like it could somehow exist. But it's the action where this movie clearly excels. Gun-play, knife-play, martial arts are intertwined in kinetic, bloody sequences, with some of the better fighting choreography I've seen from movies of recent years. There are certain formula action-movie elements here, like the way it shifts between one-on-one and one-versus-many fights; but they're staged in such a meticulous, clever ways as to hardly ever feel cliched or stale. If John seems a little too invincible, I can kind of forgive that too. The film moves along at a nice pace, with interesting scenes in between the ones with John blowing tons of people away, including a hypnotic sequence of Mr. Wick gathering weapons and protective gear for his forthcoming mission. <br/><br/>Bottom line: this is an action film with heart, style, and wit. It doesn't quite add up to a great action film in my opinion, but in many facets it's bloody brilliant. And I still look forward to one day seeing the original John Wick."
"a_chinn","9","1","2","24 July 2018"," Keanu has completely divested himself of Ted
","Keanu has tried to shed his dumb guy persona for quite some time. Even in excellent films like ""Point Break"" or ""The Matrix"" he was still playing a doofus. With the John Wick films, Keanu is a next level badass and completely divests himself from Ted (although he's reprising his role in an upcoming third film). This sequel picks up right after the first John Wick film, with Keanu being pressured to pay back a debt that originally got him out of his hitman life in the first place. He's been asked to kill a powerful mob boss by her brother. After doing so, the brother puts a huge bounty on Wick's head and he has to fight off hitmen and hitwomen at every turn. That is everywhere except for The Continental Hotel, an underworld sanctuary run by Ian McShane where no killing is allowed. When characters who've fought each other to a bloody pulp meet up at the Continental, they must peacefully coexist. However, as cool as The Continental is of an addition to the John Wick universe, it's the unbelievably great action sequences from director Chad Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad that make this film so memorable, even for even the most jaded of action film fan. Kolstad's script sets up some great action sequences (there's an excellent hall of mirrors finale, although most filmmakers should know that they're never going to top Orson Welles' ""The Lady from Shanghai"" climax), but it's director Chad Stahelski who makes the action sequences something wholly original and something not seen on screen before. Hong Kong action films of the 80s and 90s brought something original and new to action films (which were then endlessly imitated in American action films like ""The Matrix"" or ""Desperado"", but there really hasn't been anything since then that seemed all that different from what's come before (maybe Kurt Wimmer's ""Gun-Fu"" in ""Equilibrium"" and ""Ultraviolet,"" but that too borrowed heavily from Hong Kong action cinema). The action in John Wick is fast, aggressive, and mixes hand-to-hand and gun-play in a way that has not been done before on film. The film is expertly shot by ace cinematographer Dan Laustsen (""The Shape of Water"" ""Crimson Peak"" ""Silent Hill"" ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""). The action is fast, bloody, and brutal, which is to say it's not going to be for all tastes, but if you're a fan of action films, you'll likely find this sequel equal if not better than the first John Wick film. Besides the top tier action, you have an even better cast than the first film, which includes Riccardo Scamarcio, Ruby Rose (as a very cool mute hitwoman), Laurence Fishburne, John Leguizamo, Bridget Moynahan, David Patrick Kelly, Peter Stormare, and even Franco Nero! Top that off by a surprise appearance by a Commodore VIC-20 used by The Continental Hotel staff and at the end of the film and that adds up to one of the best action films to come out in years!"
"funtasticfour","7","1","2","28 May 2018"," Going for the violence record?
","I enjoyed the first John Wick movie, as a popcorn action flick. The idea of a safe haven hotel is great, and has since been copied (upcoming Hotel Artemis for example). The action is great, with cool cars and gun-fu, which is surprisingly gory. This second movie continues where the first one ended, but has less story than the original, which isn't saying much. Some good fights and over the top shooting make me wonder why this isn't already a video game franchise! And of course a new one is in the works, which I'll watch but not in the theatre."
"ralphkelly","Null","1","2","23 May 2018"," High octane fast paced action sequences
","John Wick Chapter 2 is pretty much a continuation of the first part in every manner imaginable- the narrative, high octane fast paced action sequences, the dry sense of dialogue- everything is similar, and this isn't a bad thing. The filmmakers knew what made the first film so appealing and decided to not tinker with the formula. Keanu Reeves is pretty much at home now shooting and kicking bad guys and knows the kind of film he is in. The shootouts are intense- especially the final showdown and between this and the Indonesian ""Raid"" series action fans are having a ball. (Much the same as the 1st part- which is a great thing)"

I swear, some of them might as well have head butted the bullets and saved Wick the trouble. <br/><br/>Oh I tell a lie, there is a fourth flavour of goon, the near indestructible adversary whose purpose is to participate in a sort of violent robotic dance with Wick.

","We sat and watched an eagerly awaited sequel to a movie that we had both surprisingly enjoyed. It seemed to start well with a predictable car chase. The outcome we guessed otherwise there would have been no point to the movie......and then we realised that there was really no point. And it just went down hill from there. The story seemed to be made up as it went along. There was no dialogue, so not sure why they needed a dialogue coach in the credits, the action reminded me of a video game.....a bad one. And the saving grace of the entire film was the poor dog. And Ian McShane, of course, who just is. We both got very confused as to where all the baddies were coming from. Were they been cloned or replicated. He is John Wick. He is supposed to be the feared Boogeyman and The Ghost aren't they supposed to be scared witless. Which sort of summed up the film really. Witless. I wouldn't give away the ending as to be honest there wasn't one but if they are going to make a Chapter Three they need to keep in mind that he is supposed to be this feared and relentless assassin. And make it two hours shorter."
"rjm-geo","7","1","2","22 January 2018"," Not as satisfying as I hoped, but still good.
","The decision to flesh out the world more in the followup movie was the correct and obvious one. The story is the tired ""one last job"" routine and watching John Wick killing dozens more random bad guys is only partially going to fill that interest gap. Going back to the Continental and expanding on that curious and baroque society with new characters, locations, and mechanisms ... good! That's what I wanted.<br/><br/>The problem of course with explaining what was originally mysterious and ambiguous is it risks an explanation we might reject as nonsensical. Unfortunately with John Wick 2, the more you see the less sense it makes.<br/><br/>So, good things first: fun, memorable characters, well acted, beautifully shot and choreographed.<br/><br/>Bad things: tacked on, pointless opening sequence, poor soundtrack, insufficient time spent developing what could otherwise be poignant emotional or dramatic beats.<br/><br/>Worse things: (spoilers)<br/><br/>I was pulled out of the movie on several occasions. Small things, but they add up.<br/><br/>I'll accept that this is an alternative, matrix-y universe where the world is controlled by all-powerful crime syndicates with an assassins guild maintaining order and balance at the center. That's actually a really cool idea, but the movie doesn't do anything with it. The political and social consequences are not explored, not even hinted at. (Do they have police, is there a functional government, what criminal activities is the Bowery Kind involved in?) So in the last act, when we are thrown into world of regular commuters and city-dwellers, things unravel because the groundwork of how that world fits in with the world of the Continental hasn't been laid.<br/><br/>So, hundreds of people in the city are members of the assassins guild. A contract to kill John Wick goes out, for 7 million dollars and suddenly every 100 yards someone pulls a gun on him, only to be killed - in public view - by Wick. An no one reacts or even notices.<br/><br/>Why don't ordinary people react to gunfights or knife fights happening in the same subway car as they are in? But moreover, why would any assassin, who all know who John Wick is and how impossible he is to kill, make spontaneous, clearly suicidal runs at him for the remote chance of getting a paltry 7 million dollars? ... If John Wick knows that the homeless people are members of a similar assassin criminal network, why don't the guildmember assassins after him also know this? Last example, the gold tokens used to pay for goods and services by the guildmembers. Clearly the value is somewhat arbitrary, but it's understood they are valuable, who knows, say $10000 or more. Wick's rainy day stash only has 50 or so, and just one of them is enough to stay at the Continental for a few days for example. Then there's a scene where one character uses one to pay for another characters drink, turning everything you thought you understood about the system on it's head.<br/><br/>The movie should be structured in such a way as I'm not forced to think about these kinds of petty details. I'm not asking for everything to be spelled out, I'm just asking for things to make sense within its own made-up world.<br/><br/>Finally a comment on the fight scenes. They aren't as memorable or as good as the first film, with the exception of the fight with Cassius, and perhaps Ares. When Wick was attacked in his home in the first film, we knew roughly how many people were after him, and could follow their progress through the rooms as well as Wick's efforts to hide from them take them out. It was a tense and suspenseful sequence. Even the nightclub sequence had a stealth aspect and different spaces to interact with. Here, two dozen goons pop around corners only to be killed instantly one after the other. There is no progression or inventive use of space or geometry outside of immediate blocking cover, just run in, get killed, repeat 20-30 times.<br/><br/>I'm still signed up to watch the next one, I just hope they do a better job next time."
"MarianoJuniper","7","1","2","8 January 2018"," Great sequel that is action-packed and just as fruitful as the first chapter
","John Wick: Chapter 2 brings the hard-boiled character back as the notorious 'boogeyman' and is done so with utmost precision. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves stars as John Wick, a bereaved hitman with a Russian mafia related past who struggles to find the little pleasures in life after his wife's death. When his continuity of life is disrupted by the people he has tried to get away from, Wick easily adapts to his ruthless past and begins his rampage. <br/><br/>There is so much someone can grab and discuss from this film; it is set in John Wicks world, as opposed to the world we know; it is a reinvention, an exploration and indeed a study of what we thought was a normal place to live and roam. The secret societies are an obvious catch to discuss with plenty more other themes to find out. <br/><br/>I would say, however, is that Reeves portrayal as a sort of monstrous assassin is let down with the sweetness of his voice in delivering powerful dialogue. He lacks the punch of conventional 'hard' characters like Bruce Willis or Sylvester Stallone, but perhaps this is what makes his character so great? <br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is outweighed by a brilliantly crafted story line that delivers more while retaining Chapter One's excellent style."

","Let's say the bunch of good things first, and after I tell some little issues that I have with the movie.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is GREAT! Really, I mean, John's theme song is one of the most bad-ass track's I ever see. Right on the beginning of the movie there is a wonderful scene, with bad-ass fight's, and all that stuffs that we want in a action movie, and the track plays a big role on that.<br/><br/>I said that for the first one, I said that for Matrix, and I will keep saying that for every action movie that Keanu Reeves do it: HE IS A GENIUS! <br/><br/>OMG, really, the guy simple destroys in every action scene of the movie, and is so satisfying to see a good action scene, that is film in the right way, without a billion of cuts! It's really so good to see. Well, besides that, I really think that the first movie had more memorable scenes (like that one on the club), there isn't one specific scene of this one that people will talk forever or something like that. Buut, even though, there are a lot great scenes, with great ""OMG! WTF!?"" moments, like when he KILLS A GUY WITH A PENCIL! Or shoot in other guy's balls! The action scenes are undoubtedly the best thing of this franchise.<br/><br/>I really don't have much to say about the actors, on the dialogues part, they are, in the majority, fine. Keany Reeves, as we already know, is the best bad actor out there, so, he's fantastic once again. The main villain, I mean, is ""fine"" too, i don't know, the guy didn't convince myself. The only one that I really thought was great is Ian McShane (he's by far the best actor in the main cast, so that isn't a surprise I think).<br/><br/>There are some silly things about the movie that I think that some people might find it annoyed. Like, HOW IN THE HELL can a guy be a good hit-man if EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM?! Kkkkkkkkk, well, but this doesn't take away the shine of the movie to me at all. In fact, I really thought it was funny for the majority of the time, so I enjoy it a lot (it's like every time that he leaves a place, someone has to say ""good hunting, Mr. Wick"" or something like that. Literally, EVERY TIME! A M A Z I N G !).<br/><br/>Now, seriously, it's seen to me that they really get out of the box on this movie, and kind of change the vibe of the franchise (well, this time he is really a fusion of the Batman and the Punisher. Literally, there is a scene that he use's his suit like a Bat-cape, to avoid the shoots. In the first movie, the vibe was kind different, like a underground, and visceral action thriller). But, I think that is fine, will probably be more difficult to build a franchise based of on the first one lonely. I strongly believe that they aren't able to do another one good as the first, but, well, it's OK, isn't? As long as they keep doing good movies (like John Wick 2 is), they will have my money, they doesn't need to do fantastic movies (like ""John Wick"") for that.<br/><br/>In short, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a great movie, really entertaining, and another lesson to a lot of directors out there of how to shoot action scenes.<br/><br/>8,5/10"

"quakex-925-959388","9","1","2","7 July 2017"," Amazing Sequel That Maintains Almost Every Good Quality About Its Predecessor
","I watched this right after the original John Wick, and it felt like one long amazing movie that never ceased to keep me interested. The only slight drop off in quality is that the story doesn't give me as strong of a reason to want to see John kill the antagonist. However, there is no way I could handle the emotions of seeing another dog die. So I mostly felt relief. Through the whole thing I kept worrying that something would happen to his dog. I was so happy to see it alive and well at the end.<br/><br/>What really defines these movies for me though, is the incredible choreography of the fight scenes, and combining it with just the right amount of story to care about the fighting. In this sense, John Wick: Chapter 2 is perfect.<br/><br/>One slight weakness, that probably isn't a weakness for most, is that this movie seems to want to shoe in another really strong token female villain, that is way stronger than most of the other men. It feels out of place, and takes my attention away from the movie. It just doesn't seem realistic to me for a woman with such a feminine body to be so strong. Like maybe if the female villain looked more like those female body builders that take steroids, it could work. But overall, the scenes with the female villain are short. So this isn't that big of a deal.<br/><br/>As for the criticism that the fighting is a bit unrealistic, in that John seems too immune to the attacks against him, I agree. Usually, I would consider this to be a problem in most movies. But I find it easy to overlook this in this movie, since the style of fighting is just so darn entertaining. In the back of my mind, I just kind of just imagine that he has some slight super power that he and no one else knows about, in order to allow myself to enjoy the fighting."
"thumbworn","5","1","2","7 July 2017"," Unbelievably Bad
","Possible spoilers.<br/><br/>I'm giving this a 5 out of 10 because Ian McShane is always great in a film and because there are much worse films out there, but make no mistake, this is a terrible film and even worse as a sequel. I'm not going to spend an exorbitant amount of time here, but a review elsewhere on IMDb by Chance&Ru does a great job pointing out the reasons why this is a terrible movie. And before I get started, I did enjoy the first Wick movie for the most part.<br/><br/>Quick points: Major body count, but mostly just boring gun fights with faceless enemies meant as filler. Very little of the great hand-to-hand combat that was so enjoyable in the first Wick movie. Clearly the director was more interested in quantity than quality.<br/><br/>John Wick is a bada$$ in the first movie. So much so that mentioning his name invokes fear and he is called the Boogeyman. In this entry, no one is afraid of him, in fact, everyone is gunning for him. He even gets easily bested in a fight with Cassian before being saved due to falling into the Continental. Wick is winded and basically beaten when the fight stops and Cassian hasn't even broken a sweat. <br/><br/>He destroys his beloved car, which makes absolutely no sense. The Boogeyman we know from the first film would've taken out everyone in the garage before attracting their attention with the Mustang. Beyond that, Aurelio says he can fix it. Make no mistake, the Mustang is totaled. He wouldn't have driven that car anywhere, because among other things, there's no way the radiator wasn't destroyed, and there wasn't a salvageable panel on the car. Maybe they could've saved the rear-end, but in an overhead shot you can see clearly that the unibody is severely twisted. And what's up with the bumper-car scene where cars are just randomly, conveniently waiting to hit Wick's car and spin it in circles? Wow.<br/><br/>Wick is impervious to pain, gravity, broken bones and the limitations of the human body. He gets knocked out of the car at high velocity by the impact of another vehicle and stands up immediately. Insert eye roll here. He gets slammed to the ground from more than a few feet off the ground and it doesn't even knock the wind out of him. It doesn't phase him for a split second. Two rounds at point-blank through the stomach-area? No problem, doesn't slow him down a bit. House explodes and blows him out of the structure? He stands right back up as if an explosion of that magnitude has no concussive effect.<br/><br/>In New York City he can't walk for two minutes without being spotted by an enemy. If this section was intended as a time-lapse, it wasn't conveyed well in the movie at all, aside from the portion with the street musician and the sumo. Which goes back to an earlier point that suddenly no one remotely fears John Wick in this movie, aside from Abram.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first chapter of John Wick, but after sitting through Chapter 2 (and believe me, I was tempted to shut it off within minutes), I certainly won't waste the time on Chapter 3, if it even gets made. The director should probably stick to his career as a stunt coordinator, as directing is clearly not his forte. Ditto for the writer. Did I mention how bad the writing and direction are? This a film that serves no purpose aside from a cash grab, or a possibly vanity project. The Wick character doesn't grow or evolve here and the ""plot"" (which consists of Wick being sent to kill someone by another someone to whom he is indebted to the tune of one favor, and then every hitperson in the world trying to kill him) is weak at best."
"alanpgini","6","1","2","6 July 2017"," Disappointing sequel, but its alright
","This one tries to keep a connection with the first installment, but it kind of fails. Truth to tell, the first one should have been a stand alone. The whole secret society thing got old, midway through the picture. The elaborate weirdness seriously tests your suspension of disbelief. Especially near the end. Two thirds through, the plot begins to meander as well. Did this need two hours? It could have been edited to cut 15 minutes to a half hour, and not lost anything of value to the film. Reeves seems to improve as an actor with every film. He's almost shed the valley boy accent. I say almost. But I give him credit, even at age 52, for it taking so long. Laurence Fishburne was waaaay over the top, and needed better directing, as well as Claudia Gerini for being well, too wooden. You get the feeling she is a native Italian language actress, and had trouble translating feeling into English. Is it worth the watch? Yeah, I guess so. But if you were expecting the same quality as the first, you will be disappointed."

","There's something delightfully askew about this movie. For one, the not-so-subtle allusions to Dante. In an action movie.

Like, say, Reeves and Common continuing their fistfight during a fall down the stairs, or even co-opting New York's homeless as part of the assassin network (and Morpheus as their King . . .

In the end it seems the whole world is after Wick, how on earth could he possibly prevail? But you can bet he does and he'll kill everyone who tries to cash in on the $7 million contract.

This afternoon one of Massachusetts' U.S. Congressmen was tossing around the words ""High Treason"" on CNN while discussing how rogue U.S. Army Gen. Michael Flynn, Sr. was White House Resident Rump's Mafioso go-between in selling out America to Rump's Red Commie KGB loan shark Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin even before the Rigged Election of 2016 occurred. Since that day, of course, we've all seen the Basket of Deplorable Putin cabinet picks--confirmed with ONLY the votes of the Putin Party Senators--including the KKK's Jeff Sessions as Putin's Attorney General; Putin's buddy Rex ""Exxon Valdez"" Tillerson as Putin's Secretary of State; Betsy ""Amway Calling"" Pyramid-Scheming DeVos as U.S. Secretary of Miseducation to run Putin's chain of for-profit brain-washing shacks; Tom-the-Inside-Trader Price for the HHS head of extermination camps to deal with all the Americans cut loose by Putin from ObamaCare, Medicaid, Planned Parenthood, and Medicare--the list seems endless. That's why Wick is leading the way in showing how to fight against Traitorous Putin Party Members: with Extreme Prejudice. As YOU plan to do your Patriotic Bit in defending America, notice that Wick ends virtually EVERY confrontation with a head-shot (even the buxom nude chick in the big bathtub). Not all of us will be lucky enough to take down the Ace of Spades or the Queen of Hearts in Putin's stacked deck. Most of us might not even have access to someone ranking as high as the two of clubs.

","As 1st movie, this is a visually good film. Backgrounds, production design , costumes are good. Photography makes everyone look well included in a work of art. Characters are graphic and the whole film wants to be something of a high tolerance James Bond series. It certainly has potential, but where it fails is the emotion. No matter who portrays 007 there is generally a lot of emotion, even if it is anger or dislike. Here everybody seems cold, doing things with cold blood, acting with cold blood. I would be OK with that if action was a bit more realistic.<br/><br/>Keanu is my favorite since the matrix, however in this duology I was expecting a faster choreography. Everyone looks like waiting the next move to reply with his own . A bit like the first Jackie Chang movies but in slower pace.

"p-jonsson","6","2","8","24 June 2017"," Ehhh, what the f... happened?
","I was really hoping I would like this movie. I so enjoyed the first one. However, when the credits started to roll at the end I found myself wondering ""What the f... happened?"".<br/><br/>Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.<br/><br/>One thing I really liked about the first movie was, as you can read in my review about that one, that it was a no BS, kill the bad guys and no emotional regrets, kind of movie. John Wick went all out for revenge and at the same time we got introduced into this cool world of assassins, safe havens, hidden ""shops"" for guns, classy tailors providing bullet proof costumes etc. etc.<br/><br/>In this movie he is forced onto a job by a real a--hole. He is constantly reluctant and walks around with a sad puppy face all the time. Of course said a--hole screws him halfway through the movie and that would have been a good time to start get back on track with some decent payback story but unfortunately the script writers thought otherwise. After some more of the same sh-t no one really wins in the end (although one of the two adversaries suffer a more ""permanent"" setback than the other).<br/><br/>Worse is that, in my opinion, in their eager to put together some stupid drama this movie essentially screwed up the possibilities for a John Wick 3 unless they pull some rather big surprise rabbit out of the hat for that one.<br/><br/>There are plenty of action in the movie of course but also her I feel that it was a bit too over the top. No one, absolutely no one, seems to be able to shoot straight except for John Wick. This makes the action feel more like a parody a'la Kill Bill than a more serious action, revenge movie. Yes it is cool to watch but only up to a point. Heck, if this would have been a Star Trek (TOS) episode Hollywood's entire supply of red shirts would have been used up on a single movie. While I am bitching I should perhaps also mention that the amount of beating that John Wick seems to be able to absorb is  unbelievable.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the movie but not at all as much as I hoped I would. To me it has a completely different spirit than what I remember from the first one and the ending is, again to me at least, not a happy one.<br/><br/>Having said that the action sequences are as cool, crazy but cool, and violent as they are unbelievable. I found it a bit sad that they wrecked his nice car though.<br/><br/>Overall a enjoyable movie but no match for the first chapter and I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars."

","This movie got me entertained from minute 1. When the movie was over I could not believe that this movie was better than the original. In this part they go more in depth in the criminal organization John Wick has access to. <br/><br/>I loved the way they made John Wick portrayed as a boogieman and Keanu does a fine acting.<br/><br/>The action shots were simply amazing and dragged me into this movie. The acting is top notch from all the main characters. Of course it is over the top, but the movie never claims otherwise, they knew it is over the top but this is just fine in the setting of John Wick's legacy (The man, the myth, the legend...)<br/><br/>Personally I loved the role of Ruby Rose, although she does not say a single word in the movie, she fits the role perfectly and gave the movie a funny twist to it.<br/><br/>The ending of this chapter leaves it wide open for a third part, only now the whole world is after him.<br/><br/>All in all the best action movie I recall having seen.

Very reminiscent of a video game, however, I wish that the acting and the story was much better. I don't want to discredit Keanu Reeves for his amazing stunts and fight scenes (which I found out he all did himself), but his acting is not the best. <br/><br/>To me it was unrealistic at some point wherein John Wick was avoiding absolutely every head shot that there was. I love violence and action, but once the plot line solely becomes surrounded by these two things it tends to flat line. I don't mind violence or graphic murders but once it's kill after kill, after kill, it just becomes repetitive. <br/><br/>All in all it was definitely a good movie, for me at least, but it was not the best as it's plot line was too simple.<br/><br/>(Also I kind of wished the dog joined in and attacked people but that's not important.)"

The choreography is bad. (too many times we see people waiting to be hit and the close range shooting is amateurish in that it shows up the incompetence of both Wick and his assailants).<br/><br/>The repetition is just endless, dragging out this mind-numbing farce way beyond what was needed to convince the audience how bad it is. Action films are great, when they are done well. This is not done well.<br/><br/>The very best I could say is that this film display style over substance. But even the style is hyper-hyperbolic trash, with cliches galore.
That the best scene is the ""comedy"" one (was it supposed to be funny? It's impossible to tell) where Wick is pretending he is buying guns from a wine sommelier should be all you need to know.<br/><br/>Hopefully mr Wick got shot immediately after the hour was up and someone collected the $14million (and my very grateful, heartfelt thanks), otherwise I fear we may all be at risk of being exposed to yet more of this dross in the future.<br/><br/>Tl;dr - Avoid."

"dbrownridge","8","1","3","24 July 2017"," The 10 Sins Recanted - Wick Tops Action Hero List
","Looked through some of the reviews and felt obligated to add my two cents, mostly because Keanu Reeves and I are both Canadian and with such a scarcity of Canadian movie stars I feel the need. And I like him too. I like how he hasn't got that one wonky bottom tooth fixed. He's genuine, the real deal; no steroids here, no fake teeth or hair.<br/><br/>But I'm here to talk about his latest: John Wick 2. And I'd like to deal with a review herein that lists 10 great sins in this movie. Let's deal with those: (sorry if grammar is bad, had to edit many times to meet this site's stringent rules; so I'm sick of editing now) 1. Nobody is afraid of him.... Only one stupid Italian guy named Santino isn't afraid; and he's obviously insane. The Russian guy at the start was afraid. And 'afraid' can be subtle, not everyone is going to flat out say this; and there are degrees of fear ie. deep anxiety about getting killed. I believe I saw this in the eyes and face of Fishburne, Cassian (woman's black bodyguard), and Ares, the mute bodyguard. Anyway, totally untrue statement by the writer; Santino took him on because Santino was an idiot (kills his sister), the black bodyguard dude was getting revenge/ doing his job after Wick kills his 'ward', but he can still be afraid. This argument is a non-starter. People fear The Batman, but they still want to kill him.<br/><br/>2. No character growth....... He has changed. By movie's end we can see he has given up on a normal life. He is back to his old self, a killer, with no delusions. He has given up his dream; now he will just kill everyone who comes. You can see it; his destroyed house symbolizes it, all his memories were there, now it's gone. You can see it in his face and his last line of the movie.<br/><br/>3. Weak plot....... good grief, it's hard to respond to such nonsense – tell me any action movie with a great plot! Virtually non-existent. C&R say the first Wick movie had a strong plot. What?! This new one actually has a twist, the old double-cross by Santino. Why didn't Wick just refuse Santino's original offer. He tried, and lost his house. But he still feels he has to try and be free, get back to his dream of normality, so he accepts. He likely knows Santino is a cretin with no honor, but Wick's dream is so important, he'll take the chance.<br/><br/>4. Body count......... It's a modern one-man vs. the world action movie. Let me help you out, the recipe for success these days in an action movie is more action; more action sells. Yes, high body count, very high, but watching Wick I can believe. Hey, Reeves trained heavy for three months for this role: fighting, weapons, and driving. He's not a typical action hero 'kay? He's a freaking assassin, dig? Why do bad guys keep coming? Uh, because they get paid a lot of money? Ummm, because they think it's cool to carry a cool gun and kill someone? Ah, because if they don't their boss will kill them? Duh, they'll be famous for killing Wick? Again, you could say this for every freaking action movie. Why do all those thugs fight superheroes like Wolverine – that's a better question.<br/><br/>5. Invincible........... well, at least he does get hurt, unlike so many action heroes that aren't even scratched after a major beating. Shot in the side twice by the violinist? Well, she was a woman, maybe carried a .22 cal. Shot in the side? Missed vital organs. This is common – Payback, 1999, Mel Gibson is shot twice at close range, in the back, with a .357 Magnum! He lives. Fistful of Dollars, 1964, Clint Eastwood 'Blondie' is shot 7 times! He lives. I could go on and on.<br/><br/>7. Gadgets: somewhat bulletproof suit, 'safe'hotel, silent silencers........ Sure, all of this is impossible.<br/><br/>8. Bad soundtrack........ This is a sin? OK, whatever you say.... It's not fantastic, but it's OK. Anyway, I am from the old days when a soundtrack was background, not in your face like today where it's so loud I can't hear the dialogue, now that is bad. The music here is not terrible. In fact, the weird music performance in the Roman ruins was pretty damn provocative. Don't want to buy the album, but interesting.<br/><br/>9. Pacing...... Action movie/ pacing? I'm confused. In any other genre this might be an issue, but action? Pacing? Sorry, I'm lost here. Action movies, the good ones, have only one pace – freaking frantic, with a few seconds here and there to get beer or hit the john. Any sentimental stuff should be minimal.<br/><br/>10. Rehashing things that worked in the first move......... So, everything that worked the first time – throw all of that out in the next movie! See how long you survive in Hollywood with that mantra: ""It worked great before, OK, so this time all of that is out."" Anyway, my work here is done.<br/><br/>But, the pencil thing, fantastic; the knife fight in the subway with Cassian... Holy heck, that was the best fight I've ever seen! I always loved the hand-to-hand in Bourne, but Wick would kick Bourne's butt!! He is da man! There is no other action hero comparable, hands down: fast, smart, skilled, determined, tenacious, implacable; but with the smallest touch of humanity even when doing his job – he let Fishburne live (years before), and Cassian (heart stab). Anyway, you can see Reeves training at work; really extraordinary fight scenes, and long, and intricate. That sells me on the flick right there."

","First of all, for the haters, you're stupid. Second of all Keanu is the man. That man trained his ass off and it shows. My husband has a man crush on him now because of these movies. He also has no smack to talk about the accuracy of the weapons and training tactics (he has military/LE/SWAT/Armorer training) which is a high compliment since he always gets irritated and points out mistakes in movies.

"Leofwine_draca","9","1","3","17 June 2017"," A superior sequel and a great action movie in its own right
","JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 2 is a great addition to the action thriller genre and a superior sequel to the original movie, which in itself was a very good film. This one has a blistering opening action sequence, and then a relatively slow first hour which builds the story but keeps you interested. In the second hour, this turns into an extraordinary action movie, full of breakneck fight and kill sequences, with literally hundreds of bad guys getting constantly shot by our hero.<br/><br/>The film has the same kind of fluid choreography as the first movie, indebted to THE RAID and very nearly as good. Reeves proves to be an expert in terms of weapon skill and physicality, and if the supporting act are little more than caricatures, then that doesn't really matter. The scene in which Wick has a hit called out on him and is assailed by numerous assassins, utilising weapons such as a pencil to survive, is one of my favourite scenes in Hollywood in the last year or so, and as such I can't recommend this film highly enough."
"wwwchrispoerfts","5","1","3","5 June 2017"," It's an Anime! (sort of..)
","I am definitely not a regular anime fan. I have only seen 6 or 7 of them, but there some generic characteristics i saw in this film that kinda make feel like i was watching one. Yes, know it sounds strange, but it will make sense in a bit..<br/><br/>1. The everyone is killer universe. 95% of all the people involved in the story are assassins. Some lower some higher rank, but they all seem to be involved in the same business. The ones not involved, police, fire department, regular people, are also quite familiar with the concept and they either enable the characters or look the other way while shootouts happen, as if they know exactly what's going on.<br/><br/>2. The Secret Society who controls everything. OK, that's not a new idea, but we usually see it fantasy movies. (And anime.) All around the world secret customer service, with secret hotels, bars, all controlled by some all-powerful, mysterious guys in dark suits with ponytails, a special secret currency and sacred blood oaths.. It's more Underworld than Bourne.<br/><br/>3. The character design. The all have some interesting feature, again very common in anime. The boss(anime lingo) has his creepy Italian accent, the boss's sister has the white dress, the boss's sidekick is a girl in a suit, has androgynous look, doesn't speak and she's good with guns.You really can't go more anime than that! John Wick has long hair and we see some other interesting hair styles and goatees through the film.<br/><br/>4. The over the top killing. Easily 100+ in this one. And with a promise at the end to kill all of them.. It's cartoonish and gory and makes no sense for an action movie but it's again very common (and praised) in anime.<br/><br/>Final thoughts. As a sequel to the first movie it sucked. It all happens in a completely different world. A fantasy one. All of its aspects are cartoonish. The whole thing develops in this weird universe of secret societies and secret codes with an OP main character who fights his way through in a survival mode setting. The only movie i've seen similar to this one is Wanted (2008)with James Mcavoy, which IS labeled a fantasy movie and it's based on a comic and it was funny and silly and that's why it worked. John Wick 2 is darker than that, it's supposed to be serious and set in a non- fictional world but at the same time it kinda looks fictional. <br/><br/>Animation gives you the right to set a non-fictional world but also but put some fantasy characteristics which make things more interesting. John Wick has all of those characteristics and if it was a manga adaptation i would have enjoyed the silly plot and quirks, but as it is, i think it fails."

","Unlike some other action movie sequels they're good and decent (minus Terminator 2, Spider-Man 2, The Dark Knight, and other legendary sequels), but as for Keanu Reeves's John Wick 2, it is another fantastic action movie sequel. The fight scenes are insanely great choreographed, brilliant script and dialogue, and great acting skills from Keanu Reeves and Ian McShane. This sequel showed many assassins from the shadow organization John Wick used to work for; they blend in among the citizens, living in our world. I also love how literally everyone knows John Wick's name. It's like a saying thing that once you know and hear the person's name, you will fear the name.

But I do realize the series has to evolve and it can not just keep giving us the same film over and over again.

","I was more than surprised and entertained with the 2014 ""John Wick"" movie, and was definitely looking forward to the follow-up.<br/><br/>It was a good thing that ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" starts out as a direct continuation of the first movie, and it did serve the movie quite well that director Chad Stahelski opted for that approach.<br/><br/>While ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" initially starts out in a fast pace and with lots of action, it does feel to deflate a bit towards the middle of the movie. But it does regain momentum and get back up in a high gear again.<br/><br/>The story was good, easy to keep up with and packed with action. Very much similar in those aspects as to the storyline presented in the first movie. Actually, one might raise a question at if the storyline was in fact too simplistic, as it was essentially just about John Wick being forced to kill someone in order to not be killed himself, and when the deed is done he goes on a revenge rampage.<br/><br/>The characters in ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" were good enough, however you shouldn't expect a lot of character development or growth, because this is an action movie, pure and simple.<br/><br/>It is primarily the action and the fast pace of the movie that keeps the movie afloat and keeps it watchable. The acting in the movie was adequate, although there wasn't anything really outstanding to be seen here.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first ""John Wick"" movie, then you will definitely also enjoy ""John Wick: Chapter 2"", that much is for certain."

In the first one you don't get the sense of the world Wick lives in. Of course you understand he was a former grandeur assassin and he proves it throughout that movie, but the world that this one creates was genuine. It's adultery and sophistical themes are what push me to say this film was honestly exhilarating. The grittiness of the gun-play is amazing. It's definitely a movie I'd see again."
"pcgamerreturns","10","1","3","24 May 2017"," Best Action Movie Since Terminator 2.
","Roughly 3 years ago, I watched John Wick and was so impressed by it that I ended up watching it multiple times. The story was silly but the execution of the movie was so good that I ended up loving it even more than Mad Max: Fury Road. There were still some minor issues with the movie that could be improved like story for example or the final fight. <br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2 on other hand is basically original film but many times better. It also fixes the problems the first movie had. If the first one was 8.5 or 9 then this one is easily 10. It's near flawless movie with charisma rarely seen in movies these days. This time the movie features a great story which adds more the lore of John Wick universe without feeling like an afterthought or non- canon.<br/><br/>Everything fits so well with the first movie and lore seems to be natural extension of the first movie. Even action is much better than the first one. Stunts were jaw dropping and gunplay is just stunning to look at. Despite featuring fast paced action, the movie doesn't feature shaky cam, so you can watch the whole thing without any problem (with full clarity). <br/><br/>Characterization has improved as well. First movie had likable characters and this one delivers in that department too. In fact, I'd say characters are even better than the first film. Soundtracks are also just as badass as they always were, and the final fight is also fantastic. Last but not least, the ending is absolutely brilliant. <br/><br/>It made me sad and excited at the same time. It gave me goosebumps while setting the stage for the third movie extremely well. Overall, I think the movie is almost flawless, from beginning to end. It was definitely worth the wait. Go get this film NAOW!!!"

","John Wick: Chapter 2 showed no signs of being stale as Keanu Reeves makes a welcome return to this stylish action packed sequel to the surprise 2014 box office hit. It's more entertaining, exciting, and action packed.<br/><br/>After the events from the first movie, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) wants to close the door on his past life as a hit-man once and for all. That comes under threat when fellow assassin Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) wants John to kill his sister Gianna (Claudia Gerini) in Rome. Initially John refuses which sees Santino destroy his house but then John reluctantly accepts the offer. Things get further complicated when a $7 million bounty is placed on John's head to kill him. John now finds himself on the run from the many assassins who want to claim the bounty including Santino himself as well as many others including the mute Ares (Ruby Rose) and Cassian (Common).<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves returns to the titular role that was a thrill to watch back in 2014. Here he does what he does best and in typical Keanu Reeves style physically throws himself into the role by doing most of his own stunts as well as learning a variety of martial arts and how to handle an assortment of firearms.<br/><br/>Also returning from the first movie are John Leguizamo, Ian McShane, Lance Reddick and Bridget Moynahan. Keanu Reeves also reunites with Laurence Fishburne for the first time since The Matrix Trilogy (1999-2003).<br/><br/>The action is bigger, better and more brutal. Nonetheless it's still entertaining. You'll have to set aside some bits that may have you in disbelief but you can't look past it all.<br/><br/>The big question now is will there be another sequel? All indications may be pointing to yes.<br/><br/>8/10."

I thought the gun play would make the movie worth my time, but the story and tropes they roll out are so juvenile that it's insulting.

","I loved the first film. Was excited to see the second, and just like i suspected there is a bit too much action again...or should i say even more!??...i like to call over the top and over done movies ""walmart movies""....they only please the people who like to watch the most action packed thing imaginable..with little attention to actual acting or using their brain to watch the movie. Don't get me wrong, great filmaking, great colors..screenshots..stunts..and some good quirky lines...but anything with too much of ANYTHING can ruin the simplest thing. Take a sandwich for instance. Too much meat? Throws it off. Too much lettuce? Hard to keep the thing together. Too much bread or cheese? Things damn dry to eat and you got stuff stuck up in your teeth. Keep all the ingredients minimal with one or two things a little extra and BAM you got a dope sandwich.. What im trying to say is, i love keanu reeves, and the filmmakers did a fantastic job....but please please please make movies like they are suppose to be. Art. Simply put, a classic. These movies could easily be classics, but the over the top neck breaking action that lasts the entire movie is a little too much..it needs some damn suspense!! We need to know if the actor might not make it..not sitting there going oh wait some more dudes half way into the movie hes definitely going to just kill them all.........im not really looking forward to the next one unfortunately. Sorry dudes who made thus film, i couldn't imagine how hard it is to make...but take a little action out and its a new die hard for sure...add more to it and its just going to be too hard of a sandwich to hold onto ;)"
"autisticreviewers","9","1","3","8 May 2017"," Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
","When it comes to action films, you want pure action, a decent storyline to follow and of course pure escapism from reality. With John Wick: Chapter 2, not only does it manage to be as entertaining as the first film but makes to pump up the action, body count and style to make it a worthy example of how a sequel should be done.<br/><br/>Starting from the last moment of the first film, John Wick manages to finish off his quest for revenge and tracks down his stolen prized possession; his Mustang Mach 1. Having found peace at last but not for long, a visit from Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio offers him to finish his 'impossible task' that allowed him to retire in the first place, but making a blood oath that symbolises an unbreakable promise to demand his service. John refuses but when his home is destroyed by Santino, John has no choice but to complete his favour, but it's not long until Santino learns that you can never stab the devil in the back.<br/><br/>With returning cast of Keanu Reeves, Ian McShane and John Leguizamo, joined up with new faces to this up and coming trilogy, JW2 brings us back to the old days when action was taken to great detail. The acting range is strong throughout, with Reeves being back as a bad ass hit-man who can never seem to lose a fight, Riccardo Scamarcio as the film's smart but cunning villain who proves to be a worthy foe. I was surprised by the appearance of Ruby Rose as an mute assassin ally of the villain, she plays a role that shows that she's in her game still after having been in the last xXx film and the last installment of the Resident Evil film series.<br/><br/>In terms of story, it's straight forward and never goes into dull or dumb territory though we are shown the world of John Wick's lifestyle of being an hit-man in the crime syndicate, we never embrace on why he did it in the first place, but he does have skills that make him a ruthless anti hero. Sound editing and mixing is spot on here, it's pretty doubtful that it will get Oscar nominations for it but the sound was crisp, brutal and yet beautiful for the ears (the magic of Dolby Atmos makes his more awesome in the cinema). And of course, the action set pieces are all entertaining, thrilling and yet beautifully choreographed like a ballet or dance number. With blood splatter, broken bones, bullets and wounds showering the screen with awe and amazement.<br/><br/>The verdict is pure and simple, a 9 out of 10 rating that sure has us satisfied and craving for a third outing. With awesome action and choreography work, eye on detail and performances, John Wick: Chapter 2 proves that action can still be awesome with style, brutality and be back with a vengeance. Jay and I both agree on this, we recommend this for all action junkies."
"jabaleno","10","1","3","25 April 2017"," If anything, a little more Wick-ed than the first
","Honestly, when I heard this movie was coming out, I wasn't 100% sold on it. After all, how can you really top the first?<br/><br/>Well, they did. I do need to qualify this though, the recasting of Keaneau Reeves and the fact that the dog survived made it a worthy successor to the first.<br/><br/>Keaneau knows how to do the moves and has legitimately trained in the tactical arts. That is what really makes this so much more than 'just another high body count action movie'. His ability to move like he was actually trained (because he was) takes this series to a whole new level.<br/><br/>He pours his heart and soul into this franchise and it works. Again, not a whole lot of plot for you to think about, but a sublime level of action, body count and a little bit of the quirk Mr. Reeves is known for make this a phenomenal sequel, and one that I will be watching again."

Riccardo Scamarcio does a good job as Santino D'Antino. Ian McShane was excellent as Whinston. Ruby Rose was good as Ares. Common was good as Cassian. Other, more minor characters, such as Charon(Lance Reddick) were well acted and served roles in the movie. Lawrence Fishburn was also great as The Bowery King. The actual villains of the movie were pretty weak.<br/><br/>The story was pretty cool and the ending was perfect. It was very interesting and deeply explores the world built in the original, which was one of my main flaws with the original.<br/><br/>Good overall cinematography.<br/><br/>The effects were good, the set design was gorgeous and the costume design was decent.<br/><br/>I think this movie outdoes the original in every conceivable way. The action scenes were flawless and the random inserts of humour worked well.

"rme-adam","8","1","3","9 April 2017"," A Cool, Clever and Cracking Sequel
","John Wick is regarded as the Boogeyman by all villains (that pencil..) and yet, when we see him in action, he's not some lean, muscled, high-kicking Judo master with humming bird movement.<br/><br/>He's a man of focus and pure willpower, both of which are so cleverly and subtly displayed on the screen - more so in this cracking sequel.<br/><br/>He can't run like the wind, but he can shoot straight enough to disable then dispatch at close quarters while his radar is pinging nineteen to the dozen for the next target.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves beautifully balances the gritty and frenetic fight/shoot sequences with a slight sluggishness properly belying his real age (52). When he plans in advance, you can't help but grin in empathetic revenge.<br/><br/>Chapter Two runs easily on from the first burst, and develops John Wick's character further in a logical way. No spoilers here, but the ending will have you not wanting, but simply knowing there is more to come.<br/><br/>In short - if you liked or loved John Wick, then you're in for a treat.<br/><br/>This is an uber-cool (check out the analogue-to-mobile phone network!), logical and well-made sequel, and a welcome return to the screen for Reeves. He won't win Oscars, but he's winning fans back Big Time.<br/><br/>FOOTNOTE:<br/><br/>Probably the greatest anti-hero of modern popular literature is Jack Reacher.<br/><br/>Cruise's attempt to bring that great protagonist to the screen in 2012 was somewhat egotistical - given he's almost a foot shorter, far more charming and easier on the eye than the big, ugly yet somehow attractive character so often alluded to in Lee Child's 21 novels. Still, the movie did OK.<br/><br/>Last year's sequel however was excruciatingly bad, and a perfect example of Hollywood's incessant focus on the viewers' pockets, rather than their desires.<br/><br/>Cue, in 2014, a new anti-hero. John Wick isn't based on any book, comic, or otherwise. Rather, he's an original screenplay by one Derek Kolstad - until then a comparatively unknown screenwriter.<br/><br/>Combined with Chad Stahelski (stunt double for Keanu in the Matrix series) and his solid, focused direction, we've been brought us a new guy to look up to."

","John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is back and this time not by his choice. Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarico), a crime lord, has Wick tied up in a blood debt. Without choice the legendary assassin is forced to embark on one last mission to free his soul, but when he realizes that he will not be left alone he decides to take matters into his own hands.<br/><br/>""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a solid, action packed sequel which lives up to the original's potential and builds on it with even more world building and assassin lore. Whilst lacking some of the crazy fun that made the first entry so charming, it still holds to incredible the standards of action and improves on them with an even stronger stylistic voice.<br/><br/>What the film has to be praised the most for is the unity of vision that director Chad Stahelski brings to every frame of the film. Be it the lively colors and neon lights or the the breathtaking kinetic pace, it is so wonderful to see an action film stamped with a style that en-chances the story and livens the world. So many times we are treated to generic tropes and flashy visuals that are there for the sake of it. But Stahelski knows his stuff and paints a world that is there for the viewer to be carried away with, making every action beat more relevant because of the inherent interest and fascination this film gives the audience into its underground.<br/><br/>There is a lot of montaging and simultaneous cutting going on in the picture and it was one of the most pleasant aspects not to be turned off by it. Sequence after sequence the stakes are always ramping up, the filmmakers here clearly know how to manipulate an audience and take them through a constantly engaging journey. Of course it helps that the action is almost impeccable, every stunt is both perfectly carried out and seamless with the flow. There might be a couple of times in which it bleeds over into overkill, but they are very rare. For the majority the set pieces are highly original, they are flashy in the best way possible and contribute in making the action more alive, by always setting it in a new, surprising environment.<br/><br/>One aspect that has to be mentioned is just how beautiful the film looks, the cinematography is just jaw dropping. At one point there is a long take that keeps going and going and it was a joy. The frames are so smartly composed, the use of color in this feature is off the charts, some might call it a little too on the nose, but I found it masterful, the craft that must have gone into making this images look as they do is truly remarkable, even more so when you consider that it is rarely ever unwarranted. It supports the story, it makes it more relevant and gives this sense of rawness and liveliness to the world of crime.<br/><br/>I have to admit that this sequel does not quite reach the level of its predecessor. Be it because of a weak finale with revelations right and left that were completely unnecessary and void of any relevance to characters or story. Furthermore, this one does not quite reach the standard of fun and catharsis that was present in the first one, it decides to ramp up the seriousness a little and I think it partially suffers because of it, there isn't the sense of ridiculousness that made the first one so incredibly entertaining.<br/><br/>Yet, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" remains a masterful action film that elevates itself above the average and gives us a picture full of suspenseful and savage sequences, with great characters and even better world building."
"tlacoman","7","1","3","19 March 2017"," A movie worthy of you saying ""Holy F*cking Sh*t""
","Chad Stahelski's ""John Wick"" was full of spirit and the sequel doesn't lose one second of it. Every scene feels like effort was put into it. It seems like every one on the crew loved making this film and it payed off. John Wick Chapter 2 doesn't drag like most sequels, instead it plays off the first one very well. It's world is a world I want to live in. And that's not even mentioning the beautifully executed action scenes."

Examples such as The Expendables 3 and The Mechanic 2 are recent ones that come to mind. <br/><br/>That being said I was pleasantly surprised with this entry. It expanded on the curiosity-grabbing sub-culture of the hotel from the first film. They wisely kept Keanu in his element...not speaking much, just kicking, punching, and shooting. It actually felt like an extension of the first movie. I am looking forward to the third, and hopefully final film. Baba Yaga."
"Shred_Master","9","1","3","18 March 2017"," A rare case where the sequel outshines its predecessor
","So I really enjoyed the first John Wick. Of course they made a sequel, because Hollywood just can't resist. I didn't expect Chapter 2 to be nearly as good, much less surpass the last one but lo and behold, they did it.<br/><br/>John is the same assassin we saw from the first movie. Again, he is attempting to live the retired life and again, the rest of the world just won't let him. He doesn't have trouble adjusting back to being the living legend assassin he is known for, of course.<br/><br/>Fair warning, the first act is a lot of build up. It opens with an action chase scene but you might feel like it's not that impressive, compared to the intensity of the action scenes we saw in JW1. Then, the movie takes a little while to get him back in the swing of things and in killing mode again. Once he arrives in Rome though and he is on a new assassination assignment, all hell breaks loose and it's loads of fun non-stop. The action scenes are longer and even more frenetic this time around. They also stepped up the gore. There were quite a few people in the theater wincing at a good number of the death scenes. So be warned, you might not want to bring the young ones. This is not for the faint of heart. <br/><br/>This is a pure popcorn, shoot 'me up, turn your brain off, good time action flick. The film makes no apologies for what it is and in fact, it revels in it. Sure, there are some things that don't make sense. Sure, there is some subpar acting. Sure, it is not a movie for everyone but really, they know their target audience and with the movie holding steady at 90% on RT after being in theaters for a months and then some, it's safe to say their audience is pleased!"

We find out more about the strange kill or be killed world he (reluctantly) inhabits. This time his dog lives, but about 110-120 bad guys don't. Gun enthusiasts enjoy the skillful way Mr.Reeves handles his gun hardware, and the realistic way his character is forced to change magazines frequently. It was cool to see Mr. Fishburne and Mr.Reeves back together again. I am thinking we'll see more of his character in Chapter 3. I will be looking forward to seeing the final installment of this very exciting movie trilogy."
"freaky_dave","8","1","3","4 March 2017"," John Wick is good.
","I enjoyed the first John Wick, and I enjoyed this one just as much. It more detailed with some world building not seen as much in the first film, which introduced us to this character. THe violence is more graphic. It's like an onslaught that starts from the beginning and never lets up. THis is larger, grittier, and badder, and all in a good way. Keanu Reeves plays his part just as he should, and lo to anybody that gets in his way. THis film is intense, with action scenes that seem more realistic than some of the CGI that takes over other action films. Recommended."
"Pete-230","8","1","3","2 March 2017"," Homage to John Woo? (Mild spoiler)
","For years, I wondered why no action directors followed in the footsteps of John Woo, specifically his classics like ""A Better Tomorrow,"" ""The Killer,"" and ""Hard Boiled."" He pretty well created singlehandedly the ""ballet of bullets"" style; that is, structuring and pacing action flicks like classic musicals, with a series of tightly-choreographed set pieces (musical numbers vs gunfights/martial arts battles) connected by the barest bones of a plot and played out by stock characters whose motivations are sketched in broad emotional strokes. With the Chad Stahelski's first ""John Wick"" and Gareth Huw Evans' ""The Raid: Redemption,"" it finally seemed a couple of filmmakers had picked up Woo's torch.<br/><br/>Don't know whether it was deliberate on Stahelski's part, but toward the end of ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" it appears he tipped his hat to Woo by inserting one of the latter's signature tropes - a flock of doves or pigeons suddenly taking flight. Stahelsi does it twice in the space of a minute or two - out of focus in the background when Wick and Winston are conversing, then much more explicitly when the Bowery King releases the bird in his hand and the others in his aerie take off. If it wasn't on purpose, it sure was a nifty coincidence."
"greggs_nbacon","8","1","3","2 March 2017"," A technically great action film
","The age of great action movies is virtually over in America. Let's face it, movies like Terminator 2, Aliens, Die Hard, and Rambo were all entities that, no matter how any unnecessary sequels the studios behind them chose to make, spiritually ended in the 80s and 90s. Many times, modern action movies are simply the run of the mill superhero movies that fit into some greater cinematic universe. The new dominant ""action"" franchise is the endless teenage boy wet dream saga that is the Fast and Furious series. The last great action movie I had truly seen was probably Skyfall in 2012. That is until John Wick: Chapter 2.<br/><br/>The first John Wick movie was a solid run of the mill action movie. I thought the premise was slightly uninventive and storywise, very predictable. However, the second movie I felt was an interestingly developed story. John Wick is now a fully developed character and in hindsight, that's what the first film was trying to do. I always say that stars do not make a movie, but the talent behind the camera. these technical achievements make this film stand out among many boringly average action movies. Director Chad Stahelski and writer David Kolstad return for the sequel. Interestingly enough, Stahelski was Keanu Reeves stunt double for The Matrix Trilogy, which is frequently cited as some of the greatest action films. It is Stahelski's background in what makes stunts look so effortless. The real amazing work in John Wick: Chapter 2 comes at the hands of director of photography Dan Laustensen. I had previously applauded Laustensen's work two years ago in Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak. The way he is able to capture the hues and lights is an incredible capture of the modern neo-noir style, highlighting shadows and their opposition to the light. The real sequence that blew me away was the use of mirrors in one sequence of the movies. No spoilers, but the way the camera captured these mirrors. The sets in this movie done by Letizia Santucci and David Schlesinger are some of the best designed sets I have seen in quite some time. Most of the film is done in old fashioned practical effects, rather than showing off overly flashy and dull computer graphic imaging. CGI has become a huge cop out for many action movies, and it is always nice to see a return to the old-fashioned way of doing effects.<br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2 is The Empire Strikes Back to this saga. In some ways, it leaves you with more questions than answers. The film follows in the style of an old serial film being set to a violent aesthetic and violent setting. this film's technical achievements allow me to give it a much higher score, as it chooses to stand out from the crowd."

The answer is no. Its much, much better. <br/><br/>It builds a whole new world. A whole new cinematic universe. I don't want to dive deeper in to that. Keanu once again was amazing as the cold blooded assassin. He did most of the stunt work in all the amazing action sequences. He delivered one of the best performances I have ever seen, even though almost all his lines where cheesy. Because he was doing almost all the stunts. Amazing direction. The fights where so wonderfully choreographed and performed. No shaky cam (HELL YEAH!), amazing lighting and that last mirror sequence was so darn good. All the breaks from the action where amazing.From the start till the end of the movie I had a huge smile on my face. Great stuff.<br/><br/>I cant wait for the next chapter.

","Plot: After returning to the criminal underworld to repay a debt, John Wick discovers that a large bounty has been put on his life.<br/><br/>This was a fun sequel to a film that grew on me overtime, I won't get too much into the story since I do want people to see it before it leaves theaters, Keanu Reeves is so good as this character showing us that he can act unlike what other people say. The rest of the cast also do a very good job particularly Common who has some of the best scenes of the movie with Keanu. The action in this film is very well handled using zero shaky cam and instead using wide shots which lets us see what's going on unlike certain action films. I wish certain filmmakers would take a lesson from this film to know how you should shoot action, but that's just me.<br/><br/>The only negatives I have are the little pacing issue in the beginning especially one scene that could've been cut down by a minute or two and that the villain wasn't particularly interesting, although the actor playing him was fine, I wish they got someone that would've made the character more interesting.<br/><br/>Besides that, John Wick: Chapter 2 is a really good sequel to a really good film that is worth your time and money. You won't regret it."
"laywilson","8","1","3","22 February 2017"," I may not live up to the first one but it's still a load of fun
","John Wick Chapter 2 follows a retired hit-man shooting people in the head(yep that's about it). I had a total blast with John Wick Chapter 2. This movie knows what it is and it plays with it. The story is thin and characters are cool but what makes this franchise so good is the world building and the action. I think that the world building in these movies are totally underrated. There is a whole system underground of assassins and hit-men and the system kind of makes no sense but it's just so cool. That's why this franchise could be a cinematic universe of sort because everybody knows Jon Wick and so many characters are just there being cool while we could have spin-offs. Of course the star of this movie are the action sequences and they are fantastic. Now each fight scene have many of the same stuff as the original but that works for this movie. There are long takes of people beating the crap out of people and it's just beautiful. So go see John Wick 2, you won't be disappointed."

","John Wick 2 is a cool film, visually, if you truly understand what you're going to see. It's not cult or deep in lines 'cause it wasn't (probably - surely) meant to be! so, what's with all the exaggerated critics?! <br/><br/>i understand the comparison with first chapter, it's inherent, and from this perspective chapter 2 is probably different, not weaker to me. It has good parts and bad parts, obviously, but definitely the first 10 minutes will rebirth the road movie action genre.<br/><br/>one thing that i liked it very much, was the ""tarantino"" touch with all that mass killing and ""profound"" lines which made me laugh. i warn you: if you take it too seriously you'll miss it's charm!"
"ayoreinf","8","1","3","21 February 2017"," A sequel, for better or worse
","When making a sequel, the rule of thumb around Hollywood is to push the action, the blood quantities and the speed up a notch or two. So John Wick 2 follows this rule to the letter, it also follows the first chapter in style, namely the unlikely action scenes are made to look as real as possible. Not synthetic ballet like action but gory bloody fights in which everyone get hurt. That is everyone who's not an innocent bystander. No matter how crowded the scene is, there won't be any collateral damage here. Which means that no matter how real it does look, it's still a movie. But the gritty real appearance does make up for the small plot holes. Keanu Reeves is still within the limited borders of his range and most of the other roles are performed superbly. Ian McShane, is as first class as ever, even if I've seen him doing this role many times before. Common, Laurence Fishburne, Riccardo Scamarcio, and almost everybody else on screen are performing at the highest quality possible.<br/><br/>But the worst thing that could happened to John Wick is that it will make it big in the box office, since they're already working on chapter 3. And obviously, it'll be bloodier, faster, grittier. It'll make even less sense, but people will die here by the truckload, so who cares, let us all have action galore."

"kgprophet","6","2","11","13 February 2017"," Keanu finds a Franchise
","I was a little amazed at the number of people attending the matinÃ©e showing of this film. My excuse for being there was that Hollywood has been releasing garbage this time of year, and this was the first film that showed some interest. Curiosity was the main attraction for me. How would they expand this code of honor among thieves mythology? How would the film expand it's world with a larger budget? Would the film meet it's higher expectations? To some degree this film has a bit of repetition from the first film, revisiting locations from the first film, with characters reiterating events that happened. I got to hand it to Keanu Reeves, his dark persona makes you think he was created from a graphic novel that is larger than life. Yet there are a few quirky moments that makes you think this guy is nuts. There are certain moments of offbeat humour, but I wish there were more. The story itself is a simple revenge story that has no real twists. You know John Wick will do what he says. <br/><br/>The action beats are top notch. A fair mix of car chase, martial arts, but primarily a tsunami of bullets. The film seems to take pride in keeping count of how many shots Wick fires per cartridge, as we witness the meticulous routine of changing cartridges throughout each orgy of gunfire. With a visit to Italy, production design has a chance to find new backdrops for our storybook characters. One could believe Nicolas Refn directed this film, with the heavy use of colored lights and lush architecture to enhance the look of our characters. There is not a great deal of subtlety in the story or dialogue, perhaps trying to feel like an old western, where one didn't need more than a few words to spell out their revenge. <br/><br/>I applaud what looks like a new franchise for Keanu. It's fun to just let the large set pieces play out, giving the filmmakers an opportunity to show their creativity, as well as competency in pulling off Bond/Bourne level of action sequences. I liked the quirkiness of the first film that is less apparent in the sequel. I like the locations and new characters featured in this film. One might wonder though how much of the fearless barrages against busloads of bad guys Wick can sustain before it gets old. For now, I once again will give the filmmakers kudos for clocking the film in at 2 hours, no over- complicated subplots, no extra twists."
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","2","11","11 February 2017"," Not All That and a Pile of Spent Bullets
","Okay, I'm going to need someone to sit down and explain this one to me. Please use words, graphs, colored charts and anything else at your disposal because I really am a little blindsided by the success of this series. I mean, we are all aware John Wick (2014) and this new sequel are, by and large okay action movies, right? They're the kind of action movies that, more or less, gives genre fans what they expect and is sort of stingy about the rest. This movie is good but is it Die Hard (1988) good? Is it Enter the Dragon (1973) good, is it 91% on Rotten Tomatoes good? I would argue no. The John Wick series is arguably no better than early nineties Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicles no matter how many architectural wonders they foist behind Keanu Reeves. The only real difference here is director Chad Stahelski brings a scintilla of visual flare to the party while the plot lugs around suitcases full of world-building ornamentation. If John Wick had one thing going for it, it's that came absolutely out of nowhere. John Wick 2: It Gets Wickier, doesn't have that benefit.<br/><br/>And what exactly is John Wick (Reeves) avenging this time? Well, everyone has moved past the dog; especially and including criminal big-wig Santino D'Antonio (Scamarcio). Since the assassin has signaled he's no longer retired, D'Antonio calls upon Wick to make good on a blood oath that is enforced by the same nefarious international crime syndicate that also happens to operate the luxury hotel chain from the first flick. Wick is, of course double-crossed, things escalate and the entire criminal underground, only hinted at in the first film are suddenly all out hunting for him.<br/><br/>Much like the first film, John Wick 2 is visually impressive and includes some pretty arduous fight sequences, at least from the perspective of the stuntmen. Yet the movie lacks any tension and fails to establish any real stakes. Wick, hereto described as the biggest swinging d**k in all of murderdom, has an incredible reputation as an unstoppable boogeyman. So much so that point blank shots to the gut, stabs to the leg and tumbles out of his car barely faze him. Keanu Reeves is not just portraying a character with uncommon physical abilities; he's basically playing a superhero.<br/><br/>He's a superhero that's up against regular, Joe-Shmoe villains, who are put down with a simple double tap to the head. With the exception of Common's loyal guardian and Ruby Rose's deaf henchman, there really doesn't seem to be a whole lot standing in Wick's way. Unless of course you include the inner workings of The Continental whose two rules (honor the blood oath and no killing on company grounds) aren't exactly an advantage. Ian McShane's posh hotel manager Winston returns to give the audience enough insight into The Continental's inner workings; a function that often feels more like a pacing siphon.<br/><br/>As said before, the fight sequences are quite impressive and Stahelski does an exquisite job showcasing their physicality. Additionally, Keanu Reeves as a close quarter's brawler does find a handful of moments that force onlookers to erupt in coliseum level cheer. Yet the film lacks any real action set pieces that aren't callbacks to other, better action films, or a remix of the same ingredients used in the first movie. In John Wick, the obvious low budget was enough to overlook the lack of a big blowout finale but here it's obvious they purposely eschewed such a choice. The results are a repetitive sequence of fight, rest, fight, rest, exposition, fight, rest.<br/><br/>At a pivotal point, our cocksure villain stands triumphant amid a room full of Grecian statues. This in a nut shell is the kind of almighty status John Wick 2: No Rest for the Wicked is looking to attain. It's knocking on the door of greatness and is asking to join the pantheon of truly awesome high-octane action movies. Some people are inclined to open the gates on this one but I say we should all just turn out the lights and pretend no one is home."

","Just not worth it. If you want to get some cheap thrills and see some guns firing than fine, but really not worth it. Dunno why it's so highly rated. To be honest, I didn't even like Keanu Reeves in the role much. The rest of the cast and direction is just as disappointing."
"Tweekums","8","1","4","5 January 2019"," A thrilling, action packed sequel
","Opening four days after the first film ended we see retired hitman John Wick retrieving his car... inevitably this includes a fair amount of violence. Following this prologue he returns home and is approached by Santino D'Antonio, a senior Mafioso who wants John to do a job for him... go to Rome and kill his sister so he can take the top position in their organisation. John declines despite having given the man his marker. Soon it becomes clear he has no choice. The job isn't going to be easy as his target is well protected and Santino doesn't want any loose ends... Wick is considered a loose end.<br/><br/>The first film may have had more emotional depth but that doesn't mean this is inferior. It is action packed from start to finish. There are only brief lulls in the action as the job is explained and Wick gets the equipment he needs for the job. Even these quieter scenes are fun as Wick and his arms supplier talk about firearms as if he were discussing what to eat with a waiter at an upmarket restaurant. The action scenes are full-on with numerous bad guys being shot, stabbed and even dispatched with a pencil. It is delightfully over the top at times; I loved how just about every other person in New York appeared to be a hitman keen to get the seven million dollar reward for killing Wick. Keanu Reeves does a fine, no-nonsense, job as Wick and the rest cast are solid even if their roles are much smaller. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of full on action."

","The first John Wick was not very bad although the action was also exaggerated but this sequel is in fact a stupid movie.

The story is also as stupid as the action is: why kill the nice looking sister of d'Antonio and not this asshole instead? Now Wick has to kill first the whole army of the sister and after that the whole army of d'Antonio.... OK, the action is ""entertaining"" as you look it as all being possible and do not question the events and action. But if an army has one super-soldier like John Wick they do not need tanks, airplanes and soldiers anymore... So, this movie is very unrealistic, as most of the Hollywoord-movies are, but it is in fact not only a stupid movie but also annoying.

","The world of John Wick is completely bonkers - there seem to be more assassins than regular people, and not many of those seem to bat an eyelid when men covered in blood chasing each other and even firing shots in public pass by. It is a paranoid world of power-play and clandestine rules that make no sense in reality. The saving grace is that both films are aware of this and even play to it to enhance the fun. A neon noir world of super-cool, expanded from the first film mostly in satisfactory ways. The rules of this underworld are more explained here, which is both welcome whilst perhaps defusing a little of the mystique. If you can ignore how a mortal man can be so thrown around, run over, shot, repeatedly punched, stabbed and otherwise brutalised and then still walk away to do it all again in two minutes time then you will have a ball with John Wick two. Ticks all the action boxes, is smart, funny and above all a great piece of entertainment. High art? No. 7/10."

This movie praises John Wick like he's the best assassin in the world and no one can kill him. This certainly rings true because even when he's bloody, bruised, and limping, he still manages to have his full strength. He certainly goes through his fair share of torment, but I just can't root for him. John Wick causes most of his own problems. He doesn't care about the rules (he killed someone in a safe spot), so why didn't he just kill his Marker at the beginning? I'll tell you why. John Wick loves killing people and gets a hard on for it. This is why I can't root for him because he's a terrible person. I can't root for John Wick over the villain because that would make me a hypocrite. He manages to be more unlikable than the villain because John Wick is going around killing and shooting at other people and terrorizing people. The main villain only killed and hurt his sister, who was just as much of a jerk as the villain, and John Wick, a guy who goes around killing random people. <br/><br/>Then the end is infuriating with very little relief. ""It has been a pleasure Mr. Wick"" Really? Killing someone in a safe spot really ruined your reputation and killed any potential business just because he couldn't hold his temper. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie blows. Unlikable protagonist that manages to be even more unlikable than the villain and stupid business men. It's an action porn, so don't expect anything else. The only reason this movie gets a 4 instead of a 3 like the last one is because they had a scene where John Wick unlocked an old lock using an old key. I love watching that and wish there were more videos on it."

","John Wick 2 starts from where John Wick ends. The massacre he did in part 1 continues in part 2 too. Both the films should be enjoyed for the action. Story was OK. Lone guy who is a killing machine, retired, brought back from retirement to do another assignment forcefully, we have seen this before. But what separates both this movies from other action flicks is the stunning action itself. I love the idea of one man army. Don't you dare to come across him. He kills and doesn't regret it. People associated with him, fear him. There is a reason why he is called as, ""Boogeyman""! John Wick is back and this time he lacks what he had in the first film. Still he manages to engage us with his struggle to complete the task and make himself free with his superb action and killings. If you loved the first installment, then you will definitely love this.

","John Wick Chapter two is an explosion of violence. Case of light Wick and stand back. <br/><br/>Everything is a weapon, cars, guns, hand to hand, knives and even pencils. This movies flows well, along with an endless stream of blood. Its a well worn formula that really should not work but for some reason, it does. <br/><br/>I think the key reason it does work is its variety, polish and Keanu Reeves. Reeves is clearly not a martial artist (although it appears some time has been invested in giving him some general Ju Jitsu style training). This lack of martial expertise is compensated for by cleverly using everything as a weapon in quick succession. Reeves also suits this kind of dead eyed killer role well. Who would have thought Ted from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure would travel so well in the action genre. <br/><br/>This is implausible stuff but its done so well this hardly matters. Eight out of ten from me."

","John Wick goes back to get his car from a Abram, lots of car carnage ensues as Abram sends his minions to get in John's way. Presumably this takes place soon after part 1.<br/><br/>He barely gets home in his wreck. He's got a new dog, too. Then Italian mob boss Santino pays a visits. He wants to cash in a ""marker."" That's a medallion with John's bloody finger print. It entitles Santino to a favor which John can't refuse. This is in exchange for a favor that allowed John to retire years ago. Of course John is retired so he does refuse. In return, Santino blows up John's house.<br/><br/>John goes to the Continental to have a word with Winston who reminds John about the rules and that he cannot refuse the marker. So John of course reluctantly agrees. The job is to kill Santino's sister who was just promoted to some crime syndicate. He wants her place. In Rome, her induction party is about to take place and John prepares by getting weapons, suits, and studying the maps of the catacombs beneath Rome.<br/><br/>John gets the job done, but on his way out he realizes that Santino has turned on him. So he has to make his escape. Santino puts a a price of 7 million on John's head and now every killer in NY is after him. Eventually John has to confront Santino and in the process breaks one of the rules of the Continental which means he's now in serious trouble.<br/><br/>John Wick 2 is another great entry in what is among my favorite action franchises. This is serious old fashioned action made up mostly of gun fights and cool choreographed mano-a-mano fights. I can't recall another movie where the sound of gun shots was this satisfying. You can't get enough of it. This movie also has a great villainess in the character of the deaf hottie Ares. This time around we don't learn as much of the working of the secret society of killers. This entry is also a bit long. Nonetheless, fans of action movies shouldn't miss the John Wick movies, they are truly outstanding."
"christonr-64261","6","1","4","24 February 2017"," The man. The myth. The melodrama.
","A return to the big screen for everyone's favorite hit-man/serial killer/most tragically-suffering assassin on an increasingly preposterous revenge mission; John Wick. And with nearly double the body count of its predecessor, this sequel only builds upon the foundations of death, gore and mythology set out in what is increasingly becoming Keanu's signature role thanks to an original which has attained a cult-classic status over the last couple of years.<br/><br/>The initial outing of John Wick found great success predominantly through the re-watch (home video in old money) market, with audiences garnering a similar relationship to the 'Death Wish'-style plot which so many other successful action franchises have adopted previously (think Schwarzenegger in 'Commando' or Statham's 'Crank'); but with Chapter 2 comes a whole new level of bloody insanity. With more kills than minutes to the movie, the pace is relentless and – as is alluded to by the film's core antagonist, Santino D'Antonio – words are definitely not wasted here (a fact which is reflected in the Ruby Rose's character who is deaf and therefore says nothing whatsoever). Whilst fun, the film only really hooks you toward the end (ironically when the kill count is beginning to tail off) and Wick appears to be making decisions which will have the inevitably dire ramifications. This element of consequence is really what underpinned the heart of the first movie, yet here it is swept aside in favor of more extreme violence and an opportunity for viewer eyes to gorge on the gratuity of the images on screen. In many ways, the second outing of Baba Yaga (John Wick/""The Man They Send to F'n Kill the Boogeyman"") is so bludgeoning, full-on and generally numbing; that it becomes almost video game-esque and therefore leaves a real sense of emptiness behind."
"PyroSikTh","7","1","4","22 February 2017"," Simultaneously Satisfying and Disappointing
","I find myself simultaneously satisfied and disappointed with Chapter 2. What really stuck out to me, beyond the exquisite fight scenes, of the first movie was it's emotional core. It's unfair to expect Chapter 2 to hold quite as much emotional level, and it didn't, but it didn't really substitute it with anything nearly as good. The film opens with Wick tying up the last loose end from the first movie and returning home, only to be served a mandatory IOU that leads him deeper into the mysterious underworld of assassins and hit men. We see how far this world extends, including a Continental in Rome, and the influence of assassins extending from rich higher-ups all the way down to buskers on the street. It did get to the point where I wondered if there was actually anyone in this fictional universe who wasn't an assassin. But at least they didn't just resort to a re-hash of the first movie (even though that's where I thought it was heading initially).<br/><br/>But while the plot was a little unsatisfactory, choosing instead to embrace it's cheesier mythology, the action sequences remain as tight and gritty as ever. One might argue that they're actually a step-up from the first film, that was mired in a limited budget. Chapter 2 having more money to play around with allowed the filmmakers more creativity in their stuntwork. There's a few stand-out moments, including a covert shoot-out across a bridge that passer's-by don't notice, knife fights in what amounts to a hall of mirrors, and even using cars as weapons (although I did wonder how anyone could stand up and fight after the amount of times Wick got run-over). We even get to see how John Wick managed to kill three men in a bar with a pencil.<br/><br/>That said, the sheer creativity used in the fight sequences are balanced out by a lot of more mundane stuntwork that drags on a little too long. Pretty much any time Wick and Cassian come head-to-head, their fights go on too long and the admittedly impressive choreography just becomes a blur. Likewise, Wick finds himself battling through endless swathes of goons on multiple occasions. Why all these goons are so stupid and/or inaccurate is beyond me, and they just keep coming and feeding the machine that is whatever weapon Wick is wielding at the time. Even fellow assassins on the street fall victim to just being headshot fodder. Longer and bigger is not always better.<br/><br/>Visually though, Chapter 2 is a massive step-up from it's predecessor. The increase in budget also allowed for some simply fantastic cinematography and creative uses of backdrop and setting. Almost every scene is complimented by interesting lighting that gives it an artistic-looking edge, and even composition and framing are used to good effect to create the most visually pleasing imagery. For example, there's a shot of Santino in an art gallery dead centre, with statues either side of him literally framing him in the shot. Mirrors and windows are also used to great effect, with a bright and vibrant array of colours splashed on to them, creating interesting visual effects not too dissimilar to those in Blade Runner and Skyfall. This is the cinematographer of Crimson Peak and Silent Hill at his best.<br/><br/>Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard return to score the movie, with the same kind of frantic electro-rock. Every scene is driven by a drum beat, either natural drums or electronic, with dance basslines and the odd distorted guitar providing the musical backbone. Marylin Manson's Killing Strangers, which acted as the first movie's main theme, is absent entirely (much to my disappointment), but Nostalghia provide a good substitute with their odd brand of atmospheric techno, and Le Castle Vania provides another typically clubhouse tune for Chapter 2's own version of the club shootout. Finally a note for the sound department; Chapter 2 is very, very loud, with sharp difference between action volume and dialogue volume. Not sure if it was just my cinema screening, but they had it turned up so loud that the action sequences (most noticeably with the opening car chase) just became a distorted mess. I was starting to think I should've brought earplugs.<br/><br/>Even after having written all of that out, I'm still torn on what I actually thought of it. It absolutely did not live up to the sheer excellence and creativity of the first film, but I never really expected it would any way. The fight scenes are exceptionally well choreographed, balancing style with practicality in a way rarely seen before, show signs of originality in how they're presented, and are filmed with such a fantastic eye for photography that every scene is wall-mountable. However a lot of the gunfights and knifefights go on too long, fall back on filler, and the deeper dive into the assassin mythology is more cheesy and OTT than engaging and interesting. I give John Wick: Chapter 2 a 7/10."

"DJAkin","5","1","5","16 June 2017"," The Wick on this movie candle is burning out...
","I have always liked Keanu Reeves and this movie was a movie in which I did not know what to expect. But the bottom line, there was excessive shooting. WAY too much. Here is what I took away from the movie:<br/><br/>1. For some reason, he kept his suit in a safety deposit box. 2. There is not a SINGLE police officer in all of New York City. 3. Keanu Reeves was ""The Warriors"". As he walked around the city, everybody (literally) tried to kill him for a reward. 4. In the catacombs at the beginning, he was running and shooting with perfect aim and killing literally everybody chasing him (in the dark). It was like watching a PS3 game. 5. ""Consider it a professional Courtesy"" was a cheesy line by when Keanu Reeves stabbed Common the rapper in the aorta so he wouldn't bleed to death.(he left the knife plugged in). 6. When Common and Keanu Reeves were walking down the mall and Common was on the top level, he and Keanu Reeves kept aiming their guns at the other person from the HIP and firing shots. They missed each other every single time and neither person tried to take cover or run. Non of the other customers even noticed the gunfire. 7. Keanu Reeves meeting with Lawrence Fishburn was obviously a nod to The Matrix 8. In a lot of scenes, the victim would scream and fall down BEFORE getting shot. the director should have done those kill scenes again.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a decent movie but seriously, can you have less killing in part three? John Wick was shooting and stabbing people for almost the entire movie with not much of a break. According to somebody who actually COUNTED the people Keanu Reeves killed, it was 128. Like I said, my candle for Keanu Reeves has a wick that is slowly burning to the end. I might have to ask Keanu Reeves to make another movie as John Wick but to put a little more effort into SLOW KILLS and not Modern Warfare style kills."

","John Wick was nice, it was full over board action with a certain style. I have met few people that didn't like it and those who didn't mentioned their indifference to the style and the lack of reality in the plot. So for the sequel, the creators could have gone with making it all more believable, the legend more powerful because of real situations where action validated it. But no, they went with more action, more blood, more stylistic bullcrap and a complete ignorance of the laws of men, physics or biology.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it was still entertaining, but it has lost all novelty, the movie's only value remaining the individual fight scenes. And in this one the close up camera that showed Wick killing people that somehow failed to do anything at a distance destroyed that value.<br/><br/>Bottom line: John Wick chapter 2 left me with the feeling that there are more assassins in New York than normal people and that somehow Rome is one of its little suburbs.

I lost count at around 50 or 60. And that was early in the movie. I would venture to say it's well over 100, probably closer to 200. In this world of assassins, it would appear that he's the only one that's at all competent (think stormtroopers).

"rockman182","7","1","6","18 February 2017"," John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017)
","The highly anticipated sequel to a very popular action film has arrived. John Wick as sort of a sleeper hit that came out of nowhere and really blew a lot of peoples minds. I wasn't the biggest fan of the film but it was a solid action film that was very sleek and really established Keanu Reeves as an action hero. If you have any doubts about his credibility as an action star, you should probably see John Wick: Chapter 2.<br/><br/>This time, no one kills John Wick's dog. Thank god. Wick is visited by a gangster who wants Wick to serve him because of a blood oath taken years ago. When Wick refuses, his house gets blown up. Wick then goes out for revenge and must face bounty hunters and a bunch of trained assassins. I'd say the sequel has more going on storywise as it involves much more involving a crime lord and the underside of what it entails. The sequel does a good job of maintaining fantastic, frenetic action with a balanced story and dialogue (or lack of it in Ruby Rose's characters instance).<br/><br/>The film doesn't always flow strongly as characters sort of appear without question but this is an action film and you shouldn't worry too much about what makes sense and what doesn't. As you'd expect, the film is very sleek and has eye catching action. The scenes are shot with flashing neon lights and plenty of sick shooting with blood. If this is your sort of thing you will absolutely love it. The car chases and hand to hand combat scenes were fantastic. The whole exchange between Common and Reeves in the subway was just hilarious.<br/><br/>My main complaint is that the film is longer this time and sometimes feels its length. Its not such a bad thing. This film is a really solid sequel, I may just prefer the original but its close. The action, blood, and style is really turned up in this edition and you just know we have an action star and franchise in our hands. I don't mind it, Keanu Reeves can rock the three piece suit and he's even better kicking major ass in it.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Trigger Warning(s): Movie Contains Person Slashing Their Wrists<br/><br/>Characters & Storyline<br/><br/>Just when John thinks he had peace after handling the whole Viggo situation and getting his car back, so enters Santino D'Antonio – The man who provided a way for John to retire in the first place. He calls in a favor which calls for the death of a member of the high council [1], his sister to be specific. John refuses, at first, which leads to Santino destroying John's house. But with this favor being one sealed in blood, the movie isn't simply about John getting revenge on Santino. That is a large part of it, but that can't be done until John kills who Santino asks. Which leads to John becoming more than just recognized internationally, but wanted for dead internationally.<br/><br/>Things To Note | Question(s) Left Unanswered<br/><br/>[1]. From the way it is explained, while there maybe kingdoms throughout a city, state, and what have you, the high council are the true big dogs. Whether they are the head of the Russian mob, Italian, and etc. However, until a kingdom is taken over it seems they don't necessarily answer to the high council. Well, at least those who control a city's Continental don't seem to have to answer to members of the High Council.<br/><br/>[2]. Expect a sequel.<br/><br/>Highlights<br/><br/>They Up The Ante With The Fight & Shooting Scenes<br/><br/>With me just watching the first movie today, then going into the 2nd, you'd think I would get that same jaded feeling you get when you do a Netflix marathon. Well, not in this case. John is as violent as ever and with the inclusion of more knife play, and John killing a few people with a pencil, you will be pleasantly appalled by the violence in this movie.<br/><br/>Stronger Characters, Stronger Story, And The Addition Of Comedy<br/><br/>Within the first movie, Keanu Reeves was arguably the only notable actor and John Wick the only notable character. In this movie, however, the King of the New York Continental, Winston, plays a larger role and becomes notable. Also, our villain, Santino, while not the greatest, by any extent, he suffices in becoming someone to hate. However, what really matters here is Ruby Rose as Ares, taking part in one of the few times you'll see a man and woman go toe to toe in an action movie, Common as Cassian, who has these long a drawn out fights with John, and then, to a certain point, there is Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King aka King of the Homeless. Each one leaves the kind of mark where you can tell those involved wanted to go bigger and grander for John Wick's second outing.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>John Is Given Too Much Slack and His Adversaries are Idiots<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, it seems John is constantly given time to reload and get into a safe position. Plus, despite him getting a slew of injuries thanks to being stabbed, bullet wounds, and getting into some real drawn out fights, after he gets patched up, like some video game character, he bounces back like almost nothing happened.<br/><br/>In General, There Is Too Much Fat<br/><br/>While I appreciate the more seasoned actors being brought in, a stronger focus on presenting a story, and how stylized the fight scenes are, at a certain point it just seems like this movie was never going to end. For with John Wick going international and being the ""Boogeyman,"" now we have to listen to people talk, see John prepare and go to this place for a bulletproof suit, go to this place for guns, and this other place to get information, and then he finally gets to the location where the action begins. Thus making this movie, similar to the first, feel like a video game. One which, sort of like Mafia III, there isn't much in regards to cutting the fat and taking you straight to the action. No, we have to listen to long ass scenes from people you know are going to die. So you wonder why John is torturing you and himself by letting them go on and on.<br/><br/>Overall: Mixed (Home Viewing)<br/><br/>While John Wick: Chapter 2 ups the ante when it comes to the action scenes and character development, unfortunately, what seemed like a franchise more about characters putting up or being shut up, loses its most appealing feature – being lean. For with Santino and his sister Gianna allowed to talk more in their scenes combined than anyone probably did in the first movie, alongside Fishburne thinking he is performing on a stage and not in an action movie, their characters act as the fat of the movie. The kind which may add flavor but lessens the look and appeal of the actual meat. Hence the Mixed label. For while the action stays top notch, unfortunately, John Wick: Chapter 2 employs the action genre's worse kind of villains and characters – the ones who don't know how or when to shut the hell up and get to the point."

Surreal it is; substantial it is not.<br/><br/>Director Chad Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad are committed to entertaining and not overtaxing the brain with anything resembling reality. What's real is that Wick is back from retirement to honor a marker, and that puts everyone on edge while some of them delight to think of the mayhem he will unleash.<br/><br/>Because Reeves cannot possibly save a film with even adequate acting, the filmmakers have rightly chosen a gaggle of good character actors such as Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, and Franco Nero to name only a few. Additionally, Kolstadt has some witty setups and lines, alas too often centering on Reeves, whose acting chops don't exist. In other words, he kills lines along with lives.<br/><br/>Now and then an actor and lines save the film, not often enough: ""Have you thought this through? I mean, chewed down to the bone? You got out once. You dip so much as a pinky back into this pond... you may well find something reaches out... and drags you back into its depths."" Winston (Ian McShane)<br/><br/>For pure action fans, John Wick: Chapter 2 is not a boring sitting, and as my fellow critic and I watched, we laughed heartily at the absurdity of violence and deadening of nuance. There is a good time for all whether laughing at the outrageous plot or the ineptitude of acting.<br/><br/>""I'd like to make a dinner reservation for 12."" John Wick"

Sorry, but Commando (yeah the one with Arnie) had better writers, directors and crew than this train wreck. Actually you can include Wick 3 to this review too.

The fact that is has fantastic actors actually makes it even more painful.

However, it is hard to get past the fact that John Wick is invincible. I do not remember that being addressed in the first movie at all. Yes, there are several franchises in which the main protagonist is nearly invincible but in all of those other franchises the main protagonist skillfully avoids near-death experiences. This movie, as well as probably the first (although, again, I don't recall) and third movies, relishes on the fact that he gets shot an inordinate amount of times (at close range) and stabbed and yet still survives with virtually no repercussions."

","To be honest I didn't expect this movie to be so outstanding in the first place given the history of movie sequels as they usually diminish in quality but this movie proved me wrong altogether and entertained me throughout. Even better are the performances which are much better in this movie than the previous movie. Hell, this movie didn't drag one bit as all scenes were spectacular although there were a lot of goofs and few minor flaws but they're forgivable as this movie actually captivates you from start to finish. What's even more surprising is that this movie didn't require any big set-pieces and still churned out to be an entertaining masterpiece altogether.<br/><br/>The movie wastes absolutely no time at all and starts with 2 terrific action sequences followed by the main character's decision to retire. After he denies to do a job, his house gets blown up by the main antagonist and that's when the story starts. Following the destruction, one superb sequence after another occurs which I honestly didn't expect. The story, screenplay and direction are superb throughout despite the forgivable flaws. However, I still don't understand how John Wick knew where the head of one of Santino's henchmen was at when Wick shot through the wall and the bullet landing at the head, but that too is forgivable and shouldn't be taken too seriously as I enjoyed that shot.<br/><br/>The Action of this movie is a game-changer and brutally fun to watch with lots of never before seen Japanese Jujitsu techniques and the gun combat is nothing short of incredible in this movie.<br/><br/>Direction is a surprise. Not only was it fabulous, everyone was directed well.<br/><br/>Cinematography is good Background music is okay<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is good and gives full effort to his role, Riccardo Scamarcio is good too and does well in his role, Ruby Rose with no dialogues and just sign language overshadows Riccardo and she is superb in her villain role, Ian McShane is great too, Common is a surprise here not only is his acting great he does all the difficult parts to perfection especially his action sequences, but the best performance comes from Laurence Fishburne who is nothing short of terrific here, the rest are good too and they don't disappoint either."

"mitchell5954","9","0","1","22 May 2019"," Somehow Surpasses The Original
","John Wick Chapter 2 is the sequel to the surprising hit action movie John Wick. Most sequels are inferior, but this was one of the few sequels that was not only good, but to actually surpass the original in some ways. The story was more interesting, the action was even better (and that's saying something), and the stakes are even higher.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves returns to play the title character and gives an equally great performance as the first. What elevates this film higher than the first is that it further elaborates on the world and culture John and the people around him live in and the code they operate by, and it's fascinating. The action is also faster and more thrilling, and there are more action scenes here.<br/><br/>The film also introduces some new characters. The best one being Lawrence Fishburne's character. While he's not in the movie for very long, his presence was a very welcome addition. I hope we see more of him in Chapter 3.<br/><br/>If there was a weak point in this film it would be the villain. He has a strong introduction, but afterwards failed to impress me. He has a history with John Wick that's never fully elaborated on (maybe in Chapter 3). I just found him very bland and boring. The villain in the first movie was not amazing either, but he was definitely more memorable.<br/><br/>His female underling named Ruby Rose was more interesting and imposing than he was. I'm not sure if that name is a nod to RWBY or just a strange coincidence (most likely the latter). She's because not only does she kick ass but has a unique gimmick in that she's mute so she speaks via sign language.<br/><br/>Overall, John Wick Chapter 2 is one of the best action films to come out since...the first John Wick. Both movies are the best action films to come out in a long time and should definitely be seen if you're a fan of the genre. If I had to choose which one is superior I would probably still have to go with the first film. While this movie does improve on elements from John Wick, the first film had a better villain and it was a self-contained piece with a definitive end, while this is clearly setup for the next one, even though I like the setup."

","John Wick, you sexy man, how you entertain me. Seriously, the John Wick films have such excellent action that it makes the choppy, plainly shot fight scenes in other films so much more dissatisfying. John Wick 2 takes the best parts of the first film, namely its simple plot and beautiful fight scenes, and takes it to the next level. This film is gorgeous. The choice in colors, the club music, the environments that battles are fought in, even the guns and suits are just impeccable. This film is aesthetically flawless and its gritty but fancy fight scenes are to die for. With its better take on action and visuals, I favor this one a bit over the first film. Perhaps it's only flaw is it does not give our main character many moments of characterization. This is mostly fine but I wish it had a few more tender moments for him like he got in the first film for Keanu Reeves to show his acting chops."

","Keanu Reeves delivers a supercharged performance as the embattled ex-assassin, John Wick, who gets dragged back in to the world that he desperately wants to escape from. But a marker is a marker and Wick gets forced to pay back a debt he can't refuse. Then everything hits the fan.<br/><br/>Even though Chapter 2 is pretty much the same as Chapter 1, this is an even better, amazing film. Wick kills more people than I've ever seen in one movie.<br/><br/>Keanu is excellent as Wick, who is always cut up, tired, disshelved, wearing the weight of the world on his shoulders. Tired of everything, except living and killing. Laurence Fishburne is terrific as the bird man who kind of helps Wick out. The Continental Hotel is again central as a sanctuary - no business on the property - or is it? The hotel manager is again excellently played by Ian Mcshane. He has a terrific voice and is a superb actor. I love the role of the Reception Manager, played by Lance Reddick who you will recognize from the Bosch TV series on Amazon.<br/><br/>Fast-paced is insufficient to describe the speed of the story, including a terrific chase scene to open the movie. You also get treated to a beautiful trip to Rome and the catacombs, with some wonderful cinematography. The bad guy is an Italian mobster younger guy, and you just can't wait for Wick to slap the entitlement out of his smug little face. Be patient - you may get that or not.<br/><br/>Since there is now a Chapter 3 coming out this month May 2019, you know that Wick survives the onslaught in 2. How can they top this? I don't think they can, but if they can even equal it, that will be quite a feat.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see Keanu slip into the dirty black suit jacket, with his dog, and his car, and give it his all to defeat the challengers. Will be fun.
For now, Chapter 2 is a big success. Not for the squeamish, but hey, if you like Wick films, you already know that.
Enjoy."
"dorohedoro99","2","0","4","22 April 2019"," What a mess.
","It is such a shame to have all these great actors and waste them in such a pointless, boring, full of cliches movie.<br/><br/>Peter Stormare and Ian McShane steal the spotlight and are a delight, the only thing that makes this watchable. My 3 stars only go for these two and Lawrence Fishburn.<br/><br/>Poor Keanu had the most cliche and boring lines to deliver along with gunning down everybody with a ridiculous suit that stopped point blank bullets just by holding it loose in the air. Nobody even grazed his hands or head, while he killed everybody, it felt like watching Hot Shots! Part Deux...I almost expected to see a bodycount score.
The close combat fights where the only convincing ones and interesting.<br/><br/>And the plot, seriously, the main character is completely different from the one in the first movie:
He is not feared by others, like all his reputation disappeared.
He still mourns his wife, while in the first movie he supposedly moved on.
He violates the rules of the safehouse which is one of the things he respects.
After all this trouble he went through in the first movie to retire, someone blows up his house and that is enough to convince him to take on a job again!?
This movie destroys its main character by making him weak, with no values, not moving on in his life, not evolving.<br/><br/>The plot is non existing. Nothing makes sense or helps the story. The fisrt scene with Wick retrieving his car has nothing to do with the rest of the story.
Him getting so easily to the target, especially when another assassin from the same club is protecting her is stupid.
The only cool part was her choice to kill herself but they could have avoided that by trying to eliminate the culprit, joining forces or something along these lines. Especially after they tell us they are in friendly terms!
The fact that everybody accepts what a spoiled power hungry man wants, with no objections is pathetic.
The very interesting part of Lawrence Fishburn and his ''hobo gang'' gives nothing to the plot either. Yes they tend to his wounds and give him a handgun with 7 rounds, but their interests are supposed to be common and yet they don't help him any further, which shows they are a bunch of apathetic people who don't care what will happen to their city after the main villain take the rains."
"bowmanblue","6","0","1","16 April 2019"," Keanu shoots more people
","Would it be harsh if I said that many people were actually quite surprised at how good the first 'John Wick' film was? Keanu Reeves' star seems to have waned over recent years and he's hardly the A-lister he once was. However, with such success of the first outing, I guess a sequel was guaranteed. I eagerly sat down to watch 'part 2,' but somehow I didn't feel that lightning has struck twice.<br/><br/>The first time round the - seemingly indestructible - titular assassin went on a murderous rampage of revenge because some hoods killed his dog (no, seriously - that's the kind of 'character motivation' we deal with in these films!). This time round, some baddies only go and total his car. Guess what... John Wick doesn't just call his insurance company and hire a rental car until the garage can knock the dents out. He gets pretty much gather every gun not already used by Schwarzenegger and starts shooting people.<br/><br/>And he does shoot a lot of people. He travels from one location getting surrounded by baddies who can't really shoot straight (I believe this is now technically called 'Stormtrooper aim') and, if any do manage to scratch him, bullets only seem to graze him slightly. Then he shoots more people in a different setting.<br/><br/>And that's about it really. As much as I do enjoy action scenes (some of the shoot-outs in 'The Matrix' were literally revolutionary and nothing had ever been seen like it before in cinema) here it was literally Keanu shooting people. If a film's main selling point is its action, I'd like to see something a bit more original. I know most fans of the genre will probably have seen every hero blast every type of gun in every type of location known to man, but, even now, there are still ways of coming up with something new (think of how the action is portrayed in recent films like 'Kingsman, Shoot 'em Up' and 'Upgrade'). Here, it's just shooting people.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, 'John Wick 2' isn't a bad film. I didn't hate it. I just was hoping for something a little more than one generic shoot out after the next. I felt his car 'died' for nothing here."

The reason that I've found both enjoyable is because they are very similar. In fact, I would say that everything the first movie got right, this movie also got right, just to a slightly lesser extent because the ""wow"" factor that came with the first one has worn off a bit. The narrative in the first was more compelling than the sequel but this story was still interesting. I really like how the odds against John keep multiplying but he could not care less (as is perfectly portrayed by the monotonous Keanu Reeves). The only real negative about the film is that, I think, the overall aesthetic could become overused if the team behind the scenes don't make any changes.

He isn't a superhero (but he seems), is a regural person & makes you feel that you can be him. lots of action without any cuts, many weapons, hand-to-hand fights, Jujitsu; It's not the typical movie where the bullets are always; people hurts him, It's much more credible than the rest of films of this genre. a Cassian (Common) spin-off could be made, since he follows the same method as John, behaves in the same way; the choreographies are beautiful, the production design is visually exquisite and photography is beautiful.

","As far as sequels go, I was looking forward to the second installment of the John Wick franchise, mostly because I was interested to see how it would take the genre-defying changes it made in the first film and expound upon them. While you don't need to know much of the plot of the first movie, other than knowing John Wick (Keanu Reeves) was the best professional killer ever, and now he's trying to live a peaceful life in retirement, one could almost wonder if the first film was even necessary. Plot-wise, John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) provides a much more interesting storyline instead of just an accidental mistake made by a stupid kid of a mob boss.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, while the plot is much improved, the action seems a little stale. Sure, Wick's ""dance of death"" remains an impressive sight to behold, but now the camera is starting to trend back into its shaky ways. Some the action sequences were so confusing (either in the dark catacombs of Rome or a Doctor Strange-esque mirrored art exhibit) that it was hard to tell what was happening other than the steady piling up of dead bodies. In fact, while these sequences were the strength of the first film, the second film drags them out just a little too long. Just long enough to be exhausting.<br/><br/>And while I appreciated the scenes involving Wick's ""infrastructure"" that supported his killing profession, especially when he's gearing up for his mission, now I have more questions than answers. Judging by the number of hitmen sent after him, I have to wonder if he exists in a universe populated entirely with hitmen. At least, I found the mini The Matrix (1999) reunion entertaining, especially considering how it gave Reeves his status as a choreographed action hero.<br/><br/>A better plot but with almost too much action, I give John Wick: Chapter 2 4.0 stars out of 5."

"htestroete","9","0","1","23 January 2019"," A more than worthy sequel
","John Wick Chapter is not only a great sequel, but also a great movie on its on. You could watch this movie without seeing the first (like I did) and still completely understand what is going on, and yet the movie still is able to connect with the first movie and be a true sequel. Keanu Reeves again is able to pull of the almost emotionless John Wick to a tee, having almost no expression and saying very few things, and yet is still able to be an extremely interesting and compelling character. This movies secondary antagonist Cassian, played by rapper Common, is able to match John Wick not only is combat, but also is coolness. Cassian is a fresh addition to a franchise that lacked any real hand to hand challenges for John Wick, and even though Wick is able to best him in the end, he still is a worthy foe and great addition to this movie. Lawrence Fishburne plays an interesting role in this movie, though it may be limited, and is able to make a name for himself in this movie so that he is able to return for the third chapter. One last thing is that the final fight in this movi is great, taking place in a room full of mirrors, which allow for some really fun and great action. John Wick Chapter Two is a great sequel to the great first movie and easily sets up a third chapter, the movie is able to mix solid writing with good directing to form the second part to the franchise which is a breath of fresh air in a genre that for the most part has gone stale."

"yhlee-55405","10","0","1","13 January 2019"," I really love it, BUT:
","I love this movie, don't get me wrong, but there could be some improvements. This is an awesome action movie, with the perfect actor as main charactor. Keanu Reeves has the look, the skills and the profession for this role.
The thing is, this man is invincible throughout the movie, he is unstoppable and impossibly durable. He can still have a rough fight no matter how many times he is been beaten up or shot. This part is a little bit illogical for me considering he is still a vulnerable human-being.
As a professional, skillful and well-known hitman in his field, his skills in martial arts are not as impressive as expected for his role. He always has a hard time during hand-to-hand combat. He is not that scary without his gun. Think about Jason Statham, he always performs amazing martial art skills in his movie, which makes it seem possible that he is always quite capable of fighting whole lots of armed men. John Wick, on the other hand, seems a bit struggled and not so logical, as if the enemies are purposely weaken or retarded for the movie.
But if I watch this in another perspective, this movie makes more sense as unlike the main character in other action movie, he does get hurt a lot and he does fight like what will actually happen in real life. The fact that he struggles during hand-to-hand combat with a lot of enemies seems more logical whereas in other movies, the character can kill the whole army with no or only minor injuries which seems ridiculous.
Anyway, this is my very unprofessional opinion. One way or another, I still love this movie."
"tabuno","8","0","1","11 January 2019"," Alien or Aliens?
","13 February 2017. This movie has some comparisons to those people who loved the sequel to Ridley Scott's original 1979 sci fi classic Alien better than James Cameron's Aliens (1986). However in Ridley Scott's movie Alien, it won out by just a bit. Nevertheless, John Wick: Chapter 2 suggesting a Chapter 3, offers up bigger stakes, bigger death totals, and a nice wrap around to references to shall we say Chapter 1. The audience gets to see deeper into the ""professional"" assassins supposed subculture of rules, loyalty, and integrity like a voyeuristic treat and often with dry humorous effect. John Wick in this case, seems to reprise his horror movie character role of Constantine (2005) and its own salacious but compelling underbelly of demons and Satan all the way to the darker and nasty world of martial arts where Keanu Reeves directed and played a sinister darknet master in Man of Tai Chi (2013).<br/><br/>Unlike the almost stylized and slick death scenes from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 where Uma Thurman slices, dices and chops assassins up, director Chad Stahelski who appears to come from a stunts man background seems to up the ante in the physical fighting arena, with plenty of apparent judo moves, karate chops, and head shots, but not always with the Tarantino finesse. Like Aliens (1986), the bigger bang approach is not always the most emotionally riveting for those who prefer Alien's (1979) where the original focused on the personal emotive psychology and authentic experience of a space monster with more of a covert Hitchcockian style. With Chapter 2, there is more emphasis on the overt action and bloodshed of Aliens.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 while good, there will be a continuing likely unresolved debate whether it is better or worse than its original."

But it still nothing short of pure fun.
Another issue I've with this movie is that the denouement is a bit messy, and longer than it should be.<br/><br/>All in all, John Wick: Chapter 2 is one hell of a ride that with its exceptional pulp flick make almost every other pulp action flick seems nothing more than a cash grab!<br/><br/>(8.5/10)"

","Starting soon after the conclusion of the first film, Keanu Reeves returns to another stint of what he does best, highly choreographed fighting and emoting terribly.<br/><br/>Word of Wick's re-emergence has spread around the organised crime community and prove particularly interesting to Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) a passed over Gomorrah boss, to whom Wick owes a blood debt. Dante calls this in and refuses to take Wick's ""please ... no ... don't do this"" for an answer - blowing up his house. Out for revenge, but bound by the code of Assassins, Wick agrees to the job. <br/><br/>Your opinion on John Wick 2 is likely to be pretty similar to your opinion of the first one, as it is, generally, more of the same. It's fair to say it's not quite as good, just by virtue of being so similar to the first it doesn't have the same effect. Also expectation is much higher now, whereas the first film came out of nowhere. My opinion though is that they are very welcome additions to the action genre, disregarding CGI heavy combat, or blurry heavily cut nonsense, for proper choreographed action, performed by stuntman and to an impressive amount by Keanu himself. The body count is high and the action is brutal, although not without is comedic moments too. Direction (and art direction) is excellent and the creation of the hyper stylised world that Wick inhabits is really strong. <br/><br/>Acting in the film is . . . interesting. As if to counter act Keanu downplaying everyone else chews the scenery with abandon, none more than Lawrence Fishburne who clearly enjoys bellowing his lines at the top of his voice. Ian McShane isn't far behind and neither is Riccardo Scamarcio, twirling his metaphorical moustache as the films primary antagonist. <br/><br/>Chastising the films realism is, for me, missing the point. Finding it dull or repetitive I can appreciate, even if I don't necessarily agree - but it's clearly not supposed to be set in the real world. There isn't really an assassin's hotel in the Flat Iron Building, people sewing Kevlar into Italian suits or a worldwide cabal of organised crime. You want to drive yourself really crazy, trying working out the exchange rate for what the gold coins are worth."

At least when you play such game yourself, even with all cheats enabled, you are engaged in the story and settings since you need to know how to get from A to B and you can move by yourself freely through the setting. As a movie it gets quite boring, since you are forced into a passive position of sitting in front of the screen and watch someone hit every mark.<br/><br/>My suggestion: Buy ""Max Payne"", enable all cheats and play the game.

","'John Wick: Chapter 2' is a sequel I didn't think they were going to make, but it is actually better than the first, if only because they now know what to do more and less of. It starts directly after the first film, but Wick (Reeves) now has a new dog. The initial car chase scene in New York is a pretty great way to start the film. Wick's still the same - brooding, wearing a suit, saying maybe 100 words in the whole 2 hours and killing people left, right and centre.<br/><br/>The plot, as much as there is one, is that Santino D'Antonio (Scamarcio) - some Italian mafia guy - wants Wick to kill his sister, so he's off to Rome to mess stuff up. This starts a long-running battle with fellow hitman Cassian (Common), which has some funny moments and some good fights.<br/><br/>I liked that there's a sort of 'Kingsman'-like global hitmen underground, but it does seem a little far-fetched most of the time, especially since there's apparently hundreds of them! The film definitely needed to use Fishburne, McShane and Leguizamo more. But Reeves carries it, running around and killing at least 50 bad guys. The scene at the end in the museum is really well done too. Nothing new or exceptional, but well-made."

","Since watching the first John Wick, I have learned that: (a) the genre can best be described as ""gun fu"", (b) a college classmate of mine wrote these films. Interesting notes. As for chapter 2, the script remains smartly sparse and perfectly paced. It lacks the heart/backstory of the origin tale, but still feels like pure (and disciplined) adrenaline 90% of the time. The world is claustrophobic and well rendered, unlike similar films in the comic book category. I'll take that: simple, contained, and brutal. No superfluous characters or plot lines...Just vendettas and violence."
"Eric266","7","0","1","30 October 2017"," Lots of Action, Not Much Substance
","I really enjoyed the first John Wick. It was stylish, lots of action, and had an anti-hero you could root for. The character was depressed, heart sick over the loss of his wife, and just not interested in being an assassin any longer. Then thugs mess with him and he goes on a rampage.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 takes up right from the end of the first movie. He wants his car back. Then he tries to retire again, but fate won't let him. So, again he goes on a killing rampage. Its the same as the first movie, just less plot development and a lot more bad guys to kill repetitively. The main villain was lame and the mute bodyguard was underdeveloped. The inclusion of Laurence Fishbourne was a bit of a stunt, I guess to give a wink to the Matrix movies. His character is pointless and doesn't have much to do.<br/><br/>Still, Chapter 2, has its moments. The fight scenes are well staged. The car chases were kind of lame, but some of the stunts within those chases were exhilarating. Common as a fellow assassin is a nice counterpoint to Wick. Their scenes crackled with charisma. Hopefully he returns for Chapter 3. Likewise, Iam McShane as the Continental Manager is fun to watch as he directs traffic at his establishment. The fights and stunts, as I said, are fantastic and well choreographed.<br/><br/>The first movie was long on action, so this one should have dialed it back a bit and set up character development for the last movie in the trilogy. Unfortunately, it was just a lot of people getting shot in the head.<br/><br/>I still enjoyed the movie and its running time, while a bit long at 125 minutes, didn't feel too long. Hopefully, in Chapter 3 the stunts will be used to enhance the plot rather than cover up for the lack of one."

","The first film became a surprise box office hit, so it was unsurprising that there would be a sequel, I was definitely wanting to see it after hearing it made more money than the predecessor. Basically four days after the events of the first film, former assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) tracks down his stolen 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1, at a chop shop owned by Abram Tarasov (Peter Stormare), brother of Viggo and uncle of Iosef who he has killed. John kills Tarasov's men in a violent fight, the Mustang is heavily damaged, he spares Tarasov saying that he wants peace, and he returns home to his new dog, who he has not given a name yet. John's Mustang is taken to the chop shop of Aurelio (John Leguizamo) for repairs, after this he is visited by Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), it is revealed that John asked Santino for help for the ""impossible task"" that allowed him to retire and marry his wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan). Santino presents John a ""blood oath"" medallion, a ""Marker"", an unbreakable promise and form of contract, he demands John's services, but John refuses and claims he is retired. Santino retaliates and destroys John's house with a grenade launcher, John survives the explosion and heads to the Continental hotel in New York City, which caters exclusively to the criminal underworld and permits no ""business"" on its premises. The Continental's owner Winston (Ian McShane) reminds John that if he rejects the Marker, he will be violating one of the two rules of the underworld. John accepts his commitment and meets with Santino, he wants John to assassinate his sister Gianna (Claudia Gerini), so he can claim her seat on the ""High Table"", a council of high-level crime lords, John is under the surveillance of mute bodyguard Ares (Ruby Rose), personal bodyguard of Santino. John infiltrates Gianna's coronation party in Rome, he confronts her, faced with certain death she slits her own wrists, before bleeding to death in the hot tub he kills her, fulfilling his commitment to Santino. While retreating, Santino's men ambush John, intending to ""tie up loose ends"" and kill him, John kills most of the men, but is still pursued by Gianna's chief bodyguard Cassian (rapper Common), they have a brutal fight through the streets. The fight is halted when they reach the lobby of the Rome Continental, like in New York, there is no ""business"" on the premises, the two share a tense drink, Cassius vows revenge for Gianna's death. John returns to New York, under the guise of wanting to avenge his sister, Santino puts a $7 million contract on John for his death, numerous assassins attempt to kill John. Cassius catches up to him in the subway, John wins the ensuing fight, stabbing Cassius in the chest, he leaves him alive out of professional respect, warning him if he removes the knife he will die. John is injured and desperate, he seeks help from the underground crime lord The Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), his subordinates treat his injuries and guide him to Santino's location. John kills Santino's bodyguards and mortally wounds Ares in a knife fight, but Santino is able to escape to the Continental, Santino is smug and says he intends to remain at the hotel indefinitely, despite warnings from Winston, John shoots and kills Santino in the Continental lounge. The next day, Winston has the contract on John doubled and offered globally, he has lost all access and privileges at the Continental, and resources to the underworld, but Winston does give John a one hour head start, and provides him a Marker for future use, before leaving John vows he will kill ""whoever comes"", and he flees with his dog. Also starring Lance Reddick as Charon, Thomas Sadoski as Jimmy, Commando's David Patrick Kelly as Charlie, Franco Nero as Julius and Peter Serafinowicz as Sommelier. Reeves remains fantastic as the former hit-man that will not be messed with, it goes in a different direction with the revenge element, with the antihero repaying a debt, then being double-crossed, the fast-paced editing, escalating body count and over-the-top death and fight sequences remain skillful and well choreographed, the violence still adds to the entertainment, it just about feels fresh as well, in all it is an enjoyable action thriller sequel. Very good!"

Maybe his neurons are lined up 100%? Results don't lie and people die. Whether it is hand to hand, knifes, pencils, guns and super-guns your terminated! Now, a $14 million dollar hit has been placed on his head. That means nearly everyone will take a chance to get lucky and collect this payday. But John says quite clearly ""I'll kill them all"".

You should respect the the hard training that done by Keanu to reach that physical readiness to make that action looks real and classic... Also many thanks to Chad the director for taking the shots in the old wide scenes way not the fast moving camera, cropping and crappy new way... Best Action dose ever along with its prequel..."
"Sci-FiHorrorFan","10","0","1","12 October 2017"," This movie is totally BadAss!!!!!
","This movie is Brilliant! And completely Action packed!. After watching this movie I am totally convinced John wick is one of the Toughest movie characters of all Time!. If you thought the winter soldier was a BadAss killing machine then watch John Wick 2! and you have an even Bigger BadAss killing machine!.I like the winter Soldier movie character but I can safely say I Like the John wick character more!.the amount of people he kills in this movie is unbelievable!!!. This man kicks ass and takes names! And goes on a completely Crazy killing spree! And I loved every minute of this movie!.He killed so many people in so many different ways.This movie was action packed from beginning to End! And I Never got bored once!.<br/><br/>John wick wants to get out of the hit-man business but a Guy comes to his house telling him that he can't walk away from the business because he committed to it a long time ago but John wick Just tells him to leave his house and refuses to take the meddle the guy tries gives him and he tells him he's out of the business so after the guy leaves he blows up johns house with Grenades and burns it down. That was a big mistake on his part because John wick does not like to be messed with so he goes after him and all of his men with a vengeance and he quite literally blows them all away! Later in the movie when he finds out the guy broke his deal. It was one thing to burn down the guys house but when you make a deal with him and then break it your asking for trouble!.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves was Great in his role as John Wick and I don't care what anyone says, the man is a Great Actor! And he proved it with this movie!.I also thought his acting was good in movies like the Matrix and the first John wick movie. Speaking of the Matrix I couldn't help but notice some Matrix reference's in this movie, noticeably the women in the red dress scene being one of them.another one being Laurence Fishburne showing up and saying things like we've met before a long time ago and he helped me in the past.That was definitely a matrix reference in my opinion.it definitely felt like he was giving a throwback to the movie when he gave his big speech to Keanu Reeves. Another matrix reference I liked was when everyone was walking and then suddenly everyone stops walking and looks at him almost as if they froze.those scenes made me smile since I like the Matrix movie.<br/><br/>Getting back to John Wick 2 I really can't think of anything negative to say and that's mainly because the movie is so much fun to watch. John wick is a Great character and I feel he's equally as Great as The Jack Bauer character from 24. If people want to watch a movie with a Great main character Then I highly recommend John wick and John Wick 2!. I love both movies but I would probably say I like John Wick 2 a little bit more. The story may not be Great but the Action is Great! and the movie flies by fast!. I was quite surprised by how many Fantastic fight moves I saw in this movie! Especially by Keanu Reeves! He fights like a Psycho in this movie! And I mean that as a compliment! He was Awesome!. Even the bad guys were tough and they had some good fight moves too.I thought the fight choreography was done very well!. The writing was good and the directing was good and so was the cinematography, and Overall i Had A Fun time Watching the movie. This movie is a must watch for every Action Fan!.<br/><br/>I learnt one thing after watching this movie, DON'T MESS WITH JOHN WICK!!!."

","The film picks up right where the last one ended, as Wick attempts to find and take back his beloved car. Overall it's essentially more of the same, great action, plot, music, comedy, actors and acting. However I feel the villain isn't so generic and forgettable this time and this film has higher stakes, along with a real feeling of suspense that hits you in the final act. I disliked the cliffhanger ending, however it left me really excited to see what's next in-store for the third (hopefully final) film. I have to give this a higher rating for improving on the first film and consider both films a must watch for all action loves."

","It was not an attracting title for a sequel. The first film was good, completely an unexpected, but I was expecting this one, even though not as much as I was excited to see 'Jack Reacher 2'. That film was good, but did not meet with its first film's merit. And this sequel, really amazing. One of best follow-up flick and better than the original. That feat considered very rare in cinema and here is the one.<br/><br/>Entirely different than the first. I meant the storyline. A new action, a new adventure, and even on a bigger scale. Though the initial parts were average. I totally disliked that killing assignment Mr. Wick took in his hand, but what followed after made the film great, definitely not to be missed for that alone. Especially if you are an ardent action film fan. For me, that reminded me 'Kill Bill', but they are not the same kind, except the fighting concept with hundreds.<br/><br/>Continued from a couple of days later where the previous narration had ended. Now the retired assassin, John Wick forced to take a final job, but soon he finds he was backstabbed. Every eye on the town on him and every gun pointing at him, there's no way he could get out of it easily. So, he has to fight them all, just in order to survive. Then what comes later are even more aggressive screenplay that's ends with left open the door for the third film.<br/><br/>Now this became a stylish franchise. That's what happens when a stuntman takes up the directional job for an action flick. He did not write it, but he knew exactly how to create them, technically perfectly. Besides, he got wonderful, dedicated actors to achieve that. Not just Reeves, but all were awesome. Believe the third film would be a kick-ass, particularly the pace that could match with likes 'Crank'. Just watch it already and be prepared for the next, the mega finale.<br/><br/>8/10"

","John Wick 2 captures much of the magic of the original film and loses just a bit of the nuance. Stahelski and Leitch again create some of the most interesting and eye catching fight scenes with an overall aesthetic that creates a perfect mood. Reeves gives a solid performance, but the mystery that made John Wick so appealing begins to fade and you are left with a very good action film as opposed to the greatness that was the first. The mythos of the elegant and orderly league of underground assassins drives much of the interest in John Wick 2."
"Anthony89","7","0","1","24 August 2017"," John Wick: Chapter 2 - A solid sequel
","John Wick: chapter 2 is a solid sequel following up from the original John Wick in 2014. The film takes place right after what happened in the first film, this time around John is the one being hunted, with a lot of violence and action scenes along the way.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough for this type of film and does actually dive a little more into the character of John Wick & how he came to be the way he is. But ultimately it is a straight up action film........my thoughts below.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves again does a great job of playing the John Wick character, it is a perfect role for him , where there is not all that much dialogue & just him kicking serious ass. I also enjoyed the brief appearance of Lawerence Fishburne.<br/><br/>The action & fighting scenes are again done very well much like in the original film & with Keanu Reeves doing most of the stunts & fighting scenes himself made it look even better & more realistic. Also thoroughly enjoyed the two fight scenes that he had with Common in the movie.<br/><br/>The only minor gripe I had with the movie, is that the stakes didn't feel very high as you basically knew John Wick was going to beat up everybody & come out on top, so I guess you never really felt that he was in danger even when all these different hit men were after him.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first John Wick movie then you will certainly enjoy this one as well, both highly entertaining action films, a 7/10 for me."

"chrichtonsworld","8","0","1","17 August 2017"," Non stop Hong Kong type of action not from Hong Kong!
","There was a time you got overwhelmed with all kinds of B action flicks from Hong Kong and Hollywood and you were desperately trying to catch up to them. Simple, brainless films that were fun and nothing else. Every weekend you got your action fix so that you could last a whole week of boredom or stress in school or at work. Now those B action flicks are hardly being made. And the ones that have been produced usually are immensely bad. I am excluding TV Shows since not all of us have time to watch and follow all of those.)<br/><br/>But then Keanu Reeves and Chad Stahelski gave us John Wick to satisfy the action aficionado's needs. How glorious it was. It is therefore not surprising to me that they decided to make a sequel. Everything about John Wick clicked. The characters, the no nonsense plot and the action. It was one of those movies you actually never wanted to end. All you wanted was more of it. And by God that is what you get. More of the marvellous action and ludicrous world where most assassins have to follow certain rules and codes and more blood. Like the original most events are relative and mixed with a big sense of humour while never sacrificing the tension and thrills. It always feels like there is a lot at stake. That is not as easy at they have made it seem so kudos to Chad for accomplishing this. And what a thrill ride! John Wick: Chapter 2 doesn't a waste a single second and immediately starts with the action which rarely lets up so that you and John (Keanu Reeves) get a chance to breathe. The gun fu is very strong in this film. It's pure joy to see John kill his enemies with his guns like they are his fists. Especially since this time around the number of his opponents has increased and they are far more qualified and skilled than in the first John Wick. A little tough for John but a delight for the viewer.<br/><br/>One thing you have to keep in mind that the John Wick films are made for mostly action film aficionados. It's not that big on story or mythology although it has created an interesting world with equally interesting characters to make everything more compelling. That and style. Yes, it is style over substance. Sometimes that is a good thing. A must watch!<br/><br/>www.chrichtonsworld.com"

"MrDHWong","8","0","1","2 August 2017"," More grounded than its predecessor
","John Wick: Chapter 2 is the sequel to the 2014 action thriller John Wick. Once again starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, this follow-up feels more grounded than its predecessor and thankfully tells a much different story.<br/><br/>Four days after the events of the original, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) successfully retrieves his stolen car from the Russian gangsters and returns home. After arriving home, John is greeted by Santino D'Antonio, an Italian crime lord who forcefully assigns John with fulfilling one last ""impossible task"" as part of his blood contract to the crime underworld. Upon setting out to complete the task, John soon learns that a $7 million bounty has been placed on his life and he must now try to survive every hit-man and hitwoman in his vicinity coming after him.<br/><br/>While the most obvious route would be to completely rehash the original, John Wick: Chapter 2 follows an entirely different plot, choosing to expand upon the title character's backstory and his motivations. In the first film, several outcomes felt obvious and predictable but in this sequel it often felt like things could have gone either way. The action scenes are more frequent and even feel better choreographed this time around. There were also more fist fights in this film, alluding a great deal more to the kung fu films that it was influenced by. The creative use of colour and lighting returns and the filmmakers do a good job using them to enhance the mood and tone of a scene. Keanu Reeves continues his nuanced performance first seen in the original and it definitely works to his advantage during some of the film's more dramatic and self-reflective moments.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10"
"nogodnomasters","8","0","1","29 July 2017"," You don't want me owing you
","The film is a true sequel, picking up where the last one leaves off. In fact the first twelve minutes is part of the first film. Once loose ends are tied up, John (Keanu Reeves) gets a marker called in and reluctantly must do a hit job in Rome. It takes about an hour for the film to develop to the point John must kill every New Yorker, one person at a time in spite of all of his wounds.<br/><br/>John is supposed to be some sort of ghost, yet like ""Cheers,"" everyone knows his name. His boogeyman character which was so prominent in the first film, seems to have waned in spite of his latest deeds. The thing that made the first film so special, is subdued in this one. The film has some good characters: Ruby Rose as Ares, Common as Cassian, and Laurence Fishburne as the Bowery King. I found them and not Reeves making the film. The whole neutral territory thing was used to the point it became inane. I am also tired of watching the guy lament over his wife. Move on. Put you pictures on ""The Cloud"" so when your house burns down you have them forever.<br/><br/>We see John Wick, 'Death's Very Emissary,"" kill all kinds of people in all kinds of fight scenes while in an injured condition where a normal person could not walk. There is talk of hell and purgatory in the film, creating a fight scene that reminded me of Dante. John Wick is lead by ""Phlegyas"" down an elevator and eventually to a floor with mirrors for self reflection and burning CG fires as art, the fifth level of hell where the wrathful are punished for eternity with fighting. There is a character named Charon (Lance Reddick) in the film. Wick ultimately creates his fifth level of hell for chapter 3. If they had only made the rest of the film that good.<br/><br/>Guide: F-word. No sex. near nudity."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","0","4","22 July 2017"," A disappointing sequel for the most part
","""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don't care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.<br/><br/>The antagonists are not written in a way where you would really care for them, let alone fear them, for over 90 minutes. It's a shame as Wick running into mafia and a great elite of crime bosses could have made for a truly entertaining watch. But the film loses itself in chase sequences, gunfights and other scenes that may be spectacular to watch, but almost have no impact at all in terms of story-telling. The ending indicated that they may very well make a third John Wick movie and I think it would be unrealistic to hope it could get as good as the first film, but at least I wish it could get better than this first sequel. I am baffled by how critics and audiences alike apparently enjoyed this film almost more than the first because I did not manage to see the appeal at all. At least this raises the chances for a third film, which will hopefully be better again. As for this one: Gotta give it a thumbs-down. Not recommended."

","How and even more important who is supposed to stop John Wick? The character and the subsequent movie franchise. Maybe Denzel Washingtons Equalizer would be the correct answer. Maybe that is the mash up that would be amazing. On the other hand I've never heard any person throwing those two characters in one hat, so don't hold your breath.<br/><br/>Back to Mr. Wick (and if you have time search the fake trailer for the Dog Wick, hilarious, though full of spoilers I reckon concerning the first Wick movie) and his new problems. You know when you just want to lay back, lift your feet up and do nothing? Wick thought he'd try that out for a change. After a fast paced action riddled opening sequence that is of course. But also of course: it ain't going to happen. And you know that wouldn't be the movie you'd sign up for. Mr. Wick doing nothing other than talk with his foes. The action is choreographed really well, some stunts may seem similar, but overall the gun play is amazing.<br/><br/>People of the UK be aware of minor cuts that have been made to the version you are getting (30 seconds I think, but you can find out about that). But it's still full of violence and theatrical composition. It's beautiful and horrific in its own way. It's just wonderful and with Common it has one main antagonist who is up for the challenge ..."

The first one was full of action too, obviously, but this one took it to a whole different level. Keanu Reeves's acting was fitting the role as usual, he spoke almost nothing but no limitation in killing (ALL GUNS mostly) enemies. There will be a point where you will crave for an intermission just so you can take a breath after seeing the continuous bloodbath, almost never ending to a point.<br/><br/>Just to sum it up, perfect for viewers who want a no-nonsense action movie, you can relish this without using your brain parts.

"milk-carton-reviews","7","0","1","29 June 2017"," amazing action movie that lives up to the glory of the first film
","Let me start this review off with what everybody already knows: the amazing choreography, action scenes and gun-fu. The action in both John Wick movies is definitely one of it's biggest virtues, often being dubbed as the perfect video game movie adapted from a video game that is yet to exist. And honestly, this movie is just a perfect mesh of beautiful action, neon colors and Keanu Reeves kicking some major ass.<br/><br/>I will say, however, that the first movie was a tad bit better. It had more room to breathe in between the action and was more character driven. The character of John Wick was always something fascinating to me, because he is a morally gray man with a shady past, which has definitely been done before, but John Wick is just so... Interesting. He is so close to falling into the so called ""Gary Stu"" category, since he is basically a flawless assassin that can do anything, yet he is never portrayed as perfect and as a man he is deeply flawed, which never gets boring. Basically, my small regret with this movie is that they decided not to focus on his character so much. What I really enjoyed, however, was the development of the secret organization that we found out about in the first movie. It was really cool to finally learn all about how things worked in this John Wick world. I'd love to see more of that in the next sequel. Another pleasant surprise for me was Ruby Rose. I didn't know she would be in this movie going into the cinema, and although her role in the movie is relatively small, she manages to bring this presence to her character, and as always, it's just really nice seeing her. <br/><br/>I believe that if you were a fan of the first movie or a fan of Keanu Reeves (he is such a delight, honestly), you are going to love this movie. Go check it out."
"JasonR77","8","0","1","28 June 2017"," On with the body count
","Though the mystique of the character of John Wick is slid aside as this film goes, it is still about the slick violence and choreographed action sequences. After a very cringe-worthy scene early on, the film picks up and goes full force into the same kind of slick action that made the first one such fun to watch. Though it loses a little something by the number of people willing to take John Wick on despite his reputation, it is still a good, solid story. The network of killers is more revealed than in the first one, and we get a sense of the gravity of Wick's choices and the level of effect they have on him. There is clearly going to be a third film in this series, and given how this one ends, it will be a very interesting conclusion that will doubtlessly feature even more of the action we have come to love. But if someone would tell the main villain to avoid the monologue piece during a cat-and-mouse game, I'd appreciate it. 8/10"

","Surely one of the biggest surprises to me. In terms of how good it ended up being. Honestly Reeves has had a shaky portfolio when it comes to his movies, but I'm glad to say this is an achievement. An underrated film as it didn't do well in the box office as it should. But money aside, this movie packs a punch. Another film with one man on a quest to achieve a goal or kill some bad guys. That's not all this film has to offer. It has great action scenes, emotional scenes, and heart. A film worth owning on DVD or Blu-Ray. Keanu Reeves is outstanding, as is everyone else. As for the negatives, the length could be cut down, and really that's just a nit-pick rather then a flaw. So overall, this was an enjoyable film for action film fans, or Keanu Reeves fans."

May have set a new record for number of kills by one person (one at at time); explosives etc. don't count. Ballpark I counted around 121. Hey, not easy given the speed and lack of clarity. Beats a previous record by a movie from half a dozen years ago (don't recall the title, but if anyone knows let me know) of some guy going through the floors/apartments of an inner city tenement apartment complex killing drug baddies. The center column of space had no structure so you looked across & down to other walkways. Negatives: 1. A bit formulaic starting with high speed street racing; followed by JW feeling for lost loved one; followed by desire to retire; followed by baddies in criminal consortium saying ""Not today!"". 2. Not too realistic (actually, not at all realistic even in fantasy) to dispatch so many and end up with a few scratches on the face and a little cut to the abdomen. 3.

Credit should also be given to the makers of this movie for adding intricate, interesting and detailed storytelling elements. The movie never feels too long or short and achieves just the right balance of super-fun, beautifully choreographed and gory action with expert storytelling.Doubling up on the action and thrills, John Wick Chapter 2 more than delivers on the expectations set by its predecessor.This is essential viewing, not only for Keanu Reeves' fans but for fans of the action genre as a whole.

Sure ""John Wick"" plays more like cartoon if you start to think about reality of the movie - this is a fairy tale, but its a damn good one. <br/><br/>Action scenes were superb, as good as in a first one.

Also this movie was superbly paced - at running time hours i wasn't bored for a second and highly enjoyed this action flick.<br/><br/>Overall, while ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" doesn't achieve the greatness of ""The Raid 2: Berandal"" to deliver action film that leaves you exhilarated by the end, this is non less a very solid action film for those who liked the first part and love good old ""shoot em up"" movies in general. This one is very solid."

","I know I'm kinda late to the game, so I won't possibly write anything that hasn't been said before - except for this maybe:<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first installment immensely, and I also did enjoy the second one a lot. However, I can't help but notice some little things. First of all, the directing seemed somewhat stiff at moments, which led to some rather noticeable editing issues, especially in the first 20 minutes of the film. Second - and I hate to say that, knowing how much Keanu Reeves trained his ass off for the movie - John Wick's moves aren't that precise and popping anymore. Of course Keanu Reeves is over 50 now, so that's pretty much natural, but still it kinda showed. That being said, I absolutely take my hat off to the balls to show most of the action in nice and calm wide shots with Keanu Reeves clearly being the one performing. And to be honest, this authenticity more than makes up for some slurred executions.<br/><br/>I absolutely love this underworld of killers with all its coins, markers and what not, and I feel like this should be like some kind of Harry Potter world of its own.<br/><br/>The cinematography was beautiful, the choreographies absolutely fine, the acting quite good and the score totally fitting. I would have loved if Tyler Bates had ventured more into that Classical/Modern mash-up style, though, since I found the one sequence in Rome absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>All in all a very satisfying sequel, which is more than you can say about most sequels. It opens up even more of this bizarre and fantastic world and leaves us with one promising cliffhanger in the end. I can't wait to see ""John Wick 3: The Final Chapter""! 7/10."

","2017's ""John Wick: 2"", directed by Chad Stahelski. Starring Keanu Reeves, Riccardo Scamarcio, McShane, Ruby Rose, Lawrence Fishburne, Peter Stomare, John Leguizamo, and Lance Reddick. <br/><br/>In the first John Wick movie, we saw a retired hit-man (Reeves), brought out of retirement after his dog was killed by Russian gangsters (Spoiler alert: Reeves came out ahead while proving he was a murderous man of principle). In the sequel, we see Reeves back for more, initially miffed at how his car had been stolen by more Russian gangsters (lead by an over the top Peter Stomare). After sorting out an Uber issue, the film explores more of the ironic principles of the hit-man world. Reeves is given an offer by Scamarcio that he cannot refuse, to kill the titan's sister so that Scamarcio can be the leader of a syndicate. Dispatched to Rome, we see a standard getting-ready-for-action montage as Reeves reluctantly goes to work.<br/><br/>Unfortunately (for Reeves), the Italy job is just the tip of the iceberg, as the plot thickens with treachery, bullets, and dynamic subtitles. One of the stranger and most unique action movies around, the sequel expands upon the original's simplicity (and protagonist's blankness), as we see more luxury hotel safe zones for assassins (must be quite the chain), more casual hit men in a universe filled with nothing but them, a homeless group's unlimited kingdom of riches, loyal concierge that double as dog sitters, and a hotel manager who seems to have omnipotent powers. By the end, as Reeves' affectless hit-man is ducking in a ""Enter the Dragon"" crossed with ""Neon Demon""'s set design, we want to ultimately know where this kill fest is going. As an underling states in the beginning of the film- ""Huh. Why don't we just give him back his car?"""

I do appreciate this movie for a slightly different reason than the first one. Where the first did rely a bit more on the story and development of the character, which is a good thing, this one doesn't dabble too much into that and just goes straight at you with action. Another good thing. The sequences are strung together so well, it is just nice to sit there and take each moment in. I could do without taking a vulnerable Reeves and turning him into a bulletproof superhero, such as this movie did. Yes, before you say anything, I know fully well this movie is paying homage to the great action movies out of Hong Kong, but even John Woo may have questioned Keanus invincibility at points of this flick. But checking reality at the door to watch this is not a problem and a good time to be had. Director Chad Stahelski showed that his massive amount of time shooting stunts for more films than I can name (and he was tied with the much missed Brandon Lee as stunt double in ""The Crow"") pays off behind the camera lens.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","1","12 June 2017"," A lot more of the same in ways that are great and ways that are disappointing
","""John Wick"" deservedly earned a cult following in 2014 because of the way director Chad Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad blended revenge-driven action with martial arts and the aesthetics of both first-person shooter video games and graphic novels. They created this seedy, neon hit-man underworld and tapped perfectly into the strengths of star Keanu Reeves. In ""John Wick: Chapter 2,"" Stahelski and Kolstad bask a little in their first film's unexpected limelight and deliver a film that's in ways satisfying and a little disappointing.<br/><br/>The story of the first ""John Wick"" was an emotional cannon shot that never lost momentum. ""Chapter 2"" begins shortly after that film's events with the introduction of the first film baddie's brother (Peter Stormare), a wink acknowledging the action movie cliché of the previous villain's sibling commanding the sequel. This taxi garage sequence acts as more as a cold open/prologue that provides fan service rather than contributing anything to the movie. We don't start to feel that first film's incredible momentum until nearly an hour into the runtime.<br/><br/>""Chapter 2"" introduces us to the man who helped John Wick earn his initial ""retirement,"" Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio), who visits John's home — just as he finally actually appears to be moving on — to cash in a marker, a very serious blood debt that John must repay if asked. When John refuses D'Antonio's bold job request, D'Antonio blows his house to smithereens. John caves and fulfills the mission (in Rome), but then things take a bad turn for him and he goes on the run.<br/><br/>Kolstad carefully generates scenarios that will lead to more moody, dark, superfluous action sequences similar to the first film in which John will take down dozens of armed men at a time. In that modus, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is truly gratifying, but there are times when it feels paint-by-numbers or as though some arbitrary obstacles were needlessly thrown in John's way for the sake of our trigger-happy entertainment. Every action movie can hit a point of desensitization, but this movie hits it early on and then Stahelski largely course-corrects as the stakes get more interesting. The modern art mirror exhibit finale is a bit stylistically on the nose, but everything that happens between when John goes on the run and until then works pretty well.<br/><br/>Side by side with ""John Wick,"" however, ""Chapter 2"" doesn't measure up, largely because Stahelski and Kolstad seem more interested in celebrating their initial success through a series of nods rather than focusing on generating new ideas that could expand upon the framework of the first film. Most unfortunately, the film revisits the same exact themes (e.g. can John find peace? Is he as bad as the bad guys he kills? etc.) John takes a step back in terms of character growth and has to go through the whole revenge thing again, only with less powerful motivation.<br/><br/>Not to disparage ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" too much, however, because it doesn't run into the usual pitfalls of bad action sequels. Stahelski and Kolstad seem to understand the fine line between acknowledging your initial film's strengths and assets and utilizing them in the right ways versus leaning on them completely and assuming you can set up the same circumstances and deliver a similar result. The novelty of ""John Wick"" was never going to be replicated, and though they certainly could've spent more time building on it and taking risks, fulfilling the essential requirements counts for a lot.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"AnishMisra","9","0","2","10 June 2017"," John Wick 2 review
","John Wick 2 is a film directed by Chad Stahelski. I loved the first part of this film and had huge expectations when this part was announced. I saw the trailer and loved it too. So the first chance I got to see this film, I saw it. And I was in awe. This film is for those who love action to the core. And I am a hardcore action film fan.<br/><br/>Plot: John Wick is called back into action for a favor he has to do for a friend.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This film immediately takes place after the first film. Within 10 minutes we see the first part being wrapped up (which was kind of unnecessary). There is also a dialogue that references the first film - ""He killed 3 guys with a F***** pencil."". But still, we get to see a very large impressive action sequence. Actually, this film even has more action as compared to the first. The first one was a little dark. But this one was more on the commercial side. Which I quite liked. We also have a type of a customer service for contract killing for the underworld!!!! I mean I couldn't actually believe that thing. The underworld is shown a bot more in this film. We even see John EWick having suits made for him when he goes for a shootout (That was something unique). When seen from actually a story point-of-view, it's nothing new. That's I guess the only flaw from this entire film I could take. The film also ends in such a way so that we are actually in guessing as to what the third part is going to look like.<br/><br/>Acting: Keanu Reeves one again is a bad-ass as John Wick. I am with him in every scene he is in. Common plays a very convincing and menacing hit-man. Laurence Fishburne was good in the role for what limited time he was given. Ruby Rose as the silent assassin was great. Ian McShane was also good (again) as the hotel Manager. Riccardo Scamarcio was also kind of the bad-ass here.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: Every action sequence in this film happens to be my favorite scene. Another one would be where he goes to Abram Tarasov's office to make peace with him. I was actually getting chills in that scene.<br/><br/>Verdict: All in all, I had quite the fun watching John Wick 2. It was more enjoyable and entertaining than the first one. A treat for any action film lover. The only fault with this is sometimes it has nothing new in terms of story-telling. But I still will be waiting for a Chapter 3 and I hope Chad does bring us that Chapter 3 very soon.<br/><br/>So I give it a 9/10."
"tomgillespie2002","7","0","3","9 June 2017"," Balletic and bombastic
","John Wick was the sleeper hit of 2014, elegantly combining kinetic fist and gun fights, fluid camera-work, and an effective, stoic performance from its lead, Keanu Reeves. There was a beauty in its simplicity: a former assassin grieving over the recent death of his wife gets done over by a small gang of scumbag Russian mobsters, who proceed to beat him to a pulp and kill his dog, and who are soon running for their lives as the slick-suited killing machine routinely takes them out one by one. Animal lovers can breathe easy as no dogs die in this sequel, although the anti-hero has found himself a new four-legged sidekick. The film's surprising success, as well as the shady underground universe it only hinted at, had action fans salivating at the thought of a follow-up.<br/><br/>Fans will be pleased that stuntman-turned-director Chad Stahelski is back at the helm, as is writer Derek Kolstad, who, although obeying the expected rule of sequels by making everything bigger and louder, both ensure that everything that set our pulses racing the first time around is present and suitably breathtaking. Opening with what can only be described as a ballet of fisticuffs and impressive stunt driving, we are instantly on familiar grounds. Having done everything but retrieve his 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 as he took his vengeance on anybody stupid enough to stand in his way, Wick lays siege to a dingy chop shop ran by Russian Abram Tarasov (Peter Storemare), the brother of Viggo from the first film. With pal Aurelio (John Leguizamo) restoring the classic vehicle, Wick can finally move on with his life. Only clearly somebody hasn't informed him that he's in a sequel. Soon enough, old colleague Santino (Riccardo Scamarcio) is at his door insisting on a favour.<br/><br/>Wick politely refuses, but Santino lays down a marker which symbolises an unbreakable oath. Although they kill mercilessly for a living, these contract killers have a code and a set of rules they must obey under penalty of death. Having left the game, Wick isn't having any of it, but the quick destruction of his home soon has him jetting off to Rome to carry out the job. His target: Santino's sister Gianna (Claudia Gerini), who was chosen by their father to take his place at the high seat of international crime bosses. The organisation of the underground assassins only hinted at previously really opens up in Rome. Met by the boss Julius (Franco Nero), Wick is soon getting fitted for expensive suits and choosing his arsenal with the assistance of Sommerlier (Peter Serafinowicz) for his so- called 'impossible task'. A smooth operation wouldn't make for a particularly exciting time, so Wick quickly finds himself under threat from bodyguard and colleague Cassian (Common), and Santino himself, who wants to leave no loose ends.<br/><br/>John Wick: Chapter 2 could have easily gotten ahead of itself. By opening up what was such a personal and emotional revenge mission last time into a continent-hopping world of hotel safe-houses and spies masquerading as the homeless, this could have become very silly very quickly. Instead, the film hypnotises you by making the action even more bombastic, and infinitely more violent (if you liked The Joker's death-by-pencil in The Dark Knight, just wait for this one). Even when events take strain credibility to the max by introducing the 'Bowery King' (Laurence Fishburne, in a nice reunion with Reeves), a man in charge of a huge network of tramp hit men, and revealing that a startling number of the general public are in fact one text away from slitting your throat, you'll be too busy admiring the balletic carnage to roll your eyes. The bad guy may be even less interesting than the already-bland big boss from the previous movie and it's lost that element of surprise, but I was ready for part 3 the second the credits started to roll."

However, neither Kolstad or Stahelski bog the pace down with unnecessary exposition. <br/><br/>Stahelski's second outing is gorier with a significantly higher body count and even though the fight scenes may not be a slick as it predecessor, it does what it says on the tin. Stahelski's offering benefits from a filmed on location feel which grounds the outlandish action, this is rounded off by a fitting soundtrack and score as Keanu Reeves' Wick battles his way through New York and Rome.<br/><br/>Well executed, pure action entertainment all the way, recommend."
"timothyalanwilliams","7","0","2","7 June 2017"," ""Chapter Two"" Lacks the Passion of Its Predecesor
","""John Wick: Chapter Two"" is everything you probably loved about the first installment. Lots of fast-paced, bloody, and violent action mixed with Keanu Reeves stoic, yet intense, acting. I really wanted to like this one as much as the first one, but it came up just a bit short. Not in heart-pounding action sequences, but in story. You have to admit, much like the ""Taken"" franchise, it's tough to duplicate a strong story-line which made the first one more than just an action movie. In the first ""John Wick"", the reason and rationale for his break from retirement was clear and felt in every scene. But Chapter Two doesn't carry that same passion. The biggest let down, for me, was the ending (or lack there of). To find out Chapter Two is just the set up for Chapter Three left me feeling duped. Will I see the third installment? Most definitely! I just wish the story could have stood on its own (like the first one). All in all, I still recommend it for the die- hard Keanu action flick fans. And it's still one of the better action sequels I've seen."

","John Wick: Chapter 2<br/><br/>Usually, the second chapter of a retired hit-man's biography never gets completed.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the ex-assassin in this action movie still has his brains inside his head.<br/><br/>Out of obligation to guild rules, former button-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) must liquidate the sister of a notorious kingpin when he calls in an old mark to keep her from ascending to the high council of crime. Things go awry for John when his employer places a bounty on his head for killing his sister.<br/><br/>To get revenge, John will need help from another crime czar (Laurence Fishburne).<br/><br/>Picking up after the first movie, this slick sequel doesn't waste any time getting down to highly choreographed fistfights and shoot-outs that defy physics.

Keanu Reeves is extraordinary, where he evolves in a cascade of most explosive actions that one in a universe of the most varied face a group of implacable killers. Do not forget that we are in the movies that the situations of a film will always remain situations of a movie, but here the action is 100% successful, served by a magnificent cast, that laughs more than John Wick 2 That it is just a formidable action movie that takes place not only at one hundred kilometers, but which passes so quickly so one is caught by the action of this movie, the most beautiful movie of action 2017, Now ... in my opinion, of course, and I highly recommend it."

","It's true to say I'm not a big fan of Keanu Reaves. Funnily enough my wife enjoys watching him but I don't think that has anything to do with his acting ability. Despite my reservations , Keanu seems to have hit the bullseye with John Wick. Hit-man John Wick is once again called out of retirement, this time by a former colleague who wants him to repay a debt by killing an Italian crime lord . But when the attempted assassination goes awry, Wick finds himself hunted by an international cabal of killers. I really enjoyed this . It's one of those films that doesn't tax your brain too much and is full on high tempo action.

"whitakeroh","8","0","4","3 March 2017"," Wick 2 Goes Hard but Lacks the Emotional Connection of the First
","John Wick 2 goes hard in the paint. It broadens the universe of Wick and pierces the veil of a shadowy assassin world. The plot is fairly cliché but let's face it, you came here to see Neo, I mean John Wick, kick some butt and take names. And this he does, over and over and over. To the point where it actually undermines this movie because he kills so many people and yet all these dozens of men and assassins fail to shoot him even when they have the drop on him. The massive of amount of killing without police being anywhere present is irksome. What's the point of an assassassin and everyone is an assassin and there is one cop in the known world named Jimmy?<br/><br/>Classic action movie in that regard? Yes, but what made Wick 1 so cool was Wicks' personal hurt- this was the film taking a moment to build Wick's deep down good nature and build his character. This makes us connect with him. Wick 1 was brilliant in the idea of the dead wife giving Wick back his humanity in her death through the gift of an innocent puppy that's then viciously murdered. Not here. In this movie Wick just says no honoring a past commitment. He breaks the rules himself. So you lose that emotional connection. Heck, the movie opens up with him creating massive havoc for his car. Not indicative of any retirement which the movie tries to shove down your throat as to why Wick is a victim to this. He's a brilliant and deadly assassin and he can't see a clear double cross coming? Also the double cross is simply a silly plot device. It's not explained well and the double cross only serves to suggest these people are dumb. In fact, there's no reason for the double cross but it's done anyway for a silly reason that makes no sense in light of the known likely consequences. See it and you'll see. <br/><br/>Also, in this movie the universe becomes way more comic bookish- seems like they are interested in licensing Wick to lesser mediums. Wick would be so much cooler if they scaled down the world, made the assassins rare and assassinations rarer. This would increase Wicks' appeal. Seems now everyone in the Wick universe is an assassin. From random subway violin players to garbage men and beggars- all assassins and every single person's phone rings in New York at the same time. So if everyone is an assassin then why do we have assassains? Since there is no fear of death apparently, how do these people live for even 10 minutes? Who exactly do they assassinate when everyone is an assassin? The end of the movie had me shaking my head. I see they are trying to build a Wick universe for further media product development and thus lucrative IP deals.<br/><br/>So, Wick 2's action is TOP PAR. Keanu is on his game, no doubt. But it's not as intimate as the first and tend to become silly and redundant. The story is simply starting to become a Marvel property which is a shame. The end is silly. A lot of silly stuff here and way too much of it. It definitely lacks the intimate, hard hitting emotional punch that Wick 1 had.<br/><br/>There are so many incompetent assassins everywhere that the whole things becomes unbelievable. A contract goes out on Wick and then all of a sudden everybody is an assassin. This just limits the emotional visceral feeling the first one gave you in favor of all action.<br/><br/>However, I can't say enough about the movie that the action is top notch and I highly recommend it."

Keanus dedication to the art and how amazingly uncut it is filmed makes it even more amazing. We are tainted today with movies that have like 20 cuts in a 20 second fight scene. What stood out most with John Wick 2 was that there was barely any cuts, Keanus months of training before as prep for the movie really showed itself. And if we put the action to the side and see the story it first seems like its going to be something simple but turns out to something beautifully complex building up a possibility for a JW3. The only reason I gave it a 9 out of 10 is that JW1 was a ten. JW1 only had the upper hand of originality/being first, that's it."

","Sequels are always met with cautious optimism and nervous anticipation--and rightly so because they have such a terrible track record on average. John Wick was no different. I thoroughly enjoyed the first one so of course I wanted to see the second yet was prepared for a massive letdown as well.<br/><br/>John Wick Chapter 2 did not disappoint. Keanu Reeves still can't act (I mean he really can't act) but even he couldn't kill John Wick. We got the same dynamic gun play, skillful knife fights and plenty of UFC style groundwork. But, what I particularly enjoyed about John Wick was the method in which they brought him back into the game.<br/><br/>The writers were very creative and clever with the story, which was a huge relief. Sometimes, in effort to get to the action, we get a rushed and poorly thought out plot just to get to what the production team thinks we want to see anyway--the action. Yes, it's true that we want to see the shooting, fighting and other mayhem, but some of us would rather there be a viable (or at least plausible) reason for the action. JW Chapter 2 gave us a more than acceptable reason for bringing John Wick back into the world of assassinations and vengeance.<br/><br/>Along with the exciting gun play we were treated to more exposure to the well developed and sophisticated machinations of the criminal underworld. They had a network of people, organizations and resources that rivaled the government. This movie was extremely cool and has deftly paved a way for a part three."

","A few days ago I was talking with one of my friends at the YMCA. I told him over the weekend that I saw ""John Wick: Chapter 2"", again. He said,"" You really must like it."" I said, ""Yes."" I told him that I thought ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" was the best action movie of the last 10 years. Keanu Reeves is awesome. The movie has this ""strange love story"" that makes it very clear what John fights for. <br/><br/>I liked ""John Wick"" a lot. His tale of bloody vengeance about his dead dog and missing vintage sports car reveals in the end as the metaphor for his late wife Helen, played by Bridget Moynahan—the love of his life. John's lost love story. <br/><br/>In ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" what John fights for is completely transparent. Keanu Reeves's John is the retired master assassin, forced back into ""the game"". John's friend Winston, played by Ian McShane, tells Santino, played by Riccardo Scamarcio that he called back John on the marker which allowed him to have a life with Helen, and he betrayed John as well. Winston warns Santino that John will 'kill him', because ""He came back for love."" I got the movie then. ""John Wick 2"" is the great B-action movie that becomes the powerful story about John's lost love story. Derek Kolstad's screenplay is minimalist clarity. <br/><br/>Reeves is awesome in the brutal and spectacular martial arts and gun displays. As John he is eloquently understated, wounded, and full of focused rage. The fighting sequence where John takes out assassins in the subway is electrifying and immaculate. Reeves creates John as the tragic hero, who fights for honor and the love of his departed soul mate. <br/><br/>As one of John's intended victims lays in a bathing pool, she asks him, ""John, do you fear damnation?"" John sits next to her and says, ""Yes."" Without Helen, he feels sentenced to hell. In the opening scene John steals his mustang back from his enemy. John is relentless. In the scene in the garage, he dispatches literally dozens of trained killers with Muay Thai, Jujitsu, Aikido, and boxing. The fight choreography is clean and devastating. Reeves has mastered his arts. He retrieves his car and spares his enemy. We discover that the car was not important to him—rather what was in it. <br/><br/>John wants normalcy and calm. He even has a new dog—without a name. However, Satino calls upon the blood marker that had set John free. The marker bounds John to do whatever Santino requests. Santino wants John to murder his sister Gianna, played by beautiful and dark Claudi Gerini. Gianna has ascended to the seat on in the international crime circle. The seat that Santino felt is rightfully his. John refuses: ""I'm not that guy anymore."" Santino and his men wreak havoc upon John and his home. <br/><br/>John and his dog find sanctuary in the Continental Hotel run by his friend Winston. The Continental is sanctuary for all assassins. However, by its code all markers must be honored. Therefore, John must kill Gianna. If he refuses, he dies. If he kills her, he dies. That is John's mortal curse. <br/><br/>Director Chad Stahelski has an authentic feel for the hero and the villain. He possesses instinct for action. Bruce Lee might have said his action is ""like water""—it flows with impact. The martial arts with and without guns is brutally exquisite. Cinematographer Dan Laustsen captures the continuous flow whether in the dark tunnels of Italy or the all white lit subway. Stahelski has great homage to ""Enter the Dragon"" in the climatic fight in mirrored rooms. <br/><br/>Stahelski's John is focused and empathetic, because of his cause. There is strange satisfaction watching John take out trained assassins, who think they are tough, when John is just being that. John gets beat up badly, as well, but he never stops. His flashbacks to John's Helen sustain an ironic poignancy. Common's Cassian, who is Gianna's protector, is John's arch rival, who has code and honor. On the other hand, Scamarcio's Santino occurs as a prissy coward hiding behind his army of warriors. Reeves is made to play John. His controlled impassiveness expresses his deep rage and loss. <br/><br/>We are all for John. There must be justice in the world—or at least in the world of movies. ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is bloody and singular, and John fights for his lost love story. Somehow that makes a difference. See ""John Wick: Chapter 2"". It's a great movie."

","The second instalment of the much-loved John Wick action-thriller; the man himself (played by Keanu Reeves) crawls back into the criminal underworld to pay back a blood oath, leading to a price on his life - and this time, even the rules can't help him.<br/><br/>He Said...<br/><br/>What made John Wick amazing was not only the incredibly well-choreographed action sequences and dozens of enemies being taken down with relative ease, but its' world-building provided a look into a never-before-seen assassin underworld, conveyed in such an ambiguous manner that I found myself asking so many questions. When I found out that John Wick: Chapter Two was going to delve deeper into this society, I was excited to see where the plot would take us this time. The fact that Laurence Fishburne and Keanu Reeves were being reunited in this film made this all the more promising - their first time working together since The Matrix Trilogy. What I received from this movie was very much exactly what I expected - while the action sequences did not quite live up to the original, nor the desire for setting up a satisfactory plot line, the environment as a whole was perfect, and the world of John Wick now has a much more fleshed-out identity. My main criticism here is the storyline, as the new characters are mostly unimaginative; though those reprising their roles fit in much more appropriately. The lack of care towards an overcomplicated storyline from the first film (which only added to the amazing action) did not transfer to the second, which is troubling when the plot itself did leave more to be desired. Sadly Laurence Fishburne did not get enough screen time to really justify his involvement, or the hype around his character; nonetheless, the film as a whole is incredibly enjoyable and is a fantastically-themed look into the assassin's society.<br/><br/>She Said..<br/><br/>Eat. Sleep. Kick ass. Repeat. - John Wicks' philosophy seemingly out of the window as he returns for a more plot-detailed ass-whopping. Alongside his new canine companion, Wick is back with a vengeance when an old acquaintance catches up with him to repay a debt. Cue action-packed shoot-outs, an underground party in Italy and more mentions of his 'impossible task'. I can't tell you how excited I was to see John Wick 2 - the first movie beyond exceeded my expectations and I was intrigued as to what the sequel would bring - which, it turns out, was an overly cliché plot, borderline-boring fight scenes that we've all seen a million times over, and a tonne of product placement. Without Keanu Reeves, I feel the whole flick would have fallen apart; Ruby Rose, Laurence Fishburne and the various other 'supporting' cast brought some disappointing performances into the mix. The thing I loved most about the original was the way it pulled you in despite its' deliberate lack of attention to detail - not a single moment of eye-rolling plot detail or boredom, just 2 hours of car chases and epic stand-offs in abundance. Even though Chapter 2 focused more on the interpersonal relationships and underground lifestyle, I somehow found myself less invested. With a year ram-packed with sequels, this needed to be something special to keep up; all it left me with was a need for Guardians 2 to come round the corner sooner."

","John Wick 2 in my opinion elevated pass John Wick, the world building in this film was so great and just so cool and exciting. I found it extremely interesting to delve back in this world of assassins and to see all of these inner working of this world that was sprinkled around the first film. It really is just a big, loud, fun action spectacle. In an age like this it's really somehow hard to find movie like this but if you think about it it's not that hard, take away the meaningless attempts of creating some mind blowing story and just make it a good time, after all nobody goes into an action movie wanting a two hour in depth exploration of the human mind does it, Kingsman did it and now John Wick has done it for the second time. A simple story, triggered by clear emotionally triggered motives and a good 1 to 2 hours of headshots, hand to hand combat and one-liners. What more could you need!"

"wburchnall","7","0","3","24 February 2017"," Alright -- if -- you are really into action; otherwise kind of boring
","Overall, a viewer can tell that this film was made by fans of older action films that enjoy longer, wider shots with steady, continuous scenes without the modern day 'action shaky camera' that has become all too prevalent. <br/><br/>Part of the issue with most movies these days, is action stars cannot perform action and are chosen for looking 'the look'. Broad shoulders? Good jawline? Look like you've taken more steroids than an entire US farm uses? Congrats! You are cast in Generic Action Film.<br/><br/>To make up for actors being unable to do action, in most films they shake the camera fast, do a lot of panning and technical elements. This movie, however, uses little to no panning, still scenes, long cuts from the same angle and it is extremely easy to both understand the action and pleasant to witness.<br/><br/>Part of the problem comes from a very generic story line and action sequences that become too long with a virtually invincible hero. <br/><br/>Within the story line, you have the premise of, more or less:<br/><br/>*** SPOILER ***<br/><br/>'Bad guys wants a favor. Protagonist does favor. Bad Buy tries to off Protagonist. Protagonist then takes it upon himself to get revenge on bad guy who double crossed him.'<br/><br/>The problem becomes you know what is going to happen, it's clearly laid out from the beginning and goes from step 1 to step 2 to step 3 to the eventual expected ending. No surprises at all occur. You're, more or less, watching a very long action scene, very stylized dialogue then a very long action scene and more stylized dialogue and then a very long action scene. Queue credits.<br/><br/>The action scenes were so long though, it got a bit boring/expected to watch and I was wanting to story to move on or something different to happen in the action scene. I felt this way especially in the catacombs. The subway scenes were interesting though and the beginning sequence was interesting. The mirror room scene went back to boring clichÃ©. <br/><br/>It becomes a bit 'silly' at times though when there are literately 125+ people shooting at our hero who obtains 'Body armor' that's light weight and bulletproof. Not once, does our hero get hurt and always conveniently has the exact number of bullets he needs. The body armor giving him 'infinite life' or 'god mode cheat code' built into his stylish Italian made suit was very convenient. <br/><br/>I have seen video game characters die from less hit. So basically any shot to the body 'Hurts like hell' and effectively does 'zero' damage. So our hero, is literately set bulletproof and just walking through armies of men, mowing them down, taking no damage as if on a Sunday stroll. It reminded me of watching someone play Call of Duty on the easiest mode standing in the open, getting shot by hundred of enemies and just shooting at them one by one til they were all dead and walking to the next 'objective'.<br/><br/>I get he's supposed to be a legendary 'assassin', though, why aren't any other people in this movie....rich enough to buy body armor? Wouldn't him taking out a team of 20 very well trained guards with a combination of martial arts and guns be better than killing 125 guards with guns back to back? I think we get the visual message that he's a bad ass after the first 20 or so. <br/><br/>*** SPOILER ENDS***"
"dangkoen","7","0","3","24 February 2017"," Very enjoyable, but in slight danger of becoming stale
","John Wick: Chapter 2 continues on the strengths of it's predecessor: interesting cast of characters, visuals, intricate action/fight choreography & blasting soundtrack.<br/><br/>This time around although most of the cast give good performances, Keanu Reeves was a bit wooden this time around. No idea if it's the direction, Keanu's approach to the role or the script's dialog, just something that struck me slightly & maybe a detail that needs to be looked into.<br/><br/>Staleness is also on the edge of flowing into this new world of assassins as seeing John Wick go through hordes of disposable bad guys starts to feel tired already. Surprising as the action started out quite inventive, but seemed to run out of steam by the final act. I hope the team behind the action & fight sequences up their game for John Wick 3.<br/><br/>Still a fun ride nonetheless, despite the little issues mentioned."

","I honestly think I am the only person who thinks this one is not as good as the first one. But I am not saying that it is a bad movie. And I will tell you why that is. Let's get to it.<br/><br/>Synopsis: After returning to the criminal underworld to repay a debt, John Wick discovers that a large bounty has been put on his life. Starring: Keanu Reeves Director: Chad Stahelski<br/><br/>The thing is the reason the first one was so good is because the directors didn't use the modern tropes that action movies have become synonymous with. This time around that changed. There were close up shots and shaky cams during a few of the hand to hand combat scenes. And that hurt the movie. Quite a bit in my opinion.<br/><br/>The story is a good one, just like the first movie. John came out of retirement for vengeance only for someone to say that John still owes him a favor. When John refuses he is attacked and has no choice but to take up arms again.<br/><br/>Keanu proves once again that he can still do action with the younger crowd. The two fight scenes he had with Common were good (see my previous statement as to why I don't think they were great). And the way he moved with the weapons, any military man/woman will tell you that it was flawless. It really seemed he put his heart into this movie.<br/><br/>The last complaint I have about this movie, and it's just a bit of nitpicking on my part, is that the movie could have ended about ten minutes earlier than it did. They could have saved the end of the movie for the beginning of the third movie. It seemed like they did that with the first one and this one. And honestly, I think that would have helped both movies in the long run.<br/><br/>The last thing of note, and I'm not complaining about this part, it's just really funny. The henchmen in this movie must get their training at the Stormtrooper Military Basic or James Bond Villain Henchmen Academy because they couldn't shoot. The only time John Wick missed was when he was facing Common, any other time he was right on. He was the only one in the entire movie who was.<br/><br/>Still though, the movie is a good movie. The two things I mentioned that I didn't like are miniscule to the bigger picture of the movie. The acting, the writing, the dialog, the action, the lighting, even the music all played well together.<br/><br/>So, I ask: Why haven't you seen this yet? Shame on you.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10"
"BadAids","6","0","4","20 February 2017"," **Insta-Review** John Wick Chapter 2
","Pretty much what you would expect from a sequel to one of the most enjoyable action films of the last decade. Bigger action sequences with a wider scope. Unfortunately the film spends a little too much time world building and is overly long. Not a disappointing sequel, just a predictable one."

","If you are an action junkie, this is the film for you. If you are a Ruby Rose fan, this is the film for you. If you liked the first film, this is a must see. If you hate exaggerated action sequences, that at times make no sense, then avoid this film at all cost.<br/><br/>It's good action, with the most diversity I've seen in a while on film. Quality acting and casting. More stylized than the first film. Pure eye candy from beginning to end in terms of visuals.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I can't give this film a high rating because it would put it in the same class as Saving Private Ryan or 12 Years A Slave and this film is far from those films in terms of overall quality.<br/><br/>The gun play is a lot more concise than with most films but the viewer has to spend to much time suspending belief. The first sequence is an action junkies wet dream but it makes no sense what-so-ever. A lot of the sequences defy logic and really run counter to the overall plot.<br/><br/>John Wick is supposed to be this high level assassin. The trademark of a professional or even a military trained operative is being prepared. And there are times John gets in trouble and it's his own doing because he really isn't prepared for a heavy assault.<br/><br/>The most annoying theme was him getting hit by on coming cars. I mean, is this a comic book film? Problem for me was two fold: A- A trained operative always is aware of his surroundings. Why can't John Wick avoid getting hit by an on coming vehicle? B- How is he able to get up after getting hit by a car traveling at high speeds?<br/><br/>Just absolutely ridiculous. <br/><br/>It's a film that makes great strides to be elegant, and mature but falls short of that in its action sequences and plot devices.<br/><br/>Again, if you are a fan, you will love this film or even if you are just an action junkie who wants to hang out on your day off and you need a decent film to watch. This is for you.<br/><br/>But if you have a hard time suspending belief or dealing with a film that is filed with glaring continuity issues, avoid this film.<br/><br/>I give it a solid 6 out of 10. Not a bad film at all, just not as great as so many have claimed."

","If you like action movie with ""one man army"" this John Wick sequel is a good choice. I remember how 80-90 action movie such as Die Hard or Rambo became great entertainment in that moment. There's some new element in this movie that quite new for action genre. John Wick happen in a dystopia realm (this thing is not explained in previous movie). But there is some major problem, maybe because in post 2010 one man army action genre being dominated by notorious The Raid series. John Wick is not the only action movie affect of this phenomenon, Dredd is another example. When we watch this movie, willing or not we are going to compare with story,plot, characters or any other thing presented by The Raid astute director, Gareth Evans. Therefore, if you watch this movie as perspective of ready to be entertained by non-stop action, John Wick 2 is a good film. But if you expect to much about great story plot moreover brilliant twist, maybe you will be disappointed."

","To all hardcore action fan out there who deeply in love with the first John Which movie please hear me out:If your guys have very high hope about John Wick: Chapter 2 is going to be a action masterpiece with the same level as The Terminator 2 or any sequels that surpass the original will be disappointed.The movie still have the same formula as the first one,it directed by the same guy with Keanu Reeves back as John Wick a down right badass hit-man who always know how to cheat code head shot everyone but that not the main reason why i love this movie it also about him dealing with the bloody past he left behind and the emotion after his wife dead.In the first movie you can really see the reason why he get back in the game is avenging for a puppy that hold the last connection to his wife but in in the sequel i dare to say the reason he get back is very forcing and dumb.I mean why the hell bother accepting a last job from a stupid debt he makes back in the day to now find himself get caught in a manhunt across the New York city full of professional hit-man?The level of ridiculousness began to rise when i finally see how the world of hit-man works,at first it kinda amazing and intriguing to see all the hit-man services from clothing,weapon preparing...etc to the point that you can basically bump in to a hit-man in the street disguise as a homeless man,a street performer or even ordering a hit-man if you has their currency is some weird gold coin.The action scene is still there you will get bloody shootout plus well choreographed fight scene with Keanu and the cast doing their own stunt but is it done in a horrific way:Two big shoot out scene ruined by took place in a very dark cave that you can't really see anything and a weird glass art gallery that make you head dizzy,fight scene get interrupt by some people,casually shooting in public that seems like no ones care.The movie get dragged a little bit too long with too many boring and throwaway character with a subplot involving a character played by Riccardo Scamarcio that i hardly about.The only thing save the movie for me is some great camera works with neon night lights style,stand out performance by Keanu Reeves,Ian McShane and frankly Laurence Fishburne that delivery many great dialogue and over the top acting that keep me entertain through out the movie.The reason i gave this movie 6 stars instead of 5 because i admire the director for trying to create a story and still have hope for chapter 3:John Wick goes international(please this time have Chow Yun Fat as the main villain)"

","I reckon you saw the first john wick, so you know what to expect this time. I didn't, so I didn't. apparently mr. wick has retired, but unfortunately for him and his dog with no name, he has an iou outstanding, which must be paid back. mr. wick refuses to honor his commitment, and as is usual with these things, there are consequences. and so, mr. wick takes on his assignment. with gusto. I lost count of how many heads were blown off, but it was a lot. the audience applauded at the end. so there. in all honesty, the action sequences are spectacular, the scenery is beautiful and the whole thing looks expensive. Laurence fishburne has a nice cameo as a pigeon fancier. john leguizamo fans will be disappointed. I must give mr. reeves a lot of credit for getting from beginning to end."
